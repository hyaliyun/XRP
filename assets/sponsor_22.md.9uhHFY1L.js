She wrote many books and became acquainted with many of the leading figures in Indian politics and culture, including Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi. Biography The daughter of a village schoolmaster, Marjorie Sykes was born in Mexborough, Yorkshire, England on 11 May 1905. Sykes was nine years old when the First World War broke out, forcing a beloved teacher, who happened to be German, to leave her position. Benefiting from a scholarship, Sykes began college studies in 1923 at Newnham College, Cambridge. There she heard of Mahatma Gandhi from the many Indian students. Sykes came to Madras (now called Chennai) in 1928 to serve as a teacher at the Bentinck School, Vepery, remaining a resident of India for more than 60 years. She contributed enormous effort to advancing new forms of education advocated by Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. In late 1928, a talk by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari inspired Sykes' interest in participating in the independence movement. Late in 1938, she met both Rabindranath Tagore (traveling to his school at Shantiniketan) and Mahatma Gandhi (traveling to his ashram at Sevagram). Beginning in 1939 she joined Santiniketan, working closely with Tagore and becoming acquainted with C.F. Andrews, later in 1944-46 holding the C.F. Andrews Memorial Chair at Santiniketan while working on Andrews' biography. In 1945, Gandhi invited Sykes to join his team working on Nai Talim (New Education), and she later became Principal of Gandhi's Basic Education Programme at Sevagram. In the 1960s Sykes served in efforts to bring peace in Nagaland, as well as living and conducting nonviolence training in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris Hills, and becoming increasingly active among Quakers, at Rasulia (Madhya Pradesh) as well as outside India. After an illness, at age 85 years, Sykes moved in 1991 from India to Swarthmore, a Quaker residential home in Buckinghamshire, England, where she remained until her death on 17 August 1995. Works about Sykes Sykes' life and work has been the focus of books, chapters, and newspaper articles. In 2005, a decade after her death, the centenary of Sykes' birth was observed in a lengthy biographical article published in The Hindu. An earlier article in Gandhi Marg had also described her life. Sykes was also the focus of an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (1116 words) and of a chapter in a doctoral dissertation in History by Sharon M. H.

Composition Inspiration Similar to Bates's first symphony Liquid Interface, Alternative Energy chronicles environmental devastation of the Earth over a large timespan. Bates described the meaning of the work in the score program notes, writing: Structure The symphony has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in four movements: #Ford‚Äôs Farm, 1896 (an amateur fiddler invents a car) #Chicago, 2012 (including the FermiLab particle accelerator) #Xinjiang Province, 2112 (twilight on an industrial wasteland) #Reykjavik, 2222 (an Icelandic Rain Forest) Instrumentation Alternative Energy is scored for electronica and orchestra, comprising three flutes (2nd doubling alto flute, all doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), three clarinets (2nd doubling E-flat clarinet), three bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), four French horns, three trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, three percussionists, harp, piano, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune praised the mature accessibility of the piece, despite noting, \\"While I found the piece enjoyable and entertaining, I do wish Bates would dig deeper harmonically, challenge himself and his audience rather more. Navigating the fine line between accessibility and complexity, he continues to opt too readily for the former, in my view.\\" Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review similarly criticized the work. Despite lauding an \\"engaging, artless audacity\\" to Bates's music, Johnson wrote: Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle was more positive, however, describing the symphony as \\"fantastic\\" and opining, \\"Bates [...] writes music that is simultaneously old- fashioned in its outlook and bracingly new in its demeanor, and it satisfies the same urge for accessible novelty that people find in the other arts.\\" References  External links  Alternative Energy ‚Äì Review (2012) ‚Äì Premiere performance * Alternative Energy ‚Äì Review (2014) ‚Äì San Francisco (notes) * Alternative Energy ‚Äì Review (2017) ‚Äì Aphra Music 3 2011 compositions 21st-century classical music Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Alternative Energy (composition)"},{"id":"47192450","text":"James Franklin Wiley was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate.

The digitization of cultural heritage serves to enable the permanent access to art work ranging from literature to paintings. The main idea is the transformation of a material object into a virtual copy creating positive and negative implications. There has been several debates concerning the efficiency of the process of digitising heritage. Some of the drawbacks refer to the deterioration and technological obsolescence due to the lack of founding for archival materials and underdeveloped policies that would regulate such a process. Another main social debate, has taken place around the restricted accessibility due to the digital divide that exists around the world. Nevertheless, new technologies enable easy, instant and cross boarder access to the digitised work. Virtual heritage A particular branch of digital heritage, known as \\"virtual heritage\\", is formed by the use of information technology with the aim of recreating the experience of existing cultural heritage, as in (approximations of) virtual reality.Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage & New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J.

Digital heritage stewardship means stepping away from typical curatorial practices (e.g. discovering, arranging, and sharing information, material, and/or content) in favor of practices which allow its stakeholders the opportunity to contribute historical, political, and social context and culture. The collaborative practice encourages the creation, engagement, and maintenance of relationships with the relative communities from which certain information, material, and/or content originates. A notable use of digital heritage stewardship is for the preservation of Indigenous heritage. The Plateau Peoples' Web Portal is an online archive developed and collaborated on by representatives from six different tribes ‚Äî the Colville, Coeur d'Alene, Spokane, Umatilla, Yakama, and Warm Springs ‚Äî along with the team for Washington State University Libraries' Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections to curate Plateau peoples' cultural materials.

He was one of the founders of the musical genre later defined as Western swing. Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self-teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s. On March 28, 1928, Hunt and his group, the Texas Ramblers, which included violinist Harmon Clem and an unknown guitarist, recorded in San Antonio for Okeh Records. Of the sides the group laid down, \\"Blues in the Bottle\\" was arguably his most accomplished for its diverse assortment of country blues, ragtime and old-time music. It was later included in Rich Nevins' compilation album, Times Ain‚Äôt Like They Used to Be, Volume 1 along with other contemporaries. In addition to being a recording artist, Hunt regularly performed on local radio stations and venues, usually in blackface, with his neighbors Doc and Oscar Harper. Hunt particularly favored the neighborhood known as Deep Ellum, which was also frequented by other blues musicians, but notorious for its red-light district. On June 26, 1929, Hunt and the Texas Ramblers recorded for the last time, with the session taking place in Dallas. Among the six songs recorded was \\"Wake Up, Jacob\\" which was featured on the renowned compilation created by Harry Everett Smith, Anthology of American Folk Music, in 1952. An unknown composition was cut, but was either never released or no original copies exist. The song, \\"Oklahoma Rag\\" was released as under Prince Albert Hunt and Hermon Clem. The recordings were later seen as a primary influence in Western swing and country music in general. On 31 March 1931 Hunt was shot to death outside Confederate Hall. His assailant, William M. Douglas, reported that he murdered Hunt out of jealousy for dancing with his wife. In 1974, a documentary titled Memories of Prince Albert Hunt was released and was centered on the musician's life.

He established the Dominican Sisters of Bethany in 1867 in order to work with women who were abused or from prisons. Their aim was to spread the merciful love of Jesus Christ to these women. He assumed the name of \\"Jean-Joseph\\" after he entered the Dominican order. Pope Benedict XVI approved a healing determined to be a miracle attributed to his intercession and delegated Cardinal Angelo Amato to preside over the beatification in France. Life Alcide-Vital Lataste was born on 5 September 1832 in Gironde to his father Vital who lived in the French Revolution and his mother Jeanne. He had two siblings: Rosy and Onorato. Lataste commenced his studies for the priesthood but grew fearful of such a life and exited. He met Cecilia de Saint-Germain and the two began to date each other. But at the behest of his father he stopped seeing her. The death of his former girlfriend not long after helped to deepen his vocation to consecrated life in the form of the Order of Preachers. He entered the order at the age of 25 and was ordained to the priesthood on 8 1863. He assumed the new name of \\"Jean-Joseph\\". It was around the time he entered the order that he decided to become a member of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. Following a sermon he delivered in a female prison in Cadillac, Gironde on 14 September 1864 he felt that the Lord called him to establish a religious congregation to cater to the needs of women who left prisons or who were abused. In 1865 he started to formulate ideas in order to begin this mammoth task and he recruited prospective members for this new institution on 14 August 1866. He established the order in 1867. He became aware on 19 March 1866 that the name of Saint Joseph was not included in the mass so he decided to petition Pope Pius IX to do so ‚Äì the latter did this in 1870. Lataste died on 10 March 1869 after singing the Salve Regina. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Besan√ßon and granted him the posthumous title of Servant of God. The first process spanned from 1937 until 1938 and a second was later held. Both were ratified on 3 April 1992. The Positio ‚Äì documentation on his life of heroic virtue was submitted in two parts to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1996 and 1998. Pope Benedict XVI approved that he lived a virtuous life and proclaimed him to be Venerable on 1 June 2007. The miracle required for beatification was investigated for two weeks in 1998 and was ratified on 28 October 2005. Benedict XVI approved it on 27 June 2011 thus allowing for his beatification to be celebrated. Cardinal Angelo Amato beatified him on 3 June 2012 on behalf of the pope.

Verna left her hometown when she was fifteen due to increasing offers of marriage (which she did not want to accept) and returned sometime later when she decided to pursue her religious vocation. Her emphasis was on catechism and founded her religious congregation to better teach catechism to children as well as to tend to ill people. Her beatification process launched after her death in the 1930s and she was titled as a Servant of God while the confirmation of her life of heroic virtue enabled for her to be titled as Venerable on 19 December 2009. Pope Benedict XVI approved a miracle attributed to her intercession which would allow for Verna's beatification; Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone presided over her beatification in 2011 on the pope's behalf. Life Antonia Maria Verna was born in Turin on 12 June 1773 to the poor peasants Guglielmo Verna (1743-24.3.1798) and Domenica Maria Vacheri (b. 1748) as the second of three children (her parents were married on 24 January 1759); her baptism was celebrated mere hours after her birth in the San Giacomo in Rivarolo church. Her siblings were Michele Domenico (b. 12 October 1769; died some months after his birth) and Michele Andrea Verna (b. 30 November 1775). Her paternal uncle was Giovanni Ludovico and her paternal aunts were Domenica Maria and Maria Maddalena. Her maternal grandparents were Michele Vacheri and Francesca Maria Meaglia. Verna cultivated her deep religious calling as a child (which came from her mother who was responsible for her religious upbringing) and intensified her devotion to Saint Joseph whom she elected as her special patron. Verna also had a devotion to the Child Jesus. Her father died in 1798 following a sudden but brief illness. In her adolescence she began to feel a call to religious life and began to teach catechism to the children in her village while attending the Institute of San Giorgio Canavese as a student. It was when she turned fifteen in 1788 that she began to open herself to whatever God would want of her; her parents wanted her to find a husband but she announced her intention to consecrate herself to God (she also made a private vow to remain chaste). But she did have several suitors and to that end left her hometown to leave behind potential marriage prospects. Verna did not return to her hometown until 1789. In 1806 she established a small group that would soon become her new religious congregation. Their aim was to teach and catechize to children as well as care for those who were ill in their own homes. Their first home opened in 1819 and King Charles Felix granted secular approval to the order on 7 March 1828. The local bishop granted his diocesan approval to this institute on 10 June 1828. Verna died on Christmas morning in 1838 at 10:00 am after experiencing a brief illness (spouting from cardiovascular complications) and her remains were interred in the basement below her parish church. In 2005 her order had 928 religious in 111 houses in places such as Lebanon and Switzerland. Beatification The beatification process opened in Ivrea on 6 April 1937 which granted her the title Servant of God (theologians also approved of her writings in a decree issued on 28 May 1941); this local process closed on 20 March 1939 and received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 10 July 1992. The Positio dossier ‚Äì documentation attesting to her reputation for holiness ‚Äì was submitted to the C.C.S. in Rome in 1999. Historians approved the cause on 23 May 2000 as did theologians on 20 February 2009 and the C.C.S. members several months later on 17 November. Pope Benedict XVI ‚Äì in a decree ‚Äì confirmed that Verna had lived a model life of heroic virtue on 19 December 2009 and proclaimed her to be Venerable. The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated in Chur from 24 May to 1 June 1966 and received formal validation from the C.C.S. on 27 May 1994. Medical experts confirmed the miraculous nature of this healing on 4 March 2010 and theologians confirmed it happened as a result of Verna's intercession on 15 July 2010. The C.C.S. ruled the case to be a miracle on 14 December 2010 and would bring it to the pope for final approval. Benedict XVI approved of it on 14 January 2011 and delegated Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone to celebrate her beatification on 2 October 2011 in Turin. The current postulator for this cause is Fra Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Each category consists of five responses, which over time can track the patient's aggressive behavior. The MOAS is one of the most widely used measures for violence and aggression.Harris, S. T., Oakley, C., & Picchioni, M. (2013). Quantifying violence in mental health research. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18(6), 695-701. The scale was originally intended for use by physicians in a clinical setting, but parents may also use it to track aggressive behaviors in their children over time. It is particularly helpful in assessing aggressive behaviors in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBIs).  Development and history  The test was originally designed to measure aggression in psychiatric inpatients, specifically those with autism and other intellectual disabilities.Ratey, J. J., & Gutheil, C. M. (1991). The measurement of aggressive behavior: Reflections on the use of the Overt Aggression Scale and the modified Overt Aggression Scale. The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 3(2), S57-S60. The scale is generally used to track aggression and aggressive acts over time, typically at one week intervals. It has since been used to measure the efficacy of therapy and drug treatments on aggressive behavior in clinical settings.Oliver, P. C., Crawford, M. J., Rao, B., Reece, B., & Tyrer, P. (2007). Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) for People with Intellectual Disability and Aggressive Challenging Behaviour: A Reliability Study. Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 20, 368-372. The test has since been translated into Italian,Margari, F., Matarazzo, R., Casacchia, M., Roncone, R., Dieci, M., Safran, S., . . . Simoni, L. (2005). Italian validation of MOAS and NOSIE: A useful package for psychiatric assessment and monitoring of aggressive behaviours. International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research,,14(2), 109-118. Chinese, and French.DE BENEDICTIS, L. , DUMAIS, A. , STAFFORD, M. , C√îT√â, G. and LESAGE, A. (2012), Factor analysis of the French version of the shorter 12‚Äêitem Perception of Aggression Scale (POAS) and of a new modified version of the Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS). Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 19: 875-880. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2850.2011.01870.x The scores of the scale have reported good reliability and validity across multiple study samples. In a study conducted by Chinese researchers in 2009, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale was found to be both reliable and valid. The results from the study concluded there was high reliability,meaning the scale consistently measures the levels of aggression in each category. The MOAS is also confirmed to be valid, meaning the scale truly measures what it suppose to. In 2009, a study conducted by Ira L. Cohen and her associates studied characteristics, such as aggressiveness, in people with intellectual disabilities (IDs). The MOAS was used and researchers reported it being \\"a reliable and valid measure of aggressiveness in this population.\\"Cohen, I. L., Tsiouris, J. A., Flory, M. J., Kim, S.-Y., Freedland, R., Heaney, G., ‚Ä¶ Ted Brown, W. (2010). A large scale study of the psychometric characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale: Findings and evidence for increased self-destructive behaviors in adult females with autism spectrum disorder. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 40(5), 599‚Äì609. It is also found to be valid for measuring aggression in developing countries, in addition to the developed world, where it was originally validated.Chukwujekwu, D. C., & Stanley, P. C. (2008). The Modified Overt Aggression Scale: How valid in this environment? Nigerian Journal Of Medicine, 17(2), 153-155. Retrieved October 29, 2018.  Limitations  The original version of scale was found to have problems with its scoring methods, leading some psychologists to see it as not reliable.Mattes, J. A. (2010). Suggested Improvements to the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified. The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 22(1), 123-123. Such suggestions led to revisions of the scale. There were a few problems with the study conducted in China to test reliability and validity. The participants were psychiatrists familiar with the scale, so their pre-existing knowledge could have skewed the results. The study was conducted on a small number of people, meaning its results cannot be generalized to the whole population. These factors contributed to a limited and specific sample size that may have altered the results of this study, questioning the accuracy of the reliability and validity. The study conducted about people with IDs had minor limitations. Their standards of autistic traits were based on clinical information, instead of standard measures set by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Based on the large sample size of over 2,000 people though, it is not considered a major complication.

He was detained and interrogated by Hamas, and has been missing since then. His family has stated that he is mentally unstable and had been admitted to a mental hospital in the past. He had been treated with medication, which he stopped taking a few weeks prior to his crossing.  Background  Mengistu was born in Ethiopia, the fourth of ten children in Haili and Agumesh Mengistu's family. He made aliyah (i.e., immigrated to Israel) with his family at age five and grew up in a low income neighborhood in Ashkelon, which is from Gaza. His mother cleaned houses for a living, while his father became chronically unemployed, and his parents divorced in 2012. In a column in The Jerusalem Post, Tal Harris described the Mengistu family as extremely underprivileged and belonging to the poorest socio-economic sector of Israeli society. Mengistu attended public schools. After finishing high school, Mengistu worked in a series of odd jobs, including recycling. In 2011, Mengistu began to experience mental health problems after his older brother Masrashau died. He became withdrawn from his family and friends. He tied a piece of string around one of his fingers so tightly it cut off the blood flow, causing severe gangrene that led to the amputation of the finger. He quit his job and refused to accept benefits from the National Insurance Institute. He also began asking friends for money and traveling alone through various parts of Israel. At one point, his family considered him missing until police located him almost away in Tiberias. He agreed to undergo psychiatric treatment and was hospitalized voluntarily in a mental facility in Beersheba for 12 days in January 2013, but his family did not think he seemed better when he was released. Five days later, they had him committed involuntarily for a week, but after his release, he threw away his medication. According to his brother, his condition worsened. In March 2013, Mengistu was exempted from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces after a medical committee found him unfit for service. According to a childhood friend, in the year before his disappearance, his condition further worsened, and he began to hurt himself and talk illogically.  Incident  On September 7, 2014, Mengistu asked his mother to give him money. When she told him she did not have any, he became angry and left at about noon without saying anything. He then walked to a beach in Zikim and arrived at the security fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip. An Israeli patrol who were guarding electrical work spotted him carrying a bag near the security fence with Gaza and let him pass. One of the soldiers later said he thought Mengistu was a Sudanese refugee who had decided to move to Gaza. A security camera on an army watchtower noticed him trying to climb the fence, and the patrol that had let him pass earlier was notified. By the time they arrived, Mengistu had reached the top of the fence. They called for him to stop and fired a warning shot into the air, but he ignored them and scaled the fence. He left behind the bag, which was found to contain slippers, a towel, a Bible, and a few other books, one of which had his name on it. Since then, he has not been seen by any Israeli. Israel contacted the Red Cross and officials in the Gaza Strip and demanded that Mengistu be returned to Israel. Initially, a Hamas official said Mengistu was interrogated and seemed to have psychological problems. Israeli officials said there is \\"credible intelligence\\" that Hamas holds Mengistu \\"against his will\\". Later, Moussa Abu Marzouk, deputy chairman of Hamas' political bureau, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Mengistu wore a uniform, was mentally healthy, and that his case had came up during truce negotiations related to the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, which took place weeks before the date Israel says Mengistu crossed into Gaza. Gag order In Israel, a blanket gag order regarding the incident was put into place. It lasted 10 months, until July 9, 2015. Discussions took place in social media forums and some reports were published on foreign websites. Some clues about the affair were leaked to different Arabic media outlets, from which the story made its way to international media and was published by blogger Richard Silverstein. The gag order was lifted following a request from Haaretz. The Associated Press speculated that a statement made by Khaled Mashaal the previous day, in which he spoke of an Israeli request through a European intermediary for the release of \\"two soldiers and two bodies\\", may have \\"forced Israel's hand\\". Amir Rapaport of Makor Rishon wrote, \\"The main reason for the low profile in which the incident was dealt with was the fear that public announcement will make it difficult for Hamas to return Mengistu to Israel, since a massive [Palestinian] public pressure will be applied to Hamas to not return him without an extensive deal of prisoners swap\\". Diplomatic efforts  The Mengistu family went to Geneva in 2015 to meet with human rights organizations, including the Red Cross and Amnesty International, in an effort to gain their assistance and to put pressure on Hamas to release Avera. The family provided medical documentation of his hospitalizations and his need for daily medication and therapy, as well as proof he did not serve in the army, carry any weapon, and was in no way involved in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The family returned to Israel with the promise of help. In May 2017, Human Rights Watch issued a report condemning Hamas for holding Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, another Israeli, incommunicado, calling on the group to \\"officially and unconditionally disclose\\" whether it was holding the men and to free them unless \\"a credible legal basis\\" for holding them could be provided. In its report, Human Rights Watch wrote that both men had histories of mental health problems. The report also said that although Hamas' military wing had referred to both men as soldiers, Mengistu had been deemed \\"unfit for [military] service\\" by the IDF and al-Sayed had been discharged three months after he volunteered in 2008 as \\"incompatible for service\\". The report added that photos of the men in military uniforms circulated by Hamas appeared to have been \\"photoshopped\\". When the report was released, Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said \\"Hamas's refusal to confirm its apparent prolonged detention of men with mental health conditions and no connection to the hostilities is cruel and indefensible. No grievance or objective can justify holding people incommunicado and bartering over their fates.\\" Allegations of racist bias Critics say the Mengistu family is being treated poorly because of their Ethiopian ethnicity. Avera's brother, Yalo, has stated that if Avera were white, the affair would have been handled differently. A message sent on Hamas' Twitter account said, \\"Obviously, the real Israeli motto is 'leave no Ashkenazi man behind,'\\" an apparent reference to the military and diplomatic efforts made by Israel on behalf of captured soldier Gilad Shalit and the lack of such efforts on Mengistu's behalf. Hamas demands In 2016, Hamas demanded the release of 60 Palestinian prisoners who were released as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange and subsequently rearrested as the \\"entry fee\\" to start negotiating for the release of Mengistu and for the separation of his negotiation from other issues. An unnamed Israeli official said in July 2016 that Hamas wanted a deal similar to the Shalit exchange, in which hundreds of prisoners would be released in return for the bodies of IDF soldier Oron Shaul and IDF officer Hadar Goldin and the living civilians Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, an Israeli Bedouin held by Hamas. Later developments In June 2017, the IDF gave Mengistu's family a copy of the security camera footage showing him crossing into Gaza. They had been shown the tape several months after his disappearance, but a few years later they requested a copy of their own. When she accepted the tape from representatives from the Defense Ministry and IDF Intelligence Unit, Mengistu's mother said \\"I would have preferred to see footage of my son Avraham Mengistu returning home. My son Avera struggles with mental health disabilities and there is a daily concern for his life. The delivery of the recording does not exempt the state of its responsibility to operate to return my son to his country.\\" Mengistu's father feels that the government is not being transparent with him. On 2 July 2018, he spoke at a conference organized by MK Hilik Bar to focus public attention on Mengistu's situation. \\"I asked them for Avera's bag, which was [found] after the incident,\\" he said. \\"The bag still had clothes; the bag looked bad because they fired upon [Avera], warning shots. There is a 'conspiracy of silence' with Israel's security forces. I ask, why don't they tell us the whole story, everything that happened there. I ask from you, from the public and from the government, to help me.\\"Oren Oppenheimer (July 3, 2018). \\"Avera Mengistu's Father: Son's Disappearance is a 'Conspiracy of Silence'\\".

The prefabricated hut made in Pazardzhik was assembled on Livingston Island during the First Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition by the team of Zlatil Vergilov, Asen Chakarov, Stefan Kaloyanov and Nikolay Mihnevski from 26 to 28 April 1988, with the logistic support of the Soviet Research Ship Mikhail Somov under Captain Feliks Pesyakov. It was renovated and, together with the adjacent Russian Hut, a small storehouse, commissioned as Antarctic base St. Kliment Ohridski (often shortened by non-Bulgarians to Ohridski base) on 11 December 1993. It remained the base's only dwelling facility (with tents used when additional accommodation was necessary) until a new main building was completed in 1998. Occupied during all summer seasons since 1993, the hut has proved most suitable under local conditions.

The Georgian Law on Self Government defines a municipality as a settlement (town or city; ·É•·Éê·Éö·Éê·É•·Éò, k'alak'i) or a unity of settlement (community; ·Éó·Éî·Éõ·Éò, t'emi) with defined boundaries, administrative center, as well as representative and executive bodies of government, and possesses their own assets, budget, and income.  Legal basis  The self-government in Georgia is organized according to the Constitution of Georgia, the European Charter of Local Self-Government (ratified by Georgia in 2004), and the Organic Law of Georgia on Local Self- Government, the latest version of which was adopted in 2014. In the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, it further regulated by the Constitutional Law of Georgia on the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. The Georgian law defines the breakaway entities of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied territories, where the question of self-government should be resolved after the restoration of Georgian sovereignty. The bodies of local self-government have no jurisdiction over the free industrial zones. The Government of Georgia can create, merge, or dissolve municipality as well as change their boundaries with the approval of the Parliament after the prior consultation with or at the request of the respective municipalities.  Symbols  The municipalities have their own symbols such as flag and coat of arms, the designs of which are consulted with and approved by the State Council of Heraldry at the Parliament of Georgia. The official language in all municipalities is Georgian. The municipalities possess the rights of administer their own budgets, assets, natural resources, local taxes, and manage local infrastructure.  Bodies of self-government  The bodies of self-government at the level of municipalities are a representative council, sakrebulo (·É°·Éê·Éô·É†·Éî·Éë·É£·Éö·Éù), directly elected for a four-year term, and an executive branch, headed by a mayor, directly elected for a four-year term.

He was involved in the formation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), despite which he was a victim of political repression in both the GDR and the USSR. Life Stempel was born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). His father was a doctor. He studied law, passing his first level national law exams in 1933. He was unable to progress to the next stage academically by studying for a doctorate in law because he did not wish to become a member of the country's ruling NSDAP (Nazi party). He was nevertheless able to work in a Berlin law firm between 1933 and 1939. During World War II Stempel became the legal counsel to businesses critical to the war effort, and he was not conscripted for military service. At the end of the war, Stempel joined the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPD (Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands)), and in September 1945 he was appointed the party's Organisation Secretary, serving from 1948 to 1950 as the LDPD's general secretary. From May 1945, the central part of Germany became administered as the Soviet occupation zone. For Stempel it was the Liberal Democrats' task \\"to gather together and look after the middle class elements in the Soviet zone of influence.\\"\\"... das buergerliche Elemente innerhalb des sovjetischen Einflussgebietes zu sammeln und aufrecht zu erhalten.\\" In 1949 he was a member of the German People's Council, which had been established the previous year in the Soviet occupation zone. This was redesignated in October 1949 as the Provisional People's Chamber (national legislature) at the same time as the occupation zone itself was redesignated as the German Democratic Republic, a separate Soviet sponsored German state to the west of the Oder-Neisse line and divided politically (and, increasingly, physically) from what had been the post-war occupation zones controlled by the Americans, British and French armies. By this time the contentious merger that in April 1946 created the Socialist Unity Party (SED/Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) had created many of the preconditions for a return to one-party dictatorship. However, whereas the Hitler government had simply banned opposition political parties, the new government in East Germany pursued the same outcomes by creating a power structure that merely controlled them. Opposition parties naturally resisted control by the SED, and it was the resulting tensions that provide the context for the rest of Stempel's political career. An element of the new constitutional arrangements was the \\"single list voting system\\" whereby the ruling SED party drew up list of candidates representing each of the political parties and other groups to be represented in the Provisional People's Chamber (national legislature). Voters would be presented with the list and invited to vote for it or against it, by placing their voting paper in one of two well separated ballot boxes in the polling station, while watched by election officials. The single list voting system would succeed brilliantly. Turn-out was unfailingly high, and in subsequent East German elections prior to 1990 the ruling party's candidate list was never supported by fewer than 99% of those voting. Similarly impressive results were achieved in regional elections. However, Stempel voted against the Election Law which established the system and on 8 August 1950 he was arrested by officers of the newly established Ministry for State Security. He was handed over to the Soviet secret police and deported to Siberia. The Liberal Democratic Party leadership had become increasingly split between those prepared, if grudgingly, to go along with East Germany's constitutional arrangements, and those uncompromising and vociferous in their opposition. Stempel had been prominent among the latter and on 6 September 1950 he was excluded from the party, which some reports at the time were able to present as a result of internal party rivalries. He was succeeded as party General Secretary by Herbert T√§schner who took a less confrontational approach to the new constitutional arrangements. On 7 January 1952 Stempel faced a Soviet military tribunal which sentenced him to 25 years of forced labour, citing his \\"agent and espionage activities\\" (\\"Agenten- u. Spionaget√§tigkeit\\"). In April he was transferred to the infamous Soviet labour camp at Vorkuta. Here he was closely interrogated about his relationship with the Liberal Party leader, Karl Hamann. Hamann had been in government in the German Democratic Republic as a Minister for Trade and Supply: he had been arrested and accused of sabotaging supplies (\\"Sabotage der Versorgung\\"). In December 1953 Stempel was returned from Siberia to the German Democratic Republic on a train that was ironically known as the \\"Grotewohl Express\\" (Otto Grotewohl was the prime minister of the German Democratic Republic at the time). In May 1954 Stempel was required to testify at a show trial against Hamann: it may or may not have been a comment on the quality of his testimony that in August 1954 he was sent back to the Vorkuta labour camp. At some stage he refused to work and was transferred to another Soviet prison- camp. In December 1955 he was one in a group of detainees handed over by the Soviets to the East German authorities at Frankfurt (Oder) which, following border changes mandated ten years earlier, had become a crossing point between the German Democratic Republic and Poland. However, in view of his official status, which was given as \\"non-amnestied war criminal\\", he was not immediately released. Sources comment on the contrast between the \\"war criminal\\" official status accorded him by the Soviet authorities in 1955, and the career damage Stempel sustained from his refusal to join the Nazi Party between 1933 and 1945. On 28 April 1956 Stempel was released from the Bautzen penitentiary. He was able to flee to West Berlin where he obtained clerical work. From West Berlin, in collaboration with West Germany's Justice Minister, Thomas Dehler, he campaigned for the release of Karl Hamann. The campaign succeeded: Hamann was released from prison in October 1956 and permitted to flee to West Germany in May 1957. In consequence of his treatment in the Soviet Union, Stempel never fully recovered physically. He died in Celle on 22 October 1981.

He was also the founder director of the Simlipal National Park, in the Mayurbhanj district in the Indian state of Odisha. Choudhury was known for the pugmark technique he employed for tiger census and for his comradeship with Khairi, a domesticated tigress. His experiences with the animal has been documented in a book, Khairi: The Beloved Tigress, written by him and published in 1977. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1983. Biography Saroj Raj Choudhury, born in Odisha, started his career as a forest officer in Government of Odisha service and rose in ranks to become a wildlife conservation officer, the first person to occupy the post. Later, he was transferred as the head of the Forest Research Institute, founded in 1878 by the German forester, Dietrich Brandis. When Simlipal Tiger Reserve was established in 1972, Choudhury was made its founder field director and the head of Project Tiger with his headquarters in Baripada. 1974 was a landmark year in Choudhury's life when the Kharia tribals brought a female tiger cub found near the Khairi river. He took the cub into his care and converted his quarters at Jashipur in such a way to accommodate the wild animal. The cub, named Khairi after the river he was found from, remained with Choudhury for number of years even after it was full grown. He also reared several other wild animals at his residence such as a crocodile, a bear cub named Jumbu, a blind hyena called Baina and a mongoose, all of them roamed free in his courtyard. Choudhury was credited with several initiatives in the field of wildlife conservation. He was the first to introduce the pugmark methodology for the census of tigers in India, a technique he introduced while heading the first tiger census in India in 1972 which later became a popular method used all over India. Based on his observations of Khairi and by maintaining a daily log of Khairi's movements, he conducted research on the behaviour patterns of tigers, especially on the topic of pheromones, which helped the later day research of R. L. Brahmachary on the subject. He also introduced the use of tranquilizers for capturing wild tuskers. His studies have been documented by way of several papers published in journals and his autobiographical book, Khairi, The Beloved Tigress. Choudhury had close ties with other conservationists such as Salim Ali, who supported the initiative to establish Khairi Wildlife Institute, which did not materialise, allegedly due to disinterestedness shown by the authorities. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1983. Choudhury, did not survive Khairi for long, after the tigress was euthanised by an overdose of tranquilizers when she contracted rabies from a dog bite.

Edie is cheerful about her divorce since she's going to travel overseas to quickly remarry a man that she's been dating, while Pen is upset because her divorce was a result of her husband's philandering. Both women decide to drink at a local bar where they become fast friends, bonding over their unsuccessful marriages, as Edie's husband left her shortly after their marriage two years ago and Pen's husband Victor (Stuart Wilson) spent the last nine years neglecting her. They're unaware that they have a deeper bond between the two of them, as Edie's fiance is actually Victor, Pen's newly divorced husband. At the bar they meet up with Harry (Scott Glenn), a man whose wife recently left him for another man. Much to her chagrin, Harry begins showing an immediate romantic interest in Pen, who is reluctant to return his attentions. She's urged on by Edie, as she feels that Pen would have more fun in life if she were less uptight and more spontaneous. Pen begins to slowly return Harry's feelings based on Edie's advice, only for things to turn sour when she realizes that Edie was Victor's mistress. As a result, Pen breaks things off with Harry, not believing that the relationship would ever work out. Initially intending to angrily confront her over this revelation, Pen is surprised to discover that Edie was completely unaware that Victor was married. Edie goes on to talk about her hopes for the impending marriage as she has been hurt and used repeatedly in the past, making her optimistic that her marriage to Victor will break this chain of unhealthy relationships. This causes Pen to realize that Edie is not completely to blame for her divorce and that she is just as much a victim of Victor's actions as Pen was. Knowing that an angry confrontation is now meaningless and would only negatively hurt Edie, Pen opts to keep silent and quietly leave the following day. However Edie discovers the truth when both women travel to the airport and come across Victor, who immediately recognizes both women. The film ends with Pen returning to Harry to pursue a romance while Edie chooses to travel to Acapulco with Victor, but the two are shown arguing, leaving it up to the viewer to decide if the pair ultimately married or not.

Reno Air assisted the film crew during its airport shoot. At the time, the film was scheduled for release around Christmas 1995. Reception Critical reception for Edie & Pen was mixed. Variety panned the film, writing \\"Director Matthew Irmas (‚ÄúWhen the Party's Over‚Äù) fails to inject the energy to compensate for script‚Äôs lack of incident or depth and, despite exposure of Reno‚Äôs glitzy, neon-lit heart and its dust-bowl, edge-of-town areas, the picture has a rather flat visual stamp on it. Shawn Colvin‚Äôs bluesy, country-flavored songs provide a lift.\\" In contrast, Time Out was more positive, commenting that \\"The direction leaves something to be desired, but Victoria Tennant's script is witty and well structured without seeming mechanical, and cameos from the likes of McKean, D'Angelo, Mull and Travis keep things ticking over nicely. Channing and Glenn work up an easy rapport, and it's another notch in Tilly's promising career.\\" References External links 1996 films American drama films Films set in the Las Vegas Valley American films ","title":"Edie &amp; Pen"},{"id":"47193149","title":"Udaipur City railway station"},{"id":"47193152","text":"Joab Hoisington was a major in the American Revolutionary war who notably led the Hoisington Rangers.

Life Francesco Paleari was born on 22 October 1863 as the last of eight children to Angelo Peleari and Serafina Oldani. As a child he was inclined to favor the poor and he invited them home after mass. He travelled to Turin to follow the example of Giuseppe Benedetto Cottolengo on the advice of his parish priest and commenced his studies for the priesthood. He was tormented with the choice he made so tried to leave for his home but he decided against it so continued his studies. He was ordained as a priest at the age of 23 on 18 September 1886 and received papal dispensation due to his age which was before the required age. The Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Gaetano Alimonda. He - after this - joined an order that Cottolengo established. Paleari focused on work with the children and was known to take all opportunities to preach to them and he also heard confessions wherever possible. He was a noted preacher and people flocked to him to ask him for advice. The Archbishop of Turin assigned him to hearing confessions and preaching retreats. He died in his sleep in 1939. Hundreds of people filed past his coffin during his funeral. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 11 June 1947 in a local process in Turin that granted him the title Servant of God. The process gathered witness testimonies and documentation and concluded all of its work in 1958. The process was granted formal ratification in 1991 so that the cause was able to proceed to the next phase. The Positio - documentation on his life of heroic virtue - was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1991. Pope John Paul II approved his life of heroic virtue and conferred upon him the title of Venerable on 6 April 1998.

He was born in Birmingham and died at Hexham, Northumberland. A club cricketer in Birmingham, Durnell played for Warwickshire as an amateur. A tail-end left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, he could, said Wisden Cricketers' Almanack of him in its obituary in 1987, \\"have made a big difference to Warwickshire between the wars had he been more frequently available\\". Durnell played twice for Warwickshire inside a week in 1921, taking one wicket in each of the matches against Yorkshire and Cambridge University, both of which Warwickshire lost heavily. In the first of these games, batting at No 11, Durnell scored 5 not out and 4, and these turned out to be the best performances of a batting career that began badly and got much worse: in six first-class matches in 1928 he only scored one run. He returned to the Warwickshire side in May 1927 and in the match against Northamptonshire he made an immediate impact. He took the last three wickets in the first innings and then, after catching the Northamptonshire captain off the bowling of Freddie Calthorpe, proceeded to take seven second-innings wickets in just 25 balls, finishing with seven for 29 and match figures of 10 for 89. Wisden wrote that he was \\"almost unplayable\\". Business commitments and then injury meant that Durnell was able to play only two further matches in 1927, and one of those was almost entirely washed out by rain; but his season's tally of 14 wickets for 179 runs put him at the top of the national bowling averages for the year. Durnell had further days of success in the 1928 season, when he was able to play six times. Against Leicestershire, he took six first-innings wickets for 71 runs. His next match was a month later and he took five Derbyshire wickets in the first innings at a cost of 63 runs. But in 1929 when he played twice he was less successful and in 1930 his single appearance was his last in first-class cricket.

It was the last of her novels published in her lifetime. Plot and characters During World War II, a group of children in Loughton, Essex, United Kingdom, which is where Rendell herself grew up, play in tunnels (in reality, the foundations of an uncompleted house) they discovered under a hill. In the present day they are reunited after the discovery of two hands in a tin box when the tunnels are dug up for construction work. The novel deals frankly with changes and interrelationships of the characters and social changes generally, over seven decades. Critical reception In a review in The Observer, it was noted that instead of focusing on the crime, the novel dealt with the lives of the now elderly people in the present.

Minimum wage for 16-17 is currently ¬£4.55. It was implemented at a significantly higher rate than the preceding national minimum wage rate, and was expected (in 2015) to rise to at least ¬£9 per hour by 2020. The consultation document issued by the Low Pay Commission in 2019 indicated that this target would not be met, instead proposing a figure of ¬£8.67 per hour for the over 25 rate. History The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced what he termed the \\"National Living Wage\\" at the end of his budget speech on 8 July 2015, a new national minimum wage rate only for people over the age of 25. The National Living Wage is implemented via an amendment to National Minimum Wage Act 1998. The National Living Wage was phased in between April 2016 and April 2020, with the aim of reaching 60% of median UK earnings by 2020. For over-25 year old employees, the wage began at ¬£7.20 per hour in April 2016 and was projected to rise to at least ¬£9 per hour by April 2020. Smaller employers have had their employer National Insurance discounts increased to mitigate the higher costs of the National Living Wage. In September 2015 the proposed penalties for employer non-compliance were announced. They are double those previously payable for non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (increased from 100% of arrears owed to 200%), although this is halved if paid within 14 days. The maximum penalty remains at ¬£20,000 per worker. An additional penalty of disqualification from being a company director for up to 15 years will also be available to the courts. The enforcement budget is due to double, and the creation of a dedicated HM Revenue and Customs non-compliance team to pursue criminal prosecutions was announced. HM Treasury initially projected that 2.7 million workers would benefit directly. Research published by the Resolution Foundation in March 2016 indicated that the introduction of the measure would immediately raise the incomes of those on minimum wage by 10.8%. The number of workers affected is expected to be about 4.5 million, forming between 3% and 30% of the workforce in a given area depending on the location. The total of workers affected is expected to rise to 6 million in 2020 if a ¬£9-an-hour minimum is established by then.  Reaction  A survey conducted in November 2015 by the Resolution Foundation and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development revealed that the policy is expected to have its greatest impact in the retail, hospitality and healthcare sectors. The policy has received criticism from some large employers, particularly supermarkets and the food and drink sector, where profits may be reduced by up to 10%. Some large employers have said that they may pass on the additional cost to consumers in the form of higher prices and some intend to improve productivity. The supermarket chain Lidl has said it will implement a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù without increasing any of its prices. A report by Moody's Investors Service stated supermarkets may employ a higher proportion of under-25 year olds to reduce employee costs. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the policy will result in 60,000 fewer jobs, equivalent to a 0.2% increase in the unemployment rate. The announcement of the National Living Wage was seen as a political coup for the Conservative government because the opposition Labour Party had proposed that the national minimum wage rise only to ¬£8 per hour. Opponents have objected to the government's use of the term \\"living wage\\" on the grounds that the National Living Wage is calculated from median UK earnings rather than the cost of living. Although the policy is called a \\"living wage\\", it does not meet with internationally agreed definitions of a living wage. An independently-calculated living wage for the UK, sometimes called a \\"real living wage\\" to distinguish it from the National Living Wage, is published annually by the Living Wage Foundation.

Johnson. The law requires that \\"All executive departments and agencies shall administer their programs and activities relating to housing and urban development (including any Federal agency having regulatory or supervisory authority over financial institutions) in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes of\\" the Fair Housing Act. The law also requires the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer all HUD programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing. Since the Fair Housing Act has a dual purpose - both the elimination of all forms of housing discrimination and residentially segregated communities, affirmatively furthering fair housing is essentially fulfilling the dual purpose of the law. There is a significant link between appropriate housing, community involvement and health. According to the World Health Organization‚Äôs 2018 Housing and Health Guidelines, improved housing conditions can save lives, prevent disease, increase quality of life, reduce poverty, and help mitigate climate change.  2015 changes  Under the Obama Administration, in July 2015 HUD promulgated the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule pursuant to the Fair Housing Act. It requires cities and towns which receive Federal money for any housing or urban development related purpose to examine whether there are any barriers to fair housing, housing patterns or practices that promote bias based on any protected class under the Fair Housing Act, and to create a plan for rectifying fair housing barriers. The intention is to promote equal housing opportunities and level the playing field so that all neighborhoods provide the quality services and amenities that are important for people to live successful lives. Civil rights groups hailed the rule citing decades-long patterns of government-sponsored segregation and discriminatory practices, while conservatives decried it as \\"social engineering.\\" The 2015 rules required cities and towns, in order to receive funding from HUD to document patterns of racial bias in their neighborhoods, to publicly report the results every three to five years, and to set and track goals to reduce segregation. Under the new rules, any jurisdiction that receives money from HUD must analyze its housing occupancy by race, disability, familial status, economic status, English proficiency, and other categories. It must then analyze factors which contribute to any prohibitive barriers in housing and formulate a plan to remedy the impediments. The plan can be approved or disapproved by HUD. This is done at both the local and regional level. For example, a major city, such as Chicago, will have to analyze any racial disparities within Chicago, and Chicago suburbs will analyze their own racial disparities. In addition, Chicago and the suburbs will have to analyze any disparities as compared with each other. Thereafter, the community has to track progress (or lack thereof). The planning cycle will be repeated every five years. If the Federal Government is not satisfied with a community's efforts to reduce disparities, federal funds could be withheld. 2020 changes In a tweet posted on July 23, 2020, President Trump said \\"I am happy to inform all of the people living in their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood. Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. ENJOY!\\" In a second tweet addressed to ‚ÄúThe Suburban Housewives of America,‚Äù Trump continued, ‚ÄúBiden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better!‚Äù In a press release made the previous week HUD Secretary Ben Carson said that implementation of the Obama legislation had proven ‚Äúto be complicated, costly, and ineffective‚Äù saying: > \\"After reviewing thousands of comments on the proposed changes to the > Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation, we found it to be > unworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with, too > often resulting in funds being steered away from communities that need them > most‚Ä¶ Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local > community‚Äôs unique needs. The administration is replacing the AFFH with the Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice rule, which Carson said will offer state and local government the benefit of the doubt to maintain fair housing practices. ‚ÄúThis brand-new rule‚Ä¶defines fair housing broadly to mean housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible under civil rights laws. It then defines ‚Äòaffirmatively furthering fair housing‚Äô to mean any action rationally related to promoting any of the above attributes of fair housing,‚Äù the HUD secretary‚Äôs statement read. Commentary In a statement Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said, \\"The Trump Administration‚Äôs elimination of the fair housing rule is a betrayal of our nation‚Äôs founding values of equality and opportunity for all. It is a shameful abdication of our government‚Äôs responsibility to end discriminatory housing practices and to lift up our nation‚Äôs most vulnerable communities.\\" Eugene Robinson commented that Trump's tweet \\"may be the most nakedly racist appeal to White voters that I‚Äôve seen since the days of segregationist state leaders such as Alabama‚Äôs George Wallace and Georgia‚Äôs Lester Maddox.\\" Noting that the Trump family had been sued by the Justice Department in 1973 for refusing to rent apartments to African Americans, Robinson said, \\"Trump‚Äôs tweet is a promise not to actively enforce [the Obama Administration's] provision. And it‚Äôs a message to White people they can go ahead and do whatever they feel is necessary to keep Black people and Latinos from moving into their neighborhoods.\\" Discussing the Trump decision to end the Fair Housing Rule, NPR writes that the likely reason for his move was that suburban voters, and particularly white suburban women voters, are valuable swing voters seen as necessary for Trump to win the 2020 election. NPR quotes Lynn Vavreck, a professor of politics and public policy at UCLA, who explains the rhetoric of his policy decision: \\"[Trump suggests] a suburb is the kind of community where great Americans live because we've limited it. I think it's just straight-up racializing this idea of housing. This is the kind of argument that Trump makes all the time: 'I'm going to tell you that these people are good, or us versus them. We, the good people, and they, the bad people. And we have to keep them out to keep our greatness.'\\" Housing and racial segregation It is widely recognized that the division between urban and suburban America is closely tied to the country‚Äôs history of racial segregation. Even long after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, numerous studies and reports have revealed a long line of policies that have kept Black people out of white suburbs, as well as other forms of housing discrimination. The connection between Trump‚Äôs aspersion on low-income housing in the suburbs and racial segregation has been noted by critics. Adrianne Todman, CEO of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, said Trump‚Äôs remarks were a deep insult to those who live in, work in and build low-income housing. She stressed that those who live in low- income housing offer valuable contributions to all communities. ‚ÄúIf you are a person of modest means, know that your value is not derived by how much money you make, but by who you are.\\"  References   External links  * Presidency of Barack Obama Executive orders of Barack Obama ","title":"Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing"},{"id":"47193942","text":"Kernel patch may refer to: * Kernel Patch Protection (KPP), a feature of 64-bit (x64) editions of Microsoft Windows that prevents patching the kernel, informally known as PatchGuard * kpatch, a feature of the Linux kernel that implements live patching of a running kernel * Ksplice, an extension of the Linux kernel that allows security patches to be applied to a running kernel * XNU kernel patch, a series of initial patches necessary to run the OSx86 kernel on non-Apple hardware * TRESOR, a Linux kernel patch which provides CPU-only based encryption to defend against cold boot attacks ","title":"Kernel patch"},{"id":"47193945","text":"Rancho Veloz is a Cuban village and consejo popular (\\"people's council\\", i.e. hamlet) of the municipality of Corralillo, in Villa Clara Province.

Those looking for wood went to the area now known as Rancho Veloz, which at the time (around 1835) was named \\"realengo Las Ca√±as\\". According to the Cuban government's official Cuban history, this \\"realengo\\" was divided into three areas, one of which became known as \\"Santa Fe de las Pozas\\", and there, a person by the last name of Veloz built a ranch (rancho). Santa Fe de Las Pozas was the area's political and economical center by 1843. Sugar became the town's main economic source and as many as 12 sugar refineries were active during the 1840s and 1850s. Slavery was also an economic source and by 1862, according to official figures, there were 3,721 slaves, compared to 1,297 white slave owners and 221 free Black or Mestizo persons, which meant that about 66% percent of the town's population was made up by slaves. It is not known when slavery was eradicated from the town, but official records show that the last people to be claimed as slaves were in the area around 1879. In 1869, a fort was built to protect Rancho Veloz from attackers. On January 1, 1879, Rancho Veloz had, for the first time, a mayor. His name was Jos√© Su√°rez Sol√≠s. The first schools on record to open at Rancho Veloz were opened in 1888. These two educational centers consisted of an all girls school and an all boys one, which were situated in front of each other. During 1889, the town's cathedral was inaugurated. San Jos√© Parish on diocesisdesantaclara.com In 1936, the local fort was re-built due to corrosion affecting the original structure. During 1937, Father Pertika Unanue, a Spaniard who would become popular among church goers in Rancho Veloz, arrived to the cathedral. He was pivotal in the creation of several programs and buildings in the town, including a local stadium. Father Unanue became a Cuban citizen, later dying in 1991. Father Unanue on diocesisdesantaclara.com 1949 saw the opening of a Masonic temple. The town has remained virtually unchanged since then.

It was used by Shaker doctors for medical treatment in the early nineteenth century. The machine consisted of a rotating glass jar that produced an electrical charge by means of a crank wheel that was turned by hand. This charge was stored in a glass container that was released later to a patient for a cure. Corbett's machine is in the collection of the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village in the state of New York USA.  Description  Close-up of metal rake + glass tumbler. Leyden jar storage battery is to the right. The electrostatic machine was made by a Shaker pharmacist named Thomas Corbett in 1810 for medical treatment. Corbett was medical physician for the Shakers, a religious group of colonial America. He was a botanist and used herbal medicines and unorthodox medical \\"cures\\" for his patients, including electricity. Corbett's electrostatic machine consists of a wooden base platform sitting on a frame, forming a box. The wooden platform is about wide and about deep. To one side of the wooden platform is mounted a small axle on pivots, which holds a rotating glass jar cylinder about the size of a Mason jar. This glass jar is attached to a crank wheel of about with a leather belt. The crank wheel can be turned by hand. The wooden platform also contains a Leyden jar-style battery in one corner, standing some high. The battery is a glass receptacle with a metal rod in the center, covered by a metal ball on top which collects and releases a high voltage electrical charge.  Operation  The crank wheel is turned by an operator using the knob handle and then the glass cylinder would rotate by an attached belt. The glass jar then rubs against a layered silk cloth pad or a textile cloth pad, developing a high-voltage positive electrical charge. This static electricity charge is then taken off the glass cylinder through a small metal rake and transferred by wire to the Leyden jar storage battery for later use (see close-up illustration). The high voltage stored electrostatic charge kept in the Leyden jar was then on the metal ball on top of the glass storage battery. It would produce a spark visible to the eye when the set of small metal globes attached to the battery were brought close enough to each other as a test experiment in a discharge. The electrical principles of Corbett's electrostatic machine were later used by Edison.  Treatment technique  The high voltage static charge on top of the Leyden jar storage battery was applied to a patient as he or she sat on a chair or stool atop a special platform. The four glass legs of the chair insulated the platform from the ground. The operator channeled the stored charge from the Leyden jar to the patient using metal attachments that were connected to the patient. The electrical charge produced a shock that was described to have been similar to \\"touching a doorknob after walking across carpet in dry weather\\". The electrical treatment from Corbett's electrostatic machine supposedly \\"cured\\" the sufferer of a variety of illnesses, or at least had some electrotherapeutic value. It was especially designed to treat rheumatism. More likely, however, the electrical shock temporarily diverted the sufferer's mind from his or her aches and pains. Shaker Elizabeth Lovegrove recorded in a journal in 1837 that an elder sister of the Shakers was being treated by the Corbett machine. She reported that the Nun felt better after each treatment, at least temporarily.

The trapezoidal park, flanked by the lanes of United States Route 1 approaching the Memorial Bridge across the Piscataqua River, was established in 1926 and named for American Revolutionary War naval hero John Paul Jones. Its centerpiece is a memorial commemorating the soldiers and sailors of the state of Maine, designed by Bashka Paeff. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history John Paul Jones Memorial Park is located between Hunter and Newmarch Streets in southern Kittery, just north of the Piscataqua River. The two roadways carry one-way traffic in opposite directions, to and from the Memorial Bridge to Badger's Island and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The park is roughly , in size, and trapezoidal in shape. It is mostly a flat grassy area, with trees fringing the border and a few specimen trees dotting the park. The southern end of the park is dominated by the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial sculpture of Bashka Paeff, a gold bronze relief sculpture set in a granite frame mounted on a stone plaza. The park is home to three other memorial, all placed in the park after its establishment. The Sloop Ranger monument, originally placed on Badger's Island in 1905, was moved to the park in 1963; it is a bronze tablet mounted in granite, commemorating USS Ranger, Jones' first command. The Province of Maine Monument is a bronze tablet mounted in a circular granite pedestal, placed in 1931; it memorializes the chartering of the English Province of Maine to Sir Ferdinando Gorges in 1635. The third memorial is to the United States Marine Corps, and was placed in 1984. The park's construction is intimately bound to the construction of the original Memorial Bridge, which is a war memorial to the military of both Maine and New Hampshire who served in World War I. The bridge was completed in 1923, and Governor Percival Baxter held a design competition for a suitable memorial. Paeff's initial design was acceptable to Baxter, but not his successor, Ralph Owen Brewster, and the memorial was consequently not placed until 1926, after Paeff made alterations to its design. The park was officially named for John Paul Jones by an act of the state legislature in 1927, somewhat obscuring the intent that it be a memorial to World War I soldiers.

He threatens them to get him a specific amount of money at any cost or else he would tell the police. The group becomes stressed, not knowing how to get the money. Ricky considers telling the authorities, but his family is forced to move back to Russia. Feeling pressured, Carla considers overdosing on pills. Alex discovers a way to steal a half a million dollars. They all team up, once again, to steal money using fake IDs and add all the money to the school account online. Once they obtain all the money needed, they meet their teacher and give it to him in exchange for their freedom. Cameron, still enraged by everything their teacher put them through, confronts him, forcing Faustin to pull out a gun to kill Carla and Cameron. Jack is also shot, but is still alive. Laura threatens Alex to never speak of the incident again and to move far away. Meanwhile, she and the principal go on the school account to discover that all the money the kids had stolen is gone. Alex then receives a message on her phone that all the money has been deposited into her own account. A video message sent to the principal reveals that Brittany faked her death, and that Jack lied to and used her while he was still with Carla. Carla, later, made the whole school turn against Brittany, which caused Brittany to want to commit suicide. Also, Cameron and Ricky wanted to take advantage of her. The video ends with her saying that these haters will pay for everything they did to her. It becomes clear that there is much more to this story than meets the eye. After putting pieces together from Alex's story, Laura learns that Alex is actually Brittany. The attorney also learns that she stole the money and shot her classmates herself. Meanwhile, Jack dies from his severe wounds at the hospital. Brittany is seen taking out brown eye contacts revealing her natural blue eyes while leaving in a car, revealing that she faked her identity as Alex to avenge herself. The movie ends with Laura running and yelling after her.

Early life Crockwell (often referred to as Carlisle) was born in Bermuda in 1932, a great-grandson of the first Crockwell to settle in the British Overseas Territory, Barbados-born seaman and steam-engineer Robert Nathaniel Crockwell (also known as Robert Hughes). All of Bermuda's Crockwells descend from the children of his paternal grandparents, Bermudian-born mariner Robert Randolph Clark Crockwell and his wife, born Angelina Eleanor Wilmot, who raised their family in Pembroke East, near to North Village, Devonshire and in the shadow of Prospect Camp. Military career His grandmother's father, David Wilmot, had been posted to the Bermuda Garrison as a Private soldier in what was to become the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Crockwell, like many of his relatives, emulated his military forebear by serving part-time in the army. His great-uncle, Adrian Wilmot (one of Bermuda's noted singers), had served on the Western Front during the First World War as a Gunner in the Bermuda Contingent of the Royal Garrison Artillery (a draft from the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA)). Carlyle Crockwell's father, also named Robert Nathaniel Crockwell, served in the BMA also from 1938 through the Second World War (as a Gunner, carrying out the duties of an NCO for the last two-and-a-half years of his service), as did Carlyle Crockwell himself and his brother Jerome A. Crockwell (a Lance- Corporal) throughout the 1950s. Crockwell enlisted in 1951 with the rank of Gunner, and was promoted to Sergeant in January, 1958, receiving his discharge in 1964 (the year before the Bermuda Militia Artillery amalgamated with the Bermuda Rifles to form the Bermuda Regiment (since 2015, the Royal Bermuda Regiment). He continued to be involved with military affairs even after his discharge. By 1962 he was the Secretary, and by 1972 the Chairman, of the Ex- Artillerymens' Association (this organisation had been formed between the two world wars by former soldiers who - at a time when motor vehicles were banned from Bermuda's roads - had difficulty commuting to St. George's Barracks, the location of the Bermuda Branch of the Royal Artillery Association). By 1994 he was the Charirman, and by 1996 the President, of the Bermudian Branch of the Royal Artillery Association. Crockwell remained in Government service, working as an officer of Her Majesty's Prison Service, Bermuda (which was renamed the Department of Corrections in 2002). In 1977, when he was a Divisional Officer, he was appointed a Member of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours Sporting career Carlyle Crockwell brought his military discipline to football, becoming a long-serving member of the Bermuda Referees Association. He refereed Bermuda Football Association matches in Bermuda, as well as World Cup qualifiers for FIFA, the Pan American Games, and matches sanctioned by CONCACAF. The first international match he refereed as a FIFA official was a World Cup preliminary between Canada and the United States that took place in Newfoundland (two other Bermudian referees, Dave Parsons and Charles Marshall, were also present). Crockwell was appointed an Honorary Vice-President of the Bermuda Football Association, and in 2001 an Honorary Life Vice-President. Many of Carlyle Crockwell's relatives have also been active in football and other sports in Bermuda. His cousin, Custerfield Desmond Crockwell (a Police Inspector of the Bermuda Police Service), was a noted local boxer and cricket player. His son, Carlyle Crockwell Jr., was a goalkeeper for Pembroke Hamilton Club (PHC), and other sporting relatives include footballers Denzel Crockwell, of Ireland Rangers FC,Bermuda Football Association: Denzel Crockwell, and Mikkail Kristopher Crockwell of Dandy Town Hornets, and cricketer Fiqre Crockwell.

Plot Three women face challenges in their process of getting married, which are very relatable to Indian society. Rajkumar (Dinesh), who is in love with his colleague Kavya (Nivetha Pethuraj), is reluctant to marry her, owing to her superior economic background, so much so that he delays talks of marriage. This causes a strain in their relationship, and they ultimately break up with Kavya agreeing to marry a guy of her father's choice. Lakshmi (Miya) is visited by several suitors, and every one of them is rejected by her father (Nagineedu), whose greediness makes him wait every time for a suitor who is per the family's status. One guy, Mukundan (Abhinav), likes her, but his family rejects her due to her family's low status. In spite of that, Mukundan convinces Lakshmi to come to his place to get married. She does so, but in the bus stand, Mukundan's family spots both of them and drags Mukundan back home, not before insulting Lakshmi. With a heavy heart, she boards a bus to return to her place. Susheela's (Riythvika) family has been trying to get her married for the past few years, but none of them seems interested in her citing looks, job, and so on. This makes her quite an introvert, and the only person who understands her is her colleague Sathish (Ramesh Thilak). Bhaskar (Lingesh) agrees to marry Susheela but gets cold feet and ends up canceling the marriage, insulting Susheela every time she demands an explanation. Finally, Susheela's brother Raghavendran (Karunakaran) convinces Bhaskar to agree to marry Susheela, but she rejected the marriage because she is now in love with Sathish. Kavya's wedding is fixed with the guy, but on the day before her marriage, Raj, who travels along with Shoulder (Bala Saravanan) in a car to the venue, avoids crashing into Lakshmi (who is on her return journey to her place and alights the bus to have coffee) and diverts the car because of which another relative of Kavya's fiancee (who travels in the same road in another car) to ram on the road and die instantly. Due to this, Kavya is labeled as bad luck, and her marriage is called off. Raj arrives on time at the venue, but before that, her parents ask to call Raj but she refuses saying that she wished to marry Raj with the intention of love ad she doesn't want to marry him as an option. So Kavya chooses Sathish (one of her relatives) as her partner and marries to him. In the end, we see Raj getting engaged to Lakshmi after a year.

Produced by Udhayanidhi Stalin, the film features himself in the lead role along with Amy Jackson, Sathyaraj in a supporting role, and Vikranth as the main antagonist. Featuring music composed by Harris Jayaraj and cinematography by Sukumar, the film was released on 14 January 2016. It received mixed reviews. Critics praised the cinematography and music of the film but heavily criticized the screenplay and the misleading title of the film. Plot The film opens with a renegade sniper named Craig, (Vikranth) who assassinates an army officer from a long distance and is given a new assignment by a traitor (Avinash) to finish off an ISRO scientist named Abdul Kamaal (Sharad Haksar) within 30 days. The story then shifts to Kambam, where a PT teacher named Thulasi Raman (Sathyaraj) leads a peaceful life with his son Sethu (Udhayanidhi Stalin), wife (Pragathi), and daughter. Sethu, who works as a librarian to retired Colonel Matthews (Rajesh), meets a kleptomaniac named Nandhini (Amy Jackson), who steals books from the library. After a few altercations, the two fall in love. Craig, for some unknown reasons, lands in the hill town and is seen wandering and taking photographs of Matthews. Meanwhile, Thulasi Raman complaints about a political based bar owner named Kandhan (Mime Gopi), and in an ensuing fight, Sethu comes to his rescue by bashing up the goons. Mysteriously, the corpse of Kandhan is pulled out of a waterfall, and a ring belonging to Thulasi Raman is found in his hands. The police then arrests Thulasi Raman. Sethu takes it upon himself to clear his father's name and set out to find the real killer.

Gethu was revealed to be the title in September 2014, with Harris Jayaraj and Sukumar signed on as music composer and cinematographer respectively. Actor Vikranth, previously only seen in leading roles, signed on to appear in the film as an antagonist. Sathyaraj was chosen to play the father of Udhayanidhi's character and was given top billing in the credits. The film was revealed to be half complete by April 2015, and a first look poster was released to the public. The team began a second schedule in Kodaikanal later that month. Gethu also marks the first major appearance of Udhayanidhi in a non-comedy film. He stated that he chose to work on the film due to having grown bored of working in comedy films, and his desire to \\"experiment, try something different\\". Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sun TV.The film was released on 14 January 2016, coinciding with Pongal, and received mixed critical response. M Suganth of The Times of India rated it 2.5 out of 5, commenting, \\"Thirukumaran has the essentials for a high-concept thriller ‚Äî a determined hitman, an ordinary man who stumbles into a nefarious plot by accident, a sub-plot that provides some mystery, and a bit of family drama. It is in his execution that he falters. For a thriller clocking in at under two hours, Gethu moves at a pace that is as sleepy as the hill station where the action happens. The director's choice of slow motion shots as a device to make the action stylish and prolong the tension in the plot works against the film.\\" Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu stated, \\"The whole movie bears the flavour of a short-story adaptation, and at a little over two hours, there isn‚Äôt too much duration in which to flood the story with masala elements and thoroughly destroy it, although, to its discredit, Gethu certainly does try.\\" The entertainment tax exemption request for the film was denied on the basis that the filmmakers misspelled the English title as \\"Gethu\\" instead of \\"Kethu\\", the latter being the correct transliteration of a Tamil word. Government officials argued that since films released using Tamil words are entitled to an entertainment tax, and that \\"Gethu\\" is not a Tamil word, the film would not be entitled to an exemption. The matter was heard by the Madras State Court, which ruled that the film was entitled to the entertainment tax exemption. Music The film's soundtrack album and background score was composed by Harris Jayaraj. The soundtrack album consists of five tracks and Harris is collaborating with Udhayanidhi Stalin for the fourth time in this project. The music rights were purchased by Divo.

Organizaci√≥n Obreira had two official magazines: O Noso Ma√±√°n (Our Tomorrow, directed to seaman) and Organizaci√≥n Obreira. The group was very influential in the area of Vigo, specially in the local Workers' Commissions. Organization Organizaci√≥n Obreira was led by an Executive Committee of 10 members. Xos√© Anxo Garc√≠a M√©ndez was the secretary general of the organization and there were three area committees in the area of Vigo, where the organization was quite strong. The committees were known as CZ1 (divided in four cells), CZ2 (3 cells) and CZ3 (2 cells). The organization had around 100 \\"core\\" militants, with cells in all the cities of Galiza. The organization had a Military Front, a structure with a defensive character, led by Abelardo Collazo and Hierro Chom√≥n. History Organizaci√≥n Obreira emerged in April 1972 from a split of the PCE in Vigo, composed of around 50 workers that were members of CCOO and the Communist Youth, dissatisfied with the Pact for Freedom signed by the party the same year, that called for the unity of all leftists, regardless of their class, to defeat Francisco Franco and the Spanish State. Organizaci√≥n Obreira achieved protagonism during the Vigo general strike of 1972, that shut down the city for one whole month, growing in popularity and membership. Despite this, the party lost influence due to the repression of the regime. In late 1973 Organizaci√≥n Obreira lived an internal conflict between the supporters of joining the Organisation of Marxist‚ÄìLeninists of Spain (OMLE) and those who wanted to join the Galician People's Union (UPG). Finally, in 1974, Organizaci√≥n Obreira disappeared as one sector joined the OMLE, which was the origin of the Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted) (PCE(r)) and the GRAPO, and another part joined the UPG.

During its lifespan, it was developed into the Commer PB in 1967, and the Commer SpaceVan in 1974. After the Rootes Group, which owned Commer, was purchased by Chrysler, the SpaceVan was also sold under the Dodge and Fargo marques. From 1976 onwards, the van was only sold as the Dodge SpaceVan, and it remained in production until 1983.  History  Commer became known in later years as a maker of vans for the British Post Office‚Äîparticularly the Commer FC which was introduced in 1960 with many body styles, including a van. After engine and interior upgrades it was renamed the PB in 1967 and the SpaceVan in 1974. Following the merger of Rootes Group with Chrysler to form Chrysler Europe, the SpaceVan was sold as a Dodge and Fargo model until 1976, when both Commer and Fargo names were dropped. These were rounded-front forward-control vans with narrow front track‚Äîa legacy of their Humber car- derived suspension. Utilising at first the Hillman-derived 4-cylinder engine in the PA series, then the larger , and from 1968 onwards the unit in the PB, only the cast-iron-head version of this engine were used. A Perkins 4108 diesel was also available. The \\"1725 cc engine\\" (as it is known; it actually displaces ) was available in the 1970s with a Borg Warner (BW) Model 35 3-speed automatic transmission with a dashboard-mounted selector. This was not a popular option and few were built. The 4-speed gearbox on manual transmission models was based on those fitted to contemporary Hillman Minx (of the \\"Audax\\" generation) and later Rootes Arrow series cars such as the Hillman Hunter. An unusual feature of the model was that the handbrake operated on the front drum brakes. One of the reasons that the van was less popular with fleet operators than the Bedford and Ford Transit models it sold against was that, as on the BMC J2 and J4 models the forward-control design restricted access to the engine and made engine changes labour-intensive; the only way to remove the engine without dropping the suspension subframe was to remove the windscreen and crane the engine out through the passenger door. A 1974 road test of a motor caravan version fitted with the 1725cc engine reported a maximum speed of and a 0‚Äì50 mph (80 km/h) time of 25 seconds, indicating a higher top speed but, in this form, slower acceleration than the BMC competitor. However, the testers reported that at the van was \\"plainly at its absolute limit, screaming away in a most distressing fashion\\"; readers were advised to view as a more realistic absolute maximum. Dodge SpaceVan TV detector van on display at Science Museum, London. Reportedly, one condition of the government bailout of Chrysler's British operations in 1976 was a commitment to upgrade the Spacevan, which was praised for its brakes, cornering, and price, but criticized for its power, comforts, and top speed. A revised Spacevan was thus introduced in 1977, using the same mechanicals but with numerous cosmetic changes, conveniences, and a new interior. Although outdated by its demise in 1982, by which time Commer had been taken over by Peugeot, the Spacevan remained a familiar sight in the UK thanks to its role with Post Office Telephones‚Äîwhich was almost solely responsible for it remaining in production for so long and these vans and outstanding orders were inherited by British Telecom on its formation in October 1981. By this time, there were three engines: two 1.7 L petrol engines of 37 kW (with low compression) and 42 kW (with high compression), and a small diesel engine (31 kW), with a four-speed manual transmission and no automatic available. The last Spacevan was built in 1983.  New Zealand production  This van was produced in New Zealand by Todd Motors at their Petone Factory. It was last produced in 1974 in their secondary body factory on the other side to the railway tracks from the main car assembly plant. They produced a standard panel van, a mini bus body with sliding side windows, and cab and chassis models. The seats for the mini bus were produced by other coach builders. They used the high compression steel head motors; not the alloy head Hillman Hunter units. Generally, one unit was produced in the morning and another unit in the afternoon; i.e. 10 units per week, a third unit could be produced each day when sales were higher.

The NSFC is the most important institution in China for the funding of basic research in the natural sciences, life sciences, engineering sciences and management sciences. The DFG is the central self-governing research funding organisation in Germany. It serves all branches of science and the humanities by funding research projects at universities and other public research institutions. Both organisations aim to deepen and expand mutual scientific relations. The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1988. The SGC is tasked with promoting scientific cooperation between Germany and China with a focus on the natural sciences, life sciences, engineering sciences and management sciences. Its budget (in 2016: RMB 45.2 million or approximately 6,1 million euros) is used to support a range of funding programmes tailored to this purpose. In addition, the Center serves as an information platform, works to improve the infrastructure framework for scientific cooperation between Germany and China, facilitates the exchange of information about the research system in each country, and provides bilateral early career support. In this way it makes an important contribution to long-term cooperation between universities, research institutions and researchers in both countries. History The initiative of the NSFC and the DFG to found a jointly run center originated with a Chinese proposal in 1994. The idea was to create an institution to intensify scientific exchange between Germany and China. The decision to establish such a project was formalised in 1995, when the founding agreement for the SGC was signed in the presence of Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Chinese Premier Li Peng. In 1998 the agreement was signed by the DFG and NSFC, allowing the SGC to become reality. The foundation stone was laid in the same year. On 19 October 2000 the new building was opened and the SGC went into operation. Organization The SGC is an independent legal entity under Chinese law. Its legal representative is the NSFC's vice president for foreign affairs. The guidelines for the SGC's activities are laid down by a joint committee of four Chinese and four German members appointed by the NSFC and the DFG respectively. The Joint Committee convenes once a year. It appoints the directors and vice directors of the Center, consults on and approves its work programme, and receives the annual report and annual accounts. The work of the Center is managed by the internal board and the SGC handles research proposals in cooperation with the DFG and the NSFC. The German side of the SGC also represents the DFG as a local point of contact in China for individual researchers and various partner organisations. Funding programmes To achieve its aims the SGC currently offers the following funding instruments: * Scientific workshops/symposia for Chinese and German researchers in a defined working area * Sino-German research projects of up to three years in duration. To allow funding of a larger number of excellent projects based on a jointly developed specific research approach the processing of Sino-German research projects will be transferred to the head offices of NSFC and DFG from 2017 on.

After beginnings as an art and literary venue, liberal but highly critical of modernism, it made a turn toward politics before World War I. Especially supportive of German conservatism, it was also sympathetic toward V√∂lkisch ideologists, and published propaganda in favor of militarist politicians such as Alfred von Tirpitz. Having for its founder and editor Paul Nikolaus Cossmann, an assimilated Jew, ' was generally antisemitic‚Äîstrongly so after 1920, when it hosted calls for racial segregation. Its publication of conspiracy theories such as the stab-in-the-back myth paved the way for Nazi propaganda, but ' was more closely aligned with the mainstream right. It played a part in conspiratorial alliances supporting the policies of Gustav von Kahr, although it also had Conservative Revolutionaries among its core contributors. In its late years, ' turned to Bavarian nationalism and Wittelsbach loyalism, becoming a target for the Nazi regime. Cossmann was imprisoned for dissidence, then deported for his Jewishness; took over, leading ' until its disestablishment in 1936. Beginnings Established as a mainly social- liberal tribune by Cossmann, a Jewish writer who had converted to Catholicism, ' initially sought to reaffirm the cultural importance of Southern Germany and solidify its symbiotic relationship with Prussia, creating cultural bridges between Catholics and Protestants.Alexandre, pp. 195‚Äì196, 210‚Äì212 Joining the directorial staff in the first edition was liberal pastor-politician Friedrich Naumann (its political director to 1913),Alexandre, p. 196, 199‚Äì200, 210‚Äì212 who shared editorial oversight with painter Hans Thoma and composer Hans Pfitzner.\\"Chronique allemande\\", Biblioth√®que Universelle et Revue Suisse, Vol. 39, Issue 115, pp. 635‚Äì636 Protestant social reformer and Joseph Schnitzer, a Modernist Catholic, were noted guest writers, with Cossmann acting as neutral host.Alexandre, pp. 196‚Äì198 During the federal election of 1907, the magazine hosted debates between Schnitzer and Center Party militant , on Political Catholicism and its role in society (a divisive one, according to Schnitzer).Alexandre, p. 206 However, according to historian Adam R. Seipp, ' was mainly an interface for traditional Munich‚ÄîCatholic, \\"deeply conservative\\", \\"suspicious of outside influences\\", and antithetical to the modernist Simplicissimus.Adam R. Seipp, The Ordeal of Peace: Demobilization and the Urban Experience in Britain and Germany, 1917‚Äì1921, p. 39. Farnham: Ashgate Publishing, 2009. Cossmann managed to attract important writers to the magazine's permanent staff, including and Karl Alexander von M√ºller. In its early issues, ' hosted mainly essays by the likes of Hofmiller (such as his 1909 putdown of the modernist author Robert Walser),Bernhard F.

Some of the cultural and social chronicles had nationalist undertones, debating over the requirements of German modernization. As Anglophiles, Hofmiller, Lujo Brentano, and suggested fusing Anglo‚ÄìAmerican lessons in modernity with the German Volkstum, to make Germany a more competitive capitalist nation; in 1906, a Dr. Paul Tesdorf went further, promoting eugenics as a means to engineer a better people.Alexandre, pp. 197‚Äì198, 200‚Äì202 In contrast, Naumann and other authors worried about finance capitalism and oligopolies, exhorting a German nationalism based on \\"democratic capitalism\\" or syndicalism, and following closely the development of Marxist revisionism.Alexandre, pp. 202‚Äì204.

' promoted an increasingly radical right-wing platform, supporting militarists Alfred von Tirpitz and Erich Ludendorff while excoriating more moderate military and political elements. In 1916, Cossmann and his magazine defended Tirpitz's submarine war policy, submitting evidence that Tirpitz critic Veit Valentin had falsified military reports.Scheck, pp. 51‚Äì52 These were times of notoriety for the magazine: prior to the war, ' circulation stood at a few hundred copies,Alexandre, p. 96 rising to 3000-5000 ca. 1914, and increasing sharply after that, reaching 100,000 at times.

Also featured were articles by Zionists Max Bodenheimer and Franz Oppenheimer, who purported that \\"Eastern Jews\\" were natural allies of German nationalism. More radical Jewish intellectuals, primarily Kurt Blumenfeld and , reacted against this juxtaposition, accusing Bodenheimer of having given up on Zionist ideals.Aschheim, pp. 163, 286‚Äì287 Cossmann was also irritated by the \\"uncritical\\" views of Bodenheimer and his followers, which, he argued, were essentially \\"platitudes\\".Aschheim, pp. 170‚Äì171 The editorship viewed the November 1918 Revolution and consequent fall of the monarchy as a disaster; its nationalist agitation was strengthened in the wake of the Munich Soviet Republic and the establishment of the Weimar Republic. In that context, its antisemitism also became more radical, integrating notions about \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\", and dropping ethical distinctions between assimilated and non-assimilated Jews,Aschheim, pp. 233, 300 although Cossmann remained rather critical of such analogies.Cahnman, p. 108 In February 1919, it became the first mainstream publication to host an article by M√ºller's brother-in-law Gottfried Feder.

Its History and Dilemma in the Twentieth Century, pp. 110‚Äì111, 236. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957.

The accusation, backed by the Spenglerian philosophical stance (defeat was a failure of national will),Verhey, p. 223 was notably taken up by Cossmann‚Äîwith a focus on the wartime Social Democrats.

Spengler, who felt that Nazi adventurism had ruined his own budding project for an industrialist timocracy, broke with the Cossmann club, denouncing its failure to preclude the Putsch.Struve, pp. 244‚Äì246 By 1927, the magazine again had a focus on eugenics, as well as racial hygiene and natalism. Hosting a topical essay by Spengler, it had contributions by eugenicists Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, Alfred Ploetz, and Fritz Lenz.Liliane Crips, \\"Du f√©minisme comme d√©cadence. Le discours sur les femmes des droites conservatrices et r√©volutionnaires sous la R√©publique de Weimar et le IIIe Reich\\", L'Homme et la Soci√©t√©, Vol. 99, 1991, p. 93 Issuing predictions about the \\"fate of our race\\", Lenz discussed the Nordic race in relation to the German people, while statistician Richard Korherr contributed Geburtenr√ºckgank (\\"Birth Rate\\"), a much-read study of the West's population decline.Andrea D'Onofrio, Razza, sangue e suolo. Utopie della razza e progetti eugenetici nel ruralismo nazista, pp. 12, 122. Naples: ClioPress, 2007. These works were complimented in 1929 by a essay on biopolitics and the alleged Slavic population pressure on Germany's eastern frontier, suggesting counteraction through German recolonization. In other ways the magazine contradicted V√∂lkisch tenets. Sexologist Max von Gruber wrote that most of the \\"greatest men of our race\\" were not purely Nordic, but \\"hybrids\\", and that productive miscegenation was in the national character.Rudolf Rocker, Nationalismus und Kultur, p. 309. M√ºnster: Bibliothek Th√©l√®me, 1999.

Also, as noted by historian Bernd Weisbrod, 's racial antisemitism was of the moderate variety embraced by the National Populists. This was notably illustrated by its hosting, in September 1930, of an article by J√ºnger, in which the novelist suggested that self-segregation was \\"the most efficient weapon\\" against Jews. Returning to its critique of cultural imports at the height of the international Jazz Age, the magazine was focusing its attacks on modern American culture, and especially its African component.Michael H. Kater, \\"The Impact of American Popular Culture on German Youth\\", in Jonathan Huener, Francis R. Nicosia (eds.), The Arts in Nazi Germany: Continuity, Conformity, Change, pp. 35‚Äì36.

Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2012. J√ºnger's articles, however, showed leniency toward modernization and a more critical stance against V√∂lkisch tropes: he conceived of the \\"German national revolution\\" as an urban uprising, and decried peasant conservatism as outdated, \\"doomed to failure\\".Elliot Y. Neaman, A Dubious Past: Ernst J√ºnger and the Politics of Literature after Nazism, p. 44. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. 0-520-21628-8 ' writers were also undecided about the import of physical education and the Weimar youth's emphasis on recreational sport: Ulrich von Wilamowitz deplored these developments, while Wilhelm Wien saw in them signs of recovery from \\"the postwar chaos\\".Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time, pp. 314, 318. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. The popularity of German occultism and alternative medicine was examined by Cossmann's journal, over several issues. Astrologers such as were allowed to introduce their work to the magazine's middle-class readership, although their essays generally refrained from making astrological inferences.Treitel, pp. 133‚Äì134, 306, 308 With articles by Sven Hedin and others, the magazine expressed skepticism against the fantastic travel accounts of F. Ossendowski, and against modern mysticism in general.Wim Coudenys, \\"B√™tes, hommes et dieux: les chim√®res de F. Ossendowski pendant la r√©volution\\", in Eddy Stols, Werner Thomas, Johan Verberckmoes (eds.), Naturalia, mirabilia & monstrosa en los Imperios Ib√©ricos: siglos XV-XIX, pp. 323‚Äì327. Leuven: Leuven University Press, 2006. Nazi ascendancy to power Shortly after the onset of the Great Depression, ' resumed campaigning for \\"the revival of war generation\\" and the fulfillment of its \\"historical destiny\\"‚Äîthemes central to the essays of Edgar Julius Jung, which saw print in Cossmann's magazine.Herbert F. Ziegler, Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy. The SS Leadership, 1925‚Äì1939, p. 67. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989. In the late 1920s, Jung was outlining here his vision of neo-feudalism, communalism and grassroots democracy, as conservative resources against centralizing SPD governments.Struve, pp. 331, 337‚Äì338 With monarchism on the decline, the journal still gave exposure to Wilhelm II's apologists, hosting 's 1929 study \\"The Monarchy in German History\\".Struve, p. 221 Some of the journal's contributors looked into new forms of authoritarianism. J√ºnger's 1930 text lambasted liberalism and Italian Fascism, noting that the latter only existed as a \\"simplified and shortened\\" version of the former. He envisaged a \\"stricter solution\\" to Germany's political and economic woes.Maurizio Bach, Stefan Breuer, Faschismus als Bewegung und Regime: Italien und Deutschland im Vergleich, p. 192. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag, 2010. The economic crisis brought in opportunities for corporatist and social credit schemes, which were taken up by , who proposed creating a national labor conscription service on such grounds. After a republican Voluntary Labor Service came into force in 1932, an article by celebrated its role in national pedagogy and social advancement.Wolfgang Benz, \\"Vom freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst zur Arbeitsdienstpflicht\\", in Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, Vol. 16, Issue 4, 1968, pp. 320, 332 The journal's conservative position was at odds with Nazism, just as the latter was growing in popularity and numerical strength. Reventlow, who had since adhered to the Nazi Party, still frequented the ', where, in September 1930, he published a Nazi manifesto that called not just for \\"complete separation\\" from the Jews, but also for their \\"annihilation\\".Cahnman, p. 111 Cossmann himself rejected Nazi racial theory but, as sociologist Werner Jacob Cahnman has noted, his earlier work in propaganda had unwittingly given the Nazis \\"a rousing slogan and terrific impetus\\". According to Cahnman, Cossmann \\"just did not wish to see the writing on the wall\\". In early 1933, Cossmann and his collaborator , who had openly criticized Adolf Hitler in 1923, called for a monarchist coup against the nascent Nazi regime that would see Crown Prince Rupprecht placed on the throne. Setting out its platform, the magazine's January cover bore the title \\"King Rupprecht\\". The pair were arrested and imprisoned. Cossmann, described by scholar Steven E. Aschheim as \\"a tragic victim of the breakdown of the German‚ÄìJewish symbiosis\\",Aschheim, p. 170 was sent to the ghetto of Berg am Laim in 1941, and died at Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. The magazine continued to run to 1936 under Nazi publisher , but became both insignificant and apolitical during this last phase. A late controversy came in October 1933, when Paul Wentzcke commemorated in his articles 1920s Rhenish separatism, depicting it as a popular self-help movement against Weimar incompetence.S. A. Schuker, \\"Bayern und der rheinische Separatismus\\", in Jahrbuch des Historischen Kollegs 1997, 1998, pp. 105‚Äì106 Some of the final issues had encomiums of Nazi architecture, penned by art reviewers such as (who celebrated the Nuremberg Rally as a \\"sacred space\\").Steffen Kr√§mer, \\"Achsen f√ºr den Aufmarsch. Zur politischen Inszenierung des urbanen Raumes im Dritten Reich\\", in Schriftenreihe der Winckelmann Akademie f√ºr Kunstgeschichte M√ºnchen Textbeitrag Nr. 18, February 2014, pp. 8, 16 Having already hosted comments by on holistic health in November 1932,Treitel, pp. 157, 312 other such issues had contributions by Nazified Neo-Adlerian therapists: Fritz K√ºnkel, who favored reintegrating patients within the \\"greater community\\"; and Harald Schultz-Hencke, who talked about a \\"rediscovery of the soul\\" by psychiatric science.Laurence A.

Through the traditional system, he mastered a good portion of the Holy Qur'an and acquired intensive knowledge in Arabic Language and grammar; as well as the foundational principles of Islamic law.

Located in downtown Arlington, it served the Lexington Branch. It was closed in January 1977 when service on the Lexington Branch was suspended. History Arlington Centre station on an early postcard The Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad opened from West Cambridge to Lexington on September 1, 1846. Arlington Centre station was located near the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Mystic Street in Arlington. On April 18, 1958, the Boston and Maine Railroad received permission from the Public Utilities Commission to drastically curtail its suburban commuter service, including abandoning branches, closing stations, and cutting trains. Among the approved cuts was the closure of the Lexington Branch's four stations in Arlington (Lake Street, Arlington Centre, Brattles, and Arlington Heights), as Arlington was part of the funding district of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which provided parallel bus service on Massachusetts Avenue. The four stations were closed on May 16, 1958. Due to community input, Arlington Centre station was reopened in October 1965, followed by Lake Street in March 1968. On a typical day, no more than 7 to 12 passengers used Arlington Centre station; although taking the Lexington Branch allowed one to reach downtown faster than if one had used the 77 bus and the Red Line (transferring at Harvard, then the northwestern terminus of the Red Line), it had only one round trip per day (one train inbound to Boston in the morning, and then one back out to Bedford Depot in the evening) and was substantially more expensive. In January 1977, following a major snowstorm which temporarily shut down the Lexington Branch, stranding a train at Bedford Depot, the MBTA announced that commuter rail service on the branch would not be restored. In the 1980s, the MBTA planned to extend the Red Line through Arlington and Lexington to Route 128 along the former path of the Lexington Branch as part of the Northwest Extension, including renewed service to Arlington Centre station, but fierce opposition from Arlington residents scuttled this plan, and the Northwest Extension was cut short to Alewife in northwestern Cambridge. The only surviving stations of the Lexington Branch are Bedford Depot and Lexington; Arlington Centre was demolished at some point following the branch's closure.

It was built by the Norman Lord Bernard de Neufmarch√© in 1093, and was frequently assaulted by the Welsh in 13th and 15th centuries. The castle's ownership changed numerous times. It began falling into ruin when Henry VIII executed the last dukes of Buckingham, who at the time controlled the castle. It was renovated and made into a hotel in the early 19th century. History Bernard de Neufmarch√©, William the Conqueror's brother, conquered Brycheiniog after killing Rhys ap Tewdwr at the battle of Brecon, which occurred around Easter 1093. The Normans subsequently invaded all of South Wales, defeating the local rulers. Bernard received the title of Lord of Brecon. He commenced the construction of the motte-and-bailey castle at Brecon in 1093, thereby creating the first stone castle in Wales. The stones were taken from the Roman town of Caer Badden. The castle was built at the merging point of the rivers Usk and Honddu, conferring the benefits of protection and hydropower for mills. The castle later passed to the de Braose family. When the de Braoses rebelled against King John of England, John captured the castle in 1207. However, the de Braose family retook the castle during the First Barons' War. The Bohun family received the castle in 1241 and held it until 1373 when Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford died without male issue. It eventually passed to the Stafford family, of whom Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford (1377-1403), of Stafford Castle, had married Anne of Gloucester (1383-1438), daughter and heiress of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (youngest son of King Edward III) by his wife Eleanor de Bohun, the elder daughter and co-heiress of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford. Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1477‚Äì1521), born in Brecon Castle,Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, vol.XII no.1, p.390 was executed for treason in 1521 and posthumously attainted in 1523, when all the family's estates escheated to the crown. Although some estates were later recovered by his descendants, Brecon Castle began the process of dilapidation. The castle was last besieged by Rowland Laugharne, a military commander for the Parliament, in 1645. The Welsh also attacked the castle numerous times, in 1215, 1231, 1233, 1264, 1265, 1273, and 1403. It was first captured by the Welsh in 1215, and it was captured again in 1264 and 1265. The attacks of 1273 and 1403 resulted in serious damage. Numerous renovations were carried out through the castle's history. A shell keep made of stone was constructed in the late 12th century (the keep was initially made of wood). In 1233, a bailey wall, also made of stone, was constructed. Two towers, one round and the other semi-octagonal, were built in the 13th century and early 14th century, respectively. A hall block was added in 1300. The castle had become mere ruins by the end of the Georgian era. Renovations were begun in 1809 by Sir Charles Morgan of Tredegar House, and more than ¬£7,000 had been spent on the repairs by 1814. The castle was made a hotel, which it currently continues to be.

He heard the city's brass band parades in his neighborhood when he was a child; but it was the Beatles's famous Ed Sullivan appearance which inspired him to take up the guitar. At the early age of 12 he began performing with a high school-aged band The Sonics at The Wonderful Boys Club, a social and pleasure hall, and served as apprentice to many of the neighborhood's musicians. Recruited by former Jesuit High School classmates, LeBlanc received a scholarship to Columbia University where he studied Music Education. He would later graduate from Southern University of New Orleans, studying under the tutelage of Kidd Jordan, and move to Philadelphia to play with renowned jazz musician Sun Ra.Salaam, Kalamu Ya. \\"Carl LeBlanc.\\" Wavelength Magazine Jan. 1987: 15-16.

Life  Tatjana Doll graduated in 1998 from the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf under the master Dieter Krieg. From 2005 to 2006, she was a guest professor for painting in the Kunsthochschule Wei√üensee Berlin. After residing in New York, Istambul, and Rome in Villa Massimo, Casa Baldi Olevano Romano, she now lives and works in Berlin. 2009 she was appointed as art professor at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe and works, since then, at the external campus Freiburg.  Artistic work  Doll's pictures often show diverse everyday objects, which structure and influence our lives in the way we are often not aware of. Cardboard cups, suitcases, electronic devices, lorries or cars are depicted in large, realistic paintings and are subjects to a detailed analysis by the means of art. The focus on a single object allows taking a distance from the automatic way of seeing it, to look at it from a different point of view and to recognize social and political contexts behind it. \\"Doll's painting begins with social reality as well as with the question of images and symbols to represent the processes of this reality and their subjective assimilation.\\".  Technique and material  Tatjana Doll, Ferrari F430, 2005 In her works, Tatjana Doll investigates the possibilities and the borders of painting as well as \\"its potential to disclose social processes and our perception of them\\". The predominantly realistic style appears even stronger due to the oversized formats. The artist often works with the same motive across a series of pictures and therefore lets the moment of accident integrate the pictorial interplay. Tatjana Doll finds the way to express the confrontation of perfection and failure, integrity and breach. The material plays a great role ‚Äì the artist works with enamel, the shiny surface of which frequently gets cracks, paint puddles, and waves.

Published 26 March, 2002 It is the only prison/corrections force within the British Overseas Territories and United Kingdom that uses the \\"Corrections\\" title (popular in the US) rather than the more usual \\"HM Prison Service\\" as is customary. History HM Prison Service was part of the Bermuda Government, and a separate organisation from Her Majesty's Prison Service, which manages most of the prisons within England and Wales. The service operated a number of prisons and facilities in Bermuda, which included a Junior Training School for young offenders (located on Nonsuch Island until the 1950s, when it relocated to Paget Island, and closed in the 1980s with young offenders being placed into Canadian facilities) and a maximum security prison in the former Casemates Naval Barracks at the Royal Naval Dockyard, which was closed in the 1990s and replaced with the Westgate Correctional Facility. The service also operated the Pendle Hill Prison Farm for low-risk convicts and a Co-Educational Facility for female offenders, both of which are still in use at Ferry Reach, St. George's Parish.Government of Bermuda: Department of Corrections The service suffered a number of scandals, including the imprisonment on 14 May 1953, for twelve months of the Warden of Prisons, Albert James Croke, after his conviction for thefts related to irregularities during his term in office. Croke, a former Royal Marines Sergeant, had served in the Bermuda Police Force (now the Bermuda Police Service) from 1937 until his joining HM Prisons, Bermuda, in 1942. He had occupied the post of Warden since 1947. A riot broke out in the Hamilton Prison on the day of his incarceration as other convicts believed he was receiving preferential treatment. The rioters were subdued with teargas and batons by the Bermuda Police Service. Croke was injured in the riot and required hospitalisation, following which he was transported to Britain by to serve out the remainder of his sentence. His successor was the erstwhile Probation Officer, Major Charles Baring, who had served in the Coldstream Guards in both world wars, and had been Second-in-Command of 56 Military Prison in Italy from 1944 to 1945. In the 1930s he had been Housemaster and Deputy Governor of Wormwood Scrubs. He took over as Warden of Prisons in July, 1952, but resigned the same year and was replaced in 1953 by Wing Commander Erie Ellis, who also resigned in June, 1955, after a stormy administration. The post was then temporarily filled by Colonel Cecil Newing until Major Geoffrey Nash, a fourteen-year veteran of the British Indian Army (who had been in charge of a mixed military and civil prison in Iraq from 1945 until 1947, when he had joined HM Prison Service) arrived to take over in February, 1956.New Warden of Prisons Takes Over. The Bermuda Recorder. 22 February 1956 A more recent scandal was caused in 1992 when the Prison Officers' Club hosted a Fathers' Day event for which they had imported a troupe of female strippers called the Luscious Lollipops. Two officers, David Frost and George Cann, were convicted of indecency in Magistrates' Court. The Acting Senior Magistrate, John Judge, said the show was \\"outrageously indecent by any standards\\" and fined Frost $500 and Cann $400. His decision was subsequently reversed by the Chief Justice, Sir James Astwood, who ordered the fines to be repaid and recommended that the two men be permitted to keep their jobs. The two officers had been defended by former Prosecutor Saul Froomkin.Luscious Lollipops Prison Officers given an absolute discharge. The Royal Gazette. 27 October, 1992 In 2002, the Government of Bermuda announced a new mindset concerning the treatment of offenders, redesignating the prisons as correctional facilities. HM Prison Service, Bermuda, was renamed in accordance with this policy as the Department of Corrections. As the party in Government at the time, the Progressive Labour Party (which had failed to win an election from the 1968 introduction of party politics until 1998, when the United Bermuda Party was still divided over the unpopular 1995 Independence Referendum and the McDonald's scandal) Reuters: McDonald's Try To 'Rape' BermudaBermuda 4U: 1990s McDonald's Controversy has long called for both severing the territory's ties with Britain, and for removing the Monarchy, many Bermudians thought the new mindset to be a ploy to remove \\"Her Majesty's\\" from the name of the service. The PLP Government also raised hackles by inserting the word \\"National\\" into the names of many facilities and organisations, such as the former Bermuda Library (now the Bermuda National Library), and renaming facilities for party members (the Bermuda International Airport was renamed L.F. Wade International Airport on the 16 April 2007, in honour of L. Frederick Wade, who had been one of the leaders of the PLP during its long years in opposition).

Many details of his activity remain uncertain, but it is known that he became, on 23 February 1940, the second husband of his co-worker Ursula Kuczynski, whose own public profile in English language sources is relatively well rehearsed thanks to her espionage work involving Klaus Fuchs. Like many who make their careers in espionage, Beurton appears in sources with a number of different names. At the time of his birth he was Leon Charles Beurton. His first name appears variously as Len, Leon and Leonard, while his family name may be shown as Beuston, Benston or Brewer. Life Beurton was born in Barking, then just outside London on its east side. His father, who at one stage worked as a waiter, also called Leon Beurton, had been born in France, but he had taken British nationality and, round about the time his son was born, married Florence S. Smith. However, the father abandoned his wife soon after Leon's birth. Leon was adopted by a family called Fenton, which was another name that he would sometimes use. During the 1930s he was described as \\"an automobile engineer by trade\\". In 1936 or 1937 he joined the International Brigades to participate in the Spanish Civil War, fighting in support of the Republican side. He stayed in Spain till December 1938. In 1939 he was sent to Switzerland. At some stage he had been recruited to work as an agent for the Soviet intelligence services, probably by a fellow Communist called Brigite Kuczynski. In Switzerland he worked with another of Brigitte's recruits Alexander Foote in a little \\"espionage cell\\". The cell was led by Brigitte's better documented sister, Ursula Kuczynski, based in the village of Caux, then a three-hour hike up into the hills behind Geneva. Ursula Kuczynski took the opportunity to share with Beurton and Foote her critically important and by now formidable radio operating skills. Foote was known to colleagues at this time under the cover name \\"Jim\\" while Len Beurton was operating as \\"Jack\\" and sometimes as \\"John Miller\\". He also used Ursula's genuine (albeit pre- marriage) family name, Kuczynski. By or during 1940 he became the chief cipher expert in the Alexander \\"S√°ndor\\" Rad√≥ spy network, and he is thought to have been a key figure in the mysterious \\"Red Three\\" spy-ring (sometimes identified in US and UK sources as the \\"Lucy\\" or \\"Red chapel\\" group). On 23 February 1940 Leon Beurton married, as her second husband, Ursula Kuczynski. Moscow had told Ursula of plans by Germany to invade Switzerland, and she knew that as a Communist Jewish exile from Nazi Germany she would already have been listed for immediate arrest by the Nazi regime following such an invasion. She was instructed to divorce her first husband, Rudolf Hamburger, and marry one of her English co-agents in order to obtain a British passport: Foote had declined the honour, and Moscow assured Kuczynski that if she married the younger man she could divorce Beurton once she had her British passport. As matters turned out, however, the marriage would last more than fifty years. In December 1940 Mrs. Beurton relocated from Switzerland to Britain, arriving, on 4 January 1941 accompanied by her two children. Her father had been living in England, since 1933, and initially she stayed with him at her parents' Oxford home in the Woodstock Road. Beurton nevertheless remained in Switzerland, presumably supporting S√°ndor Rad√≥'s espionage work, for another couple of years. Len Buerton himself returned to Britain, traveling via neutral Portugal, in July 1942, using a passport he had obtained from somewhere in the name of \\"John Miller\\". For the rest of the 1940s he would live with his wife at a succession of addresses in Oxfordshire, where on 8 September 1943 Ruth Beurton (as the neighbours knew her) gave birth to their son, Peter John Beurton. Following the birth of his son Beurton voluntarily joined the British army. War ended, formally in May 1945, following which, during 1945/46 he served as a member of the British army of occupation in Berlin. Back in Oxfordshire, in 1948 he took a machining job in Chipping Norton. During this period he continued to work with his wife on their espionage work for the Soviet Union. In March 1950 his wife left England for Germany, telling neighbours that she needed to sort out the affairs of her parents, German refugees from Nazi persecution who had both died in England in 1947. She took the children with her, but left Len behind because, as she explained, he had a broken leg. Nevertheless, he joined his wife in Berlin a few months later, in July 1950: their Oxfordshire home was \\"sold up\\". In November 1950 Klaus Fuchs, under interrogation by the British Intelligence Services, identified Ursula Beurton as his contact with the Soviets. The information seeped into the public domain more gradually, at least till the later 1970s when Ursula started publishing her memoirs. From the end of 1950 till his death in 1997 Leon Beurton lived with his wife in the German Democratic Republic and its successor state, working for some years with the ADN news agency. During his final years he was stricken with Parkinson's disease. He became blind, lame, deaf, and increasingly frail and dependent for his day to day survival on his wife who had, in the meantime, retired from espionage and reinvented herself as a successful author.

CR) is a Spanish trotskyist political organization, adhering to the International Workers League ‚Äì Fourth International in 2012. CR defends and supports social struggles, class independence and political gains of the working class in order to establish a republic of workers. CR proposes the construction of a socialist economy, based on workers' democracy and the traditions of the alternative labor movement. According to its mission statement, current Red describes itself as follows: The organization is present in Madrid, Seville and Catalonia, and has some members in Galiza. In Catalonia Corriente Roja is called Corrent Roig, while in Galiza it is called Corrente Vermella. History CR was formed as an internal current in the United Left (IU) in 2002, characterized by the defense of communist values they thought had been lost in the progressive deideologization of IU. In 2004 the organization left the coalition. Initially, its members were free to belong to other political parties, part of its membership being until June 2005 affiliated to the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). The most representative figure during this period was the ex-MP √Ångeles Maestro.Left in 2011. Currently the organization is part of the International Workers' League - Fourth International (IWL). The majority of those members of the PCE were expelled from the party in 2005 for supporting the Communist Party of the Basque Homelands (PCTV-EHAK) in the Basque elections of that year, and not the Ezker Batua-Berdeak, the Basque affiliate of the PCE and the IU. In May 2007 the organization suffered a split in Madrid, that formed Comunistas 3. Comunistas 3 accused the Revolutionary Workers Party - Revolutionary Left (PRT-IR) of trying to control Corriente Roja. In the 2009 European elections CR supported and participated in Iniciativa Internacionalista (II-SP), a coalition of the Basque Abertzale Left, Izquierda Castellana, Galician People's Front and different anticapitalist parties and organizations of all Spain led by the writer and playwright Alfonso Sastre. II-SP obtained 178 121 votes (1.15% of the total vote) and no seats in the European Parliament. In the Catalan elections of 2010 CR supported and joined Des de Baix (From Below in Catalan language).

In the 2012 Catalan regional election, Corriente Roja gave critical support to the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP).

He was the son of a cafe proprietor, and held various jobs before managing to raise capital for a hydro power generation company. He founded a small bank in 1919 and specialized in turning around enterprises that were in financial difficulty through debt consolidation and the sale of shares at inflated prices. He invested in a wide range of industries from mining to leather goods and retail banking. His group was bankrupted by the economic crisis that started in 1929, and many small depositors were ruined. Oustric was found guilty of fraud and embezzlement and spent several years in prison. A commission of inquiry found that several politicians had protected Oustric, including the Minister of Justice. The Senate tried and acquitted them. Early years Albert Oustric was born on 2 September 1887 in Carcassonne, Aude. His father ran a cafe in Carcassonne, then became manager of a wine and spirits store in Toulouse. Albert Oustric became clerk to an advocate, then a sales representative of the distilled beverage firm Cusenier in the Aude. When his father died in 1910 he succeeded him as manager of the Toulouse shop, while continuing as a Cusenier representative. During World War I he was mobilized as an accountant in a shell-making factory. He was released from the factory to exploit a legacy of his father, the rights to a waterfall in the Gripp valley of the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es, by building a hydropower plant. He raised the funds needed to float the Force & lumi√®re des Pyr√©n√©es company for this purpose. He also floated the Electro-M√©tal company to produce ferro-silicon in Haute-Garonne. Banker and businessman Early growth In June 1919 Oustric founded Oustric & Cie, a small bank with a capital of one million francs, increased to five million in July 1921 and to fifteen million in 1921 after being transformed into a limited company. In 1921 he married Madeleine de Rigny. The bank had a small amount of capital from the hydroelectric company and the start of a consumer business. It became involved in arbitrage operations with coal and gold mines. Oustric's bank would issue stocks of questionable companies and use false publicity to increase their value before selling them off. Oustric sold shares in an artificial silk company, la Borswich fran√ßaise, in 1923. In 1926 Oustric invested in a silver mine in Bolivia, the Huanchaca. He used announcements of false discoveries to make the share prices rise by ten times their original value, then let them fall, then pushed them up again. With advance knowledge of price movements, he could sell high and buy low, while other investors always lost. He profited from the protectionist isolation of the French stock exchange, cut off from international finance and from other exchanges. Snia Viscosa In 1926 Oustrick became involved in Snia Viscosa, an Italian maker of artificial silk. The company was controlled by the Italian financier Riccardo Gualino, who was assisted by Benito Mussolini and the Bank of Italy, and had become the second- largest rayon manufacturer in the world. On 26 March 1926 Gaston Vidal, a former deputy and secretary of state and now a director of the Oustric bank, asked on behalf of the bank for authorization to list 500,000 shares of Snia Viscosa in France. This was against the current policy of the Ministry of Finance, which did not allow listing of foreign companies in the French stockmarket. However, the responsible official asked the opinion of Ren√© Besnard, the French ambassador in Rome. Vidal went to Rome and met the ambassador, who wrote that he had no objection to introducing shares of Snia Viscosa on the French stock exchange. The Ministry official then submitted the issue to Raoul P√©ret, Minister of Finance, saying he saw no reason to authorize the requested share float. P√©ret replied that the ambassador had insisted that the authorization be granted. P√©ret asked the opinion of the Ministry of Commerce, which was against it. He pressed the ministry, which remained cautious and wanted assurances that there would be an agreement between the French and Italian textile industries. Oustric said he would be willing to help obtain an agreement, and on that basis P√©ret gave the authorization. After leaving office, P√©ret became legal counsel to the Oustric bank six months after the Snia Viscose shares were listed. Industrial empire Oustric moved from arbitrage to ownership of various risky enterprises which he turned around through debt consolidation and partial sale of shares. During the 1920s he helped salvage the textile maker Kahn, Lang & Manuel, the spinner Valentin Bloch, the paper maker Papeteries de Gascogne and other enterprises. He became involved in companies ranging from oil production to leather goods. In 1929 his holding company acquired Mar√©chal, a firm in Lyon that made reinforced fabrics. He then acquired Sarlino (Soci√©t√© r√©moise de linol√©ums) in Reims, and Athos, a sewing machine company. Through a structure of holding companies the bank in 1929 controlled an empire of enterprises with optimistically priced shares. One of these was the Banque Adam, a long-established bank in the Pas-de-Calais. The operation was respectable, supported by other banks, and known for its success in salvaging troubled enterprises. Bankruptcy Group structure in October 1930 When Gualino quarreled with Mussolini, the value of the Snia Viscosa shares fell. The general decline of stock prices in 1929 also undermined Oustric's business. He used funds from the Banque Adam to buy shares in his other companies so as to keep their prices from falling. The attorney general became aware of this and asked for an indictment. In October 1930 Raoul P√©ret, who was now Minister of Justice, delayed the indictment for twelve days while the bank's shares were plunging in value. They were finally de-listed on 31 October 1930. On 2 November the minister told the attorney general and state prosecutor that an inopportune indictment might trigger a serious financial crisis. On 4 November 1930 the attorney general withdrew his request for immediate indictment. The Oustric group failed with debts of 125 million on 5 November 1930. Banque Adam, a Calais-based consumer bank majority owned by Oustric, was among the subsidiaries that failed. Oustric was arrested and taken to La Sant√© Prison. The default caused the ruin of many small savers. The Peugeot company lost all its capital, and came close to failing. The news of the default broke at a time when the scandal of Marthe Hanau's failed bank in which many small investors lost their savings was still current. The newspapers claimed that Oustric had drained cash from the Banque Adam taking the money of depositors. Political inquiry On 21 November 1930 the Chamber of Deputies appointed a commission of inquiry to determine if there had been any improper political involvement. The commission of inquiry found that P√©ret had been involved as counsel of the Oustric bank and of the Paris Foncier and Holfra companies that it controlled. He had received large fees but had provided no legal services. The commission found that the minister had been paid for \\"political services\\" and that he had abused his power to prevent his client being charged. One of the leading members of the commission was Georges Mandel. The inquiry showed that the Bank of France had been involved in Oustric's speculations, indicating extreme naivety of the central bank staff. The commission drew criticism for publishing names, and L'Ere Nouvelle said that it was muck-raking. P√©ret resigned, as did Henri Falcoz and Eug√®ne Lautier, two undersecretaries of state who had also been paid by Outric. The government of Andr√© Tardieu was defeated and resigned in December 1930. On 25 March 1931, the Chamber of Deputies voted to impeach P√©ret before the High Court. The Senate sat as High Court on 20 July 1931, with Albert Lebrun as president and Joseph Caillaux among the judges. The Attorney General pressed for severe penalties, but other witnesses said they did not think P√©ret had acted in favor of Oustric. On 23 July 1931, he was acquitted. The court simply found that the methods he had used should be morally condemned. The final report of the Commission was completed in March 1932 but remained unpublished for fear of the effect on public opinion on the eve of a general election. Last years At his trial Oustric was found guilty of fraud, embezzlement and engaging in financial irregularities. Eventually Oustric spent 38 months in prison and was fined 31,000 francs in damages. He was released on medical grounds and took a job as an employee of his former bank, which had reopened, at 3,000 francs a month. He was rehabilitated on 15 May 1945. Albert Oustric died on 16 April 1971 in Toulouse aged 83.

In Serbia the pioneer in archeology and Illyriology was Mihailo Valtroviƒá, but there was no widespread activity until Nikola Vuliƒá appeared, and brought important results in the half of the nineteenth century. Biography Born in Scutari in 1872 during the period of Ottoman rule, he left for Serbia where he studied Latin, Old Church Slavonic, Ancient Greek, and ancient history. He graduated from the University of Belgrade in history. For his post-graduate studies he went to the University of Munich, where he received his doctorate. Upon his return to Belgrade, he was named professor at his alma mater. During World War I, Serbia's Minister of Education in-exile in Greece concluded that professors and teachers should be seconded from the army. Nikola Vuliƒá was exempt from further serving in the army in 1917. In Clermont-Ferrand he taught Latin to both Serb and French students but as he himself said, he spent part of his classes teaching French students, the history of Serbia in ancient times. Moreover, he gave free public lectures every Tuesday at a museum to anyone that was interested. He is remembered as the translator of Aeneid by Virgil in 1907‚Äì1908.Koviƒá, Milo≈°, Srbi 1903-1914: Istorija ideja, Clio, Belgrade, 2015., , p. 369. Excavations Stobi was by far the largest projects in southern Yugoslavia (now North Macedonia) in the period between World War I and World War II and also one of the largest projects of Serbian archeology at that time, and very soon attracted the attention of foreign scholars and researchers. Particularly active was Nikola Vuliƒá, professor of ancient history at the University of Belgrade, who extensively studied pre-Roman and Roman periods of the central Balkans (epigraphy, ethnic structure, Romanization process) and contributed a series of essential papers on these topics in national and international literature (in Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft and Dizionario epigrafico di antichit√† romane). Probably the most renowned site Vuliƒá researched was that of Trebeni≈°ta in the Ohrid Lake area, where he excavated a late prehistoric cemetery between 1930 and 1934 and found two golden masks dated to mid-first millennium BC. Other Vuliƒá's archeological research included also the excavation (1925) of the theatre at Scupi, the Roman town established in the first century AD, and Heraclea Lyncestis in Bitola, a town founded in the fourth century BC.

Life Margaret Plunkett was born in the Irish county of Westmeath around 1727. (Her date of birth is not accepted by all who have written about her: Francis Leeson believed she was born about 1736 and Julie Peakman, the author of Peg Plunkett: memoirs of a whore, prefers a birth date of about 1742.Peakman, Julie (2015) Peg Plunkett: memoirs of a whore. London: Quercus ; pp. 5-6) She was one of eight of her mother's 22 children who survived childhood. Because of her mother's death and brother's abuse she moved to Dublin. In Dublin the teenage Plunkett became pregnant and she was kept by the child's father until the child died. This was the first of six of her children who died. At this point she lost everything and took again to being unmarried and relying on the support of men. Amongst these was a Mr Leeson whom Plunkett did not marry but she did adopt his surname. Plunkett never revealed the identity of this man but he is believed to have been Joseph Leeson, 2nd Earl of Milltown. Plunkett became head of her own household when she started her first brothel with a friend, Sally Hayes, in Drogheda Street in Dublin. Plunkett was successful in court against Richard Crosbie, the leader of a notorious gang known as the Pinking Dindies. This group of upper- class youths and failed students carried swords with which they used to mug the unfortunate. They were known for taking the \\"booty\\" from prostitutes and brothels and they continued in this practise, despite the law, for many years. Irish varieties, for the last fifty years: written from recollections, J. D. Herbert, 1836 Crosbie was sent to jail for an attack on Plunkett that ended a pregnancy and caused another of her children to die; it was said that Crosbie could have faced a murder charge. The business had other addresses but finally occupied premises in Pitt Street (now Balfe Street, near Grafton Street). Plunkett took her exploiters to the courts on more than one occasion and she was said to enjoy local support because her business attracted customers to other nearby businesses.The rise and fall of Peg Plunkett, 18th-century courtesan and consummate memoirist, Sarah Dunant, 2 July 2015, The New Statesman, Retrieved 8 July 2015 Plunkett retired after thirty years to Blackrock.

In 2013 it established its Permanent Secretariat in Brussels bringing together National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) from across the wider European region. Formerly known as European Group of National Human Rights Institutions (European Group of NHRIs, the Group), ENNHRI has been actively working in the field of promotion and protection of human rights in wider Europe for 15 years. ENNHRI essentially assists in the establishment and accreditation of European NHRIs, coordinates the exchange of information and best practices among its members, facilitates capacity building and training, engages with international and regional mechanisms for protection and promotion of human right and intervenes on legal and policy developments in Europe. ENNHRI is one of four regional networks within the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Other three groups are following: Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, Network of National Institutions in the Americas and Asia Pacific Forum.  History  The ICC (now GANHRI), or as often referred to, the global network of NHRIs was established in 1993. The NHRIs of the European region, however, first met in 1994 under the auspices of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. The following meeting took place in Copenhagen, where the European Coordinating Group was set up in order to enhance the cooperation with OHCHR, the Council of Europe and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR). A third meeting was, consequently held in context of roundtable with Council of Europe in 2000 in Strasbourg. The turning point for the formalisation of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions, was its fourth meeting in Dublin where the members approved the Group‚Äôs Rules of Procedure and agreed to meet annually in the margins of ICC Annual meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The European Group of NHRIs aspired to establish a Permanent Secretariat for many years. After receiving a start-up grant form UN OHCHR in 2013, the European Group of NHRIs recruited a Secretary General to establish a Permanent Secretariat in Brussels. In May 2013 the Group, agreed on the constitution and changed the name to the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions (ENNHRI). The constitution became formal as ENNHRI‚Äôs statutes on incorporation later that year as an International Not-for-profit Association (AISBL) under Belgian law. ENNHRI Strategic planning meeting supported by OSCE-ODIHR with the participation of majority members took place in November 2013 in Budapest, Hungary. The outcomes of the meeting, ENNHRI‚Äôs Strategic Plan 2014-16 and Operational Plan 2014 were afterwards formally endorsed by ENNHRI General Assembly in March 2014.  Values  ENNHRI‚Äôs values are: Respect of international human rights standards; ‚Ä¢ Transparency; ‚Ä¢ Cooperation; ‚Ä¢ Accountability; ‚Ä¢ Participation; ‚Ä¢ Non-discrimination; and ‚Ä¢ Independence.  Vision  For the period 2014-16, ENNHRI‚Äôs vision is: Universal and effective enjoyment of human rights throughout Europe.  Mission  For the period 2014-16, ENNHRI‚Äôs mission is: Supporting and strengthening European NHRIs to protect and promote human rights effectively, in line with the Paris Principles.

NHRIs that are accredited with ‚ÄòB‚Äô status by the SCA are non-voting members. Such NHRIs must commit themselves to take up active steps towards ‚ÄòA‚Äô status of accreditation. Meanwhile, as ‚ÄòB‚Äô status institutions they can take part in the Finance Committee and act as Working Groups‚Äô Chairs. The European NHRIs which are not ‚ÄòA‚Äô nor ‚ÄòB‚Äô status accredited, have a possibility to become associate members, by all means, without voting rights. Such associate members have an obligation, though, to commit, in an acceptable form, to take active steps towards ‚ÄòA‚Äô status accreditation. Thus, they can participate in the Finance Committee and Working Groups. It is equally applicable to all NHRIs of ENNHRI that in order to remain members they must comply with ENNHRI statutes, submit the annual membership fee payment and act in accordance with ENNHRIs‚Äô objectives.  Governance  = ENNHRI‚Äôs General Assembly (GA) = GA is the highest decision-making body consisting of all voting members. ENNHRI members without voting rights may, however speak during the meetings. The GA decides generally takes decisions on the basis of consensus. = The European Coordinating Committee (ECC) = ECC is responsible for ENNHRI‚Äôs management and administration. It is composed of minimum of four and maximum of six A-accredited European NHRIs. = The Chair of ECC = The Chair is elected by the ENNHRI GA and supervises the management of ENNHRI‚Äôs day-to-day activities and he /she primary representative of ENNHRI. = The Permanent Secretariat = The ENNHRI Secretariat in Brussels is responsible for daily administrative and operational activities of ENNHRI. It facilitates work between ENNHRI‚Äôs governmental structures and members.  Activities   Working Groups  ENNHRI has established numerous forms of cooperation, including working groups or thematic clusters. These are composed and led by ENNHRI members, and partially supported by ENNHRI Secretariat. = Legal Working Group = The Legal WG gathers ENNHRI members‚Äô legal experts and officers which are presided by a Chair. The Group has worked on issues of enhancing European fundamental and human rights regimes. This included the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and execution of judgments from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the EU accession to the European Convention of Human Rights and implementation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Through the Legal WG, ENNHRI enjoys observer status at the Steering Committee for Human Rights (CDDH) Council of Europe and its subordinate bodies. = Asylum and Migration Working Group = The Asylum and Migration Working Group (A&M; WG) was officially set up in January 2007. The issue of detention of the asylum seekers and irregular migrants in Europe was discussed during its resurrection meeting in December 2013. The statement produced during this meeting was presented in September 2014 during the first Council of Europe, European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and Equinet Platform meeting on Asylum and Migration. The group has been carefully following the situation of migrants and refugees in Mediterranean Sea since the Lampedusa tragedy and addressed this issue through statements including latest from April 2015. Other topics addressed by the A&M; WG include calling upon the EU Institutions to take urgent action regarding the Syrian refugee crisis, in particular the immediate application of the EU Directive on Temporary Protection and a statement on statelessness to the Human Rights Commissioner of Council of Europe during the Global Forum on Statelessness in September 2014. = Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) Working Group = The CRPD Working Group (CRPD WG) was set up in 2010 and it is composed of European NHRIs that act as an independent mechanism under article 33.2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (‚ÄòUNCRPD‚Äô). CRPD WG has been engaging with other relevant stakeholders in the field of rights of disabilities such as the UN Committee on Rights of Persons with Disabilities which wish to include NHRIs into development of General Comment on article 33.2. Moreover, CRPD WG participated in the annual European Commission Work Forum on UNCRPD in 2014. The CRPD WG met twice in 2014 and discussed article 33.2 monitoring activities of the members, updates on situation in the field of rights of persons with disabilities in EU, Council of Europe and UN and reviewed disability case law of the ECtHR and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CRPD WG focuses on issues of forced treatment and deprivation of liberty in respect of person with psycho-social disabilities and in 2014 submitted comments on the Additional Protocol to the Oviedo Convention relating to the ‚Äòprotection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorders with regard to involuntary placement and treatment‚Äô.  Projects  = NHRI Academy = The NHRI Academy is a joint project between ENNHRI and OSCE-ODIHR. The inaugural Academy took place in 2014 in Budapest, Hungary in cooperation with Central European University and the second NHRI Academy took place in Warsaw, Poland. The NHRI Academy brings together mid-level and senior staff from NHRIs from across the wider European region. The NHRI Academy addresses aspects of NHRI characteristics and methodologies, such as gender mainstreaming, cooperation and independence of NHRIs, Human Rights Monitoring and engaging with Council of Europe. The NHRI Academy also constitutes a platform for capacity building of NHRIs‚Äô staff members, for sharing good practices and provides possibilities for networking. = Older Persons Project = ENNHRI is supported by the European Commission (Directorate-General Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion - Social Protection Unit) to embed a human rights-based approach in the care of older persons in Europe through the project ‚ÄúHuman Rights of Older Persons and Long-term Care‚Äù. This project started in January 2015 and aims to improve the human rights protection of older persons in long-term care, with particular emphasis on residential care. The project will run for 2.5 years and will involve the monitoring of the human rights situation of older persons in long-term care in the jurisdictions of six ENNHRI members (Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania). Preparation for the project included an ENNHRI member survey on activities conducted with regard to rights of older persons, planning meetings and a major stakeholder conference which took place in Brussels in October 2014.

The film was submitted to the 17st Fajr International Film Festival and won three Crystal Simorghs in the fields of best directing best directing, editing and best actress. The film looks a lot like The English Patient. Hatamikia's ability to translate an American film scenario for an Iranian audience and make it look like the Iran-Iraq war points to the universality of war.  Plot  Three stubborn characters confront each other in a mine-riddled no-man's-land in the devastated South. Mahboobeh, a headstrong, grief-crazed woman who grew up in the area; Davoud, an embittered veteran focused to the point of insanity on his job clearing mines and Jomeh, an Afghan refugee whose own experience of tragedy gives him the empathy to communicate with his fellow outcasts.  Cast  * Parviz Parastui as Davoud :The bearded rough looking man, whose job is taking out land mines. * Reza Kianian as Jomeh :A mysterious Afghani who lives in a dump where a thousand war tanks are kept. * Azita Hajian as Mahboobeh :A woman who has lost everything and now only wants to live in her family\`s ruined house.  Reception  Richard Pe√±a, Professor of Professional Practice at the School of The Arts at Columbia University, mentioned Azita Hajian, who won the award for best actress in the 17th Fajr International Film Festival, does give an extremely intense, amazingly physical performance. The film is a dense, highly metaphoric drama involving three characters and set in a tank graveyard in the no-man's-land between Iran and Iraq. It reminded him a bit of some of the later absurdist dramas by Fernando Arrabal and others. As he noted on early 1999, it seemed to be a great favorite with many of the Iranian critics, however yet fared less well with the foreign guests of the Fajr festival.

The home itself was built in 1923 and has similarities to kit houses common to the era. History In June 1931 the home was purchased by Arthur and Edith Lee, an African-American couple. At the time the surrounding area was considered to be a \\"white neighborhood.\\" Several years prior in 1927 hundreds of property owners in the area had signed a contract with the neighborhood association pledging to not sell or rent their property to non-whites. When the Lees moved in July 1931 they were approached by the neighborhood association and offered more than they paid to sell the home back. After the Lees declined neighbors began to harass them by shouting threats and insults, posting offensive signs in their yard and throwing garbage and excrement on their lawn. The unrest escalated over the next several days as crowds growing into the hundreds and later thousands continued their campaign of harassment by shouting slurs and throwing rocks at the home. Local police were sent to maintain the peace but offered little additional support to the Lees. On July 16 the Minneapolis Tribune broke a media blackout on the situation with a front-page story entitled \\"Home Stoned in Race Row.\\" Arthur Lee, a World War I veteran, was quoted in the article as saying \\"Nobody asked me to move out when I was in France fighting in mud and water for this country. I came out here to make this house my home. I have a right to establish a home.\\" The publicity from the article generated even larger crowds as well as onlookers. All available police in the city were called to form a cordon around the house and ensure nearby streets were not blocked by the mob. Discussions with the neighborhood and community leaders during this unrest had been unproductive with the Lees' attorney advising them to say they were planning to leave to quell the unrest. The Lees were members of the local NAACP chapter and reached out to them for assistance. Lena O. Smith, the chapter's president, offered legal assistance and argued the Lees should remain as a statement that they would not be intimidated. The Lees accepted Smith's counsel and she drafted a statement published in all of the local newspapers noting that \\"[Mr. Lee] has no intention of moving now or later, even after we are assured the feeling in the district has subsided.\\" Smith's assertive public statement combined with the strong police presence quelled the rioting. The police presence remained at the Lees' house for more than a year thereafter; the Lees' daughter was escorted to and from school by police. In 1934 the Lees moved from the home to the historically black Central neighborhood. Interest in the home's history was renewed in 2001 when a law professor published an article on the Lees' second attorney, Lena O. Smith, including her role in the event. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014 on the basis of its significance to the social history of African Americans and housing discrimination in Minneapolis.

Engaging physicians and patients in conversations about unnecessary tests and procedures: Choosing Wisely Canada. CMAJ. 2014 Mar 18;186(5):325-6. The campaign aims to help physicians and patients engage in conversations about unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures, and to assist physicians and patients in making informed and effective choices to ensure high quality care.Canadian Medical Association [website]. Choosing Wisely Canada.Ottawa, ON: Canadian Medical Association; 2014. Available from:www.cma.ca/En/Pages/choosing-wisely- canada.aspx. The campaign is based on the notion that unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures often do more harm than good, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and significant waste in the Canadian healthcare system.Horwitz LI, Masica AL, Auerbach AD. Introducing Choosing Wisely¬Æ: Next steps in improving healthcare value. J Hosp Med. 2015 Mar;10(3):187-9 These unnecessary tests and procedures take away from care by potentially exposing patients to harm, leading to more testing to investigate false positive tests, and contributing to unnecessary anxiety and avoidable costs for patients. Choosing Wisely Canada aims to encourage and empower physicians to assimilate, evaluate, and implement the ever-increasing amount of evidence on current best practice. The campaign also supports the equally important role of patient education and the need to dispel the false notion that \\"more care is better care\\". Central to the campaign are lists of \\"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\\" developed by more than forty-five Canadian specialty societies. These lists are intended to encourage physicians to adopt a \\"think twice\\" attitude to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures, and to foster discussions between patients and physicians about inappropriate care. The campaign also uses patient-friendly education materials to complement these lists, as well as teaches medical trainees about resource stewardship. As of June 2, 2015, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released. Choosing Wisely Canada leads an international community, made up of nations who are implementing similar programs in their respective countries. At present, this community includes representation from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, United States and Wales. Motivation Choosing Wisely Canada stems from worldwide concern around providing unnecessary treatment when the risk of harm exceeds its potential benefit (\\"medical overuse\\").Morgan DJ, Wright SM, Dhruva S. Update on medical overuse. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Jan;175(1):120-4 A number of studies have highlighted the prevalence of medical overuse in Canada, which include findings that approximately 50% of prescriptions for respiratory infections in Saskatchewan are inappropriate,Wang, E. E., Einarson, T. R., Kellner, J. D., & Conly, J. M. (1999). Antibiotic prescribing for Canadian preschool children: evidence of overprescribing for viral respiratory infections. Clinical infectious diseases, 29(1), 155-160. 28% of lumbar spine MRIs in Alberta and Ontario are unnecessary,Emery, D. J., Shojania, K. G., Forster, A. J., Mojaverian, N., & Feasby, T. E. (2013). Overuse of magnetic resonance imaging. JAMA Internal Medicine,173(9), 823-825. and 28% of bone mineral density scans are inappropriate.Papaioannou A, Morin S, Cheung AM, Atkinson S, Brown JP, Feldman S, et al. 2010 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in Canada: Summary. CMAJ. 2010 Nov 23;182(17):1864-73. These unnecessary invasive procedures and low value care are major causes of preventable harm and increased waste of medical resources.Berwick, D. M., & Hackbarth, A. D. (2012). Eliminating waste in US health care. Jama, 307(14), 1513-1516. Medical overuse has been associated with decreased patient satisfaction and poor clinical outcomes, including higher mortality.Fisher, E. S., Wennberg, D. E., Stukel, T. A., Gottlieb, D. J., Lucas, F. L., & Pinder, E. L. (2003). The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending. Part 1: the content, quality, and accessibility of care. Annals of Internal Medicine, 138(4), 273-287. A systematic survey of patients in seven countries revealed that 10‚Äì20% of patients believed that their physicians had provided treatment of little or no value in the past two years.Schoen, C., Osborn, R., Doty, M. M., Bishop, M., Peugh, J., & Murukutla, N. (2007). Toward higher- performance health systems: adults' health care experiences in seven countries, 2007. Health Affairs, 26(6), w717-w734. Further studies highlighted the financial strain of medical overuse, such as the analysis conducted by the Institute of Medicine, which found that up to 30% of American health care spending is on unnecessary tests and procedures.Schwartz AL, Landon BE, Elshaug AG, Chernew ME, McWilliams JM. Measuring Low-Value Care in Medicare. JAMA Intern Med. 2014. Epub ahead of print. In light of these concerns, Choosing Wisely Canada hopes to optimize value, reduce waste and improve patient outcomes by promoting patient-physician conversations about low-value care. History Dr. Wendy Levinson (MD, OC) Chair of Choosing Wisely Canada Choosing Wisely Canada is modeled after the Choosing Wisely campaign launched by the ABIM Foundation of the American Board of Internal Medicine in the United States in 2012.Harvey EJ. Choosing wisely (and carefully) Canada. Can J Surg. 2014 Jun;57(3):149, 151. Dr. Wendy Levinson, a Canadian physician and previous chair of the ABIM Board of Directors, was involved in launching the Choosing Wisely campaign in the United States.Smith, C. D., & Levinson, W. S. (2015). A Commitment to High-Value Care Education From the Internal Medicine Community. Annals of Internal Medicine,162(9), 639-640 After its successful launch, she decided to bring the movement to Canada and partnered with the Canadian Medical Association and the University of Toronto to launch Choosing Wisely Canada on April 2, 2014. In the first wave of the campaign, nine national medical specialty societies released evidence-based lists of 41 tests, treatments and procedures that provided no benefit or potentially caused harm to patients. Under the leadership of Dr. Wendy Levinson and the Canadian Medical Association, Choosing Wisely Canada initially gained momentum in Ontario and subsequently became a national movement.Gupta S, Detsky AS. Development of Choosing Wisely Recommendations for an Inpatient Internal Medicine Service. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Feb 23. The second and third waves of physician recommendation lists and patient education materials were launched on October 29, 2014, and June 2, 2015, respectively.Vogel, L. More Hospitals Choose Wisely.CMAJ June 8, 2015 cmaj.109-5078 As of June 2, 2015, more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies are engaged and at various stages of recommendations development . In total, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released in the three waves from 2014‚Äì2015. Campaign Choosing Wisely Canada has adopted a multi- faceted campaign approach, engaging physicians, patients, and medical trainees at all levels. The campaign has partnered with more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies to develop evidence-supported lists of \\"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\\", hoping to promote conversation about inappropriate care. The underlying premise is that physicians must lead such conversations, since they determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of resources. CWC has also developed complementary patient-friendly education materials, and has begun to embed lessons focusing on resource stewardship in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula. In order to unify grassroots projects occurring across Canada to implement physician recommendations, CWC additionally developed the Early Adopters Collaborative, which serves as a \\"learning platform for sharing knowledge, tools and experiences among participating organizations\\".Holton, E. Choosing Wisely: Tackling Unnecessary X-rays in the ICUS. St. Michael's Hospital Newsroom. Available at: http://www.stmichaelshospital.com/media/detail.php?source=hospital_news/2015/20150624_hn  Physician Recommendations Lists  CWC List Development Process At the core of the campaign are lists of \\"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\\" developed by national specialty societies representing a broad spectrum of physicians. These lists contain tests, treatments or procedures commonly used in their specialty, but which are not supported by evidence, and/or could expose patients to unnecessary harm.Hurley, R. (2014). Can doctors reduce harmful medical overuse worldwide?. BMJ, 349, g4289. List items recommend practices to be avoided and typically begin with the word \\"Don't\\" or \\"Avoid\\"; for example, one of the recommendations released in the first wave of the campaign was Don't order screening chest X-rays and ECGs for asymptomatic or low risk outpatients.Canadian Association of Radiologists. Medical imaging primer with a focus on x-ray usage and safety [Internet]. [Cited 2014 Feb 15]. Available from: http://www.car.ca/uploads/standards%20guidelines/20130128_en_guide_radiation_primer.pdf . National specialty societies are free to determine the process for generating their lists, as long as they are done in accordance with the following principles: # The development process is thoroughly documented and publicly available # Each recommendation is within the specialty's scope of practice (and not pertaining to other specialties such as family medicine) # Tests, treatments or procedures included are those that (a) are frequently used, and, (b) may expose patients to harm or stress. # Each recommendation is supported by evidence Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations are not intended to be used to establish payment and coverage decisions. Rather, the lists are meant to spur conversation about what is appropriate and necessary treatment. As each patient situation is unique, Choosing Wisely Canada recommends that its materials be used as guidelines for physicians and patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan together.Baron RJ, Wolfson D. Advancing medical professionalism and the choosing wisely campaign. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Mar 1;175(3):464-5. Patient education In order to encourage patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care, Choosing Wisely Canada uses patient-friendly materials with lay language to complement the lists of \\"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\\". These patient educational materials are meant to inform patients about the tests, treatments and procedures used within various medical specialties, when they may or may not be necessary, and what patients can do to improve their overall health.Wolfson D, Santa J, Slass L. Engaging physicians and consumers in conversations about treatment overuse and waste: a short history of the choosing wisely campaign. Acad Med. 2014 Jul;89(7):990-5. For example, one of the patient educational materials released on June 2, 2015, addressed concerns regarding the amount of bed rest required to treat lower back pain, advising that staying in bed longer than 48 hours will not help, and in fact, may actually delay recovery.Recommendations target overuse of unnecessary medical procedures. BCMJ, Vol. 57, No. 6, July, August 2015, page(s) 237‚Äì238. An editorial was written by Dr. Wendy Levinson in The Toronto Star as a part of the weekly feature titled \\"Doctor's Notes\\". The article highlighted the Choosing Wisely campaign and encouraged patients to engage in conversations with their physicians about unnecessary care.https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/10/why- that-medical-test-might-not-be-necessary.html Other campaign avenues Healthcare stakeholder groups have begun to mobilize around the CWC campaign at provincial and local levels. In Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, multi-stakeholder tables have been established to organize, coordinate and focus provincial implementation efforts. At the local level, hospitals, health regions and physician groups across the country are working under their own initiative to find innovative ways to put the recommendations into practice. Such local implementation efforts are beginning to emerge across Canada, with activities ranging from physician and patient education, to modifying clinical processes and information systems, to providing data back to providers about their practice patterns. Another major aspect of the campaign is engaging medical trainees at all levels. The Draft 2015 CanMEDS Framework identifies leadership as one of seven essential physician competencies, urging medical professionals to \\"engage in the stewardship of health care resources\\", particularly to \\"allocate health care resources for optimal patient care\\" and \\"to apply evidence and management processes to achieve cost-appropriate care\\".Frank, J. R., Snell, L., & Sherbino, J. (2014). The Draft CanMEDS 2015: Physician Competency Framework. Ottawa: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada In order to embody these ideals, CWC is working with Canadian medical schools to introduce new content focussing on resource stewardship into the undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education curricula. On the media front, the campaign includes partnerships with patient organizations and media outlets to develop and disseminate complementary content to increase patient awareness, and to support them in conversations surrounding inappropriate care. CWC has also developed a bilingual mobile app available on both Android and Apple platforms, which contains all physician recommendations and patient educational materials organized categorically.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.choosingwiselycanada.CWChttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choosing- wisely-canada/id933897108?mt=8 Examples Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations range from avoiding overuse of broad practices such as unnecessary and potentially harmful screening, diagnostic and radiographic services, to specific tests which are not supported by evidence to improve patient outcomes. Examples of recommendations which advise against overuse of broad practices include: * Don't perform routine cancer screening, or surveillance for a new primary cancer, in the majority of patients with metastatic disease.Mitera, G., Earle, C., Latosinsky, S., Booth, C., Bezjak, A., Desbiens, C., ... & Porter, G. (2015). Choosing Wisely Canada Cancer List: Ten Low-Value or Harmful Practices That Should Be Avoided In Cancer Care. Journal of Oncology Practice, 11(3), e296-e303. * Don't perform annual stress cardiac imaging or advanced non-invasive imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.Natarajan MK, Paul N, Mercuri M, Waller EJ, Leipsic J, Traboulsi M, et al. Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement on radiation exposure from cardiac imaging and interventional procedures. Can J Cardiol. 2013 Nov;29(11):1361-8. Examples of specific low-value tests to avoid in certain circumstances include: *Don't order serum testosterone in men without symptoms of hypogonadism.The Endocrine Society. Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes: An Endocrinology Society Clinical Practice Guideline [Internet]. 2010 [cited 2015 Jun 18]. Available from: http://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/FINAL- Androgens-in-Men-Standalone.pdf *Don't order thrombophilia testing in women with early pregnancy loss.Hicks, L. K., Bering, H., Carson, K. R., Haynes, A. E., Kleinerman, J., Kukreti, V., ... & Wood, W. A. (2014). Five hematologic tests and treatments to question. ASH Education Program Book, 2014(1), 599-603 Challenges Campaign leaders have identified a number of challenges which could potentially undermine the efforts of Choosing Wisely Canada. Since reducing unnecessary tests and procedures may result in lowering healthcare costs, the campaign may be viewed as a cost-cutting or rationing measure, which could in turn \\"undermine both physician engagement and patient trust.\\"Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74 Consequently, the campaign is centered around patient safety with particular emphasis on quality of care. Furthermore, Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations do not determine payment for individual services. Some physicians report feeling pressure to engage in defensive medicine (e.g., ordering more tests than necessary) because they feel that it will help them avoid litigation.Volpp, K. G., Loewenstein, G., & Asch, D. A. (2012). Choosing wisely: low-value services, utilization, and patient cost sharing. Jama, 308(16), 1635-1636. The Canadian healthcare system is also set up so that specialty physicians get paid for tests and procedures conducted, and not for practicing conservative medicine.Allin, S., & Rudoler, D. (2015). The Canadian Health Care System, 2014.International Profiles of Health Care Systems, 21. Such a system may create a pattern for physicians to recommend more treatment. This pattern may also contribute to unwilling of physicians to put recommendations on their lists pertaining specifically to their specialty, instead focusing their recommendations on overuse by other specialties. Evaluation of the campaign has also been identified as a major challenge. Campaign leaders concede that measuring the impact of Choosing Wisely is complex and may require multiple approaches, including physician and patient awareness of the campaign, documented curriculum inclusion in medical curricula, and demonstrated reduction in unnecessary testing following campaign efforts.Bhatia, R. S., Levinson, W., & Lee, D. S. (2014). Low value cardiac testing and Choosing Wisely. BMJ quality & safety, bmjqs-2014. Measuring progress of reduction in inappropriate care is particularly complex, since \\"the definition of appropriateness often includes knowing about symptoms and physical exam findings often not included in electronic health records and administrative databases\\". Recognizing the complexity of evaluation efforts, Choosing Wisely Canada along with other international Choosing Wisely movements is working with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to develop metrics that might be used to compare countries on specific measures of overuse, as well to develop cross-country metrics. Since patient education is a core facet of the campaign, communication with patients presents another challenge. Some campaign recommendations may require clinical education for complete comprehension.Brody H. Talking with patients about cost containment. J Gen Intern Med. 2014 Jan;29(1):5-6. Furthermore, many patients tend to follow physician recommendations without question, even if they have questions. As such, a major portion of the campaign focuses on encouraging patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care. Additionally, Choosing Wisely Canada has developed patient-friendly materials with straightforward, lay language to explain common tests, with a \\"When you need them and when you don't\\" approach. These materials complement the lists of \\"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question\\" developed by specialty societies. Reception The response to Choosing Wisely Canada has been positive, with physicians across the country expressing support for the campaign and highlighting the need for more resource stewardship. Dr. Danielle Martin, family physician and Vice-President Medical Affairs and Health Systems Solutions at Women's College Hospital, lists Choosing Wisely Canada as one of three major ideas to improve Canadian healthcare, highlighting that \\"Choosing Wisely Canada is not a rationing or cost-cutting exercising. It is about reorganizing healthcare services so we only do things for people that truly benefit their health.\\" Dr. Chris Simpson, past president of the Canadian Medical Association, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Cardiology at Queen's University, Kingston, notes \\"Physicians are really embracing the principles behind Choosing Wisely. It's all about the right thing to do for patients and avoiding the harm that can come from unnecessary testing. Let's do more of what works and‚Ä¶and less of what is done 'just in case'. Society expects us to lead the way, and the physicians of Canada intend to do just that\\". Dr. Rick Glazier, senior scientist in primary care and population health at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto, highlights two aspects of the campaign that he believes are unique and have great potential. \\"The first\\", he states, \\"is that it's targeted to the public, and the second is that it's driven not only by scientists and medical journals, but by the professional organizations themselves. For radiologists to come forward and say you shouldn't order radiology tests under these circumstances, this is unprecedented\\".Glauser W. Choosing Wisely campaign well received. CMAJ. 2014 May 13;186(8):E239-40. The final report of the Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation to Rona Ambrose, Minister of Health (Canada), saluted Choosing Wisely Canada \\"as an innovative physician-led and patient-centered approach that has the potential to shift healthcare away from a culture of consumption to a focus on appropriateness and quality of care\\". Furthermore, the panel urged \\"governments to support the implementation of [Choosing Wisely Canada] in all jurisdictions and to carefully evaluate its impact\\". In addition to endorsements from eminent physician leaders and professional organizations, Choosing Wisely Canada received positive media coverage in national media sources, including The Globe and Mail, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Toronto Star, which heralded Choosing Wisely Canada as one of the top medical breakthroughs of the year. On the other hand, early criticism of Choosing Wisely in the United States highlighted that some specialty recommendations addressed overuse of resources by primary care specialties, instead of addressing unnecessary tests and procedures conducted by their own specialty colleagues.Morden, N. E., Colla, C. H., Sequist, T. D., & Rosenthal, M. B. (2014). Choosing wisely‚Äîthe politics and economics of labeling low-value services.New England Journal of Medicine, 370(7), 589-592 Choosing Wisely Canada responded to such criticisms by setting guidelines for its list development, which required recommendations put forward by specialty societies to pertain specifically to the specialty's scope of practice. Many physician bloggers assert that most medical overuse is a result of practicing defensive medicine in an effort to avoid lawsuits. Others recognize the noble goal of reducing overuse and harm, but lament that the lists are too simplistic and do not necessarily advance the identification of low-value care, but merely synthesize \\"agreed-upon, well-established practices\\".Siemens DR, Finelli A. Choosing Wisely Canada: It's our turn. Can Urol Assoc J. 2014 Jul;8(7-8):E580-1. A critique of the Choosing Wisely campaign published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Clement and Charlton highlights a number of shortcomings in the overall movement. While the critique commends the campaign for succeeding in its goal of promoting conversations about low- value care, the authors of the critique believed that the process of list development were based on \\"quasi-systematic methods that focus on physician participation to increase support\\".Clement, F., & Charlton, B. (2015). Challenges in Choosing Wisely's international future: support, evidence, and burnout. JAMA Internal Medicine,175(4), 644-645 The critique additionally called for increased evidence of the efficacy of the \\"Top Five\\" lists in terms of reduction in wasteful practices. Clement and Charlton furthermore warn of \\"Top Five List Burnout\\", noting that when faced with multiple guidelines on a single topic, physicians become confused regarding which protocol to follow. In spite of these criticisms, Clement and Charlton \\"strongly believe in the global spirit behind the Choosing Wisely campaigns and movement\\" and \\"advocate that the priority in 2015 should be thoughtful implementation and rigorous evaluation of existing top five lists\\". Impact Choosing Wisely Canada has identified a multifaceted evaluation approach to measure its impact, which includes: *Physician attitudes and self-reported experience (through physician surveys) *Patient receptiveness to campaign messages *Reduction in ordering of low-value tests and procedures *Implementation in medical education Evaluation of campaign impact on patient education and receptiveness included a randomized control trial entitled EMPOWER (Eliminating Medications Through Patient Ownership of End Results), led by Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, geriatrician and Professor in the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy at the Universit√© de Montr√©al.Tannenbaum C, Martin P, Tamblyn R, Benedetti A, Ahmed S. Reduction of inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions among older adults through direct patient education: the EMPOWER cluster randomized trial. JAMA Intern Med. 2014 Jun;174(6):890-8. The trial recruited more than 300 patients aged 65‚Äì95 years in the greater Montr√©al area who were long term users of benzodiazepines. Approximately half the patients were exposed to educational intervention, which included Choosing Wisely recommendations around excessive benzodiazepine therapy. The patients were then followed for 6 months. The study found that 62% of patients who received the intervention initiated conversation regarding benzodiazepine therapy discontinuation with physicians and/or pharmacists. After six months, 27% of the intervention group had stopped taking benzodiazepines, compared with 5% of the patients who did not receive the educational intervention. The impact of Choosing Wisely Canada on test ordering and utilization was studied at the North York General Hospital in the Greater Toronto Area, one of the early adopters of the campaign. A multi- faceted campaign was implemented particularly in the hospital Emergency Department in June, 2014. Test utilization in the Emergency Department was analyzed between September 15 and November 21, 2014, and compared to the same 10-week period in 2013 to account for any seasonal variances. The study found a 41% decline in the number of laboratory tests ordered pre- and post- CWC program implementation, without any observable change in outcomes. A preliminary cost analysis revealed annual departmental savings of approximately $215,000 while maintaining the same quality of care. A quality improvement initiative based on CWC principles was launched under the supervision of Dr. Danielle Martin at the Women's College Hospital (WCH) in Toronto. The American Thyroid Association and Choosing Wisely Canada recommends testing only Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels rather than testing both TSH and free thyroid hormones (such as T4) for assessment of suspected hypothyroidism, since majority of patients with hypothyroidism will present with abnormal TSH levels. A baseline audit at Women's College Hospital revealed that 60% of all free thyroid hormones tests were performed in patients who had normal TSH levels, amounting to approximately $50,000 annually in additional laboratory testing expenditure.Gilmour, J., Weisman, A., Vecchiarelli, J., Orlov, S., Goldberg, R. J., & Goldberg, A. (2015). THR-191: Reducing Inappropriate Thyroid Function Tests at an Academic Ambulatory Hospital: Baseline Assessment for a Quality Improvement Initiative. A \\"Reflex T4\\" approach was implemented at WCH, wherein free T4 tests would not be conducted unless TSH levels are abnormal, or if there are clinical indications of situations when measurement of free thyroid hormones would be necessary. When it is found that TSH levels are abnormal, free T4 levels would then be automatically measured. In addition to reducing inappropriate thyroid function testing, the impact of Choosing Wisely Canada is felt through numerous physician and patient awareness campaigns conducted at the hospital. Medical education efforts of CWC are currently centered at the University of Toronto, where Choosing Wisely principles are integrated into the undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula through Problem-Based Learning seminars, lectures, resident research projects and academic half days.Leon-Carlyle, M., & Srivastava, R. (2014). Medicine's Push for Resource Stewardship in Education and Practice. University of Toronto Medical Journal,92(2). Following the example of Choosing Wisely in the United States and Choosing Wisely Canada, health leaders from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, and Wales have committed to initiating similar campaigns revolving around medical stewardship and low-value care in their respective countries. Italy has integrated the principles of Choosing Wisely in a campaign called \\"Doing more does not mean doing better\\", and the Netherlands has launched \\"Choosing Wisely Netherlands\\", both contributing to a growing international Choosing Wisely movementLevinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74.

His residence continued in Waterbury, with the exception of a brief period (about 1859) during which he was an assistant editor of the Daily Register in New Haven. He represented Waterbury several times in the Connecticut Legislature, was for three terms Mayor of the city, and through his life an active democratic politician. In 1870 he was nominated for US Congress, but was not elected. He died in Waterbury, May 27, 1877, being on that day 52 years of age. He had been confined to his house for several weeks by rheumatism, which so seriously affected the bones of one leg that an operation was performed and some pieces of the bone removed. Afterwards an artery in the leg burst, and he lived but a few hours. In October, 1849, he was married to Miss Marian Mair, of Waterbury, who survived him with two of their three children. One son graduated Yale in 1872.

Biography  The brother of actress Erin O'Brien- Moore, Ainsworth O‚ÄôBrien-Moore attended Harvard School in Los Angeles and studied classics at Princeton University, where he received his Bachelor's degree in 1916, his Master's degree in 1918 and his Ph. D. in 1922. He worked as instructor in Latin at Princeton and in 1923 at Brown University. From 1925 he was assistant professor of classics at Yale, and was appointed associate professor in 1936. At age 39, O'Brien-Moore was killed in a car accident near New Haven, Connecticut, in the early morning hours of December 31, 1936. Injured in the crash was his wife, the former Margaret M. O'Donnell, who was driving the car. The couple had a son, Michael. O'Brien-Moore's scholarship covered different areas of Roman literature and culture. As a graduate student he collaborated with his supervisor David Magie in editing and translating the Scriptores Historiae Augustae for the Loeb Classical Library. His thesis was an examination of the phenomenon of insanity as it was perceived and described by ancient Greek and Roman authors. While being limited to canon authors without taking in account parodistic or medical treatises, his work was an enormous effort and advanced knowledge of this field significantly. In Germany it was praised by the classicist and religious studies scholar Otto Weinreich.Deutsche Literaturzeitung, Vol. 48 (1927), col. 2297‚Äì2299 = Ausgew√§hlte Schriften. Vol. 2 (1973), p. 242‚Äì245. As an expert on various aspects of Roman culture, Moore was invited by Wilhelm Kroll to write articles for the internationally renowned Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft on the Roman Senate and the Senatus consultum. He was life member of the American Philological Association (since 1923).

USDA Plants Profile. it is native to northern and central Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it is cultivated for fodder. It was introduced elsewhere and it is now cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world for this purpose. Description Para grass is a vigorous, semi-prostrate perennial grass with creeping stolons which can grow up to long. The stems have hairy nodes and leaf sheaths and the leaf blades are up to wide and long. It roots at the nodes and detached pieces of the plant will easily take root in moist ground. The flower-head is a loose panicle up to long with spreading branches. The paired spikelets are arranged in uneven rows and are elliptical and long. The rachis is tinged with purple. Although many flower-heads grow, only a few viable seeds are produced, and propagation is usually by vegetative means.Urochloa mutica. USDA Forest Service Weed of the Week. Para grass can be distinguished from the closely related tanner grass (Brachiaria arrecta) by its paired spikelets, tanner grass having single spikelets. Distribution and habitat Para grass is native to northern and central Africa and parts of the Middle East. It was introduced into Central America but has largely been superseded there by other species of Brachiaria. It was also introduced into the humid, tropical parts of Australia around 1880 and has become widely naturalised in Queensland. By a few decades later it had become naturalised in much of southern Asia and on many Pacific islands, but is confined to its preferred habitat of poorly drained, swampy land. Along with tanner grass, it is planted as a fodder grass in seasonally flooded or swampy habitats, and in ponds in pastures, but it can block irrigation ditches and drains. When used as forage for cattle it is usually controlled by the action of the animals, so it does not become too weedy. When it grows in other habitats, however, it can become noxious. It is aggressive and can form dense stands. It may also have allelopathic effects on other plants, preventing their growth.Urochloa mutica. Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, University of Florida. This species may have been introduced to the Americas on slave ships, on which it was used for bedding. It was in South America by the early 1800s and Mexico by 1872. It was introduced to Florida by the late 1870s to be used as fodder. It has since escaped cultivation in many areas and it now grows as a widespread weed. It is sensitive to frost so it generally does not persist outside warm regions. Uses Para grass is mainly cultivated to feed livestock as it makes a high quality forage for ruminant animals.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Sauvant D., Lebas F., 2018.

Discovery Quarry where the holotype was excavated In 2010, Canadian fossil hunter Wendy Sloboda found a centrosaurine bonebed in the Pinhorn Provincial Grazing Reserve south of the Milk River, County of Forty Mile No. 8, Alberta. In 2011, a team of the Royal Tyrrell Museum explored the site and began excavating fossils. Next year, a deep overburden was removed. In 2013 and 2014, numerous fossils were discovered. In 2015, paleontologists David Evans and Michael Ryan named and described the type species Wendiceratops pinhornensis. The generic name combines a reference to Wendy Sloboda with a Latinised Greek ~ceratops, \\"horn face\\". The specific name refers to the provenance from the Pinhorn Reserve. Wendiceratops was the second ceratopsian discovered and named in 2015. The discovery of this new horned dinosaur species - starting from the ground in Alberta, through scientific study and restoration, all the way to its eventual reconstruction and public display in The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) - was captured in the HISTORY series and companion website Dino Hunt Canada.http://dinohuntcanada.history.ca/ The holotype, TMP 2011.051.0009, was found in a layer of the Oldman Formation, dating from the Campanian. The layer of mudstone, thick and probably deposited in a single event, has an upper possible age of 79 million years and a lower age of 78.7 million years. The holotype consists of a right parietal bone. Under the assumption that the bonebed contained only a single centrosaurine species, all additional centrosaurine material was referred to Wendiceratops pinhornensis, for a total of 184 specimens representing several individuals, including juveniles. The bones comprise elements from the skull, lower jaws, vertebral column, shoulder girdle, pelvis and limbs. They are largely disarticulated. In addition to the Wendiceratops bones, remains were found of tyrannosaurid theropods, crocodiles, gars and plants. Description Restoration Size and distinguishing traits Wendiceratops weighed about one ton and had a length of about . The describing authors indicated two unique traits, or autapomorphies: On the rear rim of the neck frill, the second and third epiparietals, which are skin ossifications attached to the rim, have a wide base, are vertically thick and curve obliquely upwards to the front, overhanging the rear and outer side branches of the parietal bone. The ischium has an expanded rectangular lower end. Wendiceratops is further distinguished by the presence of an erect nose horn, and the lack of a vertical spike on the rear frill. The Chinese Sinoceratops has similar epiparietals, but in addition a central midline epiparietal and bumps below the epiparietals, which are lacking in Wendiceratops. Skeleton Rostral and nasal bones The maxilla, the upper jaw bone, of Wendiceratops had at least twenty-six tooth positions, in each of which several teeth were stacked to form a tooth battery. No orbital horns have been found. The nasal bone bore a vertical nasal horn. The exact size and profile of this horn are unknown but one broken specimen has a height of and a base length of . Contact facets with the prefrontal bone suggest that the horn was located just in front of the eye sockets. Parietal bone The skull frill of Wendiceratops was broad. The front side of the frill was formed by the squamosal bone which had a rectangular shape. To its edge four skin ossifications or osteoderms were attached, the episquamosals. They had an asymmetrical triangular shape. Uniquely, they curled upwards. From the position of the fourth, frontmost, episquamosal a relatively high ridge was running to the inside, adorned with three substantial bumps. In cross-section, this ridge gave the squamosal the typical \\"stepped\\" centrosaurine profile. The rear of the frill consisted of the rounded parietal bones. They too had osteoderms attached to their edges, in this case called epiparietals. Each parietal had five of them, conventionally numbered \\"p1\\" to \\"p5\\". The fifth and fourth epiparietals, the ones in front, resembled the episquamosals. However, more to the back the epiparietals became increasingly wider, longer and thicker, curving upwards and to the front. This resulted in the first epipariatal becoming tongue-shaped and overhanging a large part of the frill, slightly pointing outwards. In this area the frill edge continued the curvature of these osteoderms, concavely curling upwards. Close to the edge two paired large openings were present, the parietal fenestrae. As no complete frill has been found, their exact form is uncertain but they probably were shaped like transversely oriented ovals. These openings were separated by a broad bone bar which featured a midline ridge that was rather smooth, not adorned by bumps. The bar ended at a gentle embayment of the frill rear edge. This lacked a central epiparietal or \\"p0\\". Whereas centrosaurine species each possessed a unique pattern of frill ornamentation, their postcranial skeleton, the parts of the body behind the skull, was very conservative, i.e. it showed little variation. Accordingly, the describers could find little of distinction among the Wendiceratops postcranial bones. An exception was the ischium. In other centrosaurines this pelvic bone had, in side view, the widest point of its shaft at midlength. The ischium of Wendiceratops however, grew wider towards its lower end, resulting in a generally rectangular shape. Though most specimens were robust, apparently of adult individuals, some bones were of juveniles. Two shinbones were found with a length of just twenty centimetres. Classification Reconstruction of the parietal bones of Wendiceratops and other centrosaurines Reconstructed skeleton Wendiceratops was placed in the Centrosaurinae, as a sister species to Sinoceratops. Their clade formed a \\"comb\\" or polytomy with Albertaceratops, another centrosaurine from the same formation, and the clade of the more derived centrosaurines. Wendiceratops and Sinoceratops were more derived, higher in the evolutionary tree, than Xenoceratops. Their nevertheless in general rather basal position is in accordance with the high absolute age of Wendiceratops living only a million years later than the oldest known centrosaurines Xenoceratops and Diabloceratops. The latest phylogenetic analysis including Wendiceratops is reproduced below, after Chiba et al. (2017): The nose horn of Wendiceratops, erect but probably of moderate size, was by the describing authors seen as a transition between the low horns of earlier forms like Diabloceratops, Nasutoceratops and Albertaceratops and the much taller horns of derived centrosaurines such as Coronosaurus, Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus. This would imply that the also long vertical nasal horn of the Chasmosaurinae would have separately been developed in a process of parallel evolution, the second time such a horn would have evolved among the ceratopsids. Remarkably, the curled epiparietals of Wendiceratops resemble the osteoderms of two chasmosaurines: Vagaceratops and Kosmoceratops, though they differ from the latter in their saddle-shaped interspaces. Paleobiology Wendiceratops (center back) with other herbivores from the Oldman Formation Being found in the Oldman Formation, Wendiceratops shared its habitat with other dinosaurs such as Daspletosaurus, Paronychodon, Troodon, Albertaceratops, and Parasaurolophus. The authors pointed out that after the discovery of Wendiceratops, no less than five ceratopids are known from the lower Oldman or coeval North-American formations, in addition to Albertaceratops also Judiceratops, Medusaceratops and Avaceratops. They assumed this was made possible by ecological specialisations and also indicated a high faunal turnover, a quick succession of related species.

Description Fictional air pirates typically operate as pirates in the air, or, in general, the atmosphere of a planet, dwarf planet or moon, and travel by aircraft, as opposed to the more traditional pirates on the high seas, who travel by ship. However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target sailing ships, air pirates serve a similar role in science fiction and fantasy media: they capture and plunder aircraft and other targets for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal an entire aircraft, sometimes killing the crewmembers in the process. However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the story's setting, rather than their seafaring counterparts. On the other hand, air pirates may be modeled after stereotypical sea pirates. Some air pirates use airborne aircraft carriers as mobile bases from which to conduct raids. Air pirates made early appearances in novels, silent films, comics and pulp magazines, and have since appeared in a variety of media, including alternate history, steampunk, and dieselpunk works.

It started when supporters of candidate Adolfo Chirife attempted to forcefully restore the implementation of presidential elections canceled by President Eusebio Ayala. Chirife represented the so-called Constitutionalist or Schaererist side ideologically supporting liberal politician Eduardo Schaerer, while troops under Ayala were named Loyalists or Gondrists ideologically pledging allegiance to former President Manuel Gondra. The conflict concluded when Gondrist forces defeated the remnants of the Schaererist army in Asunci√≥n. Background In the aftermath of the 1904 revolution, the Paraguayan liberal movement entered a period of instability and factional fighting. Between 1904 and 1922, 15 Paraguayan presidents assumed office. The coups of 1908 and 1910 cemented the division of Paraguayan liberals into the \\"radicales\\" and \\"civicos\\" factions. A further split of the radicales faction into two sub-factions led by Manuel Gondra and Eduardo Schaerer respectively, gradually escalated into a full- scale civil war. In 1920, Gondra came out victorious in the presidential election. Schaerer immediately attempted to undermine Gondra by forcing the resignation of Interior Minister Jos√© Guggiari, Gondra's most vocal supporter. After Gondra's refusal to dismiss Guggiari, Gondra himself resigned, due to the emergence of a split in Paraguay's armed forces. After Vice President F√©lix Paiva's refusal to assume office, the congress placed senator Eusebio Ayala, a moderate Gondra supporter into interim presidency. Another crisis ensued when Adolfo Chirife, a supporter of Schaerer, became a presidential candidate. Amassing the support of the Colorado party along with a large percentage of supporters in the Liberal Party, Chirife gathered enough support to ensure a victory in the upcoming elections. When Ayala reacted by blocking implementation of the elections, Schaerer's supporters attempted to restore the electoral process by force. Conflict Troops belonging to the 1st, 2nd and 4th military zones totaling 1,700 men, united under the name of the Constitutional Army, declaring its loyalty to Schaerer. Opposing them, loyalist elements of the Paraguayan Navy and the wider Asunci√≥n area garrisons pledged allegiance to Gondra. On 27 May 1922, following the failure of two weeks of negotiations between the two sides, Adolfo Chirife ordered his military and civilian supporters in Paraguar√≠ to launch an offensive on the capital, thus beginning a civil war. Passing through Luque, the constitutionalists reached Asunci√≥n on June 9. By this time the Gondrists had mustered 600 regular soldiers as well as 1,000 members of the anarcho syndicalist Marine Workers Union. Despite enjoying limited success, the Schaererists were forced to abandon the siege of the barricaded suburbs and on June 14, battles took place in Piray√∫ and Yaguar√≥n as the Schaererists retreated to Paraguar√≠. Between 28 and 29 June 1922, a loyalist Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 conducted two raids on Paraguar√≠, first dropping pamphlets and then bombing the city. On 3 July, the same F.K.8 mistakenly bombed train wagons housing imprisoned soldiers who refused to join the Constitutionalist Army. Numerous prisoners were killed or injured in the action. On 8 July 1922, the F.K.8 was shot down over Piray√∫, and British pilot Sydney Stewart was killed. In the aftermath of the July 14 loss of Piray√∫ and Yaguar√≥n, Schaererists began evacuating their troops from Paraguar√≠ to Villarrica. Between 23 and 24 July, Loyalists overran Constitutionalist positions in Ybitim√≠ and Sapuca√≠. The Gondristas continued their advance, taking Itap√© and Salitre Cu√©, and finally entering Villarrica without firing a single shot on July 31. The town of San Estanislao changed hands several times as opposing cavalries skirmished in the area during early August. The Gondrista Air Force relocated to Villarrica. Reinforced with several Italian World War I veterans including ace Cosimo Damiano Rizzotto, it intensified its reconnaissance and bombing missions. On 5 September, a Constitutionalist Ansaldo SVA.5 bombed Salitre-Cu√©. A Gondrista aircraft of the same model then took off, piloted by British aviator Patrick Hassett, who fired at the bomber and forced it to retreat to Cang√≥, in an engagement that is considered to be the first recorded dogfight in South America. The following day another Constitutionalist SVA.5 attacked Salitre-cu√©, only to be forced down near Cang√≥ by Hassett after an intense dogfight, making him the first airmen to shoot down another aircraft over South America. Italian pilot Nicol√° Bo would also damage another rebel aircraft on the 25th of September, but was forced to return to Isla Alta after running out of ammunition.Adrian English. \\"La Guerra Civil Parguaya 1922‚Äì1923\\". Retrieved 20 October 2014. Fighting continued through late October and early November, as Isla Alta and Cang√≥ fell under Gondrist control. Schaererists entrenched themselves in the Ca√≠ Puente Coronel Bogado area 30 kilometers north west of Encarnaci√≥n. On 13 November, a loyalist detachment marched on Ca√≠ Puente, while a second column perpetrated a surprise attack on the Constitutionalist rearguard, capturing Carmen del Paran√°. Three days later Gondrists took the Schaererirst stronghold of Ca√≠ Puente, but many Constitutionalists managed to escape detention, reorganising and moving north towards the unprotected capital. Utilizing rail transport, the Gondrists halted the Schaererist advance, and after heavy fighting in Paraguar√≠, Piribebuy and Yh√∫, the defeated Gondrists fell back beyond Caraya√≥. On 18 March 1923, the Schaererists mounted their first attack in three months, seizing the under-protected Villarrica. The Constitutionalists then ambushed a 20-wagon supply convoy at Pa√±etey, killing almost 500 soldiers. On 18 May, after Schaererist commander-in-chief Adolfo Chirife died of pneumonia, newly elected commander Pedro Mendoza initiated an offensive on Asunci√≥n. Passing through the densely forested areas of Carapegu√°, It√° and San Lorenzo, Mendoza entered the capital on 9 July 1923 without encountering significant resistance. A day later Loyalists counterattacked the capital from the north, routing the Schaererists and effectively ending the war.

He played in the Belgian First Division for the teams of K.A.A. Gent, Cercle Brugge and R.S.C. Anderlecht and played 21 games for the national team of Belgium. After his playing career, he was also a coach. He is also the father of football manager Patrick Orlans. Career First Division Born in Ghent, Orlans joined K.A.A. Gent in 1946 at the age of 15 and played in all of the youth teams. In 1949 he debuted as a midfielder in the first team of the team. He acquired a place in the permanent team in the 1950‚Äì51 season and finished in second position in the league in 1955 and three times in third position (1954, 1957 and 1958). He remained a player until 1961. In between 1955 and 1958, the strongest era of K.A.A. Gent, Orlans played 21 games for the Belgium national team and scored five goals overall. His best game was on 3 June 1956 in the match against Hungary which was won 5‚Äì4. After 45 minutes, Hungary was winning 1‚Äì3, but in the second half, Belgium could come back and even win, with the third and fifth goals from Orlans. In the same year, Orlans finished second in the Belgian Golden Shoe vote, honouring the best player in competition. The winner was Vic Mees. In 1961 Orlans went to the newly promoted team of Cercle Brugge and managed to ensure remaining in the Belgian First Division. He played a good season and was selected for the national team two more times, but he never played for the team. The strong performances of Orlans for Cercle caught the eye of coach Sinibaldi of R.S.C. Anderlecht, and Orlans transferred to the Brussels team. In his first season, Orlans played a strong European campaign. In the 1962‚Äì63 European Cup he and Anderlecht reached the quarterfinals setting aside, among others, Real Madrid. In the next season, he was Belgian champion with the team. After this, he ended his time in the First Division. He played 320 games all together and scored 50 goals. Lower levels Later on, Orlans played at a lower level for the team of SK Roeselare in the Third Division (1964‚Äì1965). He performed as a player-coach for the team of Zwevegem Sport in the Third Division (1965‚Äì1969) and afterwards again at SK Roeselare (1969‚Äì71). After he obtained his coaching certificate at the coaching school at the Heizel in 1970, Orlans became a coach at AS Oostende in the Belgian Second Division (1971‚Äì1972), a job he did not complete, as he resigned. He left for Excelsior Moeskroen but could not prevent relegation to the Belgian Fourth Division. Orlans returned to Zwevegem Sport in the Fourth Division and acted as player-coach for two more seasons. (1972‚Äì1974) In 1974, Orlans became the coach of K.A.A. Gent, which in the meantime had fallen to the Belgian Third Division. In his first season, he helped the club win promotion to the Second Division, and he stayed for one year longer. In 1976 Orlans applied to succeed the national coach Raymond Goethals, but it was Guy Thys who became the new coach of the national team. After this, Orlans was coach of RRC Gent for two more seasons in the Fourth Division, and he shortly became the national coach of Zaire in 1982.

An author committed to the norms of science should use mathematical reasoning to clarify his analyses. By contrast, \\"mathiness\\" is not intended to clarify, but instead to mislead. According to Romer, some researchers use unrealistic assumptions and strained interpretations of their results in order to push an ideological agenda, and use a smokescreen of fancy mathematics to disguise their intentions.  Introduction of the term  The first usage of the term was at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in January 2015. Afterwards Paul Romer published his article Mathiness in the Theory of Economic Growth in the American Economic Review. The coinage mathiness follows the pattern of truthiness coined by comedian Stephen Colbert.BloombergView, Noah Smith, How 'Mathiness' Made Me Jaded About Economics Romer warns that mathiness is distorting economics:Bloomberg, Justin Fox, What's Wrong With 'Mathiness' in Economics? He specifically points to some work by Edward C. Prescott, Robert Lucas, Jr., and Thomas Piketty, among others, and argues for a return to scientific rigor: Long before Romer, Hayek had condemned scientism, i.e. the abuse of mathematics in social science, in his 1974 Nobel Prize acceptance speech on \\"The Pretence of Knowledge\\", and in his 1942 essay \\"Scientism and the Study of Society\\", later published as The Counter-Revolution of Science.  Impact  Tim Harford draws a parallel to Politics and the English Language where George Orwell complained that politics prefers a rhetorical fog to the use of precise terms. Similarly the role of mathiness would be to hide unrealistic assumptions or pure hypothesis behind decorative math and therefore it is rather a case of politics than science. Justin Fox notes that, in his book Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics, Richard Thaler documented how economists ignored real world phenomena because they did not fit into mainstream mathematical models.BloombergView, Justin Fox, What's Wrong With 'Mathiness' in Economics?, 20.5.2015 J. Bradford DeLong argued that mathiness means \\"restricting your microfoundations in advance to guarantee a particular political result and hiding what you are doing in a blizzard of irrelevant and ungrounded algebra\\". He argues that this is what George Stigler did when he rejected the inclusion of monopolistic competition in his models because in his mind it was too intellectually dangerous. The notion of imperfect competition could give an opening to interventionist \\"planning\\" while being unaware of the magnitudes of potential government failure. Therefore, requiring that models assume perfect competition as a methodological principle was a \\"noble lie\\" to him. Paul Romer's problem is that he wants to analyze issues in which perfect competition is not leading forward but Prescott and Lucas are insisting on perfect competition as a methodological principle.J.

Goldstein (January 15, 1908 ‚Äì February 18, 1980) was a first generation Jewish-American scientist and engineer who was instrumental in the development and deployment of high-frequency direction finding by the United States Navy during the Second World War. High-frequency direction finding (known as huff-duff or HF/DF) played a significant role in the Allies efforts to counter the threat of German U-boats (submarines) during the Battle of the Atlantic. This success helped ensure the continued flow of equipment and supplies from the United States to Britain and to European battlefields, which was a critical factor in the ultimate Allied victory. Following World War II, Goldstein founded Balco Research Laboratory, which specialized in high resistance capacitors used in numerous military, civilian, and NASA projects. Early years Maxwell Goldstein was born on January 15, 1908, to Bessie and Louis Goldstein, Jewish immigrants from Warsaw. He grew up in Baltimore, MD, attending primary school at Clifton Park Junior High School and high school at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.‚ÄúHis Life,‚Äù Maxwell K.

During his time at Johns Hopkins, he established a reputation as being particularly skilled with practical solutions to technical problems, particularly with regards to radio technologies.Williams, Kathleen Broome.

In 1939, he joined the Naval Research Laboratory.\\"Maxwell K. Goldstein,\\" Engineering and Technology History Wiki, accessed October 2, 2015, http://ethw.org/Maxwell_K._Goldstein World War II When World War II began, Goldstein led the Naval Research Laboratory's Radio Direction Finder section. He also served as one of three members of the Navy Department's Direction Finder Board and was the naval representative on the National Defense Research Committee for Radio Direction Finders. After the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Goldstein's team was tasked with finding a solution to the problem of installing HF/DF systems on navy ships.Williams (1996) The Battle of the Atlantic and the U-boat threat By early 1942, German U-Boats, operating in squadrons called \\"Wolfpacks,\\" were sinking hundreds of thousands of tons of Allied shipping each month. These losses were a serious threat to the Allied ability to transport equipment and supplies from the U.S. to England and to European battlefields. Allied naval forces implemented a number of countermeasures, including the use of convoys, early radar sets, and decrypted radio intercepts (through the Ultra program), but despite these tactics and tools, the tonnage lost to enemy submarines remained high. The Allies were aware of one potential opportunity that could be exploited if the technical means could be found. The U-boat wolfpacks were under the direct command of GrossAdmiral Karl D√∂nitz, the German naval commander in chief. A former submariner with service in World War I, D√∂nitz insisted on personally guiding the submarine war, requiring his submarine captains to report in to him directly, often multiple times per day. A High Frequency Direction Finding system could determine the point of origin of such transmissions; the high level of radio traffic between the U-boat commanders and D√∂nitz's headquarters would provide the Allies with ample opportunities to use HF/DF to detect the wolfpacks and determine their locations and bearings.Wise, Mark E., and Jak P. Mallmann Showell. \\"Deciphering the U-Boat War: The Role of Intelligence in the Capture of U-505.\\" Hunt and Kill: U-505 and the U-boat War in the Atlantic. Ed. Theodore P. Savas. New York, NY: Savas Beatie, 2004. 95-124 High frequency direction finding High Frequency Direction Finding uses a radio receiver to determine the direction and strength of a radio wave sent by a transmitter. By triangulating the measurements of two or more such receivers, a HF/DF system can then determine the location of the transmitter. In naval applications, HF/DF enables a system of receivers (mounted on shore installations or on several ships, as in a convoy) to detect radio transmissions sent by potential threats (other ships, submarines or aircraft) and to determine their location and bearing. This information then allows the force deploying the receivers to take appropriate countermeasures.\\"Direction finder.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Accessed October 4, 2015. http://www.britannica.com/technology/direction- finder#ref841718 Prior to World War II, both the British and the U.S. had installed shore-based Direction Finding (D/F) installations, and had begun the process of developing and deploying HF/DF systems. Although these shore-based systems were useful for detecting enemy vessels and aircraft operating close to shore, there was a clear need for a system that could be deployed on ships operating out on ocean.\\"Direction finder.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The U.S. HF/DF effort was based on a system invented by Dr. Henri Busignies a French engineer at ITT who had escaped Nazi-occupied France in late 1940. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, the U.S. Navy accelerated development of shipboard HF/DF. By early 1942, U.S. engineers at the Naval Research Laboratory and ITT, building on Busignies' work, had developed a shipboard HF/DF system designated \\"DAQ\\".Williams (1996).\\"Le Groupe ITT pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.\\" Accessed November 15, 2015. http://siteedc.edechambost.net/CSF/ITT_Seconde_Guerre_mondiale.html Solving the HF/DF problem Although the new DAQ HF/DF system worked well in shore- based testing and was theoretically sound, it did not function correctly when installed on ships, giving false positives and ambiguous location readings. Goldstein was tasked to devise a solution to this problem for both Navy and Coast Guard vessels.Naval Research Laboratory (U.S.). \\"Report of NRL Progress\\", Naval Research Laboratory., 1973. p.56Blair, Clay. Hitler's U-boat War: The Hunters, 1939-1942. New York: Random House, 1996. p. 477 Goldstein determined that the ship's own structure and electronic equipment was causing the interference, and devised a practical solution. First, to provide the clearest possible access to transmitted radio waves, the HF/DF receiver antenna was placed at the highest point of the ship's mast, receiving priority over even the radar apparatus. Secondly, Goldstein developed a detailed testing and calibration protocol through which every individual HF/DF system was carefully customized to account for the structure, layout and electronics of the specific ship into which it was being installed.Williams (1996). This calibration procedure was carried out in port, by having a small craft circle around the HF/DF-equipped vessel while transmitting its bearings on the frequencies employed by German submarines, and matching the transmitted data against the DAQ HF/DF reading.Saladin, James. \\"World War II 'Huff Duffers'\\".

In June 1942, the navy began equipping half of all new-construction destroyers and destroyer-escorts with HF/DF systems.Williams (1996), 137 This breakthrough paid immediate dividends: between July 1942 and May 1943 Allied direction finders managed to divert 105 (out of 174) North Atlantic convoys away from wolf-pack ambushes, and enabled another 23 partially to avoid such traps.\\"The U-boat War, The Climax, July 1942-May 1943\\", Military History Online, accessed October 4, 2015, http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/climax.aspx The Allied use of a full suite of technical innovations (including direction finding, radar and Ultra signals decryption) to help anticipate, avoid, and strike back against the U-Boat threat decisively turned the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic. On November 1943, stating, \\"The enemy holds every trump card... knows all our secrets and we know none of his\\" Admiral Donitz permanently abandoned wolf-pack tactics, leaving individual U-Boats to operate on their own. This shift in tactics relegated U-Boats to little more than a harassment role, and signaled the end of German offensive operations in the Atlantic.\\"The U-boat War, The Bitter End, July 1942-May 1943\\", Military History Online, accessed October 4, 2015, http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/bitterend.aspx Recognition On July 5, 1946, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal presented Goldstein with the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award (the highest civilian honor the U.S. Navy can bestow upon a civilian employee), stating: Goldstein also received the Washington Academy of Science's 1949 award for Electrical Engineering for young scientists in recognition of his wartime work at the Naval Research Laboratory.Awards History, Washington Academy of Science.

The series' lead character John Stratton is played by Dominic Cooper, while the rest of the cast includes Gemma Chan, Austin Stowell, Tyler Hoechlin, and Tom Felton. Principal photography on the film began on 15 July 2015 in Brindisi, Italy. The film was released in the UK on 1 September 2017.  Plot  After a failed mission to destroy an Iranian bioweapon, British Special Boat Service operator Sergeant John Stratton, working for the Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland, tracks down the terrorist cell who used the mission as cover to steal the weapon for their own purposes. Due to the failed mission Stratton suspects a mole. His boss Sumner recognizes the terrorist leader as Grigory Barovsky, a Russian spy, presumed dead for nearly twenty years. They learn a bomb maker has developed a drone system to disperse the bioweapon, and track the terrorists to Rome. There is a speedboat chase with heavy gunfire, before the final action sequence, which takes place in London with the poison device loaded onto a British double-decker bus (so as to blend in), configured to automatically deploy through an opening cut into the bus's roof once it arrives at a location preprogrammed into the device's firmware.  Cast   Production  On 3 November 2014 it was announced that Henry Cavill would next star in the action thriller film Stratton, to be produced by his own banner Promethean Productions, Amber Entertainment, and GFM Films. It would be based on Duncan Falconer's eight-novel series of the same name, featuring the lead character John Stratton, an SBS soldier working for the Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland. The film, produced by Ileen Maisel and Lawrence Elman, who also bought the film rights to the novel, would be set in Southern Italy, Rome and London. On 25 February 2015 Simon West was hired to direct the film, which was fully financed by GFM Films. Five days before the filming was set to begin, Cavill exited the film due to creative differences with the script. Later it was announced that Dominic Cooper would take over the title role. Other cast members include Gemma Chan, Austin Stowell, Tyler Hoechlin, and Tom Felton. More cast was announced by Screen Daily, which included Thomas Kretschmann, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen and Jake Fairbrother. According to Hardman & Co. the budget for Stratton was ¬£12.9m and Ober Private Clients assisted GFM in the financing of this film through an EIS fund raise. The 30 June 2017 confirmation statement for Stratton Film Productions Limited filed at the UK's Companies House suggests EIS investors contributed ¬£3,358,000 towards financing the film. Accounts filed at UK's Companies House disclose the production of the film was partly financed with a ¬£7.5m loan from GFM films. According to Hardman & Co. HMRC contributed ¬£2m to producing the film with tax credit subsidies.  Filming  Principal photography on the film began on 15 July 2015 in Brindisi, Lecce, Squinzano and Casalabate, Italy, and then the shooting would move to Rome and then to London. Filming was previously set to begin on 2 June, but was rescheduled after Cavill left the film.  Reception   Box office  Stratton was released in UK cinemas on 1 January 2017. As at 1 September 2017, the film had generated $70,917 gross receipts (ticket sales) at the UK box office and $95,743 worldwide.  Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, Stratton has an approval rating of 0% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 3.23/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Stratton's action-thriller ambitions are roundly thwarted by a derivative story, misguided casting, and a low-budget feel underscored by unimpressive set pieces.\\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on reviews from 10 critics. Kim Newman of Empire gives the film 2 out of 5. \\"Dialogue is all-clich√©, a decent cast get not much to go on [...], and even the action scenes have a rushed, unfinished feel.\\" Newman praises Chan as \\"the standout player\\".

The comic depicts American sailors interacting with a pin-up style Japanese woman named Babysan. The title comes from the word \\"baby\\" an affectionate term Americans use and \\"san\\" which is an honorary term used by the Japanese. It translates literally to Miss Baby. The comic became incredibly popular with United States service members in Japan by mixing good humor with culture, language, and sex. Babysan attempted to show some of the give and take between American and Japanese cultures during the occupational era. Anything but political, the comic plays on misunderstanding and sexuality. \\"I didn't invent Babysan, I just reported life as it was.\\" History Bill Hume was a member of the U.S Navy during World War II (1942‚Äì1945). He left the Navy in 1945 and married. In 1951, he was recalled to be part of the occupying force in Japan. Hume served as a petty officer in charge of maintaining good order and discipline and was also the editor of the station newspaper, The Oppaman. Through his observations of life in Japan, the effects American sailors were having on the culture, and the effects the Japanese culture was having on the sailors Hume created Babysan, originally a pinup poster, to help boost morale. Babysan became a hit with the sailors of Fleet Airforce Service Squadron 120 and this popularity spread to the Navy Times and finally to the United States when servicemen began returning home. Hume returned to the United States in 1952, teamed up with John Annarino, and four books based on Babysan were published shortly after. Content Babysan gave a view of post-war Japan from the eyes of an American servicemember. Their love of American movies, American dance, and western clothing comes in stark contrast to the society of the recent past. Bill Hume rarely, if ever, depicts Japanese men in his comics and these cultural changes may or may not have impacted them at the time but when the Japanese women began adopting them. the American servicemen felt more relaxed and accepting. Although naive and innocent the character of Babysan was able to teach Americans a little bit about customary practices such as taking off shoes before entering a house, the hibatchi, the kimono, food, and money. It also included common Japanese words and a rudimentary explanation of writing even though some arrogant American sailors already seemed to know it all. In addition to entertaining the troops, Babysan also provided a glimpse of what to expect and how they might be perceived in their new home. This semi-pornographic comic often featured Babysan partially nude and flirting. In one comic, she reminded creator Bill Hume that \\"Japanese girls like to wear clothes, too.\\" Servicemen may have imagined Cio-Cio San in Puccini's Madame Butterfly as the typical Japanese girl but what they got was instead was Babysan. This Japanese woman was self-motivated with her own problems and desires. Tight fitting clothing, blunt talk, and comfort with nudity made Babysan irresistible to servicemen of every rank and when they got jealous they accused her of \\"butterflying\\". This term meant being unfaithful but Babysan never accepted this description, she would disagree in her broken English and say that she had not butterflied, she had changed her mind. Babysan also desired money. She goes from one serviceman to another flirting asking questions like \\"Why you all time bring candy- why never bring okane(money)?\\"(33) or \\"Why never have liberty on payday?\\". (83) This was not prostitution however. It was payment for services to be sure but \\"Babysan never forgot the acts of kindness on the part of the American. She decided...to devote herself to the part of the American...There wasn't much sense in restricting her charms to one.\\" She entertained them with her beauty, her femininity, her charm, and her energy. And unlike Cio-Cio San, Babysan was not upset when Americans left for home, as she was waving goodbye to them she was already looking towards the future and another serviceman. Impact Babysan made light of the tumultuous situation in Japan during the 1940s and 50s. Although not intended to be a textbook on Japanese custom and tradition Hume's works certainly contained elements of both. These were combined with some of the charming things in Japan, including the most charming thing to the United States servicemen according to Hume, the Japanese girl. Babysan disarmed the sailors and soldiers with her beauty and ability to adopt new things and through her they were able to enjoy the food, the language, and the culture during their short tours in Japan. It is not a widely known work but among many in the field, it is highly respected.

He usually led from the start of his races and was best at distances of around one mile. Bred and owned by Sheikh Mohammed and trained in England by David Loder he showed promising form as a two-year-old in 1996, winning on his debut and finishing third and fourth against better opposition in his other two races. In the following year he finished fourth in the 2000 Guineas before recording Group One victories in the Prix Jean Prat and the St James's Palace Stakes, beating a particularly strong field in the latter race. Later that summer he finished second in the Sussex Stakes and fourth in the Prix Jacques Le Marois. He moved to the Godolphin stable in 1998 but his form deteriorated and he failed to win in three races. After he retired from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in France and had some success as a sire of winners. Background Starborough was a \\"well-made, medium-size\\" chestnut horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind leg bred in England by his owner Sheikh Mohammed. He was sired by Soviet Star, an outstanding sprinter-miler whose wins included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Sussex Stakes, Prix de la For√™t, July Cup and Prix du Moulin. Soviet Star later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring major winners including Freedom Cry (Prix d'Harcourt), Starcraft, Ashkalani (Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Moulin), Soviet Line, Limpid (Grand Prix de Paris) and Pressing (Premio Roma). Starborough's dam Flamenco Wave was a lightly-raced but high-class racehorse who won the Moyglare Stud Stakes in 1988. She was even better as a broodmare producing several other winners including Aristotle and Ballingarry. She was one of many good horses descended from the American broodmare Fleet Flight: others have included Almutawakel and White Muzzle. The colt was initially sent into training with David Loder at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1996: two-year-old season On 23 August 1996 Starborough made his racecourse debut in a six furlong maiden race at Thirsk Racecourse, and started the 2/5 favourite against nine opponents. Ridden by Kevin Darley, he led from the start and won easily by three lengths from Indian Blaze. Two weeks later he was moved up in class and started favourite for the Listed Sirenia Stakes at Kempton, but finished third to the filly Arethusa. On his final appearance of the year he contested the Group Three Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury in October and finished fourth, just over a length behind the winner Desert Story. 1997: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Starborough started 4/5 favourite for the Thirsk Classic Trial over one mile on 19 April. Darley sent him into the lead from the start and he stayed on strongly to win by two lengths from Intikhab with the only other runner Caviar Royale four lengths back in third. Two weeks later, the colt started a 33/1 outsider for the Classic 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. He led the sixteen-runner field until be overtaken approaching the last quarter mile and held on to finish fourth behind Entrepreneur, Revoque and Poteen. Starborough was sent to France for his next race, the Group One Prix Jean Prat over 1800 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 1 June. He started the 2/1 second favourite behind the Andr√© Fabre-trained Kirkwall, the winner of the Prix de Guiche, with the other three runners being Visionary (Prix Matchem, third in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) Cirino and Mamalik. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori, he led from the start and was driven out to win by one and a half lengths from Mamalik with Kirkwall a short head away in third. Two weeks later the colt was brought back in distance for the 152nd running of the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot, and was again partnered by Dettori. Desert King started favourite ahead of Daylami and Poteen, with Starborough next in the betting on 11/2. The other runners included Mamalik, Air Express (Premio Parioli, Mehl-M√ºlhens-Rennen), In Command (Dewhurst Stakes) and Running Stag (runner-up in the Predominate Stakes). Starborough took the lead from the start as usual and set a strong pace from Mamalik and Running Stag. He maintained his advantage into the straight and held off a challenge from Air Express to win by a length, with Daylami four lengths back in third ahead of Desert King. After the race Dettori said \\"He has got a very high cruising speed and there were some horses out there with a greater turn of foot so I wanted to take the sting out of them\\", whilst Loder commented \\"we decided to just let him roll and, as you can see, when he gets going he's got a pretty ferocious roll\\". On 30 July, Starborough was matched against older horses for the first time when he was ridden by Pat Eddery (Dettori was suspended) in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and started the 9/4 favourite. He led until the last quarter mile but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three-quarters of a lengths by the four-year-old Ali-Royal. The other beaten horses included Allied Forces (Queen Anne Stakes), Among Men, Air Express and Alhaarth. In August he was sent to France again and started favourite for the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse. After leading for most of the way he faded in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Spinning World, Daylami and Neuilly. 1998: four-year-old season In the winter of 1997/8, Starborough was transferred to the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin Racing organisation and removed from Loder's stable to be trained by Saeed bin Suroor. On his first appearance of 1998 he was sent to Hong Kong for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup over ten furlongs at Sha Tin Racecourse on 19 April and finished sixth, two lengths behind the locally trained winner Oriental Express. On his return to Europe, the colt made a second attempt to win the Sussex Stakes. Ridden by Dettori he led until the last three furlongs before finishing fourth of the ten runners behind Among Men. Godolphin's spokesman Simon Crisford commented \\"He certainly hasn't been showing the form we know he is capable of producing, and fourth place... was as good as we could expect\\". Starborough was then dropped in class to contest the Celebration Mile over the same course and distance a month later but after leading in the early stages he finished seventh behind the John Gosden-trained Muhtathir. Stud record Starborough was retired from racing and stood as a breeding stallion at the Haras de la Reboursiere et de Montaigu in France at an initial fee of ‚Ç£35,000. He died in December 2006 at the age of twelve, after suffering complications from leg surgery. The best of his offspring was probably the Hungarian-trained sprinter Overdose. Other good winners were Whortleberry (Premio Lydia Tesio, Prix Jean Romanet), Appel au Maitre (Stockholm Cup International) and Star Valley (Prix de Meautry).

Jean-Ren√© moves to Paris to be with Violette and meets her young adult son, Eloi, who still goes by the babyish name Lolo. Lolo is a self-professed artist, and his mother supports him utterly. He appears to welcome his mother's new love; but sets out to wreak havoc in their relationship. Lolo, a moocher who requires his mother's universe to be centred on him, ups his game when nothing seems to break the couple's relationship. He plants a virus in Jean's newly coded software for a bank; running the software on the buyer's system infects their whole network, and Jean-Ren√© is arrested. Jean-Ren√© warns Violette that all these mishaps are caused by Lolo and he has found evidence in Lolo's diary.

He studied in France and became one of Canada's first impressionist painters. He lived most of his life in France and on the island of Gotland, Sweden, where he and his Swedish wife Carolina Benedicks-Bruce created the artists estate Brucebo, which was later established as a nature reserve.  Biography   Early years  William Blair Bruce was born on 8October 1859, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where he grew up in Corktown and on the Mountain. A plaque in Bruce Park, Hamilton marks the site of his childhood home. He was the son of William Bruce, born 1833 in Scotland, who emigrated to Hamilton with his wife Janet Blair in 1837. Initially Bruce studied law at Hamilton Collegiate Institute, but had his mind set on becoming an architect, and studied for a while at the Mechanics Institute in Hamilton, in 1877. He worked for an architectural firm for the ensuing two years. Members of his family were both musically and artistically inclined and noticed Bruce's talent at an early age. In 1881, they sent him to Paris to study, a journey that extended over the years. He would only return to Canada on two short occasions.  Paris  Open air studio, 1885-90 In Paris his classical education at Acad√©mie Julian included genre scenes and several other subjects. Like other artists of the time he wanted to experience the Parisian art scene and join in the competition to exhibit at the annual Salon in Paris. He also traveled to the artist colony in Barbizon where he and a group of artist friends rented a cottage in 1882, and Grez-sur-Loing where a new generation of Swedish artists, such as Carl Larsson, his wife Karin Berg√∂√∂, Bruno Liljefors and August Strindberg had formed a colony. He became acquainted with Impressionism and En plein air or \\"outdoors painting\\", a style he came to prefer working with. He also became one of Canada's first impressionist painters. Bruce exhibited at the Salon in 1882. His works received positive reviews but the following year his self confidence and finances deteriorated. His parents were not entirely enthusiastic about his new painting style but he ignored them and began to create very large paintings. His Temps Pass√© was exhibited at the 1884 Salon although despite this success he remained in financial difficulties. Bruce subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown and hastily returned to Canada for the first time. To compound his problems, the steamship Brooklyn, carrying about 200 of his works, sank outside Anticosti Island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on 8November 1885. In the summer of 1885, Bruce had met the Swedish sculptor Carolina Benedicks in France. They fell in love and when Bruce returned to Canada, she made a surprise visit accompanied by her uncle, to persuade him to return to Paris. They were engaged in the autumn of 1886, and returned to Europe in 1887.  Return to Europe  Carolina Benedicks-Bruce and William Blair Bruce Bruce returned to France a bolder artist. In 1887, he and a group of fellow artists such as the American painter Theodore Robinson, travelled to Giverny where they shared a house and, influenced by Monet who lived nearby, painted a number of impressive impressionist sketches. In 1888, on his return to Paris, he painted The Phantom Hunter, which became an instant success at the Salon and marked the peak of his career. He and Benedicks married at the British embassy in Stockholm on 5December the same year. She provided energy and stability for Bruce throughout his life and also became his favorite model. In May 1889, the couple returned to Grez and Bruce wrote to his mother that \\"Gr√®z is a great improvement on Barbizon, quite a different country in fact\\". A month later, Bruce also sold some paintings to the American artist Walter Gay, who was visiting Grez at the time. Bruce and Benedicks-Bruce continued to make annual visits to Grez up until 1894. They rented a small house, which had previously been the home of Carl Larsson and his wife Karin. It was here that Bruce painted his Open-Air Studio (now in the National Museum of Fine Arts, Stockholm). It is a view from their home in Grez, picturing Benedicks-Bruce doing an etching out-doors behind a sun screen. In 1895, the couple made a brief journey to Hamilton in Canada, where Bruce painted on the Six Nations Reserve. Throughout the 1890s, they led a bohemian life, travelling to Capri, Italy and Sweden where they took a liking to Gotland and its light. In 1900‚Äì06, the couple created a summer home called Brucebo (Swedish for: \\"The house where Bruce lives\\") on Gotland. Here, Bruce painted, did some amateur archaeology and socialized with the locals, while Benedicks-Bruce worked with sculptures and etchings as well as tended the garden and the many animals she had gathered at Brucebo. Bruce died suddenly on 17November 1906 in Stockholm at the age of 47, and Benedicks-Bruce settled down permanently at Brucebo. After Bruce's death, a commemorative exhibition of 122 of his works was held in Paris in 1907. Carolina donated 29 of his paintings to the City of Hamilton. This donation became the foundation of the Art Gallery of Hamilton that opened in 1914. Even though Bruce enjoyed a good reputation towards the end of his life with 15 participations at the Salon, exhibitions in London, Toronto, Stockholm, Buffalo and came to influence many young artists in Canada, he remains relatively unknown. A large part of his production can be seen at Brucebo, which is now a museum managed by the Brucebo Foundation. Benedicks-Bruce lived at Brucebo until her death on 16February 1935.  Brucebo  Originally used as a summer house by Bruce and his wife, they rebuilt and extended Brucebo in 1900‚Äì06 into their permanent home and studio. In 2009, the estate was converted into an art museum. In connection to this, a shooting occurred at the main house. The museum and the estate are managed by the Brucebo Foundation. The foundation also grants scholarship to younger Canadian artists. In 1970, the Brucebo estate was established as a nature reserve.

The brand name for engines and automobiles was Kessler; also Kess-Line for some cars.  History  Kessler-Detroit Motor Car Company Factor, Plant Number Two In 1907 Martin C. Kessler designed an automobile engine for the Chandler Motor Car company in Cleveland, Ohio. He then worked as an independent engineering consultant. In 1917, after several attempts, he founded the Kessler Motor Company in Detroit, Michigan. The company supplied engines for combat aircraft to the US government. It is unclear whether it was connected to the Liberty program. Kessler was president and CEO of the company. William H. Radford was appointed chief engineer and vice president. Automobile manufacturing With the end of World War I the demand for military engines ended, and like many similar companies, Kessler Motors turned to building automobiles. The first model, the Kessler Super- Charge Four, was announced in January 1920 and shown the following month at the Detroit Auto Show. Super-Charge Motor For the Super-Charge Four the company developed the Super-Charge Motor, a technically interesting engine for which both Kessler and Radford later claimed credit. It was a two-liter 4-cylinder inline engine with integrated compressor. It was innovative in incorporating a compression space into the crankcase; pressure was increased by the downward movement of the pistons.Kimes/Clark p. 101. A more than respectable performance of 70 bhp (52.2 kW) was claimed, equalling that of the basic model of the Bugatti Type 35. The Ford Model T offered 20 bhp (15 kW). The company's advertising emphasized that the engine produced negligible carbon deposits.  Automobile models   Kessler Super-Charge Four  Apart from the engine, the Kessler Super-Charge Four was a very conventional private car. Because of the company's limited resources, it was an assembled car, consisting of purchased components fitted together. The chassis consisted of a ladder frame with front and rear beam axles. The wheelbase was 117 ins (2972 mm). The car was only available as a touring car and was a close copy of the then new Packard Single Six;Kimes/Clark, p. 804, picture.Kimes/Clark, p. 1116, picture. the Super-Charge Four offered distinctly superior performance over the Packard's 52 bhp / 38.8 kWKimes/Clark, p. 1116. and a slight advantage in wheelbase over the Packard's 116 ins. / 2946 mm When first introduced, the Single Six cost $3640 as a touring car (and was soon reduced in price); the Super-Charge Four cost only $1995. Regardless, the Super-Charge Four flopped badly; by the end of 1921 only 16 vehicles had been produced. The reason is unclear, but may have been the engine.  Kess-Line Motors Company  7.5x9.75 black and white photograph of the Kess-Line Motor Car Company located at 657 Lycaste Street Kessler formed a subsidiary called the Kess-Line Motors Company to produce its next car under the Kess-Line marque. Again Kessler was president and CEO and Radford chief engineer and vice president. H. H. Scott, formerly of Fisher Body, was chief financial officer and secretary. A new production location was rented, the former facilities of Liberty Motor Car in Detroit. In that company's best year, 1921, 21,000 Liberty Sixes had been sold;Kimes/Clark, p. 864. thus the plant was far too large for Kessler unless the new car sold extremely well. The Kess-Line 8 was also extremely reminiscent of a competitor: the engine hood and radiator grille very closely resembled those of the much more expensive Lincoln L.Kimes/Clark, p. 868, picture. However, the Kess-Line, again available only as a touring car, had sportier lines than the massive Lincoln and \\"helmet\\" fenders‚Äîclose to the wheel and turned out at the base, so that the profile recalled a Classical helmet. Instead of running boards, there was a nickel- plated step under each of the four doors, and the grille was also nickel- plated. The engine was an inline V8 offering 100 bhp (74.6 kW); a performance exceeded by very few production automobiles at the time, such as the compressor version of the Bugatti Type 35 or the Mercedes 24/100/140 PS. Of US cars, similar performance was offered only by, for example, the Finley Robertson Porter, which were produced in extremely limited numbers and offered 125 bhp;Kimes/Clark, p. 1238. typical performance for US luxury cars was 80‚Äì90 bhp.Duesenberg Model A, 88 bhp: Kimes/Clark, p. 497.Daniels Model D, 90 bhp: Kimes/Clark, p. 413.Locomobile Model 48, 95 bhp: Georgano, p. 437. The Kess- Line 8 also failed to fulfil expectations; only 12 were built, according to one source only one.Georgano, p. 403. Later history After the failure of the Kess-Line 8, the company did not make further attempts to market automobiles. Radford went to California to prepare for equipping Balboa cars with Kessler V8s, but the project did not advance beyond the prototype stage, and there are no further documented uses of the Kessler Super-Charge engine. When the company was dissolved is unclear; there are mentions of it until at least 1927. In the 1930s Martin Kessler over-extended himself financially developing a 10-cylinder automobile.

The organization uses marketing techniques and technical interventions to address threats like overfishing and deforestation. Rare's work is founded on the belief that most of the threats faced by the environment are the result of human behavior, and that changing human behavior requires appealing to people using both rational and emotional arguments and removing any barriers that might prevent change. History Rare was founded on January 1, 1973 by David Hill. The organization was originally headquartered at the offices of the National Audubon Society in New York before joining the World Wildlife Fund in the 1980s. In 1987, Rare returned to being an independent entity. Currently headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, in the United States, Rare also has offices in the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Brazil, Mozambique, Mexico and Micronesia. Rare has worked with communities and local partners in over 55 countries. Rare receives 3 out of 4 stars, from Charity Navigator. Approach to Conservation Social marketing: Rare uses social marketing to achieve its mission. Each marketing concept is applied to motivate communities to take pride in their surrounding environment and wildlife. The tools Rare uses include: animal mascots, puppet shows, religious sermons, radio spots, billboards, art contests, community theater events, festivals, murals, songs and school visits. Rare's campaign approach originated on the Eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia in 1977, with the work of Paul Butler, now Rare's senior vice president. Butler was hired by St. Lucia's Forestry Department in an effort to save the declining, endemic St. Lucia Parrot. Hunting, habitat destruction and the bird trade had caused the species to decline from 1000 birds in the mid-1950s to less than 150 by 1977. Working with Gabriel Charles (Former Chief Forest Officer) and a team of forest officers, he created an outreach campaign that aimed to build community pride in the parrot and its forest habitat. Butler and his forestry department colleagues leveraged marketing materials that mirrored those used by the private sector, including campaign songs, mascots, and poster art depicting the parrot alongside a targeted call to action: \\"Take Pride in St. Lucia! Report illegal hunting of wildlife and clearing of land!\\" In 1979, the government of St. Lucia declared the parrot its national bird, established a parrot sanctuary, and updated and enforced laws to protect the species and its habitat. The parrot population steadily recovered, and today population estimates for the species exceed 2,000. Butler's campaign and marketing tactics formed the foundation of Rare's social marketing strategy. Current Projects Fisheries Rare works with coastal communities to restore small-scale fisheries in the Philippines, Belize, Brazil, Indonesia and Mozambique. Through the Fish Forever partnership between Rare, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the University of California Santa Barbara, the organization expands and implements sustainable fisheries management solutions worldwide. The Fish Forever program pilots and implements TURF+Reserves, (territorial user rights for fishing) a pairing of exclusive fishing access and marine reserves that allows fisheries restoration and marine conservation to work together. Marine reserves (specifically in the form of no-take areas) are designated alongside or within the exclusive fishing areas, or TURFs, with the aim of giving fish populations the chance to thrive and spill over into the fishing areas. Watersheds Rare works with local communities throughout Latin America to implement reciprocal water agreements for upstream habitat protection. The agreements incentivize upstream landowners to conserve watershed habitat, with downstream water users (both entities and individuals) financing such incentives. Sourcing Solutions Solution Search is a crowdsourcing online contest platform designed to source, reward and disseminate proven solutions in conservation and development. Past competition themes have sought out fisheries restoration solutions and climate adaptation approaches worldwide. The 2015 Solution Search contest recognized solutions in U.S. weather-related disaster risk management. The contest has identified more than 240 solutions from 65 countries across the various topics. Sustainable Agriculture Rare works with farmers in China to adopt sustainable agriculture practices‚Äîin particular the shift from conventional cotton to organic cotton. The program seeks to reduce pesticides and other contaminants entering the waters and threatened wetland habitats of China.

The remains have been secured as five stone plates, removed on several occasions. In 2003, Peter Wellnhofer identified the fossil as a specimen of Eudimorphodon, a cf. E. ranzii. As it was 10 to 25% shorter than the latter's holotype, Wellnhofer considered it a juvenile. The same year Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia doubted the comparability to E. ranzii and suggested that it represent a separate Eudimorphodon species. In 2009, Dalla Vecchia concluded that the specimen was neither a juvenile nor closely related to Eudimorphodon. In 2015, Alexander Kellner named the separate genus Austriadraco, with the type species Austriadraco dallavecchiai. The generic name is a combination of the Latin words Austria and draco, \\"dragon\\". The specific name honours Dalla Vecchia. The Life Science Identifiers are for the genus 120B3003-6DE3-41B4-AF6B-6F242FB2A777 and for the species 6E123721-07EA-419CB755-9981CC7D9209. The holotype, BSP 1994 I 51, was found in a layer of the Seefeld Formation, dating from the late Norian. It consists of a partial and disarticulated skeleton with skull. It contains both frontal bones, a left jugal, the lower jaws, loose teeth, vertebrae of the neck, back and tail, the shoulder girdle, both humeri, a first wing phalanx, the pelvis, a shinbone and a calf bone. The fused frontals had in 2003 been incorrectly identified as a breast bone by Wellnhofer. The bones have been partly preserved as impressions only and many are fragmented. The fossil is part of the collection of the Bayerische Staatssammlung f√ºr Pal√§ontologie und historische Geologie at Munich.  Description  Austriadraco dallavecchiai is a small species. Humerus length is about four centimetres. In 2015 Kellner indicated several distinguishing traits. Some of these are autapomorphies. The frontal bone has a short front branch. The jugal bone has short branches to the front, in the direction of the maxilla and the nasal bone, and a long narrow upwards branch running towards the postorbital bone. In the outer rear side of the lower jaw an opening is present, the mandibular fenestra. The coronoid process of the surangular bone is low. The shoulder blade is considerably longer, 62%, than the coracoid. Additionally, a unique combination of in themselves not unique traits is present. The coracoid is broad, with a constricted shaft. In the pelvis, the ischipubic plate, the fusion of the pubic bone with the ischium, is deep. The shinbone is relatively long, with a length of 57.7 millimetres attaining 70% of the length of the humerus and 92% of the length of the first phalanx of the (fourth) wingfinger.  Classification  According to Dalla Vecchia's analysis, Austriadraco would have a very basal position in the Pterosauria. Kellner concluded that its affinities were uncertain and placed Austriadraco in a separate, undefined, Austriadraconidae. He suggested a close relationship with Arcticodactylus as both taxa shared the trait of a short coracoid.

These colourful, frugivorous doves are found in forests and woodlands in Southeast Asia and Oceania. It is a large genus with over 50 species, some threatened or already extinct. Taxonomy The genus Ptilinopus was introduced in 1825 by the English naturalist William John Swainson with the rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina) as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek ptilon meaning \\"feather\\" with pous meaning \\"foot\\". The many species of this genus can be further grouped by geography and by certain shared characteristics. The fruit doves of the Sunda Islands and northern Australia, such as the pink- headed fruit dove and banded fruit dove, have comparatively longer tails than other species, and are notable for their solid colouration on the head, neck and breast, with a black band across the belly. Another grouping can be made of certain fruit doves endemic to New Guinea, the Moluccas, and the Bismarck Archipelago, including the carunculated fruit dove, knob-billed fruit dove, and others; these are notable for their grey colouration on the head or shoulder and/or enlarged cere (part of the bill). This group is uncharacteristically not sexually dimorphic, meaning males and females look alike. The orange dove, golden dove, and whistling dove, all endemic to Fiji and sometimes placed in their own genus Chrysoena, have in common their small size, compact shape, yellow or orange colouration in the males, and hair-like body feathers. They also are known for their rather un-pigeon-like vocalizations, which sound like snapping, barking, or whistling, respectively. Finally, the Pacific Islands provide homes to a number of species that share generally green colouration with crimson caps or crowns, ventriloquial cooing or hooting, and a distinct texture of the breast feathers. Recent evidence suggests Ptilinopus as presently defined is paraphyletic as Alectroenas and Drepanoptila are embedded within it. Species Dwarf fruit dove (Ptilinopus nainus), Lobo, New Guinea, 1828 The genus contains 55 species: * Banded fruit dove, Ptilinopus cinctus * Black-banded fruit dove, Ptilinopus alligator ‚Äì split from banded fruit dove * Red-naped fruit dove, Ptilinopus dohertyi * Pink-headed fruit dove, Ptilinopus porphyreus * Flame-breasted fruit dove, Ptilinopus marchei * Cream-breasted fruit dove, Ptilinopus merrilli * Yellow-breasted fruit dove, Ptilinopus occipitalis * Red-eared fruit dove, Ptilinopus fischeri * Jambu fruit dove, Ptilinopus jambu * Banggai fruit dove, Ptilinopus subgularis * Oberholser's fruit dove, Ptilinopus epia ‚Äì split from Banggai fruit dove * Sula fruit dove, Ptilinopus mangoliensis ‚Äì split from Banggai fruit dove * Black-chinned fruit dove, Ptilinopus leclancheri * Scarlet-breasted fruit dove, Ptilinopus bernsteinii * Wompoo fruit dove, Ptilinopus magnificus * Pink-spotted fruit dove, Ptilinopus perlatus * Ornate fruit dove, Ptilinopus ornatus * Tanna fruit dove, Ptilinopus tannensis * Orange-fronted fruit dove, Ptilinopus aurantiifrons * Wallace's fruit dove, Ptilinopus wallacii * Superb fruit dove, Ptilinopus superbus * Many-colored fruit dove, Ptilinopus perousii * Crimson-crowned fruit dove, Ptilinopus porphyraceus * Purple-capped fruit dove, Ptilinopus ponapensis ‚Äì split from crimson-crowned fruit dove * Kosrae fruit dove, Ptilinopus hernsheimi ‚Äì split from crimson-crowned fruit dove * Palau fruit dove, Ptilinopus pelewensis * Lilac-crowned fruit dove, Ptilinopus rarotongensis * Mariana fruit dove, Ptilinopus roseicapilla Rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina) from Australia and Indonesia * Rose-crowned fruit dove, Ptilinopus regina * Silver-capped fruit dove, Ptilinopus richardsii * Grey-green fruit dove, Ptilinopus purpuratus * Raiatea fruit-dove, Ptilinopus purpuratus chrysogaster * Makatea fruit dove, Ptilinopus chalcurus * Atoll fruit dove, Ptilinopus coralensis * Red-bellied fruit dove, Ptilinopus greyi * Rapa fruit dove, Ptilinopus huttoni * White-capped fruit dove, Ptilinopus dupetithouarsii * ‚Ä† Red-moustached fruit dove, Ptilinopus mercierii - extinct (mid-20th century) * Henderson fruit dove, Ptilinopus insularis * Coroneted fruit dove, Ptilinopus coronulatus * Beautiful fruit dove, Ptilinopus pulchellus * Blue-capped fruit dove, Ptilinopus monacha * White-bibbed fruit dove, Ptilinopus rivoli * Yellow-bibbed fruit dove, Ptilinopus solomonensis * Claret-breasted fruit dove, Ptilinopus viridis * White-headed fruit dove, Ptilinopus eugeniae * Lompobattang fruit-dove, Ptilinopus meridionalis Male pink-headed fruit dove, Ptilinopus porphyreus * Orange-bellied fruit dove, Ptilinopus iozonus * Knob-billed fruit dove, Ptilinopus insolitus * Grey- headed fruit dove, Ptilinopus hyogaster * Carunculated fruit dove, Ptilinopus granulifrons * Black-naped fruit dove, Ptilinopus melanospilus * Dwarf fruit dove, Ptilinopus nainus * Negros fruit dove, Ptilinopus arcanus ‚Äì possibly extinct (late 20th century?) * Orange fruit dove, Ptilinopus victor * Golden fruit dove, Ptilinopus luteovirens * Whistling fruit dove, Ptilinopus layardi Description These small- to medium-sized doves generally have short, fan- shaped tails, and are remarkable for their colourful and often glossy plumage, as evidenced in the aptly named orange fruit dove, flame-breasted fruit dove, and pink-headed fruit dove. Males and females of many fruit dove species look very different. For example, the female many-colored fruit dove shares the male's crimson crown and deep pink undertail feathers, but is otherwise green, whereas the male has a crimson on the upper back and has areas of yellow, olive, cinnamon, and grey. Distribution and habitat This is a large genus, most diverse in and around the island of New Guinea, in the Philippines, and in the biogeographical region of Wallacea. Some species have ranges as far west as the Sunda Islands, others north to Taiwan, south to Australia, and east into Polynesia. Behaviour and ecology Chick of a black-naped fruit dove (Ptilinopus melanospilus) Fruit doves, as their name implies, eat fruit‚ÄîFicus is especially important‚Äîand live in various kinds of forest or woodland. Some species are restricted to primary forest, such as lowland rainforest, montane forest, or monsoon forest, while others prefer secondary forest or disturbed areas. Some species specialize in particular habitats, from lowland coastal forest to the cloud forest or moss forest of high altitudes. Some species of fruit doves are only found in habitats dominated by particular plants, such as mangrove, eucalyptus, or pandanus. Only a few species can commonly be seen around human habitation, these include the knob- billed fruit dove, Makatea fruit dove, and black-naped fruit dove, which are known to visit gardens and such. Much is still to be learned about fruit doves. Many species are shy and difficult to observe in their natural habitat. For example, there are several species in the Philippines, and for most of them, little or nothing is known of their breeding or nesting behavior.

Its only species is Bergamodactylus wildi. It was named in 2015 based on a pterosaur specimen which had previously been regarded as a juvenile Eudimorphodon or as identical to Carniadactylus. Some Triassic pterosaur specialists consider the distinguishing features of Bergamodactylus to be invalid or insufficient to distinguish it from Carniadactylus, and thus retain the specimen in that genus.  History  Photo and reconstructions of the skull In 1978, Rupert Wild described a small pterosaur specimen in the collection of the Museo di Paleontologia dell¬¥Universit√† di Milano, found near Cene, Lombardy. He referred to it as the \\"Milan Exemplar\\" and identified it as a juvenile of Eudimorphodon ranzii. Wild noted considerable differences with the latter's type specimen but these were explained as reflecting the young age of the animal.Wild, R., 1978, \\"Die Flugsaurier (Reptilia, Pterosauria) aus der Oberen Trias von Cene bei Bergamo, Italien\\", Bolletino della Societa Paleontologica Italiana, 17 (2): 176-256 In 2009, Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia confirmed an earlier conclusion by Alexander KellnerKellner, A.W.A., 2003, \\"Pterosaur phylogeny and comments on the evolutionary history of the group\\". In: Buffetaut E. and Mazin J-M. (Eds), Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, p 105-137 that the specimen must have been at least subadult in view of the fusion of the scapula and the coracoid, the upper wristbones being fused into a syncarpal, and the fusion of the extensor process on the first wing phalanx. Dalla Vecchia referred the specimen to Carniadactylus rosenfeldi. In 2015, Kellner concluded that the Milan Exemplar represented a different species from Carniadactylus. It showed differences in build that could not be explained by individual variation, it was much smaller though of similar age, and it was of a younger geological age. He named a separate genus and species Bergamodactylus wildi. The generic name combines a reference to Bergamo with a Greek Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫œÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ, daktylos, \\"finger\\", a usual suffix in pterosaur names since Pterodactylus. The specific name honours Wild.Kellner placed Bergamodactylus, within the Novialoidea, in the Campylognathoidea. In 2018, Dalla Vecchia argued that Kellner's observations on development in pterosaurs were oversimplified, and that the Milan Exemplar's distinguishing features were ambiguous, invalid, or individual variation at best. As a result, Dalla Vecchia referred the specimen back to Carniadactylus, rendering Bergamodactylus wildi a junior synonym of Carniadactylus rosenfeldi.  Description  Life reconstruction The holotype, MPUM 6009, was found in a layer of the Calcari di Zorzino Formation dating from the early Norian (upper Alaunian). It consists of a partial skeleton including the skull, compressed on a single plate. It is largely articulated and includes the lower jaws, most of the wings, much of the vertebral column except the tail, and hindlimb elements. Some bones have only been preserved as impressions. Bergamodactylus is one of the smallest known pterosaurs: Kellner in 2015 estimated the wingspan at just 465 millimetres. He also established some distinguishing traits. The postorbital bone is slender with a thin branch towards the frontal bone. The praemaxilla does not reach the lower rim of the external nostril. The fourth metacarpal is short, with only 40% of the length of the humerus and 30% of the length of the ulna. The thighbone is short, attaining just half of the length of either the ulna or the first wing finger phalanx. Bergamodactylus has multi-cusped teeth like Eudimorphodon but their number strongly differs: fourteen in both the upper jaw and the lower jaw as against respectively twenty-nine and twenty-eight in the latter species. Additional differences with Carniadactylus include a tooth row that extends further to the rear, a lower mandibula, a higher placed deltopectoral crest on the humerus and a shorter upper part of the kinked pteroid. Bergamodactylus has a short second phalanx of the wing finger in common with Carniadactylus.

The ship was one of the first of the standard vessels modified into a troop transport. Sea Snipe was completed 29 May 1943 and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) upon completion. American President Lines operated the ship throughout the war under a WSA agreement. The ship, after brief charter to the British Ministry of War Transport in 1946 and lay up in 1947 served as a civilian transport ship for 24 years, first as Edward Luckenbach for Luckenbach Steamship Company then Aloha State for States Marine Lines. The ship was scrapped in August 1971. World War II Sea Snipe was capable of transporting 2,194 troops and of cargo. Its maiden voyage commenced on August 13, 1943 en route to Townsville, Queensland, where it would haul both US and Australian troops to various locations in New Guinea, Indonesia, and the South Pacific until return to San Francisco in November. The ship immediately made a round trip to Brisbane returning 5 January 1944. Sea Snipe then made four round trip voyages from San Francisco in 1944. *Departure on 20 January for Milne Bay, Brisbane, Oro Bay, Buna and Langemak. *Departure on 9 April for Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Lae, Langemak, Finschhafen, Cape Gloucester (Papua New Guinea) and Brisbane. *Departure on 8 July to Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Finschhafen, Manus Island, Hollandia and Brisbane. *Departure on 18 October to Guadalcanal, Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Hollandia, Brisbane and Bougainville with end of year return to San Francisco on 31 December. The ship made two more Pacific voyages in 1945. The first departed San Francisco 6 February for Finschhafen, Hollandia, Leyte, Lingayen, Subic Bay and Manila with return to Los Angeles. On 22 May the ship departed San Diego for Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok and Guam returning to San Francisco in July. Later in July Sea Snipe departed for the Atlantic and Marseilles for redeployment of troops to the Pacific. Instead, with the Pacific war ended, the ship was redirected to Hampton Roads from which another round trip to Marseilles was made returning on 27 September. From Baltimore the ship went to Le Havre, returned to Boston, then Naples back to Boston. Another voyage was made to Naples with return to Hampton Roads then back to Le Havre. The ship then went to New York in December with more voyages scheduled. Serious boiler problems required major maintenance and cancellation of the scheduled 1946 voyages. On 29 May 1946 the ship was allocated to the Ministry of War Transport under a bareboat charter. Civilian Service In 1947, the United States Maritime Commission, who owned the ship, sold Sea Snipe to Luckenbach Steamship, after major repairs on the boiler were made. Luckenbach was purchasing many ex-World War II transports, to make up for ships that were lost in the war. Luckenbach, as a result of major corporate reorganization, sold the ship to States Marine Lines in 1960. They renamed the ship Aloha State, and it served as an international cargo ship until 1971. It was scrapped sometime between August 21 and 31, 1971, in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

They then took up residence on the Dargle, a tributary of the Umgeni River, and it was named after the River Dargle near Dublin by Fannin's father. The local district is now known by the name Dargle. Fannin first married the Reverend Eustace Wilberforce Jacob in 1869. The couple travelled to England in 1871, with Jacob dying soon after their arrival. Fannin remained in England for a period, studying music and painting. She returned to South Africa in 1875. From 1878, she lived in Transvaal, marrying the Reverend Alfred Roberts in 1879 whom she met through a mission party. Roberts later went on to become an archdeacon in the Diocese of Pretoria. The couple lived in Potchefstroom from 1881 to 1896, where they had two sons. Their son, Dr Austin Roberts, went on to become an eminent ornithologist. Fannin was one of the founding member of St. Mary's Diocesan School for Girls, Pretoria, and Roberts served as headmaster of the boys' school St Birinus's. In 1881, during the siege of Pretoria, Fannin returned to the family home in Natal. Fannin died on 18 November 1938, either in Heidelberg, Gauteng, or at New Muckleneuk, Pretoria. Artistic career Fannin appears to have been a self-taught artist. She was encouraged by her older brother, George Fox Fannin a keen botanist, to study the local flora of South Africa. Their interest lay primarily in orchids and Asclepiadoideae (milkweeds). This interest led to Fannin pressing and painting the plants George collected and sending the illustrations to William Henry Harvey at Trinity College, Dublin. Harvey was so impressed by her paintings, he named an orchid in her honour, crediting her as its discoverer. Around 1869, Fannin painted an album detailing the flowers of Natal. In 1878, Fannin was a member of a mission party led by Bishop Henry Bousfield, and during their journey from Durban to Pretoria Fannin made sketches of the surrounding countryside. Whilst living in Transvaal, Fannin painted wildflowers and landscapes. Her flower paintings are held by the School of Botany, Trinity College, Dublin. Her landscapes are held in private collections in South Africa. Eponymous taxa *Disperis fanniniae Harv. 1863 *Sisyranthus fanniniae N.E. Br. *Streptocarpus fanniniae Harv. Ex C. B. Cl.

The building features a ten-story clocktower on the southeast corner, facing the intersection of Pacific Avenue and S 7th Street.Schoor, Barett P., Old City Hall, 74001973; United States Department off the Interior, National Park Service; National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form; Washington D.C., May 17, 1974 The building uses masonry bearing walls combined with numerous windows. The windows on the second and third floors are of equal size. The fourth story windows are arched at the top. The fifth story windows are smaller and narrower. The foundation is a local Wilkeson stone, which is light gray. The walls are eight feet thick at the base and taper to six feet at street level. They are covered with a fa√ßade of red brick faced with yellow Roman brick. These bricks are believed to have been ballast from China or Belgium or to have been imported from Italy. The tower is a freestanding masonry with a clock on each face. The building is a trapezoid in plan and reflects the Italian Villa style. Small round windows appear below the corner line; three large round windows occur below the corner on the tower. The tower's base has heavy brackets above the corner of the main structure and narrow rectangular windows on the tower body. A group of three arched windows are at the top on each side. A row of small round windows circles the tower between the arched windows and the eave line. Terra cotta decorations embellish the tower and areas of the entablature. The tower has a clock and a set of four bells. The clock and the bells were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, the same company that cast the Liberty Bell. The bells is of silver bell metal. Hugh Wallace of Tacoma, ambassador to France during World War I, gave the bells and chimes in memory of his daughter on Christmas Day, 1904. The pendulum of the clock, in length, is suspended on a single wire, in length. The mechanism is gravity run and the motors are wound electrically. History Tacoma was a railroad town, acting as the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Attracted by the potential of financial success, businessmen from the Midwest came to the city. They brought with them a culture and the Old City Hall is an example of those tastes. The old Tacoma City Hall was completed April 23, 1893 at a cost of $257,965 and was used by the city until 1957. The structure is representative of the ebullience of spirit that characterized the city of Tacoma in the late 19th century; it ‚Äò‚Äô\\"...seems to combine a romantic feeling for the spirit of fifteenth century Florence with the mercantile spirit of nineteenth century America‚Äô‚Äô.\\" Edward Hatherton The building was designed by the San Francisco firm, Hatherton and Mclntosh. Edward Hatherton (b. 1836 d. 1896) had established a private architecture practice in San Francisco in the 1870s, and was hired in 1877 as a draftsman and assistant to prominent architect August Laver in 1877.http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi- bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=SFC18960320.2.164http://pcad.lib.washington.edu/person/6754/ Laver, an English architect who moved San Francisco from Canada 1871 when he won a design competition for San Francisco's new City Hall, resigned soon thereafter due to health complications and problems with the City Hall construction project, and Hatherton assumed Laver's role on the project.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/laver_augustus_12E.html Hatherton established his own practice with John Cotter Pelton in 1879, before assuming the position of City Architect of San Francisco in 1888. Hatherton resigned his position in 1891 to relocate to Tacoma, WA. That same year, Hatherton formed a new firm in Tacoma with Australian-born architect Colin McIntosh, and together they designed numerous commercial and residential buildings in Tacoma, including the new City Hall Building and the Chamber of Commerce Building (1892). On March 1, 1896, Hatherton was reported missing from his home in San Francisco. He had last been seen at his office the day before, on February 29. On March 20, newspapers reported that it was suspected that Hatherton, despondent over the financial losses incurred in Tacoma during the recent financial panic, had committed suicide. A week later those suspicions were confirmed.http://pcad.lib.washington.edu/person/6755/ Redevelopment In March 2019, after three rounds of competitive bidding, the Tacoma City Council announced that it had awarded Surge Tacoma the right to purchase and redevelop Old City Hall. The purchase price was $2 million plus $2 million in kind donations over the next 10 years.

Johann Nepomuk Hoechle (16 September 1790, Munich - 12 December 1835, Vienna) was an Austrian painter and lithographer who specialized in scenes from military actions and current events.  Biography  His father was Johann Baptist Hoechle (1754-1832), an artist from Switzerland who later became court painter for the Habsburgs. When he was still a child, he was apprenticed to the engraver and etcher, Ferdinand Kobell,Brief biography @ German WikiSource. who died shortly after, in 1799. The following year, his father took him to Vienna. From 1804 to 1808, he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied history painting with Heinrich Friedrich F√ºger and landscape painting with Michael Wutky. His later career as a battle painter probably came from the influence of the French marine and military artist, Ignace Duvivier (1758-1832), who Hoechle met while he was visiting Vienna. This may be what inspired Hoechle, in 1809, to make sketches of the ongoing Battle of Aspern from a hillside near Heiligenstadt. He was found and arrested by French soldiers, who thought he was a spy and were going to have him shot. Luckily, he spoke French and was able to convince the commanding officer that they were mistaken.\\"Wer War Hoechle?\\" by Johannes Holba @ Pfarre Aspern. The Crossing of the Vosges. In 1814, after further studies in military art, he made more sketches at the scenes of major events, on behalf of Austrian Emperor Francis I, and turned them into paintings at his studio. His most important work from this period, and his best-known overall, depicts the crossing of the Vosges Mountains, following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig. In 1819, he accompanied the Emperor's entourage to Italy, followed in 1820 by attendance at major military maneuvers in Hungary. That same year, he did a portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven and, shortly after the composer's death in 1827, made a detailed sketch of his study (where he died) in the \\"Schwarzspanierhaus\\".Beethovens Sterbezimmer @ the Beethoven-Haus website.

He took over the club from fellow New Zealander Kevin Greene in November 1997 when it was felt that the head coach position should be a full-time post. Previously a coach of Rugby Southland and an assistant coach of Otago Highlanders, Robertson applied for the Glasgow job when the Highlanders were on a tour of the UK. He was already earmarked as a potential candidate head coach by Jim Telfer in May 1997. This was a difficult period for the fledgling professional rugby game in Scotland. During Robertson's tenure at the club the 4 districts of Scotland were merged into two. The Glasgow club merged with the Caledonia Reds to become known as the Glasgow Caledonians. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Rugby merged with the Border Reivers to become the Edinburgh Reivers. Robertson's philosophy was to learn with the players and belief was key. He stated \\"When I come over I am not going to be saying to the boys that this or that is the way we do things in New Zealand, I fully expect that I will learn from Glasgow's players and they will tell me what they do. I enjoy motivating players to see what they can do more than dictating to them.\\" He also tried to put losses and rugby in perspective: \\"A loss in sport is a loss, you pick yourself up, examine why you lost, and then go forward.... Don't talk to me about sporting pressure. The bloke with no money in Drumchapel has more pressure than any rugby player.\\" Robertson thought the Glasgow team in 1998 could have competed in the Super12 and won the European Cup. In the Heineken Cup of 1998‚Äì99 Glasgow recorded only 2 wins out of the 6 group games; the others of the group consisting of Pontypridd, Benetton Treviso and Colomiers. It was thought that Robertson struggled to cope with merging the Glasgow and Caledonia Reds players into one team. He was replaced by Richie Dixon in January 1999. Robertson moved to helping the Scotland Under 21 side with Roy Laidlaw but left at the end of the season. Robertson is now the coach of Clyde-Earnscleugh in New Zealand.

Plot Ed works an office job as a cancer insurance call-center operator by day, a job he seems not to enjoy, especially as he's in his early thirties. The movie details the hardships faced in London as Ed moonlights as a stand-up comedian, and shows the different dilemmas faced by bisexual men as Ed experiences turmoil‚Äîemotional, sexual and professional‚Äîand ends up retreating into himself to observe his environs. His personal life is also in disarray as he is torn between a newfound love, artist Nathan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), and his best friend and flatmate Elisa, who develops issues with the boyfriend.

Bruns Publications, Inc., 111 F.2d 432 (2d Cir. 1940), the case of Superman v. Wonderman,The court refers to the defendant's character throughout its opinion as \\"Wonderman,\\" not \\"Wonder Man.\\" is a 1940 decision of the Second Circuit in which the court held that the archetype of a comic book hero, in this case a cape-wearing benevolent-Hercules figure (Superman), is an idea, which the copyright in the comic strips does not protect against copying; only the specific details of the strips, their particular expression, enjoy legal protection. The author of the court's opinion was Judge Augustus N. Hand and the panel of Second Circuit judges included Judge Learned Hand. Background The defendant Bruns Publications, Inc. published a comic strip magazine that featured an action hero called \\"Wonder Man\\". The plaintiff Detective Comics, Inc. published a comic strip magazine called \\"Action Comics\\" that featured Superman. Bruns published strips resembling Superman strips. The court described the strips in these terms: > Each publication portrays a man of miraculous strength and speed called > \\"Superman\\" in \\"Action Comics\\" and \\"Wonderman\\" in the magazine of Bruns. The > attributes and antics of \\"Superman\\" and \\"Wonderman\\" are closely similar. > Each at times conceals his strength beneath ordinary clothing but after > removing his cloak stands revealed in full panoply in a skintight acrobatic > costume. The only real difference between them is that \\"Superman\\" wears a > blue uniform and \\"Wonderman\\" a red one. Each is termed the champion of the > oppressed. Each is shown running toward a full moon \\"off into the night\\", > and each is shown crushing a gun in his powerful hands. \\"Superman\\" is > pictured as stopping a bullet with his person and \\"Wonderman\\" as arresting > and throwing back shells. Each is depicted as shot at by three men, yet as > wholly impervious to the missiles that strike him. \\"Superman\\" is shown as > leaping over a twenty story building, and \\"Wonderman\\" as leaping from > building to building. \\"Superman\\" and \\"Wonderman\\" are each endowed with > sufficient strength to rip open a steel door. Each is described as being the > strongest man in the world and each as battling against \\"evil and > injustice.\\" A side-by-side comparison of Detective's Superman and Bruns's Wonderman strips is provided in Superman v. Wonderman, along with corresponding passages from the preceding excerpt from the Second Circuit's opinion. Detective prevailed in the district court, which found Bruns guilty of copyright infringement. Bruns appealed the judgment to the Second Circuit. Opinion of the Second Circuit The court acknowledged the accuracy of Bruns's contention that the \\"various attributes of Superman find prototypes or analogues among the heroes of literature and mythology . . . a comic Hercules . . .\\" Nonetheless, to the extent that the Superman strips contained any expression, they were protected by copyright: > [I]f his production involves more than the presentation of a general type he > may copyright it and say of it: \\"A poor thing but mine own.\\" Perhaps the > periodicals of the complainant are foolish rather than comic, but they > embody an original arrangement of incidents and a pictorial and literary > form which preclude the contention that Bruns was not copying the antics of > Superman portrayed in Action Comics. We think it plain that the defendants > have used more than general types and ideas and have appropriated the > pictorial and literary details embodied in the complainant's copyrights. The court then explained this holding in clarifying language that deprived Detective of much of its apparent victory: > So far as the pictorial representations and verbal descriptions of Superman > are not a mere delineation of a benevolent Hercules, but embody an > arrangement of incidents and literary expressions original with the author, > they are proper subjects of copyright and susceptible of infringement > because of the monopoly afforded by the act. . . {T]he complainant is not > entitled to a monopoly of the mere character of a \\"Superman\\" who is a > blessing to mankind. . . . Accordingly, the court held, the district court's injunction against Bruns was too broad, because it swept up noninfringing conduct. Detective was entitled to relief only against cartoons \\"portraying any of the feats of strength or powers performed by \`Superman' or closely imitating his costume or appearance in any feat whatever.\\" Subsequent developments After losing, Wonderman folded and publication ceased. 21 (1996). The Wonderman decision became a precedent and influenced the outcomes in subsequent Superman infringement suits, such as Superman v. Captain Marvel. See also * National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc. * Warner Bros. Inc. v.

Previously a community school administered by North Yorkshire County Council, Aireville School converted to academy status in September 2014 and was renamed The Skipton Academy. Description The school has a comprehensive admissions policy, but the other two secondary schools in Skipton (Ermysted's Grammar School and Skipton Girls' High School) are both academically selective grammar schools. The school provides a curriculum that covers what pupils will need once they are in the world of work. It offers a wide range of extra-curricular and cultural activities, while enrichment activities include everything from a pantomime rewards trip to a Learn2Earn activity day. The curriculum focuses on the core subjects of English, maths, RE and PE. All students must also choose to study French, geography or history. Other subjects are available, such as computer science, engineering, health and social care, drama and business studies. Site Aireville Hall was the home of the Dewhurst family (silk and cotton manufacturers)and strong non-conformists. It dates from 1836. History The first school was financed by Dewhurst and built next to the Congregational Church. It was one of the British Schools, as distinct from the Tory, established church National Schools. By 1909, the school had expanded and land was bought to by move the school, it became The Brougham Street Council School. With the 1944 Education Act, secondary schools were needed for all children. Brougham Street Secondary Modern School was born, and much expanded in numbers, they used buildings all over the town. In 1958 it moved to the current site. The school now became Aireville Secondary Modern School and later Aireville County Secondary School. The election of the Thatcher government halted the planned reorganisation of the three Skipton School into 11‚Äì16 comprehensive on the Aireville site and a sixth form college. Over the next three decades the school didn't have many successes, and in 2014, it became a academy, and others from outside the town tried to improve it.

In 2014-15, Hughes claimed to have completed 53 marathons in 53 days, after which she claimed to have broken the Guinness World Record. However, her record claim was rejected by the organisation, as their requirements at the time asked for claimants to have run the marathons in official races. In 2017, Hughes claimed to have broken the 7 day treadmill world record, by running over seven days at the Trafford Centre. Her record claim was rejected as implausible for a non-elite runner, and it also lacked independent verification.  Marathon running   Background  After her friends' child developed a medulloblastoma, Hughes decided that she wanted to break the marathon running record in order to raise money for the Isabelle Lottie Foundation, which \\"raises awareness about the importance of diagnosing brain tumors early in children\\". She was also inspired by Larry Macon, who ran across all 50 U.S. states, desiring to run in all the major cities of the United Kingdom. Hughes also wanted to promote \\"the importance of leading a healthy, active lifestyle\\".  Marathons  She started her first run on 6 August 2014, in Chester. From Chester, she travelled from north to south and then to the south-west, before travelling north and completing her 53rd marathon in Manchester on 27 September. Covering a total of , Hughes travelled to cities including London, Liverpool, Wolverhampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, and Cardiff. After the event, Hughes said her highlight was Brighton, and that Tunbridge Wells was \\"hilly\\". During the attempt, Hughes suffered from stomach viruses, one of which caused her to take 8 hours to run her 35th marathon around Taunton. By making unsubstantiated and unverified claims of completing 53 marathons in 53 consecutive days, Hughes claimed that she broke the world record for most consecutive marathons; according to the Guinness Book of Records, the current women's record is 60, set by Alice Burch in Southampton, England in 2015, and the previous women's record was 17, set by Parvaneh Moayedi in 2013. Hughes also raised over ¬£42,000, of which ¬£10,000 was donated to the Neurosurgery Department at Alder Hey Children's Hospital.  Social media reactions  Hughes' record attempt received praise on social media, including from some notable celebrities. England football captain Wayne Rooney described her efforts as \\"a great achievement\\", whilst Paula Radcliffe tweeted her support for the \\"amazing and inspirational accomplishment\\".  Treadmill running  In 2017, Hughes claimed to have broken the 7-day treadmill world record, by running over seven days at the Trafford Centre, more than the previous record of . Her claim was rejected by Guinness, was subsequently heavily scrutinised and met with scepticism by some in the running community, in particular on Let's Run's forum, and the Ultrarunning Community Facebook group. Criticism was largely focused on the lack of any verifiable data to support this or any previous record claims, limited evidence to suggest the requisite athletic pedigree to break a record previously held by elite runners, and video evidence of Hughes taking breaks whilst the treadmill continued to run. Her record claim had no independent witnesses, with the only witness being her ex-partner Dave Keighley. A subsequent investigation website concluded that \\"As a result of her treadmill record being denied, people have questioned her ability. 520 miles on a treadmill in 7 days would require an ability on par with the elite ultra runners and multi-day runners. While she will not be able to have this record validated, there are many sanctioned multi-day races ‚Äì or even 24-hour races where she could at least validate her abilities. To date, none of her official races stand out. She admits that she is not fast, but she can prove her stamina in any # of sanctioned events\\".  Other activities  After completing the marathons, Hughes was involved in a number of high-profile events. She helped Blue Peter presenter Lindsey Russell train for the London Marathon, and has spoken at many Running Expos. Her record won the \\"best running moment of the year\\" at the 2015 Running Awards.  Personal life  Hughes works as a sports therapist in Oswestry, Shropshire.

He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal in 1945. Dunning was born in Stoke-on-Trent but after marrying lived in Sussex. He was serving with the Lincolnshire Regiment when he was captured in Belgium in May 1940. A succession of thwarted prison escapes saw him identified for repatriation. The negotiations failed and he promptly escaped before being sent to Germany. Unfortunately he was recaptured and this time sent to a camp in Carpi Italy. With the Italians withdrawing from the war the camp was taken over by the Germans on 9 August 1943. With the Allies advancing up the Italian peninsular arrangements were made to send the prisoners back to Germany, but Dunning hid with four others in a dug-out for five days before escape.

His modus operandi was always the same. Working as a taxi driver, he intercepted young people with offers of free rides, then would take them somewhere remote, where he would rape and kill them with blows to the head. Later, Silva would throw the bodies in deep abandoned mines. He was convicted of killing 14 women and was sentenced to life imprisonment on February 26, 2004. Background \\"Segua\\", as he was called in his childhood, spent most of years among the streets of Puchuncav√≠. Those who knew at the school where he studied agreed that he was a quiet, introverted student. He married at the age of 22 to Monica Cistemas, a native of La Calera, and they had two daughters. Then, he spent five years with Marianela Vergara, who already had two other daughters. With her he returned to Puchuncav√≠ and reaped the reputation of a good husband. In the mid-1990s he emigrated to Iquique looking for better job opportunities, finding a job loading sacks of salt. At a party he met Nancy Boero, fourteen years older than him and a mother of six children. After two weeks they were living together and then settled in Alto Hospicio, in a sector known as \\"La Negra\\". Later they would move to \\"Autoconstrucc√≠on\\", another local sector. Soon, he left his job to start as a taxi driver illegally. It was then that he began a string of crimes, all of similar characteristics. Crimes On September 17, 1998, he picked up 17-year-old Montserrat Graciela Saravia on the waterfront of Iquique. According to his confession, she offered him money in exchange for sex. However, this young woman's real intention was to steal from him. When he noticed this, he beat her to death and left her on a beach. On November 24, 1999, while driving in Alto Hospicio, he offered 13-year-old Macarena Sanchez a ride to her school. After threatening her with a knife and raping her, he tied her hands and threw her into the Huantajaya Pique, which is more 220 meters deep. In February 2000 he attacked twice in less than a week; the first was Sara Gomez on February 21, and just 2 days later 23-year-old cellphone promoter Angelica Lay, both of whom were killed in the middle of the desert. On March 23 of the same year, exactly one month after the fourth murder, he assaulted and murdered 14-year-old Laura Zola, and like Sanchez, she was raped and murdered in Huantajaya. Then, on April 5, he attacked Katherine Arce, whom he raped and murdered like Angelica Lay, then buried her body in an unofficial garbage dump. On May 22, 17-year-old Patricia Palma left the lyceum on her way home. It was at that moment that Silva kidnapped, raped and killed her, leaving her body in Huantajaya along with the corpses of Sanchez and Zola. Eleven days later, on June 2, he attacked again. He raped and murdered Macarena Montecinos in the \\"Pampa El Molle\\" sector, who suffered the same fate as Lay and Arce. The same fate befell 15-year-old Viviana Garay, who was intercepted, raped and killed with a blow to the head. The luck would be different this time, since the father of the last minor mobilized the relatives of other victims, who according to the authorities and the police had fled from their homes, immersed in poverty, to Peru or Bolivia, looking for a better future. Because of this, Perez did not attack for nine months, but on April 17, 2001, he struck again in the sector \\"Autoconstrcc√≠on\\" where he intercepted a child under 16 years identified as Maritza, threatening her with a knife and raping her, but did not kill her. Later she managed to escape and returned home. They took her to the hospital, where they took samples of the aggressor's semen. Although Maritza wasn't able to see her attacker due to the darkness, months later, when they checked him, she recognized his voice. They compared the DNA samples and they were identical. Reactions of the press and victims' relatives During all that time, the mysterious disappearances of so many young women from Alto Hospicio reached national coverage. However, the authorities of the time - mainly under the Secretary of Interior at the time, Jorge Burgos  and the police assumed that it was most likely that the young people fled their homes due to poverty, possibly migrating to Tacna or Bolivia. There were even some suggestions that the girls probably engaged in prostitution. This fact diverted even more attention from the true motive of the disappearances. However, with the disappearance of Viviana Garay generated a totally unexpected reaction. The father of the girl, Orlando Garay, mobilized the other affected families. Only then did the event become news, so the crimes briefly stopped. The Mea Culpa program made a special about this case in 2003. Discovery of the murderer Searching for the truth Orlando Garay, father of one of the victims Viviana Garay, began to fight for the truth and did not accept the authorities' speculations, selling his fisherman's boat to gather the families of other disappeared girls to find answers. On July 18, 2000, a bag and clothes belonging to Viviana were found on a rubbish dump where, according to her family and friends, she never went to; That same day, in another landfill, the neighbours found Katherine Acre's backpack and uniform. On July 20, In√©s Valdivia, mother of Patricia Palma, distinguished her daughter's underwear in a ravine. This was how family members, friends and neighbours looked for the young women. Last crime and arrest On October 4, 2001, Perez made this last attack, when a young woman identified as B√°rbara Nu√±ez survived. He intercepted and attacked in the same way he did with other victims, the difference was that Silva confessed to being the murderer; After he had hit her with a stone on the head and thinking she was dead, he left. B√°rbara survived however, and managed to report the attack. That same day he was arrested; without any remorse he admitted to the murders and rapes, also confessing to having acted alone and denying having dementia. After his arrest, Perez provided the necessary information to locate the other victims' bodies. Currently, he is monitored 24 hours a day and is subjected to sleep control, after he once tried to commit suicide in his cell with a shoelace wound to a toothbrush. So far, the names of five other disappeared young and adult women emerged in Alto Hospicio area between April 1999 and August 2001. However, Silva claims to know nothing about them. Condemnation Finally, on February 26, 2004, Perez, 40 years old at the time, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the murders of 11 adolescents and 3 adults in the attempted murder of other 2. He is currently incarcerated in the high security prison of Colina I in Santiago.\\"Psychopath of Alto Hospicio\\" was sentenced to simple life imprisonment Victims According to the investigations, the 14 victims of Julio P√©rez Silva, murdered between September 12, 1998 and August 23, 2001, would be: * Viviana Garay, 16 * Katherine Arce, 16 * Patricia Palma, 17 * Macarena Montecino, 16 * Macarena S√°nchez, 14 * Laura Zola, 15 * Gisela Melgarejo, 36 * Angelica Palape, 45 * Deysi Castro, 16 * Sara Gomez, 18 * Graciela Saravia, 18 * Ornella Linares, 16 * Angelica Lay, 24 * Ivonne Carrillo, 15 References External links * \\"Julio P√©rez Silva, the murderer of Alto Hospicio\\" Biography of Julio P√©rez Silva on emol.com * Chapter of the Mea Culpa program about each crime of Julio P√©rez Silva, the Psychopath from Alto Hospicio People from Valpara√≠so Province Chilean serial killers Male serial killers Living people 1963 births 20th-century criminals 21st- century criminals Chilean people convicted of murder People convicted of murder by Chile Chilean prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment 1990s murders in Chile 1998 crimes in Chile 1998 murders in South America 1999 crimes in Chile 1999 murders in South America 2000s murders in Chile 2000 crimes in Chile 2000 murders in South America 2001 crimes in Chile 2001 murders in South America ","title":"Julio P√©rez Silva"},{"id":"47199063","text":"Nomad Foods is an American British domiciled frozen foods company.

The association is headquartered at the heritage-listed house Miegunyah in Bowen Hills. History Maryvale in 1963 The association was established in Brisbane in April 1950 as the Women's Historical Association. Its headquarters were at the heritage-listed Newstead House. In 1957 it was renamed the Queensland Women's Historical Association. From 1960 to 1983 the association placed plaques to commemorate historic sites associated with Queensland's history. In 1966, Newstead House was to be converted into a museum so the association required new headquarters. At the same time, a nearby historic house Miegunyah (then called Beverley Wood) in Bowen Hill was about to be demolished. Through a public appeal, the association raised the funds for a deposit to buy Miegunyah to restore it to its former glory. Current activities The association continue to restore and maintain Miegunyah, which is open to the public as a museum and a venue for talks, exhibitions and social events. The association maintains a library and archive and publishes books. Plaques Some of the plaques placed by the association include: * the monument at Lake Moogerah to the women of the Fassifern District * the Cactoblastis Memorial beside Myall Creek, Dalby commemorating the introduction of the Cactoblastis insect that helped eradicate the highly invasive prickly pear from Queensland farmland  Collection policy  Barrow and silver spade presented to Sir George Bowen, 1865 In the absence of a well-defined collection policy, over the years the association acquired via donations a number of items in its collection that did not fit its primary mission to collect and preserve women's history, often to save precious artifacts which might otherwise have been lost in the absence of other collecting organisations. Following the establishment of a collection policy and a review of the collection in 2016, it was decided some original items should be donated to more appropriate collections. In 1964, Roma Browne, granddaughter of the first Queensland Governor, George Bowen, donated a silver spade to the association. Bowen had used this spade to turn the first sod of the Queensland Northern Railway at Rockhampton on 27 September 1865 and had been presented with the spade as a souvenir of the occasion. In 2018, the association donated it to the State Library of Queensland. Also in 1964, Mrs Vernon Alford donated a parian ware vase to the association. It is believed to be a favourite wedding present of Mrs Louis Hope of Ormiston House. In 2018, it was donated to the Ormiston House Museum.

It is approximately long and flows through Liberty Township in Montour County and East Chillisquaque Township in Northumberland County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . Reaches of the stream are designated as impaired due to siltation caused by agriculture. Numerous bridges have been constructed across it and it lacks a riparian buffer in some reaches. Course Beaver Run begins in a pond in a valley on Montour Ridge in Liberty Township, Montour County. It flows west-southwest for about a mile before turning northwest, leaving behind Montour Ridge and entering a much larger valley. The stream eventually turns north and then northeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning northwest again. Some distance after crossing Pennsylvania Route 45, it begins meandering west-southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns west- southwest. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it leaves Montour County and enters East Chillisquaque Township, Northumberland County. It almost immediately reaches its confluence with Chillisquaque Creek. Beaver Run joins Chillisquaque Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Beaver Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The channel of Beaver Run (along with those of Chillisquaque Creek, Mauses Creek, and Kase Run) is partially created by Limestone Ridge and a range of hills running in an east- west direction through the central part of Montour County. To the south, the drainage basin of the stream is marked by Montour Ridge. Hydrology, watershed, and biology The watershed of Beaver Run has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Northumberland. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Riverside. There are a total of of streams in the watershed of Beaver Run. Of these, , or 49.4 percent, are designated as impaired. The cause of the impairment is siltation due to agriculture. At least one person has received a permit to discharge stormwater into an unnamed tributary of the stream. History Montour County Bridge No. 1 over Beaver Run Beaver Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169037. Numerous bridges have been constructed over Beaver Run. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3003 was built over the stream in 1909 and repaired in 1973. It is long and is northwest of Mooresburg. A steel truss bridge carrying T-308 was built over the stream in 1912 and repaired in 1997. It is long and is east of Potts Grove. A concrete bridge was constructed over the stream in 1924 northwest of Mooresburg. This bridge is long and carries T-318. A concrete slab bridge was constructed over the stream in 1941 and repaired in 2007, northwest of Mooresburg. This bridge is long and carries State Route 3003. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-306 was constructed across the stream in 1991. It is long and is southeast of Potts Grove. A concrete culvert bridge carrying T-843 was built across the stream in the same year, is long, and is southeast of Potts Grove. In 1999, a bridge of the same type was constructed over the stream west of Mooresburg. It is long and carries State Route 3004. Biology There are some areas along Beaver Run where the stream lacks a riparian buffer. According to the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory, planting native trees along the stream in these reaches would reduce nonpoint source pollution and raise water quality.

It was released as a single under the pseudonym Luke the Drifter by MGM Records in 1950. Background Although credited to Williams, \\"The Funeral\\" had existed for years as a poem written by Will Carleton and recounts a black child's funeral. T. Texas Tyler, who had scored a big hit with the recitation \\"Deck of Cards\\" in 1948, had recorded a version of the song titled \\"Colored Child's Funeral\\" around the same time as Williams recorded it, as did East Coast deejay Buddy Starcher. It is one of the few Hank Williams recordings that has not aged well, as biographer Colin Escott observes: :\\"By today's standards, 'The Funeral' was an uncomfortably patronizing account of a black child's funeral service. Originally a poem by Will Carleton, it was first published in August 28, 1886 in Harper's Weekly. Unlike Starcher and Tyler, though, Hank delivered 'The Funeral' in his regular voice, and was clearly extending every ounce of compassion within him. His sincerity, though, was undermined by the words...\\" Williams recorded the song in Nashville at Castle Studio at the first Luke the Drifter session on January 9, 1950 with Fred Rose producing. He was backed on the session by Don Helms (steel guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), and probably Owen Bradley or Rose (organ) Guitarist Bob McNett, who attended the session, later recalled that both Williams and Don Helms had tears in their eyes after they had finished recording: \\"'The Funeral' really touched him. When he did it, he lost himself in it.\\" It was released as a single in 1950 with \\"Beyond the Sunset as the B-side. It also appeared on the 1953 posthumous LP Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter.

V&R; is commonly described as a continuum, with two modes of online engagement at either end, making a separation between different approaches to engagement. People operating in Visitor mode have a defined goal or task, and select an appropriate online tool to meet their needs as they arise. For example, using a smartphone to search the internet for directions to a local bookstore, thus finding a particular piece of information online and then going offline to complete the task. There will be little in terms of social visibility or trace when online in Visitor mode. People operating in Resident mode are online to connect to, or to be with, other people. For example, posting to the wall in Facebook, tweeting, blogging, or posting comments on blogs. The web supports the projection of their identity and facilitates relationships. In other words, Residents live a percentage of their lives online. Unlike the Visitor mode, there will be online visibility and presence when in Resident mode. It is very common for individuals to engage online in a mixture of Visitor and Resident modes depending on what they are trying to achieve.  Background  Marc Prensky's notions of digital natives and digital immigrants has had a lasting influence on how educational institutions perceive students and technology. However, Prensky's model has been challenged by other researchers who have debated its parameters. One of these new models is the V&R; project. It contrasts with Presky's digital native in that it rejects hard divisions based on the age of the user, and instead focuses on the user's desired level of engagement.  Mapping process  A detailed Digital Visitors and Residents map of online engagement from a Health and Social Care student in the UKThe Visitor-Resident continuum illustrates the range of possible modes of engagement individuals now have available to them through the web. The corresponding Digital Visitors and Residents mapping is a tool used by educators and librarians for exploring how their institutional users are engaging with the services they provide. By having students or users map their activity, they can create a picture of their overall engagement. Mapping also can be used to gain a picture of the overall digital presence of a group or department when bringing together and overlaying multiple maps.  V&R; study  The V&R; project explored learners' motivations behind different types of engagement with the digital environment, when seeking information. The investigation focused on the sources learners turn to in order to gather information, and which on- and off-line spaces they choose to interact in as part of the learning process. The study used the Digital Visitors and Residents framework to map learners' modes of engagement in both personal and institutional contexts. The project assessed whether individual approaches shift according to the learners' educational stage or whether they develop practices/literacies in early stages that remain largely unchanged as they progress through their educational career. Learners from both the United Kingdom and the United States participated in the project. The V&R; project used both quantitative and qualitative methods for a mixed methods approach. The qualitative method of semi-structured interviews, sometimes accompanied by monthly diaries and follow-up interviews, was used to create a rich, descriptive longitudinal study of preselected individuals who represent the four educational stages (Emerging, Establishing, Embedding, and Experiencing). Findings, to date, indicate that behavior patterns vary by the participants' educational stage rather than by their age, which varies within each stage. This categorization, by educational stages rather than age, contrasts with Prensky's \\"natives and immigrants\\" paradigm. However, the V&R; notion reflects that individual choices about technology and information seeking derive from context‚Äî that is, from individuals' educational and professional priorities ‚Äî rather than from their age. The findings also indicate that people still rely on other people to get information, especially those within their personal networks. Individuals make decisions based on convenience within the context of their information needs and the situation within which the need arises. Web-based functionalities are the expected norm for services by many people, as the sources that people chose are overwhelmingly digital. Interviewees mentioned search engines and social media sites far more often than physical places, when looking for information. This reliance on digital spaces coexists with a persistent need to be in contact with other people both online and face to face. Individuals expect to use their own technology to connect with institutional (and other) resources, and to engage in Resident modes of behavior. There is also an underlying perception, particularly by US students, that sources such as Wikipedia should be avoided, creating a ‚Äúlearning black market‚Äù where these sources are covertly used and not mentioned. Mentions of the free web, as represented by major media sites and Wikipedia, also far outnumbered mentions of university databases or course management systems such as Moodle, even among graduate students. Participants in all of the educational stages frequently mentioned convenience/ease of use as an important factor in obtaining information. Undoubtedly, people seek what they need within their existing relationships, and as they move through the educational stages, their networks are increasingly populated with people who have relevant subject expertise. By the time individuals become faculty members, calling a \\"friend\\" about an article indefinitely means the friend is also an expert in the field. Relationships are a major factor in how individuals get information and whom they choose for collaboration. The desire to make contact with others also motivates people to engage with technology.  Recommendations  Services and systems need to be embedded into individual's workflow. Therefore, the institution should provide a broad range of tools for gathering information and create simple and convenient interface designs. Institutions should also eliminate any barriers between information discovery and access, along with the promotion and marketing of services academic communities. Institutions should use individual Internet practices as a guide to linking institutional resources to those on the open web by conversing with their academic constituencies and using what they already know about people using Wikipedia. It is also important to ensure that the library, or institution, has a diverse presence in digital and physical spaces, and engages in innovative strategies for making library collections come to life, using social media.  InfoKit  The infoKit draws on the findings and methods of the Jisc/OCLC funded Digital Visitors and Residents (V&R;) project which is underpinned by an alternative to Prensky's typing of technology users. It contains advice on evaluating the services you offer to your users. The focus is primarily on digital/online services but set within the broader context of more traditional services, exploring the relationship between the two.
