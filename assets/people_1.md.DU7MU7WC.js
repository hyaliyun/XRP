He is best known for having quit the Liberal Party of Canada because of his isolationist opposition to Canada's entry into World War II and for campaigning against the government during the Conscription Crisis of World War II. Early life and career Lacombe was born and raised in Sainte-Scholastique, Quebec. He studied law at the University of Montreal and began his practice in 1923 working out of law offices in both Sainte-Scholastique and Montreal. He earned fame for his involvement in several high profile murder cases.http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/LigoriLacombe.htm Political career Lacombe was first elected to parliament as the Liberal MP for Laval—Two Mountains, Quebec in the 1925 federal election. He was re- elected in 1926 but defeated by former Quebec Conservative Party leader Arthur Sauvé in the 1930 federal election. Lacombe returned to parliament as a Liberal in the 1935 federal election defeating federal Minister of Marine and Fisheries Lucien Henri Gendron who had opted to run in Laval—Two Mountains after Sauvé was appointed to the Senate of Canada. =Opposition to World War II= On September 10, 1939, Lacombe broke with the Liberal Party to vote against Canada's entry into World War II. He and fellow maverick Liberal Edouard Lacroix introduced an amendment calling for \\"non-participation\\" in the war, reflecting some reluctance in French Canada to join Britain in war. The two MPs, who proved to be the amendment's only supporters, were condemned in a Globe and Mail editorial the following day as \\"two French-Canadians who gained eternal distinction by an attitude unworthy of their people and country.\\" Last updated: 5 December 2008. Via Canadian Museum of Civilization digital collections. He stood as an \\"Independent Liberal\\" in the 1940 federal election and was re-elected, defeating the official Liberal nominee by almost 2,000 votes. Later that year, Lacombe and Lacroix attempted to lead a revolt of Quebec MPs against the National Resources Mobilization Act. The bill gave the government emergency powers to mobilize resources, including manpower for the war effort, called up all men between the ages of 19 and 45 for a thirty-day training period, and required everyone over the age of 16 to register with the government in preparation for a possible draft. Lacombe and Lacroix moved an amendment that would have substituted the measures of the act with a statement that Canadian participation in the war must be free, voluntary and moderate. The government responded during the debate by insisting that the measures are for home defence only and that there would be no conscription for overseas service.Ernest Lapointe: Mackenzie King's Great Quebec Lieutenant by Lita-rose Betcherman. Toronto: University of Toronto Press 2002, page 313-314 In 1942, Liguiori formed the Parti Canadien to run candidates in two federal by- elections on a platform opposing the imposition of conscription and to oppose Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's plan to hold a plebiscite on conscription. The party stood candidates against Liberal Louis St. Laurent in Quebec East and Gaspard Fauteux in Montreal St. Mary and did well enough to inspire other anti-conscriptionists to form the Bloc populaire canadien later that year. Lacombe used the party as a platform to campaign for a \\"no\\" vote during the April plebiscite on conscription. In June he invited Quebec Liberal MPs who opposed conscription to join his party but had no takers, remaining the party's sole MP. He subsequently was part of an unofficial \\"Independents Group\\" of five anti-conscription MPs led by Frédéric Dorion.\\"'Something Different' Is Party Cardin to Lead In Protest Against King\\", Globe and Mail, April 26, 1945 =Later political career= In the weeks before the 1945 federal election, Lacombe and the other members of the Independents Group led by Dorion joined with former Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Joseph Arthur Cardin, who had quit the Mackenzie King cabinet in 1942 over the issue of conscription, to form the \\"National Front\\" which was to be a united nationalist party. However, Cardin dropped the National Front project a month before the election when several nationalist candidates and groups failed to join and Lacombe was re-elected an Independent MP, defeating his Liberal opponent by 300 votes. He resigned from the House of Commons in 1948 in order to accept an appointment as district magistrate by the provincial government of Maurice Duplessis.\\"Duplessis Names L.

It is also home to the Grutas of Carlos Pacheco, a smaller system, as well as two subterranean rivers which have carved out tunnels in the rock. The park has outdoor pursuit attractions such as rappelling, and rock climbing in Limontitla Canyon. as well as the two underground rivers to explore. It also has a small botanical garden, a pool and places to camp. Geography The park is located in the Sierra Madre del Sur, primarily in the northeast part of Guerrero state. This section of the Sierra Madre del Sur is made of rock, mostly limestone, that was formed under oceans millions of years ago. The caverns extend through the municipalities of Pilcaya, Tetipac and Taxco of Guerrero state, and extend into Morelos state in the municipality of Coatlán del Río. The parks extends over 2,700 hectares of land, and is located southwest of Mexico City, near the silversmithing town of Taxco. This is the well-known cave system in Mexico, and popular for caving. The park is visited by about 350,000 people annually, generating an income of about 8 million pesos each year. Grutas de Cacahuamilpa One of the formations in the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa Passing through one of the salons of the caverns One of the main corridors of the caves Cacahuamilpa is one of the largest cave systems in the world. It is a \\"live\\" cave system, meaning that groundwater still filters down into it, and that the formations there are still growing. Inside the cavern system are ninety large \\"salons\\" separated by large natural rock walls and connected to one another via a central gallery. However, only about twenty of these are fully explored and open to the public. Most of these salons are located under the Cerro de la Corona, a limestone mountain ridge. borehole openings. These salons average about forty meters wide, and vary in height from twenty to 81 meters. Most have names which reflect the major formations found in them such as the Goat Salon, the Throne Salon and the Cathedral Salon. All the openings numerous rock formations growing from both the ceiling and the floor. One of the drier salons has been dubbed the “Auditorium”. It has a large flat floor and has been outfitted with seats. It is rented out for events, and has been the site for a number of concerts including one in 2007 by Miguel Bosé and one by the Acapulco Philharmonic Orchestra in 2009. Tours of the open cave system run every hour and last about two hours. On the walkway to the entrance there are a couple of amate trees (Ficus insipida) with their roots wound around the rocky walls of Limontitla Canyon. The entrance is a large arch about forty meters wide and twelve meters tall. From the entrance, one descends about twenty meters to the level of the caverns. The path has a mostly level cement walkway, and there is artificial illumination on both the path and parts of the salons. However, since it is a live cave, the high humidity can make the trek uncomfortable for some people. At least parts of the cave system have been known for centuries, and parts have been occupied since pre-Hispanic times. Excavations in the caverns have produced fragments of pottery. This area was home to the Olmec people, and later the Chontal tribe. Both peoples used the caves for ceremonial purposes. The original name of the caves was “Salachi.” The current name, “Cacahuamilpa,” comes from a location near the cave entrance and means “peanut field.” After the Conquest, the existence of the caves was kept hidden from the Spaniards by the indigenous peoples. Credit for the “discovery” of the caves is given to Manuel Sainz de la Peña Miranda, who used the caves in 1834 to hide from Spanish authorities, which prompted a thorough search of the area. In 1866, Dominik Bilimek and Maximiliano von Habsburg made the first biospeleological visit to the cave. F. Bonet surveyed and mapped the cave up to 1,380 meters in 1922 and it was opened to the public during that decade. The first scientific expedition to the caves was organized by the Secretary of the French Legation in 1935, and the national park was established in 1936 by President Lázaro Cárdenas. Guided tours began in 1969, and a second survey in 1987 established the cave system’s length at between four and five kilometers. In one of the salons is a gravesite. The story behind this grave is that an Englishman got lost exploring the cave and eventually died of starvation. He was accompanied by a dog, which he sent to get aid. However, no one on the outside paid any attention to the dog, so it returned to the cave to die along with its master. When the remains were found, they were buried there with rock and a simple cross. Grutas de Carlos Pacheco One of the examples of stalactite The Grutas de Carlos Pacheco are located 400 meters to the south of the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa. They were named after Mexican General Carlos Pacheco, who fought against the French Intervention in Mexico. Just beyond the entrance the cave divides into two branches. The infiltration of water into these caverns is minimal and parts are entirely dry. For this reason, this is considered to be a fossilized cave. The stalagmites and stalactites here stopped forming hundreds of years ago. However, a number of these formation are very uncommon and some seem to defy gravity. These caves can be visited by arranging a tour separate from the tour of the Cacahuamilpa Caverns. Other features of the park Entrance to the Cacahuamilpa Caves Limontitla Botanical Garden outside the caverns The park has two underground rivers called the Chontalcoatlán, which is eight km long, and the San Jeronimo, which is 12 km long. The tunnels that have been formed by these rivers are still completely active, as the water continues to cut away little by little at the rock. Both have areas with rocks and sandy beaches on each side and the darkness is complete in much of the tunnels’ lengths. The San Jeronimo River has its origins in natural springs that lie in San Pedro Zictepec, Mexico State. The walls of the cavity in which it flows are up to eighty meters high. It is possible for visitors to explore this river, which requires about seven hours to do so; however, it is the easier of the two to explore as it is more level. The waters of the Chontalcoatlán originate from the Nevado de Toluca. Its descent underground has carved out an entrance fifty meters high. It is also possible to visit this natural tunnel although it is necessary to get to the entrance by vehicle. It is relatively easy to travel to a point called La Caraboya or La Ventana. However, after this point, the river descends steeply and those not in good physical condition are not advised to continue. Just after the two rivers reemerge above ground, they join to form the Amacuazac River, which is a tributary of the Balsas River. Rock climbing in this park is highly recommended by the Squamishrock rock climbing club. They describe it as having “collapse followed by several long, full of tufas, stalactites and Chorreras ... (Route 7 Mala Fama has long run the vast bovedon's Chanchullo ...) “ There are 45 rock climbing routes with grades from 10b to 13d of. Route types are desplome and techo and the rocks are mostly limestone with stalactites. The Limontitla Botanical Garden exists to demonstrate the native flora that exists in this subtropical, mostly deciduous forest. Tours of the garden can be done alone or with a guide to explain the species on display here. The best time to visit the garden is during the rainy season (approx. June to October) when everything is green and in bloom. The park also has a large swimming pool located in a point that overlooks the place where the San Jeronimo and Chontalcoatlán Rivers meet to form the Amacuazac. Popular culture Parts of the movie Tarzan and the Valley of Gold were filmed at the caverns.

Its purpose was to act as a social switchboard for people living there. History In early 1967 the Diggers were promoting a new type of philosophy and life concept in the Haight Ashbury. With media coverage of the district increasing, a local resident Al Rinker visualized the need for a service providing news and information about the Hippie movement. He rented an apartment at 1830 Fell Street in early 1967, adjacent to the Panhandle of Golden Gate Park, to act as both his home and headquarters of his conceptual \\"Switchboard\\". Al found willing assistants in George Darling and Danny to assist with his concept of a human switchboard. While he and the volunteers were doing this, the \\"Human Be In\\" took place and the Fillmore Auditorium was gaining national prominence. News coverage of the Haight Ashbury skyrocketed bringing in more people with more work required to keep the Switchboard going. The rapid influx of people flooding the area created an immediate need for some services that Al had not originally considered. One of these was in finding safe lodging (Crash Pads) for the wandering jobless hippies that arrived without any means of support. This program proved so popular that Al's office (living room) was changed to the \\"We will help you find a place to stay\\" room. Al moved his office to a tiny room next to the kitchen. The Switchboard attracted additional volunteers Ron Small and Ken Englander to assist with the many tasks the Switchboard wanted to accomplish. Social networking took a back seat to the more critical services required by the population explosion. In summary, the Switchboard was created, then made useful by events not originally considered and grewEvening Independent article about the Switchboard and Community activities, Jul 26, 1968 to fill those needs as well as those in its original plan. Social Events 1967–1968 * Music concert – On August 15, 1967, Happening House planned an arts and crafts fair\\"The Haight Ashbury - A History \\" by Charles Perry Random House 1984, page 143 followed by a free live concert in the Panhandle. About 15 bands were to perform however the police would not issue a permit for the live music portion of the fair. The Switchboard and Happening House then jointly sponsored a live music concert at Sokel Hall on Page Street as a follow up to the fair. * Softball Games - As a fund raising activity, the Switchboard formed a softball team ** In July 1967 there was a radio broadcast game between the Switchboard and the KNEW radio staff. A bevy of Playboy playmates were scheduled to participate and play an inning or two. While enough players from the Switchboard and KNEW showed up to play, no Playmates ever arrived at the game. ** In August 1967, the Switchboard played its second and last game against Happening House. This received TV news coverage but notes from the game do not mention on which TV station(s). They do mention the game was won by the Switchboard by a score of 28-16. * The infamous cocktail party\\"We are the people our parents warned us against\\" by Nicholas von Hoffman, LCCN:68013465—In the heyday of the 1967 summer, Al and Ron Small were invited to speak on a local radio talk show. From ideas sown during that broadcast, it was decided to have a cocktail party that would be attended by both the \\"straights\\" (political figures, newspaper figures, authoritarian figures like the police) and the \\"Hips\\" (founders and invited staff of (1) the Psychedelic Shop (Ron Thelin and his brother Jay Thelin), (2) the Switchboard (Al Rinker, George Darling, and many others), (3)The Diggers, (4)The Free Clinic (Dr. David E. Smith) and other organizations active in the \\"Hip scene\\"). Al was contacted by someone calling himself Herb who professed to be a journalist. Herb wanted to provide monetary support for the party in exchange for interviews with Al and others at the Switchboard. He wrote Al a check for $1500.00 not an insignificant sum at that time. The money went toward loads of booze and some party food (no drugs). John Shelley the Mayor of San Francisco and Herb CaenHerb Caen column San Francisco Chronicle 1967 \\"Mayor visits Switchboard Get together a popular journalist at the San Francisco Chronicle (not the Herb above) both made appearances and the free flowing alcohol made for a lot of camaraderie. But not much came of the event except that the check Al had been given bounced and Herb disappeared after the party. While this was not the only reason, the Switchboard began to change. Al had financial problems and the mood of the Haight itself had changed. * In late September 1967, many of the shops in the district began to display a stack of 4×5 cards on their counters proclaiming \\"Funeral Notice for Hippie\\". \\"Friends are invited to attend services beginning at sunrise, October 6, 1967 at Buena Vista Park\\". Al actively supported the funeral concept. Al and many of the original Digger group had realized that the media had exploited the word \\"Hippie\\" to have a or be a negative concept and decided to have a funeral to end the negative connotation that had become attached to the word. The media once again twisted the purpose of the event and broadcast the story nationwide calling it \\"The Death of the Hippie\\" without explaining the true purpose of the procession. During the days preceding the event, Al Rinker described the event as the beginning of the end. Ron Thelin gave away everything in the Psychedelic Shop to the customers who came in. The funeral procession went from the park down Haight St and ended in the Panhandle. Ron (of the Switchboard) was one of the pallbearers carrying a trinket filled casket. It was emblematic of the fate of the hippie movement and of the Switchboard. The Psychedelic Shop closed for good right after the funeral. The Switchboard lingered on but withered. Al left for more remote northern territories in 1970.Death of Hippie Parade Later period After the departure of Al Rinker, Ken Englander and others took up the Switchboard concept. They moved to a storefront office at 1797 Haight St. It went through a number of moves and forum changes through the 1990s. Before he left, Al Rinker transferred the Haight Ashbury Switchboard's 501 (c)(3) (non profit tax status) to Pam Hardt and Jed Riffe.

Parker. Though set in present day, it is a prequel to Parker's venerable Spenser series of novels. Unlike the rest of the Spenser series, Chasing the Bear is a young adult novel and not strictly detective fiction. Plot Spenser, while relaxing at a park with his love interest, Susan Silverman, reflects on some experiences in his life as a youth, before becoming a detective. Spenser conveys that he grew up in an all-male household, his mother dying immediately before he was delivered by caesarean section. His household consisted of himself, his father, and his two maternal uncles. They were all uneducated, but eager to learn, worked in construction, and boxed from time to time to earn extra money. His uncles taught him to box from a very young age, three years old. They also read volumes of classic novels to him at night. The main narrative conveys Spenser's adventures with a girl, Jeannie Haden. Jeannie was about Spenser's age, but was just a friend. Her father was an abusive drunk. One day Spenser saw her in her father's car, mouthing the words \\"Help\\" over and over again. Spenser, along with his dog, Pearl, follows the car and, eventually, Jeannie's father's boat down a river. He locates her and her father on a small island in the river, next to a lean-to. After a brief encounter with her father, Luke, Spenser is able to rescue Jeannie some time later. They escape downriver on Spenser's rowboat, eventually leading Luke Haden to his death. Spenser's father and uncles tell him he \\"did good\\" and needn't report the death, or his role in it. But he does, but the local law enforcement doesn't charge Spenser with any crime. Spenser relates that Jeannie had a crush on him, but he didn't return her amore. But he managed to let her down and remain friends. As a favor to Jeannie, he goes on to protect a student of Mexican descent, Aurelio Lopez. Lopez was targeted by white classmates and beaten up on occasion. After Spenser's protection, he doesn't get bullied any longer. However, his relationship with Lopez alienates him somewhat from his white classmates, many of whom he had known since the first grade. At the end, Spenser is confronted by the entire white gang of about fifteen boys. Before any fighting convenes, Spenser's father and uncles arrive and mediate a fair fight between just Spenser and the leader of the gang, Leo Roemer. Because of his boxing training, Spenser quickly wins the fight. He doesn't have any trouble from the gang following the showdown. The recollection ends with Spenser going off to college in Boston on a football scholarship. After an injury his second year, he loses his scholarship and is unable to afford any further schooling and joins the police force, choosing to stay in Boston rather than returning to his home town. Reception Chasing the Bear was received favorably by most critics,Book Review: Chasing the Bear by Mel Odom from BookCritics.comChasing the Bear by Robert B. Parker from BookPage.com though some noted that it is probably better suited towards older young adults (mid-teens) rather than typical young adult books, which target a younger audience. Some critics found the switching between present-day and past to be distracting and felt it may alienate younger readers new to the series. Critics pointed out that there is no one mystery Spenser pursues, but rather shorter adventures which may disappoint some fans of the series.Chasing the Bear by Robert B.

On 18 Jan 1937, Group Captain Smart took command of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath where he soon made his opinion of contractors known: \\"Our job is to test aircraft, not to tell the constructors how to design them.\\" This sentence was from a speech made by Smart during the \\"Sixteenth Annual Contractors' Dinner.\\" His speech was greeted with applause. The significance of the remark, and the sly dig contained therein, was not lost on any one of those present.Flight, p. 576 In 1939, Smart became the Commander of the British Forces in Iraq. =Second World War= Air Vice Marshal Smart was the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) at RAF Habbaniya in the Kingdom of Iraq when Iraqi rebels took up strong positions on the plateau overlooking the base with the objective of overrunning the base. He was also AOC of all RAF forces in Iraq and reported to Arthur Longmore and to Air Vice Marshal (Acting Air Marshal) Arthur Tedder of the RAF Middle East Command. During the tense period of time after the Iraqis positioned themselves on the plateau, Smart communicated directly with the British Ambassador to Iraq, Kinahan Cornwallis who was also in contact with London. Habbaniya. Smart's tactics to defend the Habbaniya cantonment was to mount continuous bombing and strafing attacks with as many aircraft as possible.Jackson, p. 151 At 05:00 on 2 May, 33 aircraft from Habbaniya,Playfair, p. 183 out of the 56 operational aircraft based there,Mackenzie, p. 95 and eight Wellington bombers, from RAF Shaibah, began the attack. What became known as the Anglo-Iraqi War was now under way. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill hoped that Smart would be able to hold out at Habbaniya until Habforce could advance from Palestine and relieve him on 12 May. However, in a matter of days, the Iraqi forces were suffering heavy losses. Late on 6 May, the Iraqis abandoned the plateau and left much equipment. In the end, the flying column of Habforce, Kingcol, did not reach Habbaniya until 18 May. On 25 May, the main body of Habforce arrived. On 5 May, AVM Smart was injured in a car accident during the night-time blackout Smart, p. 146 (author is his daughter.) and was evacuated out of Habbaniya on medical grounds with multiple injuries Smart, p. 153 (author is his daughter.) Smart was evacuated to Basra and then onto India, together with his wife and daughter (who had been tending the wounded in the hospital but were evacuated from Habbaniya to Basrah on the 3rd day of the Siege).Smart, p. 132 (author is his daughter.) Colonel Ouvry Roberts assumed de facto command of the land operations at RAF Habbaniya. AVM John D'Albiac, who had just returned from Greece, took command of the aerial forces.Playfair, p. 188 Also on 7 May, apparently unaware of Smart's injury, Churchill sent the following message to Smart: \\"Your vigorous and splendid action has largely restored the situation. We are all watching the grand fight you are making. All possible aid will be sent. Keep it up!\\".Churchill, Chapter 14, The Revolt in Iraq, p. 230 On 17 November 1941, Smart was named AOC of No. 17 (Operational Training) Group. On 1 September 1945, Smart retired from the RAF.

Surface exposure dating is used to date glacial advances and retreats, erosion history, lava flows, meteorite impacts, rock slides, fault scarps, cave development, and other geological events. It is most useful for rocks which have been exposed for between 10 years and 30,000,000 years. Cosmogenic radionuclide dating The most common of these dating techniques is Cosmogenic radionuclide dating. Earth is constantly bombarded with primary cosmic rays, high energy charged particles -- mostly protons and alpha particles. These particles interact with atoms in atmospheric gases, producing a cascade of secondary particles that may in turn interact and reduce their energies in many reactions as they pass through the atmosphere. This cascade includes a small fraction of hadrons, including neutrons. When one of these particles strikes an atom it can dislodge one or more protons and/or neutrons from that atom, producing a different element or a different isotope of the original element. In rock and other materials of similar density, most of the cosmic ray flux is absorbed within the first meter of exposed material in reactions that produce new isotopes called cosmogenic nuclides. At Earth's surface most of these nuclides are produced by neutron spallation. Using certain cosmogenic radionuclides, scientists can date how long a particular surface has been exposed, how long a certain piece of material has been buried, or how quickly a location or drainage basin is eroding. The basic principle is that these radionuclides are produced at a known rate, and also decay at a known rate. Accordingly, by measuring the concentration of these cosmogenic nuclides in a rock sample, and accounting for the flux of the cosmic rays and the half-life of the nuclide, it is possible to estimate how long the sample has been exposed to the cosmic rays. The cumulative flux of cosmic rays at a particular location can be affected by several factors, including elevation, geomagnetic latitude, the varying intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, solar winds, and atmospheric shielding due to air pressure variations. Rates of nuclide production must be estimated in order to date a rock sample. These rates are usually estimated empirically by comparing the concentration of nuclides produced in samples whose ages have been dated by other means, such as radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, or optically stimulated luminescence. The excess relative to natural abundance of cosmogenic nuclides in a rock sample is usually measured by means of accelerator mass spectrometry. Cosmogenic nuclides such as these are produced by chains of spallation reactions. The production rate for a particular nuclide is a function of geomagnetic latitude, the amount of sky that can be seen from the point that is sampled, elevation, sample depth, and density of the material in which the sample is embedded. Decay rates are given by the decay constants of the nuclides. These equations can be combined to give the total concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides in a sample as a function of age. The two most frequently measured cosmogenic nuclides are beryllium-10 and aluminum-26. These nuclides are particularly useful to geologists because they are produced when cosmic rays strike oxygen-16 and silicon-28, respectively. The parent isotopes are the most abundant of these elements, and are common in crustal material, whereas the radioactive daughter nuclei are not commonly produced by other processes. As oxygen-16 is also common in the atmosphere, the contribution to the beryllium-10 concentration from material deposited rather than created in situ must be taken into account. 10Be and 26Al are produced when a portion of a quartz crystal (SiO2) is bombarded by a spallation product: oxygen of the quartz is transformed into 10Be and the silicon is transformed into 26Al. Each of these nuclides is produced at a different rate. Both can be used individually to date how long the material has been exposed at the surface. Because there are two radionuclides decaying, the ratio of concentrations of these two nuclides can be used without any other knowledge to determine an age at which the sample was buried past the production depth (typically 2–10 meters). Chlorine-36 nuclides are also measured to date surface rocks. This isotope may be produced by cosmic ray spallation of calcium or potassium.

Under the HOPE VI grant program introduced by the Clinton administration, the Garden City-influenced Aliso Village was demolished and replaced by a New Urbanist development, Pueblo del Sol. Whereas Aliso Village consisted mostly of apartment buildings, Pueblo del Sol's housing stock is largely semi- detached single family apartments. Most are subsidized to varying degrees. The project reduced the number of units from 685 to 377,http://www.mccormackbaron.com/component/sobi2/?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid;=26&sobi2Id;=48 a 45% reduction that displaced the majority of the former residents. The project has been criticized for reducing the number of units, at a time when Los Angeles suffers a severe shortage of affordable housing. The families that were displaced from the public housing receive priority in the rental or purchase of the new units. (Displaced households can use Section 8 vouchers to find temporary—or permanent—housing elsewhere.)

This is permitted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The secured party in a strict foreclosure takes physical possession of collateral, and the debt for which the property served as collateral is discharged as fulfilled. Strict foreclosure is an effective remedy where the creditor has a need or use for the physical property itself. For example, a seller of goods that forecloses on goods in which it had a purchase money security interest (PMSI) may then return the foreclosed goods to its inventory and resell them at its leisure. Similarly, a company that operates equipment and sells some surplus equipment (such as a taxicab company that sells some of its vehicles, or a landscaper that sells excess gardening equipment) can put the foreclosed equipment back into the service of the company. Strict foreclosure is also an effective remedy where the value of the goods foreclosed is the equivalent of the debt due and owing, and the creditor can easily sell the goods for that value. In order to effect a strict foreclosure, the creditor must transmit a proposal indicating their desire to foreclose, which must be sent to the debtor and to secondary obligors (guarantors of the debt). If the collateral is not consumer goods, the notice must also be sent to other secured parties known to the foreclosing creditor, either because they have notified the foreclosing creditor of their interest, or because they have perfected their interest by filing the appropriate documents with the state secretary of state. If any notified party objects within 20 days, irrespective of reason, then strict foreclosure will not be permitted. Instead, the creditor will have to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, and will recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale. This prevents subordinated creditors from having their interest in the value of the property cut off, since any amount recovered in the sale over and above the amount of the foreclosing creditor's debt will go to the remaining creditors. A recent modification to the rule provides that strict foreclosure will also not be permitted if the debtor has repaid at least 60% of the loan for which consumer goods have been put up as collateral, or has paid 60% or cash price of consumer goods bought under a PMSI. This rule prevents the creditor from realizing a windfall gain by foreclosing on property that is substantially more valuable than the remaining debt. If the 60% threshold has been met, then the creditor will have to sell the collateral within 90 days, and must recoup its debt from the proceeds of that sale, returning all excess to the debtor.

It was a European version of Country Music Television. The channel started in 1992. It was closed down on March 31, 1998 after substantial losses. On the Astra 19.2°E position, the channel switched satellite several times and was for a long time only available as a daytime service. It first launched in 1993 on transponder 41 on Astra 1C as part of the Sky Multichannels package, where it was broadcasting on The Discovery Channel's daytime space and was on air from midnight until 4pm. It moved to transponder 24 on Astra 1B in September 1994, which allowed it to extend its broadcast hours until 7 p.m. It finally ended up on transponder 51 in 1996 and was then allowed to go 24 hours on Astra. For cable networks, a 24-hour feed of CMT Europe was maintained on Intelsat 27.5 degrees west. It was available in several European countries, for example in Sweden. It was carried as part of the Scandinavian channel Sky Entertainment when it launched in September 1997. In the UK, it was available 24 hours a day on cable. However, a number of cable companies dropped CMT in autumn 1996, thereby massively reducing the potential audience for the channel.

It is within Close To The Edge Provincial Park and Protected Area about 160 km east of Prince George, British Columbia. Name origin The cave is named for its remarkable cliffside location; a caver standing on the entrance rampart can look down the 255-metre entrance shaft on one side and down some 700 metres to the valley floor on the other. This topographic oddity is also reminiscent of the artwork on the 1972 record album Close to the Edge by the band Yes, which featured lakes improbably perched on mountain summits. Local cavers also felt close to the edge of their abilities while exploring the unprecedented deep shaft. Cave setting and form The 20m wide entrance to Close to the Edge is located in a cliff near the summit of an unnamed mountain, but is hidden by a natural rampart and thus only visible from the air. The entrance shaft is 255 m deep, by far the deepest in Canada, and often sports a 20-metre-long overhanging icicle. This is followed by shafts of 32 m, 17 m, 7 m, 10 m, 10 m, 8 m, 9 m, 68 m, and 9 m, ending at a sump. The surveyed length of all passages only totals 967 metres, while its overall depth of 472 metres makes it the fourth- deepest cave in Canada. It is believed that the sump water reappears at Twin Falls Resurgence some 600 m below the entrance. Exploration The first recorded entrance sighting was in 1985 by cavers in a helicopter supporting a nearby expedition. The following year the cave was explored to a frozen mud and stone blockage at the base of the second pitch at a depth of 263 meters. The blockage was removed in 1994 by a team led by the team of Neeld Messler, Jim Hewett and Stephen Alvarez. A final exploration in 2001 by a team led by Canadians John Donovan, Jason Morgan, Dan Patch and Australian Warwick M Green (Formally known as Warwick Baggs) pushed the cave from the blockage and discovered the sump at -472 m. This team surveyed and mapped the cave and published their findings with the assistance of Dr Chas Young of the University of Calgary. See also *List of caves in Canada References *McKenzie, I.

The capital of the dynasty was Bikrampur in present-day Munshiganj District of Bangladesh. This Hindu Vaishnava dynasty is different from an earlier Buddhist Dabnyawatti dynasty (c. 8th-9th centuries) of Samatata, whose capital was Danyawatti. Four rulers of this dynasty are known from the inscriptions: Shantideva, Viradeva, Anandadeva and Bhavadeva. The rule of the Devas was indeed a period of peace, prosperity, and creative excellence, and may be designated as the \\"Golden Age\\". Rulers The major sources of the history of this dynasty are the three copperplate inscriptions of Damodaradeva issued in years 1156, 1158 and 1165 of the Saka era, which were his 4th, 6th and 13th regnal years. Although there are many myths about this dynasty, none were proved with strong evidence. The first three rulers are known from the Chittagong copperplate inscription of Damodaradeva dated Saka era 1165. The first ruler of this dynasty was Purushottamadeva, who rose from the position of a village chief (gramani). His son Madhumathana or Madhusudanadeva was the first independent ruler of this dynasty, who assumed the title of nripati. He was succeeded by his son Vasudeva and Vasudeva was succeeded by his son Damodaradeva. Damodaradeva (reigned 1231–1243) was the most powerful ruler of this dynasty. He took the title of Ariraja-Chanura-Madhava-Sakala-Bhupati-Chakravarti. The inscriptional evidences show that his kingdom was extended up to the present- day Comilla-Noakhali-Chittagong region. A later ruler of this dynasty Ariraja- Danuja-Madhava Dasharathadeva extended his kingdom up to Bikrampur and made it his capital.Roy, Niharranjan (1993). Bangalir Itihas: Adiparba Calcutta: Dey's Publishing, , pp.408-9 He issued an inscription from here. Yahya bin Ahmad in his Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi mentioned that he (referred as Danuj Rai of Sonargaon by Yahya) made an alliance with Ghiyas-ud-Din Balban in 1281.

It is commonly known as the collared earthstar, the saucered earthstar, or the triple earthstar—and less commonly by the alternative species name Geastrum indicum. It is the largest member of the genus Geastrum (or earthstar fungi) and expanded mature specimens can reach a tip-to-tip length of up to . Immature fruit bodies are spherical—somewhat resembling puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely buried in the ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits around the perimeter of the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released. The species is widespread and can be found in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and both North and South America. The fungus has a history of use in the traditional medicines of native North America and China. Fruit bodies have been analyzed chemically to determine their lipid content, and various chemical derivatives of the fungal sterol ergosterol have been identified. Taxonomy and classification alt=Grainy black and white photograph showing the face and torso of an about 50-year-old bearded man looking into the camera. He is wearing a jacket, and collared shirt that appears to be buttoned only at the top. The species was first described scientifically, by German botanist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn, as Geaster triplex in 1840. The earlier genus name Geaster, introduced by Italian botanist Pier Antonio Micheli in 1727 in Nova Plantarum Genera, is considered an orthographical variant of Geastrum. Junghuhn, who was living in Indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora, discovered the type specimen on Mount Panggerangi on the island Java, at an elevation between . Today, the type specimen is kept at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. The morphological feature used by Junghuhn to differentiate G. triplex from other similar earthstars was the collar-like structure of the inner layer of the exoperidium. American mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd would later erroneously suggest that the species was a \\"giant form\\" of Geastrum saccatum. Several authors have regarded Geastrum indicum as the correct name for G. triplex. This is because G. indicum—a species described by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1832 as Cycloderma indicum and then moved to Geastrum by Stephan Rauschert in 1959—may be the same species as Geastrum triplex. If it is in fact the same species, the first published name (i.e., G. indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G. indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G. triplex maintained as the correct name for the species. Stellan Sunhede's 1989 monograph of European species of Geastrum follows V. J. Staněk's concept for the infrageneric (below the level of genus) placement of Geastrum, and places G. triplex with species that do not incorporate and encrust forest debris (section Basimyceliata). G. triplex is further categorized in subsection Laevistomata, which includes species with a fibrillose peristome—that is, made of parallel, thin, thread-like filaments. Within subsection Laevistomata it is in stirps Triplex, due to its delimited (with a distinct restricting edge) or irregularly torn peristome. The specific epithet triplex means \\"threefold\\", and refers to the three-layered peridium. Geastrum triplex has acquired several vernacular names, including the collared earthstar, the saucered earthstar, and the triple earthstar. Description Like all mushrooms, the fruit body of Geastrum triplex is the visible part of a larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly invisible fungal threads called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body—created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal—is designed to produce and disseminate spores. Geastrum triplex has the largest fruit body of the earthstar mushrooms. The immature fruit body is typically in diameter, and up to broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5 cm) after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the ostiole, covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is sessile) grayish brown to \\"wood brown\\" when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the gleba. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a columella not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited. The exoperidium's rays are long and up to 4 mm (3/16 in) thick. The outer surface of the rays (the lower surface, after expansion) and unopened specimens have a rough texture. In several Geastrum species, dirt and debris adhere to the underside, this is not the case in G. triplex. The inner fleshy layers (upper surface) of these rays are near \\"wood brown\\" in color when dried, and have a layer of surface tissue that cracks into patches. There is a great deal of variation, however, to the extent in which the upper surface tissue of the rays crack: this tissue layer may also remain closely attached as a sheet over the unsegmented part of the outer wall with the part adhering to the rays variously cracked and sometimes finally peeling off in places. In G. triplex, the bases of the rays usually break around the perimeter of the endoperidium to form a saucerlike platform or receptacle in which the endoperidium rests. However, not all specimens form this receptacle, leading to possible confusion with other Geastrum species. Curtis Gates Lloyd claimed that in tropical regions, with an abundance of high temperatures and humidity, the fungus expands rapidly, which is more conducive to the fleshy layer breaking away to form a receptacle; in more temperate areas this effect would not be as pronounced and \\"usually does not occur at all\\". The endoperidium is in diameter by high, sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome is made of radially arranged fibrils that clump together at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn. The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores are thought to be dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating a puff of air that forces the spores through the ostiole. =Microscopic characteristics= alt=About two dozen round objects that are brownish and translucent, and covered with small bumps. What appear to be the gradation lines of a ruler run horizontally through the middle of the image. The spore sac contains the gleba, which is composed of a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the capillitium), the spore-bearing cells (basidia) and the spores themselves; all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic features that help distinguish G. triplex from other superficially similar earthstars. The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5 µm in diameter. They are covered with short narrow abruptly terminating projections of a translucent (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of what appears to be encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6 µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened to the point where the interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20 µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia. =Similar species= Geastrum triplex may be confused with G. saccatum or G. fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G. triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it from the rest of the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G. triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity. Habitat and distribution alt=Six star-shaped fungi arranged in a semicircle on the ground. The bottom fungus is partially buried, and the rays of its \\"star\\" are not yet fully opened. Moving counterclockwise around the semicircle, the rays are more opened, and in the top two example, are curved downwards so as to raise the level of the circular sac above the level of the ground. Geastrum triplex is a saprobic fungus: it derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, they have been collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G. triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees. Geastrum triplex has a widespread distribution, and has been collected in Asia (China, Korea Iran, and Turkey), Australia, Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden, and the Canary Islands), and Africa (Congo, South Africa). In North America, its range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico, including the whole continental United States and Hawaii. In Central and South America the fungus has been reported from Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. Uses=Edibility= Although the fruit bodies of Geastrum triplex are nonpoisonous, they are tough and fibrous, and of \\"no alimentary interest\\". Mycologist David Arora says that they are reputed to be edible when immature—when the gleba is still white and firm—but adds that they are rarely found in this form. =In traditional medicine= Earthstars were used medicinally by Native American Indians. The Blackfoot called them ka-ka-toos, meaning \\"fallen stars\\", and according to legend, they were an indication of supernatural events. The Cherokee put fruit bodies on the navels of babies after childbirth until the withered umbilical cord fell off, \\"both as a prophylactic and a therapeutic measure\\". In traditional Chinese medicine, G. triplex is used to reduce inflammation in the respiratory tract, and to staunch bleeding and reduce swelling. =Chemistry= The fruit bodies of Geastrum triplex have been chemically analyzed and shown to contain a number of bioactive compounds, including fungal sterols such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, ergosterol, and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various fatty acids, notably myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, alpha-linolenic, and linoeic acid.

The museum has a range of flying and static aircraft displays as well as a cafe. History The museum was started in 2000 when several local businessmen, who were also aviation enthusiasts, decided to see if an existing World War II-era hangar at the Tauranga Airfield could be renovated for use. The hangar proved to be unsalvageable but the group decided to build a new facility instead and formed the Bay of Plenty Classic Aircraft Trust. The new hangar is at the entrance to the Tauranga Airport, on Jean Batten Drive, Mount Maunganui. The founders decided to focus on creating a flying museum, as opposed to one that just had static displays, with the intention of having a high number of museum aircraft movements. The museum was officially opened on Saturday 28 May 2005 with an air display and fly-past. Inside the main hangar In October 2012, the museum launched the Legacy Jet Centre and celebrated the arrival of an Aermacchi aircraft to be restored. In recognition of funding from the Legacy Trust, the main hangar was named \\"The Legacy Jet Centre\\". Currently, the museum is spread across three adjacent hangars, the first of which houses the visitor centre, cafe, and most of the museum exhibits, while the other two accommodate the bulk of the classic aircraft in working flying condition. Additional airplanes are on display outside the hangars. One of them is an old New Zealand National Airways Corporation DH-Heron, which is open to the public, but not in airworthy condition. Aims The museum aims are: * Preserve classic and historic aircraft * Support the retention of New Zealand’s aviation history The Trust focuses on preserving aircraft and memorabilia that has a connection to the Bay of Plenty area or New Zealand generally.

Summary  The book draws attention to the numerical significance of the 2006 global oil production figure: of crude oil per day is equivalent to one thousand barrels per second. He believes the transcendence of this consumption threshold marks the beginning of a historically significant “energy break point” when oil’s dominant position as a primary energy source is no longer tenable. The book examines industrial society's \\"addiction\\" to oil in its past, present and future aspects. The history of humankind’s ongoing adoption and abandonment of energy sources – wood, coal, tallow, whale oil, kerosene, etc. – illustrates a “evolutionary energy cycle”. This cycle is evident today in the problems facing the oil industry. At the time of the book’s publication, various factors — ranging from unrest in the Middle East, a “demand shock” from India and China, exceptionally elevated energy commodity prices and climate change anxiety — weakened oil’s leadership amongst all primary energy sources. The author does not commit to the inevitability of any one particular future outcome, but paints various scenarios that could lead to a peaceful and profitable resolution of the break point.  History  In order to properly comprehend the nature of the current oil break point, the author begins his exposition with a historical study of the dominant energy sources before the oil age. He depicts, for instance, the displacement of one fuel source by another (i.e. tallow—spermaceti—kerosene as an illuminant; wood—coal—oil as a primary fuel) and demonstrates how the story of energy is inextricably linked with economic development and rising living standards. The author furthermore surveys the history of the oil industry itself from its inception, including the rise and breakup of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, the curious origins of Saudi Aramco, and Winston Churchill’s fateful decision for the British Navy to switch from coal to oil. Emergent from this historical retrospective is the compelling argument that oil is not exempt from the same stages of rise and fall experienced by other previously dominant energy sources.  Break point  The book's rise to bestseller status must be attributed in part to its timing. Shortly after its 2006 publication, crude oil futures hit all-time contact highs. Moreover, the run up to US$147 per barrel of oil (West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude) in the summer of 2008 appeared to further corroborate Tertzakian’s theory of an imminent oil break point. One goal of the author, a long-serving energy analyst, was to make the far-flung structure of energy supply chains comprehensible to the layperson by retaining a “big picture” perspective. The complex processes involved in the discovery, extraction, and distribution of energy mean that major energy transitions are measured in decades, not years. Pressures on both the supply and demand side, together with associative infrastructure and industrial dependencies, is pushing oil to a tipping point. A thoroughgoing paradigm shift appears inevitable:A Thousand Barrels a second, p. x > As you read this book, we are on the cusp of a tipping point -- what I call > a break point -- that will change the way governments, corporations, and > individuals exploit and consume primary energy resources, especially crude > oil. Over the course of the next 5 to 10 years, increasingly volatile energy > prices are going to affect how you live and what you drive, not to mention > the economy, the environment, and the complex geopolitical chess match that > is now being played out for the world's precious energy resources. Although Tertzakian explores arguments from the peak oil debate, his rationale for declaring an oil break point does not hinge upon them. Reminiscent of Sheik Yamani’s famous declaration that “the Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil”, Tertzakian brackets aside the peak oil theory and demonstrates that other factors are sufficient in themselves to initiate a decline in oil's position in the global energy supply mix. Tertzakian's 2009 book The End of Energy Obesity: Breaking Today's Energy Addiction for a Prosperous and Secure Tomorrow, written four years after A Thousand Barrels a Second, offers strategies for expediting a quick rebalancing in the energy sector following the oil break point.  Rebalancing  The book concludes by painting a picture of plausible post-break point outcomes as they play out on a one-to- two decade time horizon. During these adjustment periods, nations struggle for answers, consumers suffer and complain, the economy adapts, and science surges with innovation and discovery. In the era that emerges, lifestyles change, businesses are born, and fortunes are made. Surprisingly for an energy economist, Tertzakian does not refer to a timeworn tenet of economic theory that presupposes rising demand inevitably generates adequate, if not infinite, supply. Instead, when the effects of the oil break point make themselves more broadly known, Tertzakian shows how the power of human innovation (i.e. energy conservation and efficiency) and the laws of substitution (i.e. alternative energy) will help in the re-balancing process. Despite this belief that new energy forms will begin to replace oil, the bad news is that, for the first time in the history of energy consumption, there is no “magic bullet” offering an immediate, large-scale alternative. The good news is forward-thinking nations, corporations and individuals can anticipate and navigate the coming break point. Despite the book's general optimism, Tertzakian is quite forthright in stating his belief that the \\"rebalancing\\" process involve considerable lifestyle changes. Tertzakian’s heralding of a “New Energy Era” following the oil break point is strikingly reminiscent of the “Energy-Climate Era” promulgated in Thomas Friedman’s 2008 book Hot, Flat, and Crowded.

He appeared in 13 films, and had completed his final role, in a television production, the day before his death. Biography Belmadi grew up in the northern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. His first screen appearance was in 1997, when he played a young gay beur in the short film Les Corps ouverts, directed by Sébastien Lifshitz. The film was a critical success, winning two awards (the Prix Kodak and the Prix Jean Vigo) in the category of short film in 1998. Other notable films in which Belmadi appeared include Les Amants criminels, Wild Side, Beur blanc rouge and Grande École. Belmadi played a lead rôle in the 2009 film Adieu Gary, directed by Nassim Amaouche, which won the International Critics' Week Grand Prix at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Adieu Gary went on general release in France on 22 July 2009, four days after Belmadi's death. Belmadi's last rôle was in Pigalle, a production for French television channel Canal+, which he completed on 17 July 2009. Death On 18 July 2009, at 6 a.m., the scooter which Belmadi was riding collided with a lamp post at the intersection of the Pont de Sully and the Boulevard Henri IV in Paris. He was taken to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where he died from his injuries, aged 33.Obituary (in French)  Filmography  * 1997: Les Corps ouverts - dir.

Simmons. The Prisoners Problem and the Subliminal Channel. In Advances in Cryptology – CRYPTO ’83, pages 51–67, New York, 1984. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, ed. D. Chaum. Subliminal channels in digital signature crypto systems were found in 1984 by Gustavus Simmons. Simmons describes how the \\"Prisoners' Problem\\" can be solved through parameter substitution in digital signature algorithms.Gustavus J. Simmons. The subliminal channel and digital signatures. In Proc. of the EUROCRYPT 84 workshop on Advances in cryptology: theory and application of cryptographic techniques, pages 364–378, New York, NY, USA, 1985. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc. (Note that Simmons' Prisoners' Problem is not the same as the Prisoner's Dilemma.) Signature algorithms like ElGamal and DSA have parameters which must be set with random information. He shows how one can make use of these parameters to send a message subliminally. Because the algorithm's signature creation procedure is unchanged, the signature remains verifiable and indistinguishable from a normal signature. Therefore, it is hard to detect if the subliminal channel is used. * Subliminal channels can be classified into broadband and narrowband channel types. * Broadband and narrowband channels can exist in the same datastream. * The broadband channel uses almost all available bits that are available to use. This is commonly understood to mean {≥50% but ≤90%} channel utilization. * Every channel which uses fewer bits is called a narrow-band channel. * The additional used bits are needed for further protection, e.g., impersonation. The broadband and the narrow-band channels can use different algorithm parameters. A narrow-band channel cannot transport maximal information, but it can be used to send the authentication key or datastream. Research is ongoing : further developments can enhance the subliminal channel, e.g., allow for establishing a broadband channel without the need to agree on an authentication key in advance. Other developments try to avoid the entire subliminal channel.  Examples  An easy example of a narrowband subliminal channel for normal human-language text would be to define that an even word count in a sentence is associated with the bit \\"0\\" and an odd word count with the bit \\"1\\". The question \\"Hello, how do you do?\\" would therefore send the subliminal message \\"1\\". The Digital Signature Algorithm has one subliminal broadbandGustavus J. Simmons. Subliminal communication is easy using the DSA. In EUROCRYPT ’93: Workshop on the theory and application of cryptographic techniques on Advances in cryptology, pages 218–232, Secaucus, NJ, USA, 1994.

At signing the parameter k has to be set random. For the broadband channel this parameter is instead set with a subliminal message m'. # Key generation ## choose prime p = 2347 ## choose prime q = 23 ## calculate generator g = 266 ## choose authentication key x = 1468 and send it securely to the receiver ## calculate public key y = g^x mod p = 2100 # Signing ## choose message m = 1337 ## (hash function H(m) is here substituted with a modulo reduction by 107) calculate message hash value h = m mod q = 1337 mod 107 = 53 ## instead of random value k = ? subliminal message m' = 17 is chosen ## calculate inverse of the subliminal message m'^{-1} = 19 mod 23 ## calculate signature value r = (g^k mod p) mod q = (266^{17} mod 2347) mod 23 = 12 ## calculate signature value s = k^{-1} * (h + x*r) mod q = 19 * (53 + 1468 * 12) mod 23 = 3 ## sending message with signature triple (1337; 12, 3) # Verifying ## receiver gets message triple (m; r, s) = (1337; 12, 3) ## calculate message hash h = H(m) mod q = 1337 mod 107 = 53 ## calculate inverse w = s^{-1} mod q = 8 ## calculate u_1 = (h * w) mod q = 53 * 8 mod 23 = 10 ## calculate u_2 = (r * w) mod q = 12 * 8 mod 23 = 4 ## calculate signature v = (g^{u_1} * y^{u_2} mod p) mod q = (266^{10} * 2100^4 mod 2347) mod 23 = 12 ## since v = r, the signature is valid # Message extraction on receiver side ## from triple (1337; 12, 3) ## extract message m' = 8 * (53 + 1468 * 12) mod 23 = 17 The formula for message extraction is derived by transposing the signature value s calculation formula. * s = m'^{-1} * (h + xr) mod q * s * m' = h + xr mod q * m' = s^{-1} * (h + xr) mod q Example: Using a Modulus n = pqr In this example, an RSA modulus purporting to be of the form n = pq is actually of the form n = pqr, for primes p, q, and r. Calculation shows that exactly one extra bit can be hidden in the digitally signed message. The cure for this was found by cryptologists at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in Amsterdam, who developed a Zero-knowledge proof that n is of the form n = pq. This example was motivated in part by The Empty Silo Proposal.  Example - RSA Case study  Here is a (real, working) PGP public key (using the RSA algorithm), which was generated to include two subliminal channels - the first is the \\"key ID\\", which should normally be random hex, but below is \\"covertly\\" modified to read \\"C0DED00D\\". The second is the base64 representation of the public key - again, supposed to be all random gibberish, but the English- readable message \\"//This+is+Christopher+Drakes+PGP+public+key//Who/What+is+watcHIng+you//\\" has been inserted. Adding both these subliminal messages was accomplished by tampering with the random number generation during the RSA key generation phase. PGP Key.

In May 2009, Chicago Math and Science Academy purchased the vacant Clark Mega Mall property for $5.5 million and moved to its current location at 7212 North Clark Street. The new building had 54,000 square acres, up 14,000 from the old buildings. The new building originally did not have a gym, but one was constructed and officially opened in November 2013. The school currently does not have a dedicated auditorium.

The conclave took place during the Italian Wars barely a month after the papal conclave, September 1503, and none of the electors had travelled far enough from Rome to miss the conclave.. The number of participating cardinals was thirty-eight, the College of Cardinals having been reduced by the election of Piccolomini as Pius III, who did not elevate cardinals. At a consistory on October 11, Pope Pius had proposed to make Cardinal d'Amboise's nephew a cardinal, as part of his effort to conciliate the French, but the response from the Cardinals was not enthusiastic.Marino Sanuto, I Diarii di Marino Sanuto Volume V (Venezia 1881), pp. 176-177. Background The previous conclave in September 1503 had already been caught up in the Italian Wars, surrounded by the forces of Louis XII of France, those of Ferdinand II of Aragon, and those of Cesare Borgia the son of Pope Alexander VI. Cardinal Georges d'Amboise had been the favorite candidate of Louis XII. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, who had returned to Rome on 3 September 1503, following the death of Pope Alexander VI, was also a strong papabile., p. 56 no. 661. But it was Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini, who was the favorite of the bookmakers gambling on papal elections, who had been elected on 22 September. Pius III (Francesco Todeschini-Piccolomini) was ordained a priest on 30 September 1503 and consecrated a bishop on 1 October 1503 by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the Bishop of Ostia. He was crowned as Pope Pius III on October 8. He died on 18 October, after just 26 days in office. The Cardinals, who had attended the Coronation and the succeeding consistories, had not dispersed, and so they were all able to assemble for the new conclave. The number of cardinal electors who convened again to elect a new pope was larger than in September. Two cardinals who had not been at the September conclave were present for the October conclave: Ippolito d'Este and Pietro Isvalies, the Legate for Hungary. Cardinal d'Este had broken his leg while on his way to the September conclave.Petruccelli, p. 456. He returned to Rome on October 28, 1503.Burchard, p. 291. It was reported by Niccolò Machiavelli to the Council of Ten in Florence on 31 October, the day of the beginning of the Conclave, that della Rovere was being given a 90% chance of being elected. Proceedings :See Cardinal electors for the 1503 papal conclaves. In the month between the conclaves, della Rovere met with Cesare Borgia and the Spanish cardinals, whose support he lacked in the previous conclave, to assure them he would uphold Cesare's command (Gonfaloniere) of the papal army and his territorial possessions in Romagna (the Romandiola).Burchard, p. 293. Pastor, VI, p. 208, states that the agreement was concluded on Sunday, 29 October 1503. Cesare delivered the support of all eleven Spanish cardinals. It was reported to the Council of the Ten of the Badia in Florence that della Rovere had promised that Cardinal Pedro Luis de Borja-Lanzol, Cesare Borgia's second-cousin, would be given the office of Major Penitentiary, the current holder of which was della Rovere himself.Petruccelli, p. 464. Eubel, p. 24 no. 24. Coincidentally, Borja-Lanzol was actually named Major Penitentiary on 7 December 1503. Della Rovere was also negotiating with Cardinal d'Amboise (the Cardinal of Rouen) on October 5, according to information received in Venice from their ambassador in Rome.Marino Sanuto, Volume V, p. 151. Georges d'Amboise also accepted the candidacy of della Rovere, regarding his own candidacy as impossible and della Rovere as the least threatening of the Italian cardinals to the French interests.. It was reported by the Ambassador of Modena, Beltrando Costabili in a dispatch of 1 November, after the election, that the new Pope had dined with Cardinals Amboise, Sanseverino and Trivulzio, and that he had confirmed for Amboise his position as Legate in France, and had given him besides the Legateship in Avignon.Petruccelli, p. 464. The appointment was announced in Consistory on 4 December 1503: His nephew, François Guillaume de Clermont, Archbishop of Narbonne, the intermediary in negotiations between Amboise and della Rovere, was named a cardinal on 29 November 1503. Joannes Burchard, the papal Master of Ceremonies, records that the Conclave was enclosed at the first hour of the night on 31 October. Next morning there was a Mass of the Holy Spirit, held at the \\"sixteenth hour\\". This was followed by the signing of the Capitulations, by all thirty-seven cardinals. =Capitulations= Despite the claim of Frederic Baumgartner that there were no capitulations, there were electoral capitulations. They are carefully noted in Johannes Burchard's Diary, and they were signed by the Cardinals on 1 November 1503, All Saints' Day.The full text is to be found in: See also Petruccelli, I, p. 463; Pastor, Volume VI, p. 211; The Electoral Capitulations contained clausesPastor, p. 211. relating to: * the prosecution of the war against the Turks * the summoning of a general council within two years * forbidding the pope from making war against any of the great powers without a 2/3 vote of the Cardinals * the Cardinals being consulted on all important matters, especially on the creation of new cardinals =Voting= After the Capitulations were dealt with, the Conclavists were removed and the doors closed, so that the voting could begin. The voting was by written ballot, and it was a preference ballot. One cardinal could name several candidates on the ballot, and five Cardinals did in fact take the trouble and time to do so. The details of each and every ballot were recorded by Burchard in his Diary, who also comments that all of the ballots were in the handwriting of the cardinal, except for three, which were written by an attendant.Burchard, pp. 298-299, scriptae manibus servitorum eorumdem cardinalium. He gives a complete list of the cardinals and their conclavists at pp. 299-304. Ascanio Sforza and his faction were reserved at first, but voted for della Rovere on the first scrutiny, due to various promises of favors. The vote was nearly unanimous for della Rovere on the first ballot, with the exception of his own vote, according to Baumgartner, which he cast for Amboise, Riario and Carafa. Baumgartner is not correct: Cardinal d'Amboise cast his vote for Carafa and Da Costa.Burchard, p. 299. As Master of Ceremonies, and a Protonotary Apostolic, Burchard kept a complete record of the individual votes. There were therefore two ballots which did not name della Rovere. After his election, Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, the senior Cardinal Bishop, presented the new Pope with the Fisherman's ring (anulus Piscatoris) which had belonged to Pius III, but Julius produced a ring of his own, which caused some surprise. He then signed the Electoral Capitulations and took the oath to observe them. This was officially witnessed by Burchard in his capacity as a notary. The Pope declined to sign any of the rolls of supplications (requests for favors and benefices) put before him by the cardinals, but handed them over to Fabio Santorio, whom he named Datary,One of the duties of the Datary was to make recommendations for the filling of various offices and benefices which came into the hands of the pope. It was a powerful office, with considerable influence over the careers and incomes of prelates, and it brought the Datary a large income in fees and gifts. Gaetano Moroni, \\"Dataria Apostolica\\", in: Dizionario di erudizione storico- ecclesiastica Vol. XIX (Venezia: Emiliana 1843), pp. 109-110. with the promise to sign them all, and the requests of the conclavists as well.Burchard, III, p. 298, in the note; p. 304. Louis XII of France who had opposed Piccolomini a month earlier—exclaiming about Cesare \\"that son of a whore has prevented Rouen from becoming pope!\\"— accepted the election of della Rovere, although they would soon be at war once Julius II formed the Catholic League. The conclave is claimed to have been the shortest ever, less than ten hours.Pastor, p. 210, repeated by Baumgartner, who calculated the number of hours. NotesReferences Pastor, Ludwig von.

A leading figure in the early years of fascism, he helped to build the movement in several regions of the country and was particularly active in Trieste. During the Second World War he became notorious for his role in occupied Yugoslavia. Early fascist career Born in the Tuscan town of San Piero a Sieve, he started his career as a lawyer, having studied law and philosophy at university.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 150 He served as a machine gun captain in World War I,Alan Kramer, Dynamic of destruction, 2007, p. 302 having joined the army in 1915. After the war he was involved in the establishment of the ex-service group Associazione Nazionale dei Combattenti, as well as the more overtly political Alleanza di Difesa Cittadina, an anti- socialist group with a strong military bent that was involved in battles with leftists. An early member of the Italian fascist movement, Giunta was the leader of fascio in Florence before in 1920 being sent the Julian March (Venezia Giulia) to aid Professor Ruggero Conforto in establishing the fascist movement in the region. Having garnered a reputation as a good organiser, he was subsequently sent to Trieste that same year to work under Gabriele D'Annunzio.Paul H. Lewis, Latin Fascist Elites, 2002, p. 17 Under the direction of D'Annunzio he became the propaganda chief in FiumeC.P. Blamires, World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 239 and a deputy for the city from 1921 to 1939. He worked with Benito Mussolini to set up a number of Fascist squads that attacked a group of allegedly separatist Slovenes in northern Istria. As a Fascist leader (ras) of Trieste, he built up an early mass support base for the Fascist movement.S.J. Woolf, Fascism in Europe, 1981, p. 48 In July 1920, he led the squad that burnt down the Narodni dom, the community centre of the Slovenes in Trieste.DOMOV - Fašisti so v Trstu zažgali Slovenski narodni dom Giunta gained fame in March 1922 when he followed the example of D'Annunzio by staging a coup in the Free State of Fiume with 2000 followers and by doing so laying down the foundations for the official Italian takeover in 1924.Paul H. Lewis, Latin Fascist Elites, 2002, p. 31 In October 1922, he commanded the Fascists from the Julian March on the March on Rome. His leading position in the early years of fascism came despite his Freemasonry, a movement to which Mussolini was bitterly opposed.Nicholas Farrell, Mussolini: A New Life, p. 134 Under Mussolini's government He became national secretary of the National Fascist Party in succession to Michele Bianchi in 1923 and oversaw the move towards an increasingly diminished role for the party rank and file as Mussolini consolidated his government.Adrian Lyttelton, The Seizure of Power, 2004, p. 183 He also sought to increase party discipline and was behind a brutal physical attack on Cesare Forni, a leading dissident within the Fascist movement.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 151 Replaced by Roberto Farinacci the following year, Giunta settled into an undersecretary's role in the cabinet office.Maria Wyke, Julius Caesar in Western Culture, 2006, p. 257 In this role he was pivotal in signalling one of the future intentions of Italian foreign policy when he stated in an April 1933 visit to Malta that he was on Italian soil and that the future of the island lay in complete union with Italy.Manfred Pfister & Ralf Hertel, Performing National Identity , 2008, pp. 173-4 He also acted as vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 and in this role was declared immune from prosecution in March 1925 when magistrates in Milan attempted to charge him over the attack on Forni. Dalmatia In February 1943, he succeeded Giuseppe Bastianini as the Governor of Dalmatia. A fervent anti-Yugoslav since the times of his activity in the South Slav-inhabited Julian March, Giunta brought a number of his old colleagues from Trieste with himself. His regime became noted for its brutality against the local Croat population, and a fierce repression of the Yugoslav partisan movement present in the area.Jozo Tomasevich, War and revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945, 2001, pp. 136-7 He was subsequently involved in the Italian Social Republic, although on a personal level he was largely unenthusiastic about the regime. Post-war activity After World War II, Yugoslavia demanded the extradition of Giunta, so that he could be tried for war crimes committed in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav demand was rejected by both Italy and the Allies. He was involved in the 1947 Dumini trial, which investigated the murder of Giacomo Matteotti. He was not charged in relation to this but indicted on further, unrelated charges, the same year. Giunta settled in Rome, where he died in 1971.

Made up of multi-instrumentalist/producer Giovanni Giusti and songwriter/vocalist Eric Victorino, the duo formed in 2007 and has since gained international fame, thanks in part to the release of their singles \\"Very Busy People\\" and \\"Internet Killed the Video Star\\". Their first full- length album, Get Sharp, was released July 27, 2010 to critical acclaim. On December 13, 2010, the band officially signed with Dangerbird Records, but have since left the label and independently recorded and produced their second album, Hush, which was released on June 4, 2013.  History  In 2007, while in England, Eric Victorino was first introduced to Giovanni Giusti after a mutual friend of theirs had played Victorino a remixed Jay-Z album that Giusti had produced,South Bay's electro-upstarts the Limousines  Music & Nightlife dubbed The Bloody Album. Victorino later emailed Giusti, expressing his enthusiasm for the music Giusti was making and they began a regular correspondence through the internet. At the time, Giusti was home in California's East Bay area, where he was attending a music and visual arts college. The two eventually began sending each other ideas for what would later become the music of The Limousines; with Giusti sending beats to Victorino and Victorino sending lyrics and melodies to Giusti. Through this collaborative process, without ever meeting face-to-face, they managed to construct multiple songs. The pair finally met in person for the first time while they were at The Panda Studios in Oakland, California to record their songs \\"Scrapbook 1998\\" and \\"New Year's Resolution.\\" Individually, they had been working on their own separate musical endeavors while, at the same time, using The Limousines as another type of creative outlet. Though, as The Limousines, they had digitally composed many demo tracks, which they posted on their band's Myspace and Tumblr sites, but had yet to release any physical product. Aaron Axelsen, a music director from Bay Area radio station Live 105, received The Limousines' \\"New Year's Resolution\\" demo and played it on his weekly, Sunday evening radio show, Soundcheck. This, coupled with the airplay that Michael Solari, a promotions director at another Bay Area radio station, Channel 92.3, gave \\"Very Busy People\\", helped further spread word about The Limousines and greatly increase the band's already growing fanbase. Eventually, \\"Very Busy People\\" was picked up by Sirius XM satellite radio, even before the band signed a single song deal with Universal Republic for the song, and became a frequently played track on the station's Alt Nation channel. The song was the seventh most requested song for the year 2009 on the channel's Alt-18 Countdown.https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=236710744797 By late 2009, The Limousines had independently released their first official collection of songs; a dual 7\\" white vinyl EP entitled Scrapbook, featuring four songs originally available only as MP3 demos: \\"Scrapbook 1998\\", \\"Plans Are Just Coincidence\\", \\"New Year's Resolution\\", and \\"ithinkican\\";http://thedemellotheory.com/2012/09/05/interview-with-eric- victorino-from-the-limousines/ in January 2012, however, Scrapbook was re- released in CD format and featured two bonus tracks: \\"To Be Adored\\" (previously a promo single to Get Sharp) and \\"Short'n Sweet\\". Though the band was still unsigned, they had been in contact with record labels. However, without having practically any other songs written and with high industry expectations to do a full-length album in a short amount of time, which they were unable to do, they weren't ready to make any deals.the Pop Sucker: Search results for the limousines The band continued writing and promoting their music and on June 17, 2010, they announced that their debut album would be entitled Get Sharp. In December 2010 Dangerbird Records officially welcomed The Limousines to their roster. Also in December 2010, the song \\"Internet Killed the Video Star\\" reached #1 on the Sirius-XM Alt-18 Countdown.https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=476463569797 Their growing success and new contract also earned them a feature article in issue 24 of alternative scene magazine Substream Music Press, published for April/May 2011. The band toured as main support for Neon Trees in May 2011, spanning the midwest and east coast of the United States. For the week of May 2, 2011, MTV began featuring the band on MTV Push Week, a promotional segment aired in between shows. In May 2011, MTV featured the music video for \\"Internet Killed the Video Star\\". The band began a North American tour in support of The Sounds in October, 2011, with the final show of the tour scheduled for November 22, 2011 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.The Sounds Official Tour Dates In November, 2011, the Sounds announced that they will be touring Europe with the Limousines in early 2012.https://www.facebook.com/thesounds#!/thesounds?sk=events On August 14, 2015, the Limousines released their third single, \\"Stumble Back to You\\".  Get Sharp  Recorded primarily in Giusti's home studio, with some vocals done alongside engineer Todd Cooper at Street Symphony Studios, Get Sharp was composed in the same fashion as their previous work together; with the two sending lyrics and music back and forth to each other and exchanging ideas until finally meeting to record in the studio. Pre-ordering of the CD started on June 28, 2010, and the first 100 to do so received an autograph copy. Included with the first 100 was a piece of writing significantly used during the album's recording sessions; on it was a Limousines stamp of authenticity. San Francisco, Ca session drummer, Cary LaScala, performed a various amount of live shows with the band during the release of Get Sharp in 2010 into 2011. Inspired by a great video ideaThe Limousines  South Bay indie sensation  San Jose  Features & Columns the band had for their song \\"Internet Killed The Video Star\\", they enlisted the help of family and friends and went to work on creating their first official music video.

The Cow Creek Band is also known as the Upper Umpqua. The tribe takes its name from Cow Creek, a tributary of the South Umpqua River. History=Origins= The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians was originated as a unified entity by the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs on September 19, 1853, when a treaty was signed between the United States and a group of villages located along Cow Creek, a tributary of the South Fork of the Umpqua River.Robert H. Ruby and John A. Brown, A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Revised paperback edition. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1992; pg. 66. In actuality several different tribal entities were included in this umbrella group, including Upper Umpqua Targunsans, Milwaletas, and possibly some Southern Molallas. No fewer than three distinct languages were spoken by the Native Americans agglomerated by the government as the \\"Cow Creek Band.\\" During the times before Western contact, the various entities of the Cow Creek band were seasonally migratory hunter-gatherers, making use of permanent winter encampments and moving their villages in pursuit of food sources during the warmer months.Ruby and Brown, A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, pg. 67. This changed under terms of the 1853 treaty, however, with the Cow Creek Band agreeing to cede 800 square miles of territory to the government in exchange for 21 payments totaling $12,000 and a temporary reservation located on their traditional tribal lands. In October 1855, the Rogue River War erupted in the area and the peoples of the Cow Creek Band fled for safety in the hills, joining others there who similarly faced forced removal from their traditional homeland for concentration on the Grand Ronde Reservation located to the north. This relocation proved inevitable however, and in January 1856 the bulk of the Cow Creek Band was moved to Grand Ronde, many forced to walk beside the inadequate 8 wagons appropriated for the move. Some refused to leave, however, with half the Milwaleta people dying of starvation and exposure when they remained in the hills. Several indigenous people were shot during armed forays into the hills in search of stragglers. The mountainous terrain near today's Canyonville provided cover for some, however, and efforts in May 1856 by Oregon Indian Agent James P. Day and in 1860 by the United States Army failed to round up remaining members of the Cow Creek Band.Ruby and Brown, A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, pg. 68. Volunteers periodically pursued them for the next quarter century, with members of the Cow Creek Band periodically conducting raids upon the cattle of Anglo-American settlers in an attempt to avoid starvation in a world in which traditional methods of food acquisition were no longer possible. =Claims= In 1910, the Cow Creek Band made its first attempt to regain a portion of its traditional homeland through the legislative process. A bill was passed to compensate the tribe in 1932, only to be vetoed by President of the United States Herbert Hoover. Litigation commenced in 1936, with the Cow Creek Band a party in the case Rogue River Tribe of Indians v. United States (64 F. Supp. 339, Ct. Cl.). A second hearing was held four years later (89 F. Supp. 789, Ct. Cl.). Only two of the 17 tribes participating in these cases were successful, however, and the claim of the Cow Creek Band was dismissed. Decades of litigation followed, marked by a series of legal defeats based on technical aspects of the law surrounding the Indian Claims Commission. This was reversed on May 26, 1980, however, when the United States Congress passed legislation paving the way for a lawsuit against the government on the basis that the amount paid by the federal government for tribal lands was unconscionably low. On December 29, 1982, an act of Congress granted the Cow Creek Band formal tribal recognition. =The Cow Creek Band today= In the 21st Century, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians is one of nine federally recognized tribal governments in Oregon and includes nearly 1400 members.\\"Cow Creek Story,\\" Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians official website, www.cowcreek.com/ Among the economic ventures of the Cow Creek Band is the Seven Feathers Hotel & Casino Resort, located at Canyonville, Oregon.

Bonneau du Martray is the only estate in Burgundy to exclusively produce wine from Grand cru vineyards. The estate was owned and managed by Jean-Charles de la Moriniere who inherited it from his father in 1994. Jean-Charles has been working on moving viticultural management and the care of the vineyard toward a biodynamic philosophy and away from the previous use of herbicides to manage weeds and pests. He has also worked to reduce yields significantly in an effort to improve the intensity and quality of the finished wine.Mansson, Per- Henrik, Wine Spectator (February 2, 2001). Domaine Bonneau du Martray: Hitting Its Stride In 2017, the Domaine was sold to Stan Kroenke. Only two wines are produced from the vineyard holdings of the domaine. A White Burgundy with Chardonnay grapes from the 9.5 hectares the estate owns in Corton-Charlemagne and a Red Burgundy with Pinot Noir grapes from 1.5 hectares owned in the Corton vineyard. Bonneau du Martray is the largest single owner of vines within the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard and owns the largest area of a single Grand cru vineyard of any producer in Burgundy. Clive Coates describes Bonneau Du Martray's white Corton-Charlemagne wine as \\"one of the very greatest in all Burgundy\\" and Hugh Johnson lists Bonneau du Martray as one of the leading Côte d'Or producers and gives the estate his highest rating of 4 stars indicating \\"exceptionally fine or great quality, consistent over many vintages\\".

TOHP collects interviews and produces multimedia content featuring a stories of transgender-identified people, and exists to empower trans folks through sharing stories of their lives. The Transgender Oral History Project is also active in the community, hosting events in many states including Massachusetts, Illinois, Iowa, Seattle, Philadelphia, and New York City. Goals According to the official website, the Transgender Oral History Project's goals are to build community, encourage inter-generational discussion, framing contemporary issues that transgender people faced within a broader context, highlight individuals, communities, and organizations struggling with trans issues that are not addressed by mainstream discourses and portray how political, social, and historical circumstances impact transgender lives.  Founding  The Trans Oral History project was founded in 2009 by André Pérez as began documenting the evolution of the first ever New England Transgender Pride March. He went on to create a multimedia exhibit entitled, \\"Community in Transition: 40 Years of Struggle\\" that incorporated archival materials from the Sexual Minorities Archives and the first set of interviews from the Transgender Oral History Project. This exhibit has been featured at Marlboro College, University of Illinois Chicago, and the Translating Identities Conference.http://www.uvm.edu/~tic/  Notable Past Projects  In 2010, a poster describing the Compton's Cafeteria riot was featured in the anthology, Celebrate People's History, published by the Just Seeds Collective. In 2011, the Trans Oral History Project participated in a two-month residency at the University of Illinois, Chicago's LGBTQ Resource Center. TOHP collective members lead a participatory workshop series and created a multimedia exhibition featuring interview materials. In 2014, I Live for Trans Education: A Youth Toolkit officially launched. I Live featured mini documentaries paired with interactive activities to teach about issues that impact the transgender community. The toolkit is a resource for trans educators, youth workers, and youth leaders to educate about issues that impact the trans community from an intersectional perspective. TOHP also began partnering with StoryCorps, the largest oral history project in North America, to record and preserve stories. A TOHP interview was featured on WBEZ in Chicago. The Trans Oral History Project now serves as a community archive for StoryCorps' recordings with transgender individuals, and is in the process of integrating those interviews into their publicly accessible digital archive of transgender stories.  Community Events Members of the Trans History Collective have also led educational workshops in community settings, academic institutions, and national conferences. The Transgender Oral History Project collaborates with other organizations in the area to host regular skills shares that teach media production skills to trans* and gender variant people.

Life Frances McCue was born in North Tarrytown, New York in 1962. After her parents’ divorce in 1963, she spent her early years with her grandparents and mother in Cincinnati and on Cape Cod. In 1975, her mother remarried and they moved to Western Pennsylvania. McCue was sent to boarding schools in New England and went on to receive her Bachelor of Arts at the University of New Hampshire. She graduated from the University of Washington with an MFA in creative writing before receiving a Klingenstein Fellowship from Columbia University, where she studied linguistics, English education, architecture, and administrative leadership. She received an EdM in 1996 and an EdD in 2001. She is now a senior lecturer in the English department at the University of Washington. McCue co-founded Richard Hugo House in 1996, serving as the Founding Director for ten years. Though “Hugo House,” as it has since been renamed, is an arts venue rather than a residence, McCue lived in the building with her husband and daughter during the early years of the literary organization. In 2009, while the family was in Morocco for a University of Washington course, McCue's husband, Seattle activist Gary Greaves, died unexpectedly. His death inspired her 2010 book The Bled. In 2015, McCue began work on Where the House Was, a documentary film weaving together the history of Hugo House, the life and work of poet Richard Hugo, and ongoing gentrification in Seattle. The film is directed by filmmaker Ryan K. Adams and is set for a 2018 release date. Production of the film also inspired McCue's 2017 poetry collection Timber Curtain. Awards McCue has received grants and residencies from Centrum, Artist Trust, 4Culture, the Whiteley Center at Friday Harbor Laboratories, the Seattle Mayor’s Office of Arts and Cultural Affairs, the Jack Straw Writers Workshop, the University of Washington’s Simpson Center for the Humanities, Hedgebrook, and from 1998 to 2002 was an Echoing Green Fellow. Spanning almost thirty years from Columbia University to the University of Washington, she has won numerous teaching awards. Her work for Richard Hugo House won her an Evergreen State Service Award in 2002 and a 2003 History Makers Award from the Museum of History and Industry. She has been nominated for a Pushcart Prize, has been a runner-up for the Milliman Prize and a Stranger Genius Award, and has won the Joan Grayston Poetry Prize, Richard Blessing Scholarship, the Bumbershoot Written Works Competition, a GAMMA award, and the Grub Street National Book Prize. Her first poetry collection, The Stenographer's Breakfast, won the Barnard New Women's Poetry Prize. Her second book, The Bled, won the 2011 Washington State Book Award for poetry. In 2011 and 2015 she was a finalist for the award in the History/General Nonfiction category, first for her book The Car That Brought You Here Still Runs: Revisiting the Northwest Towns of Richard Hugo and then for Mary Randlett Portraits. Works Frances McCue’s prose has appeared in Ms. Magazine, New York Times Book Review, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Stranger, The Seattle Times, Nest Magazine, Teachers College Record, Seattle Social Justice, Journal of National Collegiate Honors Council, The Georgia Review, Arcade, and Tin House Magazine. She has been featured in numerous anthologies, including Seattle City of Literature (Sasquatch Books, 2015), Wordswest Anthology (Wordswest Press, 2015), Make it True: Poems from Cascadia (Leaf Press, Vancouver BC, 2015), Looking Together (University of Washington Press, 2009), Worlds in Our Words: Contemporary American Women Writers (Prentice Hall, 1997), and For a Living: The Poetry of Work (University of Illinois Press, 1995). = Books =  * =Essays= * \\"Self-Hatred Can Be Funny\\", Poetry Foundation * \\"Dreaming Richard Hugo,\\" The Georgia Review, Summer 2008. = Selected poems = * \\"Mary of the Woods, of the City: A Prayer\\"; \\"Mother and Clone\\"; \\"New Anthropology\\", Caffeine Destiny * \\"WORK, FATE AND SCENIC LANDSCAPE\\", Square Lake 6, 2004 * \\"Us, Back Round\\", Tarpaulin Sky, Spring 2007 ReferencesExternal links * \\"Frances McCue\\", 2006 Jack Straw Writers Program University of New Hampshire alumni Columbia University alumni University of Washington alumni Seattle University faculty University of Washington faculty Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American women poets People from Sleepy Hollow, New York ","title":"Frances McCue"},{"id":"23723544","text":"The Orobó River is a river of Pernambuco state in eastern Brazil.

It is bounded on the east by Data Centre Road, on the north and west by the Rideau River and on the south by Brookfield Road. Confederation Heights includes the Clarke Memorial Centre (RA Centre), the Taxation Data Centre (Revenue Canada), the Edward Drake Building (formerly Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Communications Security Establishment), the Sir Leonard Tilley Building (formerly Communications Security Establishment), Canada Post Place (Canada Post headquarters), the Sir Charles Tupper Building (Public Works Canada), Hog's Back Park, Vincent Massey Park and Mooney's Bay station. History Prior to the expropriation of the Merkley Brick Yard in 1954, the area had been a combination of woods, farmland, quarry and brickyard. The arrival of Federal government departments in the late 1950s - early 1960s had a significant impact on the area. In 1959, the Fire Chief of Gloucester Township (the area was incorporated into Ottawa the following year) raised concerns that road traffic caused by the 1400 new workers commuting to Confederation Heights would interfere with the firefighters' ability to respond to fires from their station in Billings Bridge. It was estimated that daily traffic on Riverside Drive west of Bank Street would increase by 3500 cars. In 1961, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker inaugurated the Sir Alexander Campbell Building, the new headquarters building of the Department of the Post Office. The building, designed by architects Shore and Moffat was one of three which anchored the site. Public Works National Headquarters, opened in 1960 (Lithwick, Lambert and Sim Architects) was another. The third was the Sir Leonard Tilley Building. Plans to move various other departments to Confederation Heights changed over time. For example, Indian and Northern Affairs were suggested but never moved to the site. The new government jobs also drove the development of neighbourhoods and infrastructure (e.g.: Brookfield HS, opened 1962; General Vanier PS, opened 1963) in nearby Billings Bridge, Riverside Park, and Carleton Heights. A plaza, with fountains and benches, spread between the self-standing cafeteria building and the Canada Post building. To commemorate Canada's Centennial, a sundial was installed on the plaza. The plaque attached to its base read \\"Erected by Headquarters Staff of the Post Office Department to Commemorate the Centennial of Confederation July 26, 1967\\".

The conclave was marked by the early candidacies of cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (future Pope Clement VII) and Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), although the Colonna and other cardinals blocked their election. Adrian, the viceroy to Spain and a clear pro-Imperial candidate, was elected as a compromise candidate despite his absence from the conclave. The number of cardinal-electors (thirty-nine) and the length of the sede vacante increased the cost of the conclave even in excess of the funds distributed by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I of France, and Henry VIII of England to promote their candidates. Cardinal electors There were thirty-nine cardinal electors, only three of whom were non-Italians (two Spaniards and one Swiss). Nine non-Italians did not attend (compared to only one Italian), despite the lengthy delay. The lengthy delay was due to the capture of one cardinal on his way to Rome, who was held for ransom. In the meantime, the agents of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I of France, and Henry VIII of England began to distribute the large sums that the monarchs had sent to Rome for bribes. Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III) The preferred choice of Henry VIII was Thomas Wolsey (for whom he was prepared to spend 100,000 ducats), although Giulio de'Medici (future Pope Clement VII) was also acceptable to him. Henry VIII asked Charles V (with whom he was allied) to support Wolsey and send his army to Rome. Even the large bribes of these monarchs were less than the cost of the conclave, and even the papal tiara was mortgaged to continue to fund it, and only a very few of the Italian cardinals would even consider a non- Italian. Charles V eventually threw his support behind Medici rather than Wolsey, although he was opposed by many because he was the cousin of Leo X and the College feared a hereditary papacy. Francis I supported the election of a French pope, backed by one million gold ecus, although whether he actually sent the funds to Rome is unclear; in fact, Francis I's agents focused their attention on the pro-French Italian candidates, mainly the three Venetians. Francis I claimed to control the votes of twelve cardinals. Medici for his part entered the conclave with fifteen or sixteen supporters, but very little chance of securing additional votes. =The papabile= Pope Leo X (center) with his cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (left), a leading papabile in the conclave, later elected Pope Clement VII. The bookmakers of Rome offered bets on the papabile, an early example of gambling on papal elections; Medici had the best odds at 25 to 100; Farnese's odds were 20 to 100. Proceedings The conclave began on December 28, twenty-seven days after the death of Leo X.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 95. The cardinals agreed to a conclave capitulation, but Baumgartner calls it \\"an exercise in futility as always\\". The balloting began on December 30. Farnese, supported by Medici and his supporters, received twelve initial votes, all from creations of Leo X.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 96. If Farnese could have secured the votes of Leo X's other cardinals (twenty-eight of the thirty-nine electors), he could easily have been elected. The Roman mob looted him home (as was customary for newly elected popes) and his odds increased to 40 to 100, although his votes dropped to four on the second day. After the second ballot, one cardinal pleading ill health was released from the conclave by a two-thirds vote. The conclave dragged well into 1522, taking only one vote per day; various Italian ambassadors remained well-informed of the progress throughout. Farnese remained the favorite into the eight scrutiny, with Medici asking for an accessus after Farnese received twelve votes. Farnese received eight or nine additional votes by accessus, and one cardinal even shouted out \\"Papam Habemus!\\". However, two of Farnese's strongest opponents demanded a formal counting of the votes, and it was revealed that Farnese was just short of the required supermajority, after which Farnese was discredited and lost support. Medici attempted to promote the candidacy of others in his party, but none could gain wide support. Wolsey received eight votes, but his young age deterred other cardinals from supporting him (the English ambassador tried to convince the College he was over fifty). Medici addressed the conclave on January 9 and suggested they turn their attention to candidates not present in the conclave, expressing his willingness to elect Adrian of Utrecht. In the following scrutiny Adrian received fifteen votes, including all those controlled by Medici.Baumgartner, 2003, p. 97. Colonna, the main opponent of Medici and those in his party then declared his support for Adrian, netting him thirteen more votes by accessus, exactly two-thirds. As Adrian was not present, his candidacy did not require two-thirds plus one. The crowd did not understand which cardinal had been elected immediately upon announcement, as Adrian was relatively obscure and currently in Spain as viceroy to Charles V. Three cardinals were dispatched to inform him of his election, with a private letter reaching him on January 24 (the cardinals would not arrive until March). In the meantime, rumors of Adrian VI's death spread in Rome and Francis I began to prepare for a new conclave. The cardinals did not bring a fisherman's ring with them to Spain, to ensure that Adrian VI would be forced to travel to Rome, where he arrived on August 28. Adrian VI said mass every day for the year he was pope, in contrast to his two predecessors who may have never celebrated mass at all.Baumgartner, 2003, pp. 97-98. NotesReferences * J. P.

In the land of temples: Notes from a South Indian pilgrimage. p. 32. \\"It is a temple to Maha Pratyangira, a particularly ferocious manifestation of the goddess in which she has the head of a lion.” and a female human body representing the union of Shiva and Shakti. She holds the combined destructive power of Shiva and Shakti. This combination of lion and human forms represents the balance of good and evil. In Shaktism, Pratyangira is Siddhilakshmi, a form of Guhya Kali.In Durga tradition, Pratyangira is Purna Chandi, the fiery destructive power of Brahman. In the Vedas, Pratyangira is Atharvana Bhadrakali, the goddess of Atharva Veda and magical spells.Dr Ramamurthy, Sri Maha Pratyangira Devi: Holy Divine Mother in Ferocious Form Incarnation of Adi Parashakti As told in Markandeya Purana and Shiva Purana, in the beginning of the Treta yuga, the Lord Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the unruly King Hiranyakashipu by tearing up his body and drinking his blood. Because of the anger in Hiranyakashipu's body and blood Lord Narsimha drunk on rage and could not be stopped. To calm him down, Lord Shiva came down as Sharabha, a bird-animal-human hybrid. Upon seeing this, Lord Narasimha created Gandaberunda, a two headed bird to fight against Sarabeswara. These two beings fought a long time terrorising the world without reaching a solution. Seeing this Shakti invoked Pratyangira. Pratyangira appeared before these fighting beings and roared. When she roared, the terrified Sarabeswara and Gandaberund stopped their fight. Pratyangira had the combined power of Vishnu, Shiva and Shakti she was more powerful than any of them. In another version in ancient times when two Rishis, Prathiyangira and Angiras, were meditating they re- discovered a Goddess through a Moola Mantra who was nameless. Later She privileged the rishis by naming Herself after them and hence She was called as Prathyangira Devi. Narasimhi is another name of Hers. 'Nara' means human and 'Simha' means lion, so She got named thus as She appears with a lion's face and a human body. The term Prati means reverse and Angiras means attacking. Thus, devi Pratyangira is the one who reverses any black magic attacks. In temples of south India, She is also eulogized as Atharvana Bhadrakali as the She is considered the ruling Goddess of the Atharva Veda, the scripture which contains spells to conjure and cure.Max Muller The Hymns of the Atharva-Veda: The Sacred Books of the East V42Teun Goudriaan Maya: Divine And Human Pratyangira is one of the chief warrior goddess of Lalita Tripura Sundari's army called Sakthi Sena. Adi Parasakthi at an earlier time during the war between her and Bhandasura gave two boons to Pratyangira that the protection offered by Pratyangira is invincible and no god even Adi Parasakthi herself cannot overcome it. Also when invoked for offensive purposes Pratyangira give invincibility and sure victory to her devotee. Thus Pratyangira is a very popular deity among the Kshatriyas warrior caste. She is often described as the ultimate Goddess to be worshipped for defensive and offensive power.  Appearance  In some images she is shown as dark complexioned, terrible in aspect, having a lion's face with reddened eyes and riding a lion or wearing black garments, she wears a garland of human skulls; her hair stands on end, and she holds a trident, a serpent in the form of a noose, a hand-drum and a skull in her four hands. She is associated with Sharabha and she has a variant form, Atharvana-Bhadra-Kali. She is considered to be a powerful repellent of the influences generated by witchcraft and is said to have the power to punish anyone doing Adharma be it Brahma, Vishnu or Siva. It is said that when Narashimhika shakes her Lion's Mane, she throws the stars into disarray.Max Muller The Hymns of the Atharva-Veda: The Sacred Books of the East V42Benoytosh Bhattacharyya THE INDIAN BUDDHIST ICONOGRAPHY Pratyangira has close resemblance to Sekhmet from Egyptian mythology. Both Pratyangira and Sekhmet is part man part lion, have a snake over head, has an aura resembling fire. Both of them are great warrior goddess. In Hindu Epics The Pratyangira yantra. Prathyangira is also mentioned in the Hindu epic Ramayana. Indrajit was performing \\"Nikumbala yaga\\" (a sacred ritual to worship Prathyangira) while Rama and his soldiers were waging war in Lanka. Hanuman came down to stop this ritual because he knew that if Indrajit completed it, he would become invincible.

If the weapon is used to block attacks too often, the character will only be able to fight with his/her bare hands and lose the weapon for the rest of the round. Fighting moves are classified under low, medium and hard in terms of attack power, in order of increasing amount of damage dealt to an opponent. Each character also has his/her own special attack to use against the opponent. Characters The game takes place in Liangshan Marsh, where 12 of the strongest outlaws out of 108 gather to test their battle skills against each other while the Gods of War watch from above. The characters are inspired by the 108 outlaws from the 14th century Chinese classical novel Water Margin by Shi Naian. Ports Front cover of the Sega Saturn version, Dark Legend. Data East ported Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty to the Sega Saturn in 1995 and PlayStation in 1996. The North American home version was retitled Dark Legend, while the Japanese title remains unchanged in the Japanese home versions. The Japanese port includes both an Original Mode, the mode that plays just like the arcade version, and a Special Mode, which adds extra moves. There is also a beginner mode that can be accessed by pressing the L or R button at the same time. In 2P Battle mode, Makoto Mizoguchi from the Fighter's History series (also by Data East) can be unlocked. The North American version is an update from the Japanese version and was translated for the American audience; however, most of the Japanese text and voice samples remained. Some of the options were removed, as well as the option demo play. Unlike the Japanese version, this version lacks the Arcade Mode, it defaults to Special Mode instead. A Japan-exclusive semi- sequel titled was later released only for the Sega Saturn. Along with Makoto Mizoguchi, another character from the Fighter's History series, Liu Yungmie, was added to the roster. In 2009, G-Mode ported the PlayStation version of Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty over to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in Japan. This port was later released in North America on October 4, 2010 and May 16, 2012 in Europe. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty on their April 15, 1995 issue as being the sixteenth most- successful arcade game of the year. A reviewer for Next Generation gave the Saturn version 2 out of 5 stars, commenting that, \\"There are a few elements in Dark Legends that make thorough use of Saturn's power, including a wide variety of colors, smoothly scaling backgrounds, and unusually large fighters. But for the most part, DL is very much like all the 2D fighters preceding it. Though it is possible to have fun playing this game, it would be a mistake to buy a next generation system for a game like Dark Legends.\\" Tommy Glide of GamePro similarly remarked, \\"Nothing new here: average 2D graphics and adequate fighting earmark Data East's coin-op conversion of Dark Legend.\\" He particularly criticized that the characters lack dramatic reactions to being beaten, though he praised the voice acting and \\"intensity\\" of the musical score. Like Next Generation, he found the game to be essentially fun but not worth getting in light of the more distinctive fighting games coming out for the Saturn.

He was a journalist by profession and worked for La Stampa most notably. Under the fascists Although he did not achieve high office, De Marsanich held a number of positions within the fascist movement. He served as a director of the local party in Latium and Sabine from 1927 to 1929, briefly serving as a member of the Fascist Grand Council in the latter year. 1929 also saw him take a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, where he remained a member until 1943. Seen as something of a bureaucrat, he variously served with the Syndical Office, as head of the party's Legal Office, President of the Syndical Confederation of Commerce and Vice-President of the Corporation for the Building Trades. He served as under-secretary of communications from 1935 to 1943 and also represented Italy at the League of Nations during the Ethiopia crisis.Guido Bonsaver, Censorship and literature in fascist Italy, p. 153 He also was a regular contributor to a number of fascist journals, notably Giuseppe Bottai's Critica FascistaJohn Whittam, Fascist Italy, 1995, p. 2 and served as a director of the fascist monthly Il Lavoro Fascista. As the maternal uncle of novelist Alberto Moravia De Marsanich helped to ensure that he enjoyed the patronage of Benito Mussolini's government.Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Fascist Modernity, 2004, p. 55 He continued to hold a number of positions in the Italian Social Republic, most notably acting as Assistant Postmaster-General, as well as serving as chairman of both the Banco di Roma and Alfa Romeo.

He was succeeded as leader by fellow moderate Arturo Michelini in 1954, although he continued to be a leading MSI figure as national secretary. He was again elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1953 and the Italian Senate in 1968. He was also unsuccessful candidate for the President of Italy in 1964.

It was founded and largely operated by former executives from recently-dissolved Texas-based Braniff International Airways. Flights between Fort Worth and three Texas cities commenced in December 1984 and additional Oklahoma and Texas destinations were added in 1985; however, the airline was unable to operate profitably, and it ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in September of that year.  History  Fort Worth Airlines was founded by Thomas B. King, a former vice president of Braniff International. Fort Worth Airlines was the first federally certificated interstate carrier based at Meacham Field in more than 30 years. Local news reports remarked on the airline's strong ties to Braniff: two- thirds of the airline's executives came from Braniff, its office furniture was bought at Braniff's liquidation sale, and walls were decorated with original artwork by Alexander Calder, who had previously done design work for Braniff. The airline used turboprop-powered 56-seat NAMC YS-11 aircraft leased from Mid Pacific Air, claiming that larger jetliners could not support the frequency of flights that the carrier wanted to offer. Flights to Austin, San Antonio, and William P. Hobby Airport in Houston began on 14 December 1984. In February 1985, Mid Pacific Air became one of the airlines' largest shareholders, and it was announced that Fort Worth flights to Houston Intercontinental Airport would begin in April. In June 1985, an interline ticketing arrangement with Continental Airlines was signed. Fort Worth Airlines began flights to Oklahoma City and Tulsa in August 1985 and announced that flights to Abilene, Texas would begin the following month. On 22 September 1985, Fort Worth Airlines halted flights and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming that ticket revenues were not covering operating costs and that it had run out of cash. The carrier had per-seat costs 61 percent higher than Southwest Airlines, which offered comparable low-fare flights to the same destinations from nearby Dallas Love Field. The airline's board had forced Thomas King to resign as president and CEO nine days earlier due to the carrier's poor financial performance; he was replaced by Sheldon Srulevitch, and most of the airline's 150 employees were laid off immediately.  Destinations  Fort Worth Airlines served the following destinations during its existence: * Abilene, Texas: Abilene Regional Airport (ABI) * Austin: Robert Mueller Municipal Airport (AUS) * Fort Worth: Meacham Field (FTW) - airline headquarters and hub * Houston: ** Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) ** William P.

It is situated on the northwest corner of 3rd and Tingey Streets, Southeast, three blocks from the historic Washington Navy Yard. The industrial, two-story building was recently renovated and currently owned by the United States Department of Transportation. It is a contributing property to the Washington Navy Yard Annex Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  History  Constructed in 1919, Building 170 was part of a 60-acre (24.2 ha) industrial complex used by the United States Navy until 1962. During World War I and World War II, the Navy Yard Annex was the center of U.S. naval weapon production and ordnance technology. In 1963, ownership of Building 170 and 55 acres of the Washington Navy Yard Annex was transferred to the General Services Administration. The GSA completed a master plan to redevelop the site for office and mixed use to accommodate federal agencies, and to renovate and adapt some of the historic buildings. It conducted a design charrette in cooperation with the National Endowment for the Arts and nationally known designers, to generate more ideas for the site. It was a model for interagency charrettes, later used by the departments of Treasury and Agriculture, among others. In 2006, Building 170 was renovated when the U.S. Department of Transportation built its new headquarters on the same street. Upgrades to the surrounding property included the installation of fountains, landscaping, and a plaza. Future plans for the renovated building include leasing of retail space on the first floor, with the second floor's remaining being leased if demand rises. On January 3, 2008, Building 170 was one of 14 structures designated as contributing properties to the Washington Navy Yard Annex Historic District. The boundaries of the historic district include M Street, the Anacostia River, Isaac Hull Avenue, and 2nd Street, SE.  Architecture  Building 170 is an example of industrial Colonial Revival architecture. The steel-framed building is faced in red brick, and features an open interior and metal shed roof. A pronounced ridge monitor runs along the entire length of the building.

They can occur in the testis or ovary. They are very rare and generally peak between the ages of 35 and 50. They are typically well-differentiated, and may be misdiagnosed as seminomas as they often appear very similar. A tumor that produces both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells is known as a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Presentation In males, Sertoli cell tumours typically present as a testicular mass or firmness, and their presence may be accompanied by gynaecomastia (25%) if they produce oestrogens, or precocious pseudopuberty in young boys, especially if they produce androgens. Diagnosis Low magnification micrograph of a Sertoli cell tumour. H&E; stain. On ultrasound, a Sertoli cell tumour appears as a hypoechoic intratesticular lesion which is usually solitary. However, the large cell subtype might present as multiple and bilateral masses with large areas of calcification. An MRI may also be conducted, but this typically is not definitive. Microscopy and immunohistochemistry are the only way to give a definitive diagnosis, especially when there is a suspected seminoma. Treatment In males, due to the difficulty in identifying the tumour using imaging techniques, an orchiectomy is often performed. The majority of Sertoli cell tumours are benign, so this is sufficient. There is no documented benefit of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In non-humans Sertoli cell tumors are known to occur in other species, including domestic ducks, dogs, and horses. Additional images Image:Leydig cell tumour2.jpgMicrograph of a Leydig cell tumour.

It arises from Leydig cells. While the tumour can occur at any age, it occurs most often in young adults. A Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour is a combination of a Leydig cell tumour and a Sertoli cell tumour from Sertoli cells. Presentation The majority of Leydig cell tumors are found in males, usually at 5–10 years of age or in middle adulthood (30–60 years). Children typically present with precocious puberty. Due to excess testosterone secreted by the tumour, one-third of female patients present with a recent history of progressive masculinization. Masculinization is preceded by anovulation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea and defeminization. Additional signs include acne and hirsutism, voice deepening, clitoromegaly, temporal hair recession, and an increase in musculature. Serum testosterone level is high. In men, testicular swelling is the most common presenting feature. Other symptoms depend on age and the type of tumour. If it is secreting androgens the tumour is usually asymptomatic, but can cause precocious puberty in pre-pubertal boys. If the tumour secretes oestrogens it can cause feminisation in young boys. In adults, this causes a number of problems including gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, infertility, feminine hair distribution, gonadogenital atrophy, and a loss of libido. Cause Animal studies a suggest possible link with C8 (C8HF15O2, Perfluorooctanoic acid). Diagnosis Presence of an ovarian tumour plus hormonal disturbances suggests a Leydig cell tumour, granulosa cell tumour or thecoma. However, hormonal disturbances, in Leydig tumours, is present in only 2/3 of cases. Testicular Leydig cell tumours can be detected sonographically, ultrasound examinations may be ordered in the event of a palpable scrotal lump, however incidental identification of these lesions is also possible. A conclusive diagnosis is made via histology, as part of a pathology report made during or after surgery. Reinke crystals are classically found in these tumours and help confirm the diagnosis, although they are seen in less than half of all Leydig cell tumours. Immunohistochemical markers of Leydig cell tumours include inhibin-alpha, calretinin, and melan-A. Treatment The usual chemotherapy regimen has limited efficacy in tumours of this type, although imatinib has shown some promise. There is no current role for radiotherapy. The usual treatment is surgery. The surgery for females usually is a fertility-sparing unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For malignant tumours, the surgery may be radical and usually is followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, sometimes by radiation therapy. In all cases, initial treatment is followed by surveillance. Because in many cases Leydig cell tumour does not produce elevated tumour markers, the focus of surveillance is on repeated physical examination and imaging. In males, a radical inguinal orchiectomy is typically performed. However, testes-sparing surgery can be used to maintain fertility in children and young adults. This approach involves an inguinal or scrotal incision and ultrasound guidance if the tumour is non-palpable. This can be done because the tumour is typically unifocal, not associated with precancerous lesions, and is unlikely to recur. The prognosis is generally good as the tumour tends to grow slowly and usually is benign: 10% are malignant. For malignant tumours with undifferentiated histology, prognosis is poor.

The population was 18 at the 2010 census. History Overly was founded in 1905 as a railroad loading station along the Soo Line Railroad. Overly's post office was established August 21, 1905, and service discontinued November 9, 1996. The city now shares the ZIP code of 58384 with nearby Willow City. For many years, the city thrived as a railroad center, serving as a crew transfer point for the railroads traveling east and west along the line. The railroad installed a roundhouse for servicing locomotives as well as coal and water facilities. A popular pastime for city residents was to gather at the rail depot on the edge of town to watch the trains in the mornings and evenings. Many speculate that the town's name was meant to describe the numerous rail crews that \\"laid over\\" in town during the shift changes. Others say the town is named for Hans Overlie, an early settler. The United States Census Bureau recorded a high population of 193 in 1920. Wheat shipments and the city's status as a railroad hub seemed to indicate future growth, but the frequency of trains dwindled until the 1950s when trains just passed by without stopping. The railroad tore down the roundhouse and other facilities, commercial businesses closed down, and the city began a steady population decline to just 32 by the 1980 Census. The Census Bureau currently places the 2008 population of the city at 17 people. Geography Overly is located in Cecil Township in the eastern part of Bottineau County. The city lies along the border with neighboring Rolette County, and a 5-block portion of the city was actually platted in that county.

Plot  The Ninja Turtles and their master Splinter are startled to watch a video broadcast of the Turtles fighting the Purple Dragons on TV. The Turtles set out to break into the Purple Dragons' HQ to get to the bottom of these doppelgängers, to discover that their \\"imposters\\" are actually alternate versions of themselves. They escape together, but the 2003 Turtles find the 1987 team too difficult to control, until they summon Splinter, in whose presence the 1987-Turtles explain that they landed here after fighting the 1987 Shredder and Krang over mutagen in the Technodrome. During the battle, the dimensional teleporter malfunctioned, sending them all to the 2003 dimension. Checking recent tremor reports, the Turtles find the Technodrome, only to have to battle an army of Foot-Bots led by Bebop and Rocksteady. When the 1987-Shredder sees the two Turtle teams, he hypothesizes the possible existence of another Shredder in this dimension. After escaping the Turtles, Shredder and Krang locate Ch'rell, the Utrom Shredder, on an icy asteroid. After Ch'rell is thawed out, he proves too insane to work with and is retained for vivisection. However, his adopted daughter Karai, who had been monitoring his exile, breaks into the Technodrome and frees him. While tracking the Technodrome, the Turtles and Splinter are attacked by Hun and the Purple Dragons, who want their mutagen. In the course of the fight, Hun accidentally becomes exposed to the substance and turns into a mutant turtle. He wanders until coming upon the Technodrome, now under the control of The Utrom Shredder, who takes Hun back into his service. Ch'rell and Karai begin upgrading the Technodrome and the Foot-Bots with Utrom science, and use their supply of mutagen to make a mutant army out of the Foot clan. Using the trans- dimensional portal, Utrom Shredder learns there are many parallel universes filled with Ninja Turtles. Hun, Bebop and Rocksteady are dispatched alongside an army of Utrom Foot-Bots to capture the Turtles, breaking into their lair and it begins crumbling, forcing the Turtles to use their own dimensional portal projector to escape into the 1987 universe. Splinter is captured by Hun to serve as bait, and Utrom Shredder decides to launch an all-out assault on the 2003 universe to lure the Turtles out of hiding. After a brief stint in the 1987 universe, the Turtles are able to return to the 2003 universe with anti-Technodrome gear and infiltrate the Technodrome. Captured by Utrom Shredder, the Turtles learn from him they are not the only versions in the multiverse; because any of their alternate versions would pose a hindrance to Shredder's plan to rule all of reality, Ch'rell intends to kill the Ninja Turtles of the source dimension, creating a domino effect that will erase every other team of Ninja Turtles in the multiverse. All eight are scanned for shared DNA and are about to be obliterated as the Technodrome vanishes to the source dimension (dubbed \\"Turtle Prime\\"); however, Karai has gotten doubts about her father's plan and secretly teleports the Turtles to safety, where they are joined by Casey Jones and April O'Neil. Unfortunately, Ch'rell has already infiltrated the Turtle Prime universe and is now demolishing it; this causes a chain reaction that begins to literally erase everything in the 2003 universe. Needing to upgrade their portal device, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon HQ, where Hun is waiting for them to take revenge on them. However, when he sees the world vanishing, Hun surrenders the upgrade tech just before he's erased. Despite April and Casey being erased as well, the Turtles just manage to escape the 2003 universe, and are teleported to Turtle Prime. They quickly encounter their 1984 counterparts, and after some explanation the twelve Turtles team up to stop the destruction wrought by Utrom Shredder, joined by Splinter, Karai, '87 Shredder and Krang. During the scuffle, Ch'rell's exo-suit is knocked into the energy the Technodrome is firing and receives damage. Everyone tries knocking him into the beam before Rocksteady accidentally trips on and unplugs the power cable for the Technodrome's main beam cannon. Utrom Shredder seizes and begins crushing the Prime Turtles, causing Turtle Prime and all his enemies to start being erased. Even though Karai warns him that all of reality, including Ch'rell himself, will vanish, Utrom Shredder continues to crush the Prime Turtles due to being too insane to care until 1987-Donatello tosses explosive throwing stars at his leg, causing him to release the Prime Turtles and thus halting Turtle Prime's demise. Bebop then plugs the Technodrome's beam back in, thus inadvertently vaporizing Ch'rell into nothingness. With their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as Turtle Prime and the 2003 reality restore themselves. Even if Utrom Shredder is defeated, 2003 Splinter and Karai note that Ch'rell always returns no matter how he is defeated, but the 2003 characters decide they'll be there to stop him whenever he may rise again. The 1987 characters board the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the 2003 characters use the portal projector to return to theirs. The Prime Turtles decide to go get some pizza to eat, as somewhere else, in the real world, Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman put the finishing touches on the first issue of Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and go out themselves to get pizza, expressing the hope that the book will sell.  Production = Casting and music = None of the original voice cast from the 1987 cartoon series reprised their roles nor was the original soundtrack / score from the show used in this special. In the actors' case, since 4Kids Productions reside in New York City while the majority of the original cast reside in California, hiring them would be expensive and time-consuming as most of them either retired or refuse to work on projects unsanctioned by SAG-AFTRA, which was not used in most of their properties. For the score, most of the music from the series is owned by Lionsgate and would require a license fee to be used in the show. For a cost- effective solution, the special used many of the productions' frequent talents and used their in-score team to make a soundtrack reminiscent of the original series.

Tectonics The tectonic relationship of the Sangihe Plate, Halmahera Plate, and the Molucca Sea Plate, plus the volcanic Halmahera Arc and the Sangihe Arc is complex. Their interrelationship constitutes the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. The north of this zone interlinks with the Philippine Mobile Belt. Some call this linkage the Philippine–Halmahera Arc and consider it an integral part of the elongated zone of convergence extending north through the Philippines into eastern Taiwan. In the Molucca Sea Collision Zone model, the Molucca Sea Plate has been totally consumed by the arc-arc collision of the Halmahera Arc and the Sangihe Arc of eastern Indonesia. Macpherson, Forde, Hall and Thirlwall (2003) in Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes, p208 Arc-arc collision The Molucca Sea Collision Zone is the site of an orthogonal collision between two active subduction systems. Both the Halmahera subduction system to the east, and the Sangihe subduction system to the west, have subducted oceanic lithosphere of the Molucca Sea plate, which has been completely consumed, with the Sangihe arc now over-riding the Halmahera forearc.Colin G Macpherson et ors, Geochemical evolution of magmatism in an arc-arc collision: the Halmahera and Sangihe arcs, eastern Indonesia, in Robert D Larter, ed, (2003) Intra-oceanic Subduction Systems, Geological Society of London. p208 Both volcanic arcs have been active since the Neogene. Both arcs show increased evidence for sediment recycling as the collision progressed, but for differing reasons. In Halmahera, this may represent an increased sediment flux through the arc front, while in Sangihe it may simply reflect a greater opportunity for melting of sediment-fluxed portions of the mantle wedge. In both cases the change in arc geochemistry can be related to the evolving architecture of that particular subduction zone. The Halmahera lavas also record a temporal change in the chemistry of the mantle component that resulted from induced convection above the falling Molucca Sea Plate drawing compositionally distinct peridotite into the mantle wedge. Colin G Macpherson et ors, Geochemical evolution of magmatism in an arc-arc collision: the Halmahera and Sangihe arcs, eastern Indonesia, in Robert D Larter, ed, (2003) Intra-oceanic Subduction Systems, Geological Society of London. p207 Single collision zones The magmatic systems are reaching the end of their life as island arcs and are becoming a single collision zone,Colin G Macpherson et ors, Geochemical evolution of magmatism in an arc-arc collision: the Halmahera and Sangihe arcs, eastern Indonesia, in Robert D Larter, ed, (2003) Intra-oceanic Subduction Systems, Geological Society of London. p208 lending weight to the contention that Halmahera and Sangihe should be regarded as tectonic plates rather than volcanic arcs.

It was first published in the collection Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell (1846). Though it shows some signs of hasty composition the critic Winifred Gérin considered it probably Ann Brontë's finest poem. Analysis Brontë's love of the sea is expressed in this poem. In it, the sea is portrayed as \\"The Great Liberator\\". The line \\"the long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing\\" and the footnote she wrote at the bottom of the poem reveals that Brontë \\"loved wild weather, as she loved the sea, and hard country and snow\\". The poem further indicates the power and spiritual affect of the wind. The errors in punctuation on lines five and nine, as well as the erasures before \\"sunshine\\" and \\"above\\" suggest that the poem was written hastily. One interpretation by Winifred Gérin says that in the poem \\"emotion and expression have achieved a fusion as felicitous as it is rare in Brontë's writing, is probably the best poem she ever wrote, though not the most characteristic\\". Composition history The poem is based upon an actual experience of Brontë's. A note stating \\"Composed in the Long-Plantation on a wild bright windy day\\", was written in Anne Brontë's hand at the bottom of the manuscript and the \\"Long- Plantation\\" was identified by Edward Chitham as a wood to the East of Kirby Hall toward the River Ouse, though there is no clear evidence that Long Plantation is a real place. This is about a mile north of Thorp Green. Brontë, who was then serving as a governess, was influenced, both positively and negatively, as a writer by her time at Thorp Green. She was not able to write often at Thorp Green and so this poem was likely written during, or after a vacation. Her stay at Thorp Green was intended to help her become independent and form for her own philosophies and artistic style, but it may have done the opposite effect, as reflected in this poem. \\"Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day\\" was written at Green Thorpe during Brontë's three-year stay from 1842-1845, and may have been influenced by homesickness. She wrote the poem on December 30, 1842. It was composed during the Victorian Crisis of Faith, a period which played a major role in poems and literature during its time. The meter may have been derived from Thomas Moore's style based on Irish folk song. His poem \\"I saw from the beach\\" has four quatrains similar in structure to Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day. \\"Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day\\" was first published in Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, May 1846.

Despite this qualification, under the pressure of the corporate sponsor Pepsi, Harra's Casino allowed Phil Hellmuth, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Chan to compete. Mike Matusow won the million dollar prize. World Poker Tour commentator Mike Sexton won the million dollar prize in 2006, defeating a field of 27 players. In 2010, the Tournament of Champions returned to the WSOP. The event was held on June 27, 2010. Huck Seed won the $500,000 first prize.

James Crowley, who was responding to a 9-1-1 caller's report of men breaking and entering the residence. The arrest initiated a series of events that unfolded under the spotlight of the international news media. The arrest occurred just after Gates returned home to Cambridge after a trip to China to research the ancestry of Yo-Yo Ma for Faces of America. Gates found the front door to his home jammed shut and, with the help of his driver, tried to force it open. A local witness reported their activity to the police as a potential burglary in progress. Accounts regarding the ensuing confrontation differ, but Gates was arrested by the responding officer, Cambridge Police Sgt. James Crowley, and charged with disorderly conduct. On July 21, the charges against Gates were dropped. The arrest generated a national debate about whether or not it represented an example of racial profiling by police. On July 22, President Barack Obama said about the incident, \\"I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home, and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.\\" Law enforcement organizations and members objected to Obama's comments and criticized his handling of the issue. In the aftermath, Obama stated that he regretted his comments and hoped that the situation could become a \\"teachable moment\\". On July 24, Obama invited both parties to the White House to discuss the issue over beer, and on July 30, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined Crowley and Gates in a private, cordial meeting in a courtyard near the White House Rose Garden; this became known colloquially as the \\"Beer Summit\\". An independent panel with experts from across the nation published a report on June 30, 2010, which states that \\"Sergeant Crowley and Professor Gates each missed opportunities to 'ratchet down' the situation and end it peacefully\\" and share responsibility for the controversial July 16 arrest. Crowley could have better explained how uncertain and potentially dangerous it is to respond to a serious crime-in- progress call and why this can result in a seemingly rude tone. Gates could have tried to understand Crowley's view of the situation and could have spoken respectfully to Crowley. The report cites research that shows people's feelings about a police encounter depend significantly on whether they feel the officer displays respect and courtesy. Arrest On July 16, 2009, Gates had just returned from a trip to China. As the front door of his home would not open, Gates entered through the back door. Once inside, he still could not open the front door. Gates later stated that the lock was damaged and speculated that someone had attempted to \\"jimmy\\" it. Gates went back outside and, with help from his driver, forced the door open. Since the house is university-owned, he then reported the problem to Harvard's maintenance department. After Gates's driver left, the Cambridge police arrived, alerted by the 9-1-1 call of a neighbor, Lucia Whalen. There are multiple published accounts of the subsequent events which led to the arrest of Gates, including the police report, interviews with Sgt. Crowley and other officers on the scene; and published interviews with Gates and Whalen. =Police report and 9-1-1 dispatcher recordings= According to the police report, Crowley arrived at the scene, went up to the front door, and asked Gates to step outside. Crowley explained he was investigating the report of a break-in in progress; as he did so, Gates opened the front door and said, \\"Why, because I'm a black man in America?\\" Crowley's report states that he believed Gates was lawfully in the residence, but that he was surprised and confused by Gates's behavior, which included a threat that Crowley did not know who he was \\"messing with.\\" Crowley then asked Gates for a photo ID so as to verify he was the resident of the house; Gates initially refused, but then did supply his Harvard University identification card. Crowley wrote that Gates repeatedly shouted requests for his identification. Crowley then told Gates that he was leaving his residence and that if Gates wanted to continue discussing the matter, he would speak to him outside. Gates replied, \\"Yeah, I'll speak with your mama outside.\\" On the 9-1-1 dispatcher audio recordings, a man's loud voice is heard in the background at several points during Sgt. Crowley's transmissions. Gates stepped onto his front porch and continued to yell at Crowley, accusing him of racial bias and saying he had not heard the last of him. Faced with this tumultuous behavior from Gates, even though he was still standing on his own front porch, Crowley warned Gates that he was becoming disorderly. When Gates ignored this warning and persisted in his behavior, and likewise ignored a second warning from Crowley, Crowley informed him that he was under arrest. =Gates's accounts= Gates's account of the events first appeared in The Root on July 20. According to the statement, Gates saw Crowley at the door as he was speaking to the Harvard Real Estate Office to have his front door fixed. When he opened the front door, Crowley immediately asked him to step outside. Gates did not comply and asked Crowley why he was there. When told that Crowley was a police officer investigating a reported breaking and entering, Gates replied that it was his house, and he was a Harvard faculty member. Crowley asked Gates whether he could prove it; Gates told him he could, and turned to go to the kitchen to fetch his wallet. Crowley followed him into the house. Gates then handed Crowley his Harvard University ID and a current driver's license, both including his photograph, the license also giving his address. Gates then asked Crowley for his name and badge number, but Crowley did not respond. Following repeated requests for Crowley's name and badge number, the officer left the kitchen; Gates followed him to the front door. As he stepped out the front door and asked the other officers for Crowley's name and badge number, Crowley said, \\"Thank you for accommodating my earlier request,\\" and arrested Gates on his front porch. In an interview published in The Root on July 21, Gates said that when Crowley first asked him to step outside onto the porch, \\"the way he said it, I knew he wasn't canvassing for the police benevolent association. All the hairs stood up on the back of my neck, and I realized that I was in danger. And I said to him no, out of instinct. I said, 'No, I will not.'\\" \\"He demanded that I step out on the porch, and I don't think he would have done that if I was a white person.\\" Gates called the references to loud and tumultuous behavior in the police report a \\"joke\\"; he had been physically incapable of yelling at the time, due to a severe bronchial infection. As he was walked to the car in handcuffs, he asked, \\"Is this how you treat a black man in America?\\" In an interview with columnist Maureen Dowd, Gates denied he had made a reference to the mother of the arresting officer. =Lucia Whalen= Lucia Whalen was the witness and original 9-1-1 caller reporting the incident. Sgt. Crowley stated in his official police report that when he arrived at the scene, he spoke to Whalen, who told him she had \\"observed what appeared to be two black males with backpacks\\" trying to force entry. Whalen subsequently denied making any such comment to Crowley. Whalen was hurt by widespread comments labeling her a racist, based on the \\"two black males with backpacks\\" quote in the police report. A recording of her 9-1-1 call was released on July 27; in it, Whalen could be heard saying, \\"I don't know if they live there and they just had a hard time with their key.\\" When asked for a more detailed description by the dispatcher, her reply on the tape was, \\"One looked kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure. And the other one entered and I didn't see what he looked like at all.\\" =Charges and resolution= Gates was held for four hours and charged with disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped five days later, on July 21, 2009, by the Middlesex County district attorney's office, upon the recommendation of the city of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department. A joint press release by the authorities and Professor Gates said all parties had agreed that this was \\"a just resolution to an unfortunate set of circumstances\\" and that the incident \\"should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Professor Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department.\\" Sgt. Crowley said he would not apologize for his actions. He was backed up by the Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, that released a statement saying his actions had been consistent with police training, policies and applicable legal standards. Response The incident was first reported in The Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper, the Monday morning after the arrest. Following a write-up by the Associated Press that afternoon, the story spread quickly. Public interest in the arrest grew when newspapers published the photograph showing a handcuffed Gates being escorted away from the front door. A number of individuals commented on the incident in the days that followed. The Governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, stated that he felt \\"troubled\\" about the situation. The Mayor of Cambridge, E. Denise Simmons, suggested that the incident was a \\"teachable moment\\" and that she hoped there would be meaningful dialogue between Mr. Gates, the police force, and the general public. Some members of the Harvard community raised questions about racial profiling. The Reverend Al Sharpton discussed the incident and referred to it as one of \\"police abuse or racial profiling\\", calling it \\"outrageous\\" and \\"unbelievable.\\" Gates argued that the police picked on him because of his race, and said that he would use the incident to raise awareness of alleged police mistreatment of blacks, suggesting that he may plan a documentary about it. Sgt. James Crowley's supporters noted he was chosen by a black police commissioner to serve as an instructor for a Lowell Police Academy course entitled \\"Racial Profiling\\", which Crowley has taught since 2004. While working as a campus police officer at Brandeis University in 1993, Crowley had tried to revive African American Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after the latter suffered a fatal heart attack. Crowley received public support from many police officers, including African Americans, who portrayed him as a good and fair officer. Sgt. Leon Lashley, a black officer who was present at Gates's arrest, said he supported Sgt. Crowley's actions \\"100 percent.\\" Lashley added that he thought it would have gone differently, with no arrest, if he had been the first officer to arrive on the scene and the initial encounter with Gates had been \\"black man to black man.\\" Another officer in the Cambridge police department said \\"racism is not part of it, and that is what is frustrating.\\" Jon Shane, who spent 17 years as a police officer in Newark, New Jersey, and is a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who specializes in police policy and practice, told Time magazine that, had he been the responding officer, he would not have arrested Gates after identifying him. He described Gates's behavior as \\"contempt of cop\\" which officers are supposed to handle as a first amendment right under the U.S. Constitution (cf.Cohen v. California, which affirmed a right to \\"offensive\\" speech). Tom Nolan, a criminal justice professor at Boston University who spent 27 years in uniform at the Boston Police Department, was quoted in the same article supporting an officer's use of discretion in disorderly conduct cases. Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College, told the Time reporter that disorderly conduct is \\"probably the most abused statute in America.\\" David E. Frank, a senior news reporter for Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and former prosecutor in Massachusetts, commented that, from a legal standpoint, \\"the decision not to prosecute certainly seems to be the correct one.\\" In his analysis, even if the prosecution could prove all of the disputed factual allegations in Crowley's report, Massachusetts case law does not consider offensive and abusive language to be disorderly conduct per se, and they would be unlikely to prevail in court. Attorney Harvey A. Silverglate suggested that the charges were dropped because Gates would almost certainly have prevailed in court with a First Amendment defense, an outcome that would have severely curtailed future arrests for disorderly conduct in \\"contempt of cop\\" situations. In an interview with CNN, General Colin Powell, former Secretary of State and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman offered opinions on both sides of the incident. With regard to Gates, Powell said \\"I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal\\". Powell recalled that he was taught as a child \\"not to argue with a police officer trying to do their job\\" and that Gates should have instead cooperated to avoid making the situation difficult, suggested that Gates could afterwards file a complaint or lawsuit if he disagreed with the officer. With regard to Sgt. Crowley, Powell stated that: \\"Once they felt they had to bring Dr. Gates out of the house and to handcuff him, I would've thought at that point, some adult supervision would have stepped in and said 'OK look, it is his house. Let's not take this any further, take the handcuffs off, good night Dr. Gates.\\" A review conducted by the \\"Cambridge Review Committee,\\" which was formed by the Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy at the recommendation of Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas, concluded that the incident was avoidable, noting that \\"Sergeant Crowley and Professor Gates each missed opportunities to 'rachet down' the situation and end it peacefully.\\" Both Gates and Crowley have been active participants with the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, California. Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the center, has invited both of them back to the center in order to \\"create the next real 'teaching moment' for our nation.\\" =Justin Barrett e-mail= On July 28, it was revealed in the media that Justin Barrett, a 36-year-old Boston Police Department officer who had been on the job for two years, and is also a member of the Massachusetts National Guard, sent a mass e-mail to fellow National Guardsmen and to The Boston Globe in which he referred to Gates as a \\"jungle monkey.\\" Although the email was signed only JB, when he was asked about it, Barrett admitted to his BPD superiors that he was the author. According to an article in the Boston Globe, Barrett wrote the email containing the racial slur \\"in reaction to media coverage of Gates's arrest July 16,\\" in particular to a July 22 Globe column by Yvonne Abraham, who expressed support for Gates. In the e-mail, Barrett wrote, \\"If I was the officer he [Gates] verbally assaulted like a banana-eating jungle monkey, I would have sprayed him in the face with OC [oleorosin capsicum, or pepper spray] deserving of his belligerent non- compliance.\\" During the course of the message, Barrett used the phrase \\"jungle monkey\\" four times, three times in reference to Gates and once in reference to Abraham's column, which he characterized as \\"jungle monkey gibberish.\\" Upon learning of the incident, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis immediately stripped Officer Barrett of his gun and badge, put him on administrative leave, and scheduled a termination hearing. The Massachusetts National Guard also suspended Barrett. In reaction to the news of Barrett's conduct, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino compared the officer to a \\"cancer\\" and said he is \\"gone, g-o-n-e\\" from the Boston police force. Barrett, in a television interview, said that he used \\"a poor choice of words\\" in the email. He added, \\"I did not mean to offend anyone.\\" Barrett also stated, \\"I have so many friends of every type of culture and race you can name. I am not a racist.\\" In August 2009, Barrett filed an unsuccessful suit against the Boston Police Department and the City of Boston, charging that the suspension from his duties was a violation of his civil rights. Barrett was discharged from duty on February 5, 2010. On April 26, 2010, the Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA) denied Barrett unemployment benefits. The DUA board’s decision would be affirmed or reversed four times, the last being upheld on July 15, 2013, when the Massachusetts Appeals Court ruled that his \\"egregious misconduct\\" was \\"obviously intentional.\\" Presidential involvement=Press conference and briefing= During a July 22 news conference concerning health care reform, columnist Lynn Sweet, Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, asked President Barack Obama \\"Recently, Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested at his home in Cambridge. What does that incident say to you? And what does it say about race relations in America?\\" Obama replied, \\"Now, I've - I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home. And number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.\\" The President also acknowledged that Gates is a personal friend. Obama's remarks sparked a reaction from law-enforcement professionals. James Preston, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Florida State Lodge, stated: \\"To make such an off-handed comment about a subject without benefit of the facts, in such a public forum, hurts police/community relations and is a setback to all of the years of progress\\". Preston further warned that \\"by reducing all contact between law enforcement and the public to the color of their skin or ethnicity is, in fact, counter-productive to improving relationships\\". In addition, the Cambridge police commissioner, describing the impact of the accusations, commented that \\"this department is deeply pained. It takes its professional pride seriously\\". On July 24, 2009, a multiracial group of police officers demanded an apology from President Obama and Governor Deval Patrick for making comments which the police described as insulting. Republican congressman Thaddeus McCotter said he would introduce a resolution in the House of Representatives calling on the president to apologize to Crowley. An opinion poll released by Pew Research found that 41 percent disapproved of Obama's \\"handling of the situation,\\" while only 29 percent approved, and support from white voters dropped from 53 percent to 46 percent. Congressman Steve King drew unfavorable attention to himself when he remarked, during a radio interview, that \\"The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race that favors the black person, in the case of Professor Gates and Officer (James) Crowley.\\" President Obama appeared unannounced at a White House press briefing on July 24, and said, \\"I want to make clear that in my choice of words I think I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department or Sergeant Crowley specifically - and I could have calibrated those words differently.\\" Also, that \\"I continue to believe, based on what I have heard, that there was an overreaction in pulling Professor Gates out of his home to the station. I also continue to believe, based on what I heard, that Professor Gates probably overreacted as well.\\" =\\"Beer Summit\\"= President Obama called both men on July 24, and invited them to the White House to discuss the situation over beers. Both men accepted the offer. Upon accepting, Gates stated in an email to The Boston Globe that \\"My entire academic career has been based on improving race relations, not exacerbating them. I am hopeful that my experience will lead to greater sensitivity to issues of racial profiling in the criminal justice system.\\"Greene, Meg (April 11, 1995). entire academic career has been based on improving race relations%2C not exacerbating them. I am hopeful that my experience will lead to greater sensitivity to issues of racial profiling in the criminal justice system.\\"&f;=false Henry Louis Gates, Jr.: A Biography. Vintage. p. 164.

One of Gates's lawyers, Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree, a former professor of Obama, stated that \\"I think the president has taken the right approach by trying to make sure we move forward [...] He's always had the ability to negotiate difficult conversations, and his steps today are an important step in the right direction. I think the president has given his assessment, which makes a lot of sense, and, however you feel about it, it has reduced the temperature and allowed everyone to move forward in a constructive way.\\" Ogletree has since written a book about the case.The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America (Palgrave-Macmillan 2010). Steve Killion, president of the Cambridge patrol officers association, also stated \\"I'm absolutely pleased with [Obama's call]. I think it was a good thing for the president to do. .... We all want to see this behind us.\\" On July 30, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Professor Gates, and Sergeant Crowley met at the White House. Initially the Gates and Crowley families were given separate tours of the White House. The families then continued their tours together while the principals had a friendly conversation over beer. Crowley and Gates told Obama that they had already planned to meet again soon for lunch. Obama said he believed \\"what brings us together is stronger than what pulls us apart\\" and that after the meeting he was \\"hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode.\\" Both Crowley and Gates issued post-meeting statements. Crowley commented that he and Gates discussed the topic \\"like two gentlemen, instead of fighting it out either in the physical sense or in the mental sense, in the court of public opinion.\\" Gates commented that he hoped \\"that this experience will prove an occasion for education, not recrimination. I know that Sergeant Crowley shares this goal.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Gates further commented on the meeting, \\"I don't think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together [...] the president was great – he was very wise, very sage, very Solomonic.\\" When asked for his impression of Crowley, Gates joked: \\"We hit it off right from the very beginning [...] when he's not arresting you, Sergeant Crowley is a really likable guy.\\" Relations with Crowley since the incident During an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Gates stated that relations between him and Crowley are amicable. He also revealed that he asked Crowley for a sample of his DNA, and that he and Crowley are distant cousins and share a common Irish ancestor.Gates, Henry Louis. Interview. \\"The Importance of Ancestry\\" The Oprah Winfrey Show. Television Broadcast. ABC, Chicago. March 9, 2010. On the show, Gates stated that Crowley recently gave him the handcuffs used in the arrest. When asked what he would do with the handcuffs, Gates stated that he plans to donate the handcuffs to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Gates later revealed during a National Press Club luncheon that he had met with Sgt Crowley for a beer prior to the Beer Summit at the suggestion of President Bill Clinton. Gates said that he was moved when Crowley told him \\"Professor, all I wanted was to go home to my wife at the end of the day.\\" Gates further recounted that Crowley had feared that another black man had been upstairs who could at any moment have come down and killed him. Gates said this brought tears to his eyes as he understands fear and that ever since he and Crowley have been really good friends. Notes :b.Obama had a Bud Light, Crowley had a Blue Moon, Gates had a Sam Adams Light and Biden, who does not drink alcohol, had a Buckler, which is a low-alcohol beer. Some local brewers had lobbied for a Boston-based beer to be served; Obama is generally said to prefer Budweiser. References Further reading  * Donald E.

It is considered to belong to the Halmahera Plate tectonics, within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Origin Potassium-argon ages of Neogene to Recent igneous rocks from the Halmahera region record a history of intra-oceanic arc development since the late Middle Miocene following an earlier phase of collisional plutonism. Arc formation from the Middle Miocene onwards was due to the east-directed subduction of the Molucca Sea Plate beneath the Philippine Sea Plate as it arrived at the Eurasian margin. The distribution of ages within the Neogene arc indicates a northward migration of volcanic activity during the Late Miocene to Pliocene. Results of the dating work show that after collision with the Australian margin at c. 22 Ma there was a period of volcanic quiescence and limestone deposition before a new arc formed. This arc began erupting at around 11 Ma on Obi as a result of subduction of the Molucca Sea plate. Initiation of subduction is thought to have occurred around 15–17 Ma and may have been responsible for disturbing potassium-argon ages of pre-Neogene rocks. Dates from fresh rocks show that the volcanic front migrated northwards through Bacan and Halmahera throughout the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. Limestone deposition was curtailed as arc activity migrated north while volcanism died out from the south. No Neogene volcanism younger than 8 Ma is observed in the Obi area while on Bacan subduction-related volcanism ceased at c. 2 Ma. Late Pliocene crustal deformation caused a 30–40 km westward shift of the volcanic front. Quaternary volcanic rocks exposed in Bacan and the extreme south of Halmahera are not direct products of subduction but, rather, display geochemical characteristics of both subduction and fault-related magmatism. These volcanic rocks are distributed along splays of the Sorong Fault system. The formation and propagation of the Halmahera arc is a consequence of the clockwise rotation of the Philippine Sea plate as the southern edge moved across the northern Australian margin and impinged on the east Eurasian margin. The ages of initiation of volcanism and subduction track the developing plate boundary as subduction propagated northwards.

It recorded a population of 79,887 in the 2014 Moroccan census, up from 63,872 in the 2004 census. Sefrou is known for its historical Jewish population, and its annual cherry festival. History Sefrou was named for the Ahel Sefrou, a Berber tribe that once inhabited the area. Sefrou's name might be brought from the berber name \\"Asfru\\" (ⴰⵙⴼⵔⵓ) which means \\"the solution\\" (in Morocco) . Sefrou was once home to one of the largest settlements of Moroccan Jews, the population estimated to have been as high as 8,000. The first Jewish people lived in the area of the Ahel Sefrou, most of whom were converted to Judaism around 2,000 years ago. In the 8th century, most of these were converted to Islam under Idris I of Morocco. In the 9th century, a second Jewish population settled from the Tafilalt area and Southern Algeria. Most of the descendants of these Jews stayed in Sefrou until 1967, when many moved to Israel. Idris II of Morocco lived in Sefrou temporarily while overseeing the development of Fez. Geography Sefrou is located at the edge of the Middle Atlas mountain range, and is southeast of Fez. Oued Aggai runs through the city, and about west of Sefrou are the Cascades, a small waterfall. Wadi Aggai also takes part in irrigation for the area. The Kef el-Moumen caves contain ancient tombs, one of which is claimed to be the tomb of Daniel. There is also a spring near Sefrou called Lalla Rekia, which is purported to cure insanity.

The battle occurred on 20 January 1918 when an Ottoman squadron engaged a flotilla of the British Royal Navy off the island of Imbros in the Aegean Sea. A lack of heavy Allied warships in the area allowed the Ottoman battlecruiser and light cruiser to sortie into the Mediterranean and attack the Royal Navy monitors and destroyers at Imbros before assaulting the naval base at Mudros. Although the Ottoman forces managed to complete their objective of destroying the monitors located at Imbros, the battle turned sour for them as they sailed through a minefield while withdrawing. Midilli was sunk and Yavûz Sultân Selîm heavily damaged. Although Yavûz Sultân Selîm managed to beach herself within the Dardanelles, she was subjected to days of air attacks until she was towed to safety. With the most modern cruiser of the Ottoman Navy sunk and her only battlecruiser out of action, the battle effectively curtailed the Ottoman Navy's offensive capability until the end of the war. Prelude By January 1918, the situation for the Ottoman Army in Palestine had begun to falter. The new German commander of the Ottoman Black Sea fleet, Rebeur Paschwitz, decided to try to relieve Allied naval pressure on Palestine by making a sortie out of the Dardanelles.Halpern 1994, p. 255. Several British naval elements of the Aegean Squadron had been taking refuge in Kusu Bay off the islands of Imbros, and they were a prime target for an Ottoman raid. After raiding what shipping could be found at Imbros, Rebeur-Paschwitz would then turn to Mudros and attack the British naval base there.Jameson 2004, p. 89. The Allied force guarding the Dardanelles consisted of a few heavy British and French units as well as several monitors tasked with coastal bombardment. Escorting the monitors were several British destroyers. The pre-dreadnought battleships and were also tasked with guarding the area, but the Lord Nelson had been tasked with ferrying the squadron's admiral to a conference at Salonika. Taking advantage of the absence of the British battleship, the Germans and Ottomans decided to dispatch the battlecruiser Yavûz Sultân Selîm (ex-) and the light cruiser Midilli (ex-) to attack the area. The Allied forces at Imbros on 20 January consisted of the monitors and as well as the s and .Chisholm 1922, p. 1082. Agamemnon was nearby at Mudros, but she was much too slow to chase down the Ottoman ships if they wanted to avoid engaging her. Without Agamemnon and Lord Nelson the British were severely undergunned in comparison to the Ottoman ships. Tigress and Lizard both were armed with two 4-inch guns, two 12 pounders, and two 21-inch torpedo tubes. They were swift ships capable of making at best speed. The two monitors present at Imbros were better suited for coastal bombardment than naval combat, though their heavy guns gave them an element of firepower the destroyers lacked. Raglan, an , was armed with two 14-inch guns, two 6-inch guns, and two 3-inch guns.Gardiner 1985, p. 44. M28 was a smaller vessel than Raglan and as such carried a lighter armament sporting a single 9.2-inch cannon, one 12 pounder, as well as a six pounder anti-aircraft gun. The biggest weak point of both Raglan and M28 were their low top speeds of respectively, giving them little capability to escape an Ottoman raid. In contrast to the British force, the Ottoman vessels were both fast and heavily armed. Midilli sported eight 150 mm cannons, 120 mines, two torpedo tubes, and a top speed of .Groner 1990, p. 107. Yavûz Sultân Selîm was the most powerful ship in the Ottoman fleet with a top speed of 25.5 knots, ten 283 mm guns, twelve 150 mm guns, a dozen 8.8-centimetre guns, and four torpedo tubes.Groner 1990, p. 54. Thus, with no heavy units available to repel them, there was little in the means of effective Allied opposition when the Ottomans set out on their mission. Battle Setting out towards Imbros, Yavûz Sultân Selîm struck a mine on transit to the island, but the damage was insignificant and the two Ottoman vessels were able to continue their mission. Yavûz Sultân Selîm then proceeded to bombard the British signal station at Kephalo Point while Midilli was sent ahead to guard the entrance of Kusu Bay. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm and Midilli approached Kusu Bay, they were sighted by the destroyer HMS Lizard at 5:30 am.Littlefield 1918, p. 414. Lizard attempted to engage the Ottoman ships, but could not close to torpedo range due to heavy fire from her opponents. Yavûz Sultân Selîm soon sighted the two British monitors taking refuge in the bay, and broke off from Lizard to engage them. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm attacked the monitors, Midilli continued to duel with Lizard who was then joined by the destroyer HMS Tigress. Lizard and Tigress attempted to shield the monitors from Yavûz Sultân Selîm by laying a smoke screen, but this was ineffective. The monitors were both much too slow to evade Yavûz Sultân Selîm and she was able to score numerous hits on Raglan, hitting her foretop and killing her gunnery and direction officers. Raglan attempted to return fire with its 6 and 14-inch guns, but scored no hits on the German vessels before her main armament was knocked out when a shell pierced its casemate and ignited the ammunition within it. Shortly after she was disarmed, Raglan was hit in her magazine by one of Yavûz Sultân Selîms 11-inch shells causing the monitor to sink. After Raglan was sunk, the Ottoman battlecruiser began turned her attention to HMS M28, striking her amidships and setting her alight before she was sunk when her magazine exploded at 6:00 a.m. With the two monitors sunk, the Ottomans decided to break off the engagement and head south in an attempt to raid the allied naval base at Mudros. Upon withdrawing from Kusu Bay, the Ottoman force accidentally sailed into a minefield and were shadowed by the two British destroyers they had previously engaged. In addition to the destroyers, several British and Greek aircraft were launched from Mudros to engage the Germans. Greek ace Aristeidis Moraitinis, escorting two Sopwith Baby seaplanes, fought ten enemy aircraft and shot down three enemy seaplanes with his Sopwith Camel. With the approach of enemy aircraft Midilli, which had been following Yavûz Sultân Selîm, took the lead so as to take advantage of her heavier anti-aircraft armament. Midilli then struck a mine near her aft funnel, and shortly afterwards Yavûz Sultân Selîm hit one as well. Within half an hour Midilli had struck four more mines and began to sink. Yavûz Sultân Selîm attempted to rescue Midilli but also struck a mine and was forced to withdraw. Fleeing towards the safety of the Dardanelles, Yavûz Sultân Selîm was pursued by Lizard and Tigress. In order to cover Yavûz Sultân Selîm four Ottoman destroyers and an old cruiser rushed out to engage the British destroyers. After the lead Ottoman destroyer began to take hits, the Ottoman squadron was forced to withdraw back up the Dardanelles. As the British destroyers approached Cape Helles, they were fired upon by Ottoman shore batteries and withdrew. In addition to Lizard and Tigress, a dozen British seaplanes from were launched to finish off Yavûz Sultân Selîm. Although they managed to score two hits against the battlecruiser, the Ottoman ship was by this time near the coast. Thus combined efforts from ten Ottoman seaplanes as well as heavy anti-aircraft fire were able to drive off the air attacks, downing one Sopwith Baby and damaging another aircraft. The four Ottoman destroyers returned and guarded Yavûz Sultân Selîm as she sailed up the Dardnelles.Buchan 1922, p. 241. Severely damaged, the Ottoman battlecruiser ran aground on a sandbar off Nagara Point and became stranded. The next six days saw further air attacks by Allied seaplanes against the Ottoman battlecruiser, with six hits being scored against her. Ottoman seaplanes and heavy shore batteries responded to the raids and were able to guard Yavûz Sultân Selîm and beat back the air attacks. Despite the air raids, Yavûz Sultân Selîm suffered only superficial damage from them as the bombs used by the British were too small to be effective. Allied commanders proposed plans for a submarine raid against the battlecruiser, but the only submarine attached to the Aegean squadron, , had mechanical problems and was inoperative. A raid into the Dardanelles was therefore postponed until a working submarine could be dispatched to the area. Aftermath With no way to free herself, Yavûz Sultân Selîm remained stranded on the sandbar until 26 January when the finally arrived and towed her back into the Black Sea. In one last effort to destroy the battlecruiser, the British sent the submarine into the Dardanelles on 27 January. Yavûz Sultân Selîm had already left the area, and so E14 began sailing back to Allied waters after discovering the battlecruiser's absence. Sighting an Ottoman freighter, the British submarine attempted to torpedo her. The second torpedo fired exploded prematurely.Jameson 2004, pp. 95, 96. The resulting explosion damaged the submarine, forcing it to try to flee the straits. She came under heavy fire from nearby Ottoman shore batteries and was eventually beached with her commander, Geoffrey Saxton White, and another sailor killed and seven captured. White was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts to beach the submarine and save its crew. Although the Ottoman force destroyed the two monitors as planned, their losses traversing the minefield after the engagement in Kusu Bay offset these successes considerably. With Midilli sunk and Yavûz Sultân Selîm severely damaged, the threat of the Ottoman Navy to the Allies was greatly reduced for the remainder of the war. Despite the removal of these two vessels from the Ottoman battle line, the commanders of the British Aegean Squadron were criticized for sending their battleships so far from the Dardanelles. Had either Agamemnon or Lord Nelson had been nearby during the Ottoman raid, Yavûz Sultân Selîm might have been destroyed.

The song was composed primarily by keyboardist Bobby Whitlock, with guitarist Eric Clapton adding the last verse.Schumacher, p. 143. The band recorded the track at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida in August 1970, with Tom Dowd as their producer. An earlier version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" was recorded in London during the sessions for George Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. The session marked the first recordings by Derek and the Dominos. Produced by Phil Spector, this original, faster version of the song featured guitar contributions from Harrison and Dave Mason. It was issued as Derek and the Dominos' debut single, in September 1970, although the band had the release withdrawn. Background Just twenty-two at the time, Whitlock wrote \\"Tell the Truth\\" during the early summer of 1970, while living temporarily with Clapton in England. Whitlock worked out the melody on a guitar tuned in open E, having learned that alternative tuning when Duane Allman was playing with his former band, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. Whitlock recalled:  Recording  As admirers of Sam and Dave, Clapton and Whitlock styled the song as a \\"call and response\\" with the pair singing alternating verses.Reid, pp. xv, 104, 127. \\"Tell the Truth\\" was recorded on 18 June 1970Madinger and Easter, p. 427. as the first original song by what became Derek and the Dominos:Whitlock, p. 84. Clapton, Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and bassist Carl Radle. The four musicians had just helped George Harrison record the majority of the basic tracks for his album All Things Must Pass,Whitlock, p. 82. before which Harrison had agreed to Clapton's request that his co-producer on the album, Phil Spector, would help the Dominos make their first recording as a group.Reid, pp. 92–93, 105.Clapton, p. 132. Four days before the session, Derek and the Dominos, with Dave Mason as second guitarist,Whitlock, pp. 84, 116. had played \\"Tell the Truth\\" at their debut concert, held at London's Lyceum Ballroom.Reid, pp. 103–04. The session for the song and for the Clapton–Whitlock collaboration \\"Roll It Over\\" took place at Apple Studio in central London, with the intention being to issue the tracks as the A- and B-sides of the group's first single.Reid, p. 105. In addition to the four band members, the line-up on \\"Tell the Truth\\" again featured Mason as second guitarist, as well as HarrisonSantoro, p. 64. on electric guitar.Castleman and Podrazik, p. 207. Harrison also played on \\"Roll It Over\\", contributing a slide guitar part.Clayson, p. 297. In August 1970, while recording their album Layla with producer Tom Dowd, the band decided to remake \\"Tell the Truth\\". Author Jan Reid writes of the London-recorded version: \\"the problem wasn't Spector's fabled Wall of Sound engineering control – rather, it sounded as though they sang and played the song about 20 percent too fast. In Spector's production, the lyrics and the voices of Clapton and Whitlock flew by in meaningless garble: the song lost its insight and sense of humor.\\" Dowd and the members of the band struggled with the song until Duane Allman was added to the group, after Clapton and members of Derek and the Dominos met him in a concert. Following the concert, Allman joined the band at Criteria Studios in Miami,Reid, p. 123. where they recorded \\"Tell the Truth\\" on 28 August.Sandford, p. 117. With Allman's slide guitar providing a counterpoint to the melody played by Whitlock and Clapton, Dowd and the band were finally satisfied with the song. Clapton subsequently called Robert Stigwood, record executive of RSO, and told him not to issue the original version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" as a single. In the United States, Atco Records released the single on 14 September 1970,Castleman and Podrazik, p. 92. but the record was soon withdrawn. The Dowd production of the song then appeared as the opening song on side three of the Layla double album, issued in November 1970. The single has since become a sought-after collector's item. Two versions of \\"Tell the Truth\\" were later released on The History of Eric Clapton (1972), the Spector version and a previously unissued jam entitled \\"Tell the Truth – Jam\\". The Spector-produced recording and \\"Roll It Over\\" also appeared on Clapton's four-CD compilation Crossroads in 1988, while \\"Tell the Truth – Jam\\" featured on The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition in 1990 as \\"Tell the Truth (Jam #1)\\". Whitlock recorded an upbeat version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" for his second solo album, Raw Velvet (1972). This was recently included in the 2013 compilation Bobby Whitlock: Where There's a Will There's a Way. The ABC Dunhill Recordings. Musicians on that recording included all the Dominos, plus George Harrison, Jim Price, Bobby Keys and Rick Vito. Live performances \\"Tell the Truth\\" has been frequently played at Eric Clapton's subsequent concerts. Live versions of the song have been included on several of Clapton's albums as well including the deluxe release of 461 Ocean Boulevard, Crossroads Guitar Festival and Live From Madison Square Garden. The song has been sometimes played with and sometimes without the slide part added by Allman. At the Crossroads Festival of 2007, Derek Trucks played the Allman licks. In the Live from Madison Square Garden concert of 2008, with Steve Winwood, there is no slide guitar but Clapton plays a longer solo than what was originally recorded in the studio.

Early life Diederichs entered the Prussian naval officer candidate program along a circuitous route, with an incomplete secondary education, a short stint as a Prussian army cadet and service in the merchant marine.Gottschall, By Order of the Kaiser, p. 4-8 After Naval School graduation at KielThe successor institution is the Naval Academy Mürwik. and Atlantic training voyages on the Prussian sail frigate SMS Niobe, he was commissioned Unterleutnant zur See [Lieutenant JG] in 1867.Gottschall, p. 28 He served a brief tour aboard the royal yacht Grille. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870-1871 he commanded the coastal gunboat SMS Natter. Although a French fleet maneuvered in the North Sea where Natter was deployed, \\"the French battle plan had little impact on Diederichs' wartime service, which proved somewhat anticlimactic\\".Gottschall, p. 37 After hostilities ended, his ship was deactivated. From 1871 to 1874, he attended several terms at the postgraduate Naval War College, the German Imperial Naval Academy 1872-1918 (Marineakademie), with intermittent training cruises in a class with four future admirals.Diederichs, Viktor Valois, Felix von Bendemann, Gustav von Senden-Bibran [Gottschall, p. 44] Based on his academic work at the academy, he was posted to the torpedo research command. After that staff position, he requested and then was assigned to sea duty as executive officer of the corvette SMS Luise for a \\"two-year tour on the East Asian station beginning in October 1878\\".Gottschall, p. 55; Luise replaced SMS Freya at Hong Kong. Luise together with the gunboats Wolf and Cyclop now comprised the active German naval presence on the East Asian station (Gottschall, p. 70). With the return of the ship to Wilhelmshaven and deactivation in 1880, Diederichs's new orders assigned him as gunnery and torpedo instructor to the undergraduate Naval School and the postgraduate Naval War College (Marineakademie), both of which were in Kiel at the time. During his tenure at those schools, he participated in manoeuvres and exercises and several study trips abroad. With the conclusion of the academic year 1890, Captain Diederichs became director of the Imperial Shipyard at Kiel. In January 1892, he was promoted to rear admiral. He travelled to the United States in May 1893 to visit several shipyards and the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island.Gottschall, p. 117 In 1895, he was appointed Chief of Staff for Admiral Eduard von Knorr at the German Imperial Naval High Command. Knorr was a difficult taskmaster (even Tirpitz had run afoul of him) and after being dismissed by Knorr, Diederichs contemplated retirement.Despite the dismissal, Knorr had given Diederichs a favourable evaluation (Gottschall, p. 113). His career was saved after Kaiser Wilhelm II recalled Rear Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz from East Asia to Berlin, an action that created a vacancy in 1897 for Diederichs to fill. He replaced Tirpitz as commanding officer of the East Asian Cruiser Division, still without a base.Gottschall, p. 133 East Asia The political will to acquire a base in the Far East had existed for some time. The new Chancellor Chlodwig von Hohenlohe agreed in principle, despite reservations and a preference for \\"caution\\" and diplomatic, rather than, military solutions. Purchase or acquisition by other means, however, would fulfill that basic requirement.Schultz-Naumann, Unter Kaisers Flagge, p. 175 The Jiaozhou Bay concession was achieved. German ships now controlled Kiautschou Bay. With the initially-tenuous hold on the bay somewhat solidified by December 1897 by the arrival of additional ships of a second cruiser division, Diederichs continually had to deal with multiple small crises involving the movements of Chinese forces with often aggressive intentions. The situation changed favourably on 26 January 1898, when the steamer Darmstadt disembarked the 1,200 Marines of 3rd Sea Battalion to garrison the east Asian station.Gottschall, p. 176; the battalion was the only all-German formation in an overseas protectorate. The convention of Peking on 6 March 1898 granted a 99-year German concession for Kiautschou Bay. With the appointment of an imperial governor, Diederichs, now promoted to vice admiral, wrote that he \\"had fulfilled [his] purpose in the navy\\".Gottschall, p. 177 After the summer activities of 1899 in the Philippines, when German interests diverted to the purchase of certain Spanish Pacific islands, Diederichs handed command of the East Asia fleet at Tsingtao on 14 April 1899 to Rear Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia. Later life Diederichsweg [Diederichs Lane] at Tsingtao, in front of colonial government building, 1913 Diederichs's stone in Qingdao. During Diederichs' two-year absence from Berlin, a major naval reorganization had taken place that propelled Alfred von Tirpitz \\"to the pinnacle of [German] naval authority\\".Gottschall, p. 224 Into much internal strife, Diederichs stepped in as Chief of the Admiralty Staff (Admiralstab). He discovered serious organizational discords with the Tirpitz administration that he could not overcome, he did not have Wilhelm II's ear, he had few influential peers and his operational authority over ships at foreign stations was \\"undermined\\". He was again considering retirement l, as he concluded that the Kaiser no longer had confidence in his leadership of the admiralty staff although he was promoted to full Admiral in January 1902. Tirpitz did not wait but simply announced a successor to Diederichs. With limited options in the matter, he transmitted his request for retirement on 9 August 1902.Gottschall, p. 255 Admiral Diederichs and his wife decided to retire to Baden-Baden, where he designed a villa and had it constructed. LHe watched from that resort city the continuing naval arms race with Britain and the Great War. He was honoured at the Kiautschou colony by having a mountain named after him and a street in Tsingtao near the Gouverneurspalast, the seat of the colonial government. He died on 8 March 1918, age 74, six months after the death of his wife, and is interred in a mausoleum at Baden-Baden's municipal cemetery. ReferencesSources *Gottschall, Terrel D.

Regional tectonics The tectonic setting of the Molucca Sea region is unique. It is the only global example of an active arc-arc collision consuming an oceanic basin via subduction in two directions. The Molucca Sea Plate has been subsumed by tectonic microplates, the Halmahera Plate and the Sangihe Plate. The whole complexity is now known as the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. The existence of Halmahera as a tectonic plate separate from the Molucca Sea Plate is not yet entirely agreed upon by paleogeologists. Some see Halmahera as an eastern slab of the Molucca Sea Plate, just as they regard Sangihe as a western slab of the Molucca Sea Plate. What is apparent to date is that Halmahera was part of the Molucca Sea slab subducted during the Neogene between 45 Ma and 25 Ma.R. Hall and W. Spakman, Australian Plate Tomography and Tectonics in R. R. Hillis, R. D. Müller, Evolution and Dynamics of the Australian Plate, Geological Society of America Special Papers 2003, #372, p377 Seismicity shows the east-dipping Halmahera reaches a depth of about 200 km. Seismic tomography suggests that the Halmahera goes deeper to at least 400 km. Both Sangihe and Halmahera are exposed to the surface while the Molucca Sea plate is completely subsumed below these two microplates. The southern boundary of the Molucca Sea Plate is also the boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Australian Plate, and is moving northwards. Since the Sangihe Plate and the Halmahera Plate are in continuity with the Molucca Sea Plate, this implies all three slabs are moving northward in mantle with the Australian Plate. A broad high-velocity zone beneath the Bird's Head Plate at 400–600 km depth is interpreted by R Hall and W Spakman as indicating a remnant slab subducted below the Halmahera Plate, and another broad high-velocity zone beneath the Celebes Sea at 700–1000 km depth is interpreted as a remnant slab below the Sangihe Plate, both remnants having originated from a slab subducted beneath the Philippine-Halmahera Arc 45 Ma to 25 Ma ago. In this model, the Bird's Head and Halmahera Plates are separated by the Sorong Fault, a major lateral east-west fault. An earlier model considered the area to be the Halmahera Arc, a volcanic arc of islands without a tectonic plate base. More recent studies in the 1990s and later, have displaced this theory with the Halmahera Plate theory.

He first served with William of Orange in the fight for Dutch independence from Spain then switched to serve with distinction in the Spanish army. In 1580 he changed his allegiance to the Dutch Republic and was declared Lord of Toutenburg in Gelderland, Knight and Marshall of the Camp by the Dutch States General. He then served on the Protestant side in the Cologne War with some success until he drowned in the Waal in a failed attack on Nijmegen in 1588. Childhood and early career Coat of Arms Born at Goch in the Duchy of Cleves, as a child he served as a page for Christoffel van IJsselstein (or Ysselstein), and when he came of age, he joined the banner of William of Orange at the head of twenty-two men at arms, fighting in the Eighty Years' War. By right of descent, he claimed a castle in Bleijenbeek, currently in northern Limburg, which was then a possession of his cousin. Although he took physical possession of the castle, the judiciary supported the cousin, and Schenck was forcibly dispossessed. He became unpopular in William's court and after the crushing defeat in the Battle of Gembloux in 1578, he made overtures to the Spanish, who enlisted him as a soldier in the Army of Flanders. In the wars against the Dutch, he became known, and notorious, as the most daring and formidable Netherlander that wore Philip’s colors.Alexander Du Bois Schenck, the Rev. William Schenck, his ancestry and his descendants, Google Books, Accessed 23 July 2009. On 15 June 1580, at the , while still in the service of the Spanish, he outgeneralled and defeated Count Philip Hohenlohe, who lost 1500 soldiers, to 300 lost by Schenck.Schenck, p. 139. This battle preserved the city of Groningen for Philip. In the course of this campaign, he was captured twice, and held for ransom, and each time he escaped. Reportedly, he could eat, drink and sleep in the saddle, and his men followed him like dogs.Schenck, p. 128. Transfer to Dutch service and the Cologne War Despite his fame, he was dissatisfied, because he felt the Spanish continually treated him with injustice and lack of faith. Lewes Lewknor wrote of Schenck's dissatisfaction, 'Nothing ever more moved Skinke than the indignity of this dealing; and so telling the duke, that he would be loath, now he had spent all that ever he had in the Kings service, to be accounted a captain of freebooters, took his leave, bending his mind presently to revenge; and forthwith surprising Nuis by stratagem, delivered both the same, and the castle of Lemmicke, and withal, his own person, into the service of the States; of whom he was received with such honour as to a man of such worthiness belonged.'Lewes Lewkenor, The Estate of English Fugitives. 1595 On 25 May 1585, he declared his allegiance to the foundling Dutch Republic, which made him Lieutenant Governor of Gelderland and Marshall of Camp in the Dutch States Army. He received a salary of 1200 guilders a month. He resigned from his claim to the castle of Blynbeek, and he was reimbursed with other estates in Holland and Zeeland, and with 4000 florins.Schenck, p. 148. The next month, he and Adolf van Nieuwenaar were defeated by the Spanish general Juan Baptista de Tassis at the Battle of Amerongen on 23 June 1585. By spring the following year, he had adopted the cause of Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg in his quest to keep the Electorate of Cologne, also called the Cologne War.Hennes, pp. 156-162; Schenck, p. 148. =Sack of Westphalia= In March 1586, accompanied by Hermann Friedrich Cloedt, the commander of the fortified town of Neuss, Schenck went to the County of Westphalia at the head of 500 foot and 500 horse. After plundering Vest and Recklinghausen, on 18 March he captured Werl through trickery. He loaded a train of wagons with his soldiers and covered them with salt. When the wagons of salt were seen outside the city gates, they were at once admitted, salt being a valued commodity. The \\"salted soldiers\\" then over-powered the guard and captured the town. Some of the defenders escaped to the Werl citadel, which Schenck and his troops stormed in vain. When they could not capture the citadel, they thoroughly sacked the city. Count Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne, collected his force of 4000 and besieged Schenck in Werl. Schenck and Cloedt were thus attacked from the outside, and from the several hundred guards in the Werl citadel. They loaded their wagons, this time with booty, took 30 magistrates as hostages, and attacked Haultpenne's force, killing about 500 of them, and losing 200 of their own. After fighting their way through Haultpenne's force, Cloedt returned to Neuss and Schenck to Venlo on the Neuss river, where Schenck left his fortune and his wife, while he journeyed to Delft.L. Ennen, Geschichte der Stadt Köln, Cologne, 1863–1880. Google Books 21 July 2009; Johann Heinrich Hennes, Der Kampf um das Erzstift Köln zur Zeit der Kurfürstenpublished 1878, pp. 156–162. There, Robert Dudley knighted him by order of Elizabeth, and presented him with a chain valued at a thousand gold pieces.Ernest Alfred Benians The Cambridge Modern History, New York, MacMillan, 1905, p. 708. Schenck had hardly returned from Delft when Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma laid siege to Venlo. At night, Schenck and Roger Williams, a Welshman in Dutch service, took 130 English lancers and 30 of his own men. They passed through enemy lines, killed the guards and several of the soldiers, and reached the door of the Duke of Parma's tent, where they killed Parma's secretary and his personal guard.Schenck, p. 150. Afterward, Schenck and Williams made their way to Wachtendonk and Rheinberg, where he built a fortress, called Schenckenschanz, or Schenck's Fortification, at the confluence of the Waal and the Rhine. Williams and Schenck also reportedly took the castle of Kaisersworth in June 1586.Sophie Crawford Lomas and Allen B. Hinds (editors), Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 21, Part 2: June 1586–March 1587 (1927). pp. 18–44 Date accessed: 22 September 2009 The following summer, he and his men surprised the Spanish guard at the city of Bonn in the Electorate of Cologne, took the city, fortified it, and supplied it with food, but the Elector Gebhard von Waldburg, whose capital city this was, could not keep it, and after a six months' siege, it was retaken by the Spanish.Hennes, pp. 156-162. Martin Schenck drowns in the Waal River at Nijmegen, 10 August 1589. Assault on Nijmegen and death By 1588, only Rheinberg remained outside the Spanish grasp, and in an effort to salvage the last major garrison in the electorate of Cologne for Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, Schenck intercepted and defeated seven companies of foot marching to Friesland, to reinforce Francisco Verdugo. On the evening of 10 August, he and 20 barges of men made their way down the Waal to Nijmegen, where they planned to enter the city through windows overlooking the river. The swollen river pushed more than half the barges past their destination; the house they chose to enter was the site of a wedding party, and the alarm was raised. The city's garrison and citizens turned out to fight off the marauders, and Schenck and his men were driven back. In an effort to escape, he jumped into the river, and drowned. His body was found a few days later; it was decapitated, his head placed on a pike, his body quartered, and exhibited at four gates.Charles Maurice Davies, the History of Holland and the Dutch Republic, 1851, p. 233.

The Fall of Osaka Castle occurred between Imperial and Tokugawa shogunate forces during the Boshin War in Japan, where soon after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, the Tokugawa-held Osaka Castle was captured by pro-Imperial \\"Kangun\\" forces on February 2, 1868. History The Castle of Osaka was symbolic as it was the power-base of the Tokugawa Bakufu in Western Japan. It was also historically significant and it had been the location of the Siege of Osaka, the decisive battle which established the power of the Tokugawa more than two centuries before. Following the Tokugawa Shogunate's defeat in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi on January 31, 1868. Troops loyal to the bakufu tried to regroup under Tokugawa Yoshinobu. At Osaka Castle, Tokugawa Yoshinobu gathered his advisors and military leaders to plan strategy and, to boost morale, advised that he would personally take to the field as commander of bakufu forces. However, on that evening, Tokugawa Yoshinobu slipped away from Osaka Castle accompanied by the daimyōs of Aizu and Kuwana to escape back to Edo on the shogunate warship Kaiyō maru. As Kaiyō maru had not arrived, he took refuge for the night on an American warship, USS Iroquois, anchored in Osaka Bay. The Kaiyō maru arrived two hours later and picked up the Tokugawa party. When the remnants of his forces learned that the Shōgun had abandoned them, they departed Osaka Castle, which was later surrendered to Imperial forces without resistance. The castle was seized and burnt on February 2, 1868. Once the Osaka Castle was burnt and reduced to ruins by the new government, it was later used as a ground for military barracks. Yoshinobu later stated that he had been disturbed by the Imperial approval given to the actions of Satsuma and Chōshū, and, once the Imperial brocade banner had appeared, he had lost all will to fight.

The massacre, believed to have been in response to the murder of a New Zealand soldier by a villager, caused a significant rift between the Division and its Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby. Context The village of Surafend (also known as Sarafand) was near the camps of the three brigades of the ANZAC Mounted Division: the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades. The proximity of the village, coupled with a perceived general British Army acceptance and dismissal of petty crime by the local Arabs, meant that thefts and even murders took place regularly with little to no redress from the Imperial forces. The reluctance of the British to punish or avenge such crimes led to a build-up of resentment among the division towards both the native Arabs and British General Headquarters. The massacre On the night of 9–10 December 1918, a New Zealand soldier, 65779 Trooper Leslie Lowry, was woken around midnight when his kitbag, which he was using as a pillow, was stolen from his tent. Lowry pursued the thief outside of the camp, where he was apparently shot. Lowry was found by Corporal C.H. Carr, who had heard the sound of a struggle and a cry for help, lying in the sand about 40 metres from the tent lines, bleeding from a bullet wound to the chest. He died just as a doctor arrived at approximately 1:30a.m. on Tuesday 10 December, having said nothing. The camp was roused, and a group of New Zealand soldiers followed the footprints of the thief, which ended about a hundred yards before the village of Surafend. Soldiers set up a cordon around the village, and ordered the sheikhs of the village to surrender the murderer, but they denied any knowledge of the incident or its perpetrator. The death was brought to the attention of the staff of the division the following day, and a court of inquiry was conducted at first light by Major Magnus Johnson. Plaster casts of the footprints were taken, and the bullet that killed Lowry was determined to have been fired by a Colt .45 pistol, which was not on general issue to NZMR troops, but was common amongst Turkish and Arab forces. By nightfall there had been no response on what action, if any, should be taken. According to the police report, there was no evidence linking anyone from the village to the murder. The report states: > At 0930 on the 10th December 1918 the Police commenced to search the Village > and found no trace whatsoever of the culprit, or even any other individual > suspected of the crime. The only material clue was that of a Native Cap > (similar to headgear worn by Bedouins) which was picked up by a mate of the > deceased, and handed to me by Captain Cobb. This was found on the scene > where the Soldier was shot and killed. The following day, the men of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles prepared for what was to take place that night. Early in the evening, around two hundred soldiers entered the village, expelling the women and children. Armed with heavy sticks and bayonets, the soldiers then set upon the remaining villagers whilst also burning the houses. Somewhere upwards of about 40 people may have been killed in the attack on Surafend and the outlying Bedouin camp. The casualty figures depend upon the testimony from the reporting authority. There is no certain figure and one account puts the figure at more than 100. There were also unknown numbers of injured villagers who were tended to by the field ambulance units. Aftermath The massacre at Surafend was both visible and audible to the nearby division headquarters, and the division's Commander-in- Chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby, was ordered by General Headquarters to find and discipline those who took part in the killings, in particular those who led and organised the attack. The New Zealanders stood firm in solidarity and refused to name any individual soldiers responsible, and thus no-one could be definitively charged and disciplined for the massacre. General Allenby ordered the division to the square at headquarters, where ignoring the salute of Commanding Officer Chaytor he expressed his fury at their actions in no uncertain terms and employed unexpectedly strong language, including calling them \\"cowards and murderers\\". According to Gullett's Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918, the division was fully expecting harsh military discipline for the massacre, and would have accepted this without resentment; however, Allenby's abusive outburst, although leaving them unpunished, fueled a great amount of resentment and bitterness that their commanding officer would speak of the brigades in such a manner. The feeling among the mounted division was only intensified by Allenby's withdrawing his awards recommendations for members of the division and his silence towards them over the following year. It was only in June 1919 that Allenby was informed by an Australian journalist of the resentment in the division following his outburst, and he subsequently wrote a glowing tribute to the Australian Light Horse troops, bidding them farewell and thanking them for their heroic work in Palestine and Syria. No one was charged for the massacre, but the £2060.11.3d was paid to authorities in Palestine to rebuild the village. The British government contributed £686 due to a small number of Scottish soldiers who had participated and in 1921 requested that Australia and New Zealand contribute the remaining two thirds. Australia did not contest its liability and quickly paid £515.2.9d to Britain. New Zealand however objected, but eventually under British pressure paid £858.11.5d in May 1921. Australian involvement At the time the destruction of Surafend was occurring, the YMCA was screening a movie which was watched by many men of the Anzac Mounted Division. On hearing reports about the fighting, the Anzac Mounted Division Headquarters ordered the division to \\"stand to\\" with an immediate roll call to be taken and every man's location accounted for at that moment. The result of this roll call was that the location of most Australians were accounted for. In addition to the rolls, police pickets surrounded the village, finding many Australians viewing the burning houses. These were ordered back to their units. No police report indicated the presence of Australian soldiers in the village. That being so, involvement of Australian soldiers in the massacre at Surafend had been assumed, but never proven. Historian Henry Gullett's volume of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918 mentioned that New Zealand troops had conducted the massacre and the destruction of the village, but with the \\"hearty support\\" and \\"full sympathy\\" of the Australians. In 2009, journalist Paul Daley while undertaking research for his book, Beersheba discovered an audio recording in the archives of the Australian War Memorial in which Australian former Light Horseman Ted O'Brien described how he and his comrades had \\"had a good issue of rum\\" and \\"went through [the village] with a bayonet.\\" O'Brien described the actions he and his fellow Australians took as \\"ungodly\\" and \\"a real bad thing\\".

The long, flexible tail is similar to what can be seen in other extinct marine reptiles such as thalattosaurs, and it probably propelled itself through the water by means of lateral undulation. However, Helveticosaurus also possessed a robust pectoral girdle and forelimbs that were well adapted for paddle like propulsion as a supplementary method of locomotion, as seen in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. This unique combination of undulation and paddling is highly unusual for an aquatic reptile. The caniniform teeth suggest a predatory lifestyle for Helveticosaurus. Unlike most other marine reptiles which exhibited a lengthening and narrowing of the skull, the head of Helveticosaurus was more robust and boxlike. It is unknown what purpose the shortness of the skull would have had in feeding.Naish, D. (2008). \\"One of so many bizarre Triassic marine reptiles.\\" Weblog entry. Tetrapod Zoology. 13 September 2008. Accessed 24 July 2009. Relationship with other sauropsids Upon its naming and description in 1955, Helveticosaurus was classified as a member of the order Placodontia, a group of robust, barrel-bodied marine reptiles similar in lifestyle to the extant marine iguana. It was seen as a basal member of the clade, being assigned to the new family Helveticosauridae of the Helveticosauroidea superfamily. Despite the dorsal vertebrae, which are very similar to those of placodonts, the genus lacks many of the autapomorphies characteristic of sauropterygians and thus evolved from a different ancestor, independently adapting a marine lifestyle. Restoration by Darren Naish. Its affinities with other diapsids are unclear, as it differs greatly from any other known types of marine reptiles, with no apparent close relatives. It shares some characteristics with archosauromorphs, and may be related to that group. One 2013 analysis of fossil reptile relationships found Helveticosaurus, together with Eusaurosphargis and Saurosphargis, to be most closely related to either the ichthyopterygians or sauropterygians in a large clade of marine reptiles within archosauromorpha. Most recent phylogenetic analyses recover a sister taxon relationship between Helveticosaurus and Eusaurosphargis, with one analysis recovering them at successive positions instead. The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of Li et al. (2014), which includes Eusaurosphargis, Helveticosaurus and all known saurosphargid species. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown. =Possible relatives= Pelvic material from SVT 203, found from older Early Triassic strata in Spitsbergen, may share similarities with the pelvic material known from Helveticosaurus. However, this is only if the anterior element of the pelvic girdle in Helveticosaurus is interpreted as the pubis. The pubis of SVT 203 also shares similarities with placodonts, although the ischium differs in lacking constriction. SVT 203 was once referred to the ichthyosaur Grippia longirostris, but the pubis, femur, metatarsals, and phalanges suggest that it is not from an ichthyopterygian, therefore making it more probable that it belongs to a taxon related, and possibly ancestral, to Helveticosaurus, although more material is needed to give a definitive confirmation. The small size of material comprising SVT 203 in relation to Helveticosaurus, along with the compression seen on both ends of the femur, may indicate that it is a juvenile form of the species to which it belongs, but both temporal and geographical separation of SVT 203 with Helveticosaurus makes size comparison as a means of determining immaturity unnecessary, as it is possible that Helveticosaurus evolved from an ancestor that was smaller in overall size.

The project is located between Avenue D and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, spanning two superblocks from 6th Street to 13th Street. The project consists of thirteen buildings, between six and 14 stories each, containing 1,191 apartment units.  Development  The area to become the Riis houses was destroyed through urban renewal beginning in August 1943 but construction was delayed because of World War II. The Riis Houses were completed on January 17, 1949 and named for photographer Jacob Riis, who exposed the living conditions of tenement dwellers on the Lower East Side. The playground was designed to have four \\"outdoor rooms\\" for a variety of activities and was designed by Pomerance & Breines with M. Paul Freidberg & Associates as landscape architects. It was financed through a grant from the Victor Astor Foundation and opened in 1966 with Ladybird Johnson attending its opening. Later that year, it received a First Honor Award for design excellence by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Four new playgrounds throughout the city were modeled from it in 1967. In 2018, its playground was inspected by NYCHA and found to be hazardous. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the development was hit by a storm surge that left it without electricity and other services. In 2018, NYCHA received a grant for $7.1 million to fund necessary infrastructure repairs from Sandy anticipated to begin in 2022. Upgrades include: emergency generators, electrical distribution equipment, waterproofing of structures and finishes, upgrades to sewer/storm management systems, new roadways, pedestrian lighting, rehabilitation of building entrances and lobbies.

Minumsa Publishing, 2005. p 54 It was during her college years in the 1980s that she came into contact with the student movement and it was from this experience that Gong drew her sense of purpose. In 1985 she received her B.A. in Literature from Yonsei University. Her first novel Rising Dawn was a direct result of her involvement in the student and labor movements of that era. Her earlier works chronicle the 1980s and the students who like the author herself came of age during that decade of violent protest and political upheaval in South Korea.\\"About the Author\\". Amazon.com. Retrieved 2012-12-17. Career Gong began to write full-time in 1988. Her works have focused on issues surrounding laborers, the underprivileged and those who suffer discrimination.Korean Writers and Novelists. Minumsa Publishing, 2005. p55 She has also written extensively about the lives of young educated women attempting to forge lives for themselves both within and without the family. Gong is a feminist writer. In many of her works, the subject of women's struggle and that of labor movement conflate in characters that must face the twin task of building a new identity for themselves after the labor movement and finding a place for themselves in a male-dominated society. As the chaos and the repression of 1980s gave way to the relative calm and prosperity of the 1990s, the students who had sacrificed much to bring about the necessary social changes find themselves in a world that no longer seems to require their revolutionary fervor and sacrifice. They have no choice but to lead ordinary lives without the sense of direction that was once an integral part of their identity. For women, the process of integrating back into the capitalistic society as ordinary citizens entails not only embracing materialistic goals they once disdained but also subjugating themselves to patriarchal order. Resultant anger and confusion constitute the core of Gong's works.\\"공지영\\" biographical PDF available at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# While social activism is one of Gong's main thematic concerns, another equally important interest is the issue of women, particularly the failure of society to shed its patriarchal way of thinking. Gong continues to advocate gender equality, often pointing out that this equality, which is guaranteed by law, is not yet a reality. Her 1993 novel Go Alone Like the Horn of a Rhinoceros, which deals directly with women's issues, was made into a movie (in 1995 Go Alone Like a Rhino Horn was the first of Gong's novels to be made into a feature film), as well as play. In the late 1990s, Gong continued to devote her attention to the issue of women and laborers, as well as expanding her creative energy to include the underprivileged and discriminated members of Korean society. In her 1998 novel, My Sister Bongsoon, Gong portrayed the life of a woman in the 1960s. In her bestselling novel Our Happy Time, she addressed the issue of capital punishment, and in her autobiographical novel Home of Happiness, she depicted the reality of a divorcee's household. In her most recent work, The Crucible, she exposed sexual repression in Korean society, as well as the increasing abuse and violence toward the handicapped. Our Happy Time was adapted into the film Maundy Thursday. It drew significant attention when the movie opened in September 2006, becoming the first Korean novel in four years to top the bestselling charts, and staying on top for eight weeks in a row. Gong, along with South Korean writers Lee Ki-ho and Ham Min-bok, was an early adopter of the internet. She first published The Crucible on South Korean internet portal Daum on November 7, 2008, and left the work up for six months. This kind of serial writing is common in South Korea, but it is traditionally done in newspapers. Her 2009 novel The Crucible had a substantial impact on Korean society and law with respect to the rights of the handicapped. When its film adaptation became a major hit in 2011, members of South Korea's Grand National Party pressed for an investigation of Gong based on her engagement in \\"political activities.\\" Kim Yeon-ho, a GNP politician and member of the Human Rights Commission, proposed to investigate Gong because her verbose depiction \\"over-intimidated\\" citizens. Gong later mocked Kim Yeon-ho's remark by expressing a humorous gratitude, posting \\"Thank you, Grand National Party, for making me internationally famous\\" on her Twitter account.

The Confederate Oath of Association was an oath of allegiance made by Irish Confederate Catholics during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1638–53). Background Its roots lay in the wider Wars of Religion at the time, the recent Tudor conquest saw the status of much of the Hiberno- Norman and Gaelic Irish gentry challenged, some were not fully assimilated into the nobility of the new Kingdom of Ireland. Following this Plantations, especially by the Scottish in Ulster also saw the seizure of much land to the dismay of the Irish — religious differences were an issue, the Irish remained mostly Catholic, incomers were either Presbyterian, Anglican or Puritan. From October 1641 an open attempt was started by the Irish Catholic gentry to reconquer Ireland and seize power, with many believing they had been royally authorised by the Proclamation of Dungannon. Their oath was drafted at a synod at Kilkenny in May 1642. It emphasised the Confederates' loyalty to the Stuart monarchy, their unity, their commitment to protect each other's property rights and their desire for equality of religious practises. It remained current until the end of the wars in 1653. Although not a complete success, the Confederates as they would later be known established four strongholds across the island — around Ulster under Phelim O'Neill; around The Pale under Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara; in the south east under Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret; and in the south west under Donagh MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry. Following this the Scottish Covenanters drove O'Neill's forced out from Ulster, while English Royalists took care of the Pale. In response the Irish with the areas that they still held proclaimed a Confederate Ireland with its capital at Kilkenny; a constitution was drawn up by lawyer Patrick D'Arcy in consultation with a committee of noblemen, clergy and gentry — including this oath of allegiance. The Confederates accepted Charles I of the House of Stuart as their sovereign, however they wished to secure full rights for Catholics in Ireland, toleration of the Catholic religion and governance by its own local aristocracy.

In the ninth century, the terms Laithlinn / Laithlind (etc.), appear in historical sources as terms denoting the origin of Vikings active in Ireland.

A patronymic form of the personal name Lachlann is the Scottish Gaelic surname MacLachlainn.Black (1971) p. 533. Forms of the personal names first appear on record in the tenth century. The earliest known bearer of such names was Lochlaind mac Maíl Shechnaill, heir of the Corca Mruad, whose death is noted by the Annals of Inisfallen in 983.Ó Murchadha (1992–1993) p. 69; Ó Cuív (1988) p. 83. Another member of the Corca Mruad, a certain Lochlainn, is recorded by the same source to have been slain in 1015.Ó Murchadha (1992–1993) p. 69; Ó Cuív (1988) p. 83. Afterwards, the principal family of the region was the Uí Lochlainn, who bore the surname Ua Lochlainn.Ó Cuív (1988) p. 85; Ó Murchadha (1992–1993) p. 69. In Ulster, the Annals of Ulster record the slaying of a Lochlainn mac Maíl Shechlainn, an Uí Néill dynast, in 1023.Ó Murchadha (1992–1993) p. 69; Ó Cuív (1988) p. 83. This man's powerful grandson, Domnall Ua Lochlainn, High King of Ireland, ensured that their descendants, the Meic Lochlainn, bore the surnames Mac Lochlainn and Ua Lochlainn.Ó Cuív (1988) p. 85; Ó Murchadha (1992–1993) p. 69. The eponymous ancestor of the Scottish Clann Lachlainn, traditionally regarded as yet another branch of the Uí Néill, was a much later man who bore a form of the name Lachlan.Sellar (1971) p. 35 n. 22. Popularity In the 2000s and 2010s, Lachlan has been a very common baby name in Australia and New Zealand.Hanks; Hardcastle; Hodges (2006) p. 162. ranking within the top ten masculine names registered in several Australian states. In 2008, Lachlan was ranked as the third most popular masculine baby name in New South Wales, with 581 registered that year. The same year, the name was ranked as the sixth most popular masculine baby name in Victoria, with 438 registered. In 2013 it was the tenth most popular name for boys in Australia. In 2018, the name was surprisingly more popular in New Zealand than in Australia, as it ranked 13th in New Zealand, and 17th in Australia. The name used to be popular in Scotland, and Ireland, but the use of the name in those countries has been decreasing in recent years.

She expressed frustration with an academic anthropology that in her view has been committing \\"intellectual suicide\\" and decided instead to pursue a career in journalism. Life and career In 1993, Tett joined the Financial Times as a correspondent from the former Soviet Union and Europe. In 1997, she was posted to Tokyo, where she later became bureau chief. In 2003, she became deputy head of the influential Lex column.

In 2009 Kazakhstan took over top spot, relegating Canada to second. 20% of the world's primary uranium production came from mines in Canada in 2009. 14.5% of the world production came from one mine, McArthur River. Currently the only producing area in Canada is northern Saskatchewan, although other areas have had active mines in the past. History Canada's first recorded discovery of uranium came in the 1930s 3 when prospector Gilbert LaBine discovered pitchblende, a major uranium bearing mineral, on the shores of the Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories. This discovery led Labine's company, Eldorado Gold Mines Limited, to develop the Eldorado Mine at Port Radium, Northwest Territories in 1932 and a refinery to extract Radium from the ore in Port Hope, Ontario, the following year. During World War II, the demand for uranium exploded as the United States and its allies, Britain and Canada, began the Manhattan Project to produce the first atomic weapons. As a result, in 1943 the Government of Canada expropriated the assets of Eldorado and formed a federal crown corporation, Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, to oversee Canadian uranium assets. Exploration for uranium was restricted to Eldorado and the Geological Survey of Canada. The ban on private prospecting was lifted in 1947. This led to an exploration boom that quickly resulted in the discovery of mines in the Northwest Territories (Rayrock), Ontario (Bancroft and Elliot Lake), and Saskatchewan (Uranium City). By 1956, thousands of radioactive occurrences had been noted and by 1959, 23 mines were in operation in five districts. In 1959, Canadian uranium exports were valued at $330 million, more than for any other mineral exported from Canada that year. In the early 1960s, military demand for uranium declined and in 1965 Canada imposed a policy of only selling uranium for peaceful purposes. This period marked the end of the first uranium boom and saw the number of operating mines drop to four. To assist the domestic uranium industry, the federal government initiated a stockpiling program to purchase uranium. This program ended in 1974 when demand for uranium for power generation was sufficient to support the industry. Uranium mining by province=Nova Scotia= A moratorium on uranium exploration was declared in the province of Nova Scotia in 1984. This moratorium expired on January 1, 1995. However, Nova Scotia has since enacted legislation making uranium exploration and mining illegal. =Quebec= On March 28, 2013, Quebec became the third province in Canada to impose a moratorium on uranium development. This ban appears to be temporary. =Ontario= *Past producers :Elliot Lake :* Stanleigh Mine (1956–1960 and 1982–1996) :* Spanish American Mine (1957–1959) :* Can-Met Mine (1957–1960) :* Milliken Mine (1957–1964) :* Panel Mine (1957–1961 and 1978–1990) :* Denison Mine (1957–1992) :* Stanrock Mine (1958–1960 and 1964–1985) :* Quirke Mine(s) (1955–1961 and 1965–1990) :* Pronto Mine (1955–1970) :* Buckles Mine (1956–1960) :* Lacnor Mine \\"Lake Nordic\\" (1956–1960) :* Nordic Mine (1956–1970) :Agnew Lake :Bancroft :* Faraday/Madawaska Mine :* Bicroft Mine =Saskatchewan= *Past producers :*Key Lake :*Cluff Lake mine :*Rabbit Lake Mine :Beaverlodge district :*Gunnar Mine :*Lorado Mine :*Eldorado, Beaverlodge Operation (Ace, Fay, etc.) :*Cinch Lake Mine *Current Mines :*McArthur River uranium mine :*McClean Lake mine :*Cigar Lake Mine =British Columbia= In 1980 the province of British Columbia introduced a seven-year ban on uranium mining and exploration, which was not renewed.

The film stars Forrest Landis and AnnaSophia Robb as the lead characters. The movie focuses on the adventures of Thomas Miller, in his efforts to save the President's daughter from being kidnapped. Plot A twelve-year-old boy named Thomas Miller is the school troublemaker. He gets into fights and causes distractions in class, and he tells lies. Thomas is seen at the beginning of the movie fighting another student until Principal Hampton intervenes. He is next seen in class with Ms. Bleckner, in which he is assigned detention for goofing off. While in detention, Ms. Bleckner decides to leave to get her nails polished and her hair done. Thomas sneaks out and goes to the library to read and talk with other students instead. On his way to the library, he overhears an unseen figure discussing a kidnapping plot on a cellphone. Petrified by this thought, Thomas leaves. Thomas then encounters an FBI agent named Randal. Randal claims to be involved with researching the case and trying to stop it. Thomas explains what happened and the two go and meet up with Albert, a fellow FBI Agent. Randal, Albert, and Thomas all perceive that the kidnapper is planning on striking during the school dance that weekend. Thomas invites his friend Jackie to go with him, but Principal Hampton and Ms. Bleckner kick them out. They sneak in anyway and continue to search in order to discover the villain. Albert joins Thomas and Jackie in their search. Meanwhile, Randal goes looking on his own and happens to come across the unseen villain. However, the unseen villain fears being exposed, so Randal is attacked and is hit with a broom, and the unseen villain drags him away. Albert, Thomas and Jackie continue to search the dance floor in search of clues but none arise. However, there is a suspicious feeling lurking about. Meanwhile, Ms. Bleckner is seen walking down the hall, patrolling as a hall monitor; where she hears banging on the door of the janitor's closet. Now suspicious, she opens the closet door and finds Randal inside, bound and gagged. She gets him free, and the two go to stop the janitor, who Randal reveals to be the villain. Ms. Bleckner and Randal run onto the dance floor and arrive. Ms. Bleckner exclaims that the Janitor is the villain and that she just saved Randal's life. The Janitor is outraged at this and grabs the president's daughter and flees. Albert, Randal, Thomas, and Jackie chase him down and follow him onto a helicopter. Thomas jumps onto it and sneaks up on the Janitor and knocks him out and puts the helicopter on autopilot. The SWAT Team and National Guard appear with military-style assault rifles and get Thomas and the President's Daughter to safety. Thomas is worshipped as a hero and everyone throws a huge celebration.

She was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in the Grammy Awards of 1968. Music career Cantrell recorded six albums for RCA Victor. Her preferred style of music was pop standards, but she later made contemporary pop rock a significant part of her performances. Cantrell commented in a 1994 profile, \\"Think of how few people can still make their careers by singing standards.... There's Tony Bennett and Barbra Streisand, and I don't know anyone else.\\" Cantrell was a frequent guest on television shows including The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and The Mike Douglas Show. However, she never had a top 40 hit in the Billboard Hot 100. Transition to law career Cantrell eventually decided to make a transition out of music in the 1980s due to a decline in the number of venues where she could sing in her preferred style, the size of her audiences, and her working conditions. Although she had once been able to tour at supper clubs that would furnish a 20-piece orchestra for her and her conductor, in later years she toured with only a five-piece band that she had to pay herself. She decided to pursue a law career in part because a former manager had spent much of her earnings over the years and she wanted to protect other performers from similar experiences. In 1986, Cantrell enrolled at Marymount Manhattan College, where she majored in history. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she attended Fordham University School of Law. After graduation, she began practicing law with the firm of Ballon Stoll Bader & Nadler in New York City. Honours and awards In 1966, Cantrell won the Amber Nightingale award for singing at a festival in Sopot, Poland. In 2003, Cantrell was named a member of the Order of Australia. The honour was conferred for \\"service to the entertainment industry, and for assistance to the Australian community in New York.\\" Personal life It was reported in 1973 that Cantrell was engaged to Australian television personality Graham Kennedy. This turned out to be a hoax. Kennedy later claimed that his romance with Cantrell was purely an invention of the Sunday Observer, although Kennedy himself had confirmed publicly at the time that the relationship was real. Judy Carne, of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In claimed she had a love affair with Cantrell.Lisanti, Paul. p. 91 Discography=Albums= *And Then There Was Lana, RCA Victor LSP-3755, 1967 *Another Shade of Lana, RCA Victor LSP-3862, 1967 *Act III, RCA Victor LSP-3947, 1968 *Lana!, RCA Victor LSP-4026, 1968 *The Now of Then, RCA Victor LSP-4121, 1969 *The 6th of Lana, RCA Victor LSP-4263, 1969 * The Best of Lana Cantrell, RCA ANL1-1049, 1975 Reissues Beginning in 2017, Lana Cantrell's RCA Victor albums have been reissued for the first time on compact disc in Hi-Res audio, replacing years of poor quality bootlegs on YouTube.

These are along a linear path at the range front (that is, fault controlled), and include North Springs, Deadman Springs, House Springs, Middle Springs, Thomas Springs, South Springs, and Percy Springs. Fish Springs is thought to be the end of a long flowpath of groundwater, starting in the Schell Creek Range and Snake Range area and flowing along permeable bedrock (for example, limestones) or faults toward Fish Springs. This comes from the fact the annual discharge of the springs is /year, and the annual recharge for the drainage area (the range front and Fish Springs Flat) is about /year, meaning over 6 times more water flows out of the springs than falls in the valley annually by precipitation.

After earning his doctorate he became a professor of agriculture at Kansas State Agricultural College in 1913 where he was given leave to join the Crocker Land Expedition as a zoologist later that year. Crocker Land Expedition As the zoologist for the expedition, Tanquary was not involved in the final push to find the island from the village of Etah in northern Greenland. Instead, he and fellow Illinois alumnus Walter Elmer Ekblaw were stationed at a Danish trading post 120 miles to the south. They became stranded there after Ekblaw was struck with snow blindess and almost ran out of food in 1914. They were rescued just in time in August and returned to Etah. In December 1914 Tanquary and Donald Baxter MacMillan set off by dogsled for southern Greenland in an attempt to send out word that Crocker Land did not exist and that they would need a rescue ship in 1915. During the trip they became lost for ten days in temperatures as low as -50F. Running low on provisions, they had to eat several of their dogs. As luck would have it, they happened upon an Eskimo settlement. MacMillan decided to return to Etah and have Tanquary complete the journey with a Danish trader and an Eskimo guide. After making it to the mail station in southern Greenland, Tanquary made the 400 mile trip back to Etah. Along the way, Tanquary removed his boots and pieces of raw, bleeding skin and flesh fell off his rotting toes. Despite the frostbite, Tanquary managed to drive his dog team to Etah, where his big toes were amputated. Ekblaw described Tanquary’s dash back to Etah as “the grittiest exploit of the expedition.” Tanquary's message for help was received and a rescue ship was sent. Unfortunately, the ship became entrapped in ice and Tanquary had to make another trip to the southern tip of the island. The trip began on December 16, 1915 from Etah and ended on April 20, 1916. He was able to catch a ride on a ship going to Copenhagen, Denmark which he reached on May 20, 1916. He promptly cabled New York asking for a second relief ship to be sent to the party and he made arrangements for his return to the U.S.. The second rescue ship, sent in the summer of 1916, also became stuck in the ice and the expedition was not rescued until 1917. Journals from Tanquary, Walter Ekblaw, Donald and Mirriam MacMillan are available online at the George J. Mitchell Department of Special Collections & Archives website. Digitization of materials at Bowdoin College related to the Crocker Land Expedition generously funded by the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation in 2016. Personal life Tanquary married Josephine Perry of Manhattan, KS on his return from the expedition. They had a child named Jean who was born in April 1917. Professional life He returned to Kansas State Agricultural College in 1916 as an assistant professor before becoming as associate professor in 1919. Later in 1919, he became the chief of entomology at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and was named Texas' state entomologist. In 1920 he made a trip to Mexico to study the pink bollworm which infested cotton crops. Tanquary was interested in apiculture and resigned in 1923 to enter professional beekeeping in North Dakota. He joined the University of Minnesota College of Agriculture as an entomologist in 1928 and remained there until 1944. While in Minnesota he devoted much of his time to the study of bees. He was also known as a good teacher who could apply experimental ability to practical manner. Tanquary’s family donated his photographs, lantern slides and journals to The Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum, Bowdoin College, in 2006.

The five main surviving accounts are by Arrian, Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, Quintus Curtius Rufus, and Justin.Green, 2007, pp xxii–xxviii In addition to these five main sources, there is the Metz Epitome, an anonymous late Latin work that narrates Alexander's campaigns from Hyrcania to India. Much is also recounted incidentally by other authors, including Strabo, Athenaeus, Polyaenus, Aelian, and others. Strabo, who gives a summary of Callisthenes, is an important source for Alexander's journey to Siwah.Cartledge, P., Alexander the Great (Vintage Books, 2004), p. 290. Contemporary sources Most primary sources written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander are lost, but a few inscriptions and fragments survive. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life include Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Finally, there is the very influential account of Cleitarchus who, while not a direct witness of Alexander's expedition, used sources which had just been published. His work was to be the backbone of that of Timagenes, who heavily influenced many historians whose work still survives. None of his works survived, but we do have later works based on these primary sources. The five main sources=Arrian= *Anabasis Alexandri (The Campaigns of Alexander in Greek) by the Greek historian Arrian of Nicomedia, writing in the 2nd century AD, and based largely on Ptolemy and, to a lesser extent, Aristobulus and Nearchus. It is generally considered one of the best sources on the campaigns of Alexander as well as one of the founders of a primarily military-based focus on history. Arrian cites his source by name and he often criticizes them. He is not interested in the King's private life, overlooking his errors. That Alexander should have committed errors in conduct from impetuosity or from wrath, and that he should have been induced to comport himself like the Persian monarchs to an immoderate degree, I do not think remarkable if we fairly consider both his youth and his uninterrupted career of good fortune. I do not think that even his tracing his origin to a god was a great error on Alexander's part if it was not perhaps merely a device to induce his subjects to show him reverence 888. (Arrian 7b 29) * Indike Which according to Artisan made more sense. =Plutarch= *Life of Alexander (see Parallel Lives) and two orations On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great (see Moralia), by the Greek historian and biographer Plutarch of Chaeronea in the second century, based largely on Aristobulus and especially Cleitarchus. Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of Lysippus, Alexander's favorite sculptor, to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance. =Diodorus= *Bibliotheca historica (Library of world history), written in Greek by the Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, from which Book 17 relates the conquests of Alexander, based almost entirely on Cleitarchus and Hieronymus of Cardia. It is the oldest surviving Greek source (1st century BC). Diodorus regarded Alexander like Caesar as a key historical figure and chronological marker. =Curtius= *Historiae Alexandri Magni, a biography of Alexander in ten books, of which the last eight survive, by the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus, written in the 1st century AD, and based largely on Cleitarchus through the mediation of Timagenes, with some material probably from Ptolemy. His work is fluidly written, but reveals ignorance of geography, chronology, and technical military knowledge, focusing instead on the character. According to Jona Lendering: ..the real subject was not Alexander, but the tyranny of Tiberius and Caligula. (It can be shown that Curtius Rufus' description of the trial of Philotas is based on an incident during the reign of Tiberius)...Curtius copies Cleitarchus' mistakes, although he is not an uncritical imitator. =Justin= *The Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus by Justin, is highly compressed version of an earlier history by Trogus, with the selections governed by Justin's desire to make moralistic points, rather than with an eye for the history itself. Lost works *Life of Alexander by Aesopus *Works of Anaximenes of Lampsacus *Works of Aristobulus of Cassandreia *Geographical work of Androsthenes of Thasos *Deeds of Alexander by Callisthenes (the official historian) *Personal Notebooks, or Hypomnemata, by Alexander himself (possibly inauthentic)Cartledge 2007, p. 278. *History of Alexander by Cleitarchus *On the empire of the Macedonians by Criton of Pieria *Histories (also listed as Macedonica and Hellenica) by Duris of Samos *Ephemerides (royal journal) of the royal secretary Eumenes (existence or authenticity disputed) *Work of Ephippus of Olynthus *Work of Hagnothemis upon which Plutarch rested the belief that Antipater poisoned Alexander. *Work of Hieronymus of Cardia *On the education of Alexander and Macedonian history by Marsyas of Pella *Work of Medius of Larissa *Work of Nearchus, the primary source of Arrian's Indica *How Alexander was Educated and geographical works by Onesicritus *Work of Ptolemy I Soter *History of Alexander by Timagenes *Historiae Philippicae by Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus Greek epigraphy *Decree of Philippi (ca.335-330 BC) Alexander arbitrates a boundary dispute between local Thracian tribes and the city of Philippi. *A dedicatory inscription to Apollo was found at Toumbes Kalamotou, Thessaloniki regional unit ; it records a list of priests of Asclepius who had fulfilled their duties from the time when King Alexandros gave Kalindoia and the villages around to Makedones.The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor Page 94 by Getzel M.

Non-Greco-Roman Sources=Babylonian Chronicles= *Alexander Chronicle mentions the battle of Gaugamela and the incident of Bessus, who was pursued by Aliksandar. *Alexander and Arabia Chronicle refers to events concerning the last years of the King. =Zoroastrian textsThe Bible= Daniel 8:5–8 and 21–22 states that a King of Greece will conquer the Medes and Persians but then die at the height of his power and have his kingdom broken into four kingdoms. This is sometimes taken as a reference to Alexander. Alexander was briefly mentioned in the first Book of the Maccabees. All of Chapter 1, verses 1–7 was about Alexander and this serves as an introduction of the book. This explains how the Greek influence reached the Land of Israel at that time. =The Quran= There is evidence to suggest that orally transmitted legends about Alexander the Great found their way to the Quran. The story of Dhul-Qarnayn, \\"the two-horned one\\" – in chapter al-Kahf, verse 83–94 – is identified by many scholars with Alexander the Great. Most Western and traditional Muslim scholars generally identify Alexander the Great as the Dhul-Qarnayn, however, Wheeler disagrees.Shirazi, Naser Makarem. Tafseer-e-Namoona. Yamanaka & Nishio 2006, p. 103-105. Regarding Alexander's identification, some Muslim scholars (including those from classical times) have differed, with, according to Maududi, modern Muslim scholarship also leaning in favour of identifying him with Cyrus the Great.Maududi, Syed Abul Ala. Tafhim al-Qur'an. \\"The identification ... has been a controversial matter from the earliest times. In general, the commentators have been of the opinion that he was Alexander the Great but the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain described in the Qur'an are not applicable to him. However, now the commentators are inclined to believe that Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus ... We are also of the opinion that probably Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus...\\" See also *Dhul-Qarnayn ReferencesFurther reading Alexander the Great Historiography by topic ","title":"Historiography of Alexander the Great"},{"id":"23726965","text":"The Travelling Vampire Show is a 2000 horror novel by American author Richard Laymon. Plot The book follows three 16-year-olds on an idle summer day in 1963. The narrator, Dwight, and his best friends Rusty and Slim (a tomboy), find flyers for an exotic vampire show. They make a journey to a local clearing called Jank's Field in an attempt to sneak a peek at Valeria, who is billed as the world's only living captive vampire, but they are attacked by a dog and separated, leading to a series of misadventures. Meanwhile, Dwight's attractive sister-in-law Lee purchases four tickets from the show's frontman, Julian Stryker. Later that night the group is reunited and attends the titular Vampire Show, where they discover a sinister plot involving the vampires. The book focuses on the interactions between the three teens and their sexual awakening. Publication The first run of the book included two special limited editions. A signed limited edition hardcover (1000 copies) had the same production values as the hardcover and included a signature sheet. The traycased lettered edition (26 copies) was signed and lettered, and bound in leather with a satin ribbon page marker and additional full-color artwork. Lettered, limited editions are marked A-Z instead of numerically, and limited to 26 copies. Each book was enclosed in a traycase, a clam shell construction which completely encased the book, a key feature which separates lettered editions from numbered editions. Reception The book was one of Laymon's more popular novels and won a posthumous Bram Stoker Award for best novel in 2001. A starred review from Publishers Weekly praised the novel for its \\"emphasis on atmosphere\\" specifically pointing out the social and sexual tensions among the three teens.

Alice informs the Caterpillar that she has previously tried to repeat \\"How Doth the Little Busy Bee\\" and has had it all come wrong as \\"How Doth the Little Crocodile\\". The Caterpillar asks her to repeat \\"You Are Old, Father William\\", and she recites.Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Chapter 4 TextProvenance Illustration for the poem by the hand of Lewis Carroll himself Like most poems in Alice, the poem is a parody of a poem then well- known to children, of Robert Southey's didactic poem \\"The Old Man's Comforts and How He Gained Them\\", originally published in 1799. Like the other poems parodied by Lewis Carroll in Alice, this original poem is now mostly forgotten, and only the parody is remembered. Carroll's parody \\"undermines the pious didacticism of Southey's original and gives Father William an eccentric vitality that rebounds upon his idiot questioner\\". Martin Gardner calls it \\"one of the undisputed masterpieces of nonsense verse\\".Martin Gardner, The Annotated Alice: Definitive Edition, p. 49 Since then, it has been parodied further, including more than 20 versions by 1886 a version by Charles Larcom Graves, a writer for Punch in 1889, and \\"You are young, Kaiser William\\". Appearances In the Walt Disney animated film Alice in Wonderland (1951) the first stanza of the poem is recited by Tweedledee and Tweedledum as a song. \\"Father William\\" was played by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the 1985 film. The 1999 film briefly shows Father William as Alice recites the first verse of the poem to the Caterpillar.

Such guitars are not as common as the six- string variety, but are used by guitarists to modify the sound or expand the range of their instrument. Variants There are two common variations of the nine string guitar: =Coursed strings= The first style is often employed with three pairs of coursed strings similar to a twelve-string guitar. Often the three wound strings are single and the three thin strings are doubled to six strings. This allows dry power chords on the lower three and a more atmospheric chorus sound when all strings are played. Some examples of this type of nine-string guitar are the Vox Mark IX and the Vox Phantom IX. A different and rarer version of coursing uses doubled courses on the three bass strings, and leaves the high strings single. This facilitates free bending during solos, and slide playing. Mick Abrahams of the band Jethro Tull used this configuration (in open tuning) on the This Was album, though he achieved it by removing three of the top strings from an EKO 12-string acoustic- electric guitar, since stock nine-string guitars didn't exist at the time (1969). Some twenty years later, former Rollins Band guitarist Chris Haskett had a custom Paul Reed Smith nine-string guitar made in this configuration. The inspiration for the design was supposedly the desire to capture the prominent tonalities of a 6/12 doubleneck on a single-neck guitar. =Extended range= The second style expands on the seven- and eight-string guitar concept by adding either an additional lower- or higher-tuned string. When a lower string is added, the standard tuning becomes C#, F#, B, E, A, D, G, B, E. The scale is often lengthened, e.g., on the Ibanez RG9 (712 mm/28\\" instead of the common 25.5\\").Musicradar (2014-09-01): Ibanez RG9 Review. Tuning the highest string to an A4 or higher can be accomplished with a shorter scale length and/or a thinner string such as a .008 or .007. Extended range nine- string guitars also sometimes have a multi-scale fingerboard design where the bass strings will be longer than the treble strings, which helps with proper intonation of the lower strings, improves string tension balance across the strings, improves harmonic overtones, overtone series, and inharmonicity. Notable nine-string guitarists Notable guitar players of double-stringed nine-string guitars: * Mississippi blues singer and guitarist Big Joe Williams spent most of his career playing nine-string guitars he had adapted himself from six-string instruments, with the first and second strings doubled in unison and the fourth doubled in octaves.James, Steve (2001). Inside Blues Guitar. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Corporation, pp. 33-34 His grave marker reads \\"King of the Nine-String guitar\\".Cheseborough, Steve (2009). Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues. Jackson: Univ. Press of Mississippi, p. 217 * Fats Johnson, lead singer of the New Christy Minstrels in the 1960s, played a Martin 9-string. * Guitarist Matt Pike of Sleep and High on Fire also plays several First Act nine-string guitars. Nick Sadler, of the band Daughters, also played First Act nine-string guitars. Notable guitar players of extended- range nine-string guitars: * Mick Gordon used a Schecter nine-string for the Doom soundtrack.https://www.facebook.com/MickGordonMusic/photos/pb.140534901317.-2207520000.1452609627./10153333785851318/?type=3&theater; * Tosin Abasi of Animals as Leaders uses a 9-string guitar in standard tuning for the song \\"Private Visions of the World\\".Premier Guitar (2017-01-16): Animals as Leaders: 16 Strings vs. the World. * Justin Lowe of After the Burial used to play an Ibanez RG9BKP 9-string guitar. * Lucas Mann and Joel Omans of the band Rings of Saturn (band) use 9-string guitars. * Stephen Carpenter of Deftones began using an ESP 9-string on their 2020 album Ohms.

The film was made from archival footage; other footage shot at the time focusing on the fight was edited to form the film When We Were Kings. Performers in the film include James Brown (\\"Soul Power\\"), The Spinners (\\"One of a Kind\\"), OK Jazz featuring Franco, Bill Withers (\\"Hope She'll Be Happier\\"), Miriam Makeba (\\"Qongqothwane\\" a.k.a. \\"The Click Song\\"), B.B.

The DVD includes bonus tracks of James Brown (\\"Try Me\\"), Sister Sledge (\\"On and On\\"), Abeti, and folk dance performance Pembe Dance Troupe (\\"Stilts and Bells\\"). Footage was shot by a variety of camera operators, including Albert Maysles.  Music, background and Black Power  Music played on stage makes up for about half of the running time. The rest comprises documentary clips about the event, including footage of the musicians, and behind-the-scenes planning such as the stage set-up. The DVD release also includes longer clips with jam sessions, and interviews with local citizens. James Brown performs at the beginning of the film and sings two songs in the end; another of his performances is included as a bonus feature on the DVD. Brown is also shown behind the scenes, and the musicians are seen mixing with the boxers. Many of the artists express their views about Black Power and their role in it. Unsurprisingly Muhammad Ali uses his screen presence before the fight intensively not only to speak about imperialism and the like but also about how important it is for the movement that he will surely win. Since Foreman was delayed on account of an injury he could not appear in time for the festival and only footage from Ali could be used. We can see a short funny box fight between Philippe Wynne from The Spinners and Ali, as well as a comparison of New York City with Kinshasa by Ali calling NYC the \\"real\\" jungle.

Although virtually all films produced today are made within the IMR, it is not the only possible mode of representation. Other possibilities include the primitive mode of representation, which was dominant before being replaced by the IMR; certain avant-garde films that constitute a “deconstructionist” challenge to the IMR; and various non-western modes, notably pre-war Japanese film,Noël Burch (1979). To the Distant Observer: Form and Meaning in Japanese Cinema. Berkeley: University of California Press. that were possible before the IMR became the worldwide norm. Classical Hollywood cinema is the dominant style within the IMR, but other styles such as art house, independent, and most (current) foreign styles fall no less under the IMR. Overview The concept was developed by Noël Burch in his 1969 book Praxis du cinéma. Burch's goal is to show that the IMR was a class-determined practice, developed out of the bourgeois desire for totalizing illusionistic representation. André Bazin had identified the “myth of total cinema,” or a constant desire to represent reality as completely as possible, which he claimed as the root of cinema innovations (both technology such as sound, color, and widescreen as well as techniques such as more elaborate editing). Burch, on the other hand, argues that IMR is no more elaborate or realistic a system than its alternatives. The IMR is characterized by the attempt to create an entirely closed fictional world on screen. The audience is completely imaginatively involved in the film, instead of being distant from it and seeing it as an object to be examined. Burch argues that the key to the IMR is \\"spectatorial identification with a ubiquitous camera.\\"Noël Burch (1986). \\"Primitivism and the Avant- Gardes: A Dialectical Approach\\" in Narrative-Apparatus-Ideology, ed. Phil Rosen. New York: Columbia UP. p. 491 Various techniques (often referred to as the “language of cinema”) were developed in order to accomplish this identification: * Films are constructed out of a sequence of shots, each of which presents the viewer with one clear piece of information. In contrast to the Primitive Mode, IMR therefore uses close-ups. * A three-dimensional space is created, using Renaissance rules of perspective as well as new cinematic techniques such as editing and lighting. To preserve the illusion of spatial integrity, which was lost with the introduction of close-ups, eye-line and directional matches were introduced. The film is thus perceived as taking place in an environment around the viewer. * Characters are psychologically individuated, through close-ups on faces and acting methods borrowed from (bourgeois) theater. Psychological depth is prized, and the narrative is driven by character psychology. The audience is therefore invited to interpret the motivations of the characters, and thus involve itself with the film. See also * Formalist film theory  References  * Bordwell, David (1997).

Early life The Black Knight of Lorne was born at Innermeath, Scotland. His father was Sir John Stewart (died 26 April 1421), Scotland's Ambassador to England. He was a direct male line descendant of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland, through his second son Sir John Stewart of Bonkill, who was killed at the Battle of Falkirk. His mother was also a descendant of Elizabeth de Burgh, second wife/Queen Consort of King Robert I (\\"The Bruce\\"). Political career James was a younger brother of Robert Stewart, 1st Lord Lorne (1382–1449), whose descendants bore this title. He was an ally of the Black Douglases, Earls of Douglas. After the murder of James I of Scotland in 1437, power was held by Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas as regent for the underage James II of Scotland. The Stewarts of Lorne were amongst his most trusted supporters, and their power greatly increased while the Douglas family controlled Scotland and the king was a mere 7 years of age. However the unexpected death of the 5th Earl of Douglas from a fever in 1439 saw power now being uneasily shared between William, 1st Lord Crichton, Chancellor of Scotland and Sir Alexander Livingston, Governor of Stirling Castle. Stewart married Joan Beaufort, the Queen Consort, and became stepfather to James II. Stewart and his Douglas allies planned to remove the young James II, who was being held by Livingston in his stronghold of Stirling Castle. However, Livingston arrested Lady Joan on 3 Aug 1439, imprisoning her in Stirling Castle, while throwing Sir James and his brother Sir William into its dungeon. They were later released on good behaviour. Stewart was given safe conduct to England in 1445, 1447, and 1451. He was supposedly captured at sea by Flemish pirates and put to death after 1451. But he was still alive in 1453–54 when he carried King James II's offer to Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset to rescue him. Somerset was then a prisoner in the Tower of London while Richard Duke of York was in charge of the government.The Politics of Fifteenth Century England,M.L. Kekewich et. al.

He headed the following labels: Blue Note Records (jazz), Angel Records (classical), and Manhattan Records (adult pop). Lundvall began his music career in marketing at Columbia Records where he remained for 21 years, becoming President of the domestic division of CBS Records in 1976. In the course of his tenure, he built Columbia's jazz roster into the largest of any major label. In 1974 he gave the green light to Bruce Springsteen's breakthrough album Born to Run, after hearing the song of the same name.Statham, Craig (2013). Springsteen: Saint In The City: 1949-1974.

It is dedicated to Saint George.  History  A church is recorded in Kahlenbergerdorf in 1168; it was already an independent parish in 1256. The church was destroyed in 1529 by the Turks but it was rebuilt. Renovation work took place in 1633 and 1771. The parish church is based on a simple late Romanesque/early Gothic building, which was given a Baroque appearance during the last renovation. The southern spire was also given a Baroque roof. The church’s white rib vault was erected on the remains of the medieval church that had been destroyed by the Turks.  Interior  The central element of the church is the Baroque altar with a depiction of Saint Andrew. He is flanked by statues of Saint Leopold and Saint Florian. There is also a depiction of Saint George from 1827; it is the work of Nazarene painter Johann Stätter and was based on a sketch by Ludwig Ferdinand Schnorr von Carolsfeld. To the right of the altar, there is a late Gothic altar to Mary, which was erected in 1760. The depiction of the Madonna in the centre of the church dates from the early 16th century. There is a large, Baroque crucifix on the southern wall, which was originally part of an altar. The altar was placed on the northern external wall in 1732, but was removed in the 19th century. Further noteworthy elements of the church are a Gothic Baptismal font made of red marble (which dates to around 1500), an alms box decorated with rosettes, and a stoup (both date from the 17th century). The organ was made by Franz Ullmann in 1849.  References  * Klusacek, Christine; Stimmer, Kurt: Döbling. Vom Gürtel zu den Weinbergen. Wien 1988 * Schwarz, Godehard: Döbling.

It is now quite common for a 1920s FA Cup Final programme to fetch in excess of £1000 at auction houses such as Sotheby's or Bonhams, with said sale receiving national press coverage in Britain. A matchday programme from the 1913 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final sold at auction in Kilkenny for more than €2,000 in 2018. Association football A tradition from attending a football match in Britain is to purchase a football programme along with a pint and/or a pie. Due to their initial expendable nature (like the ticket) it took many decades for the format to gain respectability as a collectible. Collecting football programmes became a common hobby among fans in Britain during the 1960s and from then on a number of specialist dealers began to appear. Merseyside team Everton were the first association football club in Britain to produce regular matchday programmes. =History= Programme for an association football match played at Hampden Park, Glasgow on 9 October 1875 between home side Queen's Park and the Wanderers from London. It mentions the visiting club first and identifies individual players not by jersey numbers but by the colours of their stockings or caps. The programme started life around the late 1880s as a scorecard which would have been a single card or sheet with dateline, team names and player positions. West Midlands team Aston Villa were one of the first clubs to publish a programme with their The Villa News and Record, which from the outset almost encouraged collecting as it was in the form of a journal with a different number and volume for each season and week respectively; by 1946, for instance, it was up to number 33. Of real interest for the collector, however, has always been the FA Cup Final programme; over the years there have been many attractive covers and the design often reflecting the age, with the late 1920s and 1930s examples bearing Art Deco style, for example. It is understood that pre-war and early 1950s programmes are rarer due to recycling for paper shortages as part of the war effort and times of post-war austerity. The size of the programme has increased over the decades from the convenient pocket size to A4 but many clubs in the early 21st century have reverted to a more convenient size. The FA Cup Final has, however, retained its inconvenient size (even acknowledging this by coming with a customary carrier bag in recent years). Modern programmes have far more pages than their earlier four or eight-page predecessors and are generally full colour and glossy. With the logistics and requirements of modern production (programmes are often printed beyond a club's locality, for example), the product has long been of little help in accuracy of the \\"field of play\\", although the advent of squad numbers has at least ensured the likelihood of all names being present. The programme for Duncan Edwards's debut for North West team Manchester United in the early 1950s for example does not bear his name at all. In June 2018, clubs in the English Football League voted to end the requirement for programmes to be produced for every game. =Collecting= Certain clubs have a programme shop but these are few and far in between usually independent traders must be relied on. eBay has proved a good source now for the collector as due to the sheer saturation of armchair sellers the prices have been forced down. Dealers and collectors alike can still pick up bargains however even in rarities due to shortfalls in description for example. =Notable programmes= One of the most sought-after of all programmes is the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, but, as it was mass-produced, it is not as rare or expensive as one would imagine; however, its purchase is littered with potential minefields. There have been at least two reprints — with the original being heavier than the reprints at 130 grams — and the inside advert for Player's No. 6 is notably different. The blue of the Union Flag on the cover is darker too. The programme for the first ever FA Cup Final held in Wembley in 1923 is much rarer and would typically cost over £1000; similarly the 1927 one is much sought after as it was the first and so far only time that the Cup \\"left England\\", being won by South Glamorgan team Cardiff City. The most expensive Wembley FA Cup Final programme by far, is the 1924 edition, as few remain; the game was played in torrential rain and fans used their programmes as part of their effort to cover themselves against the weather. The programme has reached £4,500 on the few occasions on which it has been offered at auction. Some of the more recent Cup Final programmes are considered rare, notably the 1993 replay, and 1996 legend has it that the surplus copies were burned. They have been known to sell for anything between £60 and £100. Perhaps the most famous club programme in association football is the one from the FA Cup game in February 1958 in which Manchester United met South Yorkshire team Sheffield Wednesday. This was Manchester United's first game after the Munich air disaster and, out of respect, their team layout was left blank. A football programme from the 1882 FA Cup Final between Lancashire team Blackburn Rovers and Berkshire's Old Etonians sold at auction for a world record of £35,250. The programme was sold by Sotheby's in May 2013 to Old Etonians Football Club. The previous record for a football programme was for the 1909 FA Cup Final contested between Manchester United and South West team Bristol City. It was sold on 15 May 2012 for £23,500 at Sotheby's by Graham Budd Auctions. The programme for the 1973 European Cup Final between North Holland team Ajax and Piedmont's Juventus is also rare, with only 400 produced.

Honorifics associated with Khadijah included, “Ameerat-Quraysh (“Princess of Quraysh“),” “The Pious One,” and “Khadijah Al-Kubra (“Khadijah the Great”).” It is said that she fed and clothed the poor, assisted her relatives financially and provided marriage portions for poor relations. Khadijah was said to have neither believed in nor worshipped idols (Taghut), which was atypical for pre- Islamic Arabian culture. \\"One particular quality in Khadijah was quite interesting, probably more so than any of her other qualities mentioned above: She, unlike her people, never believed in nor worshipped idols.\\" Khadijah did not travel with her trade caravans; she employed others to trade on her behalf for a commission. In 595 Khadijah needed a co-worker for a transaction in Syria. She chose Muhammad ibn Abdullah for the trade in Syria. With the permission of Abu Talib ibn Muttalib, his uncle, he was sent to Syria with one of Khadijah's servants. This caravan experience earned Muhammad the honorific titles “Al-Sadiq (\\"the Truthful\\")” and Al-Amin (\\"the Trustworthy\\" or \\"Honest\\").Martin Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources, p. 33–34. Khadijah hired Muhammad, who was then 25 years old, sending word that she would pay double her usual commission.Muhammad ibn Saad, Tabaqat vol. 1. Translated by Haq, S. M. Ibn Sa'ad's Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, p. 145–146. Delhi: Kitab Bhavan. She sent one of her servants, Maysarah, to assist him. Upon returning, Maysarah gave accounts of the honorable way that Muhammad had conducted his business, with the result that he brought back twice as much profit as Khadijah had expected. =Differing views on previous marriages= Sunni version  Khadijah married three times and had children from all her marriages. While the order of her marriages is debated, it is generally believed that she first married Atiq ibn 'A'idh ibn' Abdullah Al-Makhzumi and second Malik ibn Nabash ibn Zarrara ibn at-Tamimi. To her second husband she bore two sons, who were named Hala and Hind. (First print edition: , 1960-2007). He died before his business became a success. To husband Atiq, Khadijah bore a daughter named Hindah. This marriage also left Khadijah as a widow. Khadijah proposed to Muhammad when he was 25 years old and she was 40 years old. Khadijah consulted her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal ibn Asad ibn 'Abdu'l-'Uzza.  Shia version  Shi'a scholars believed Khadijah did not marry anyone before Muhammad. Ibn Shahrashub quoted from al-Sayyid al-Murtada in al-Shafi and al-Shaykh al-Tusi in al-Talkhis that Khadijah was a virgin when she married Muhammad. In addition, considering the cultural and intellectual situation in Hijaz and high position and status of Khadijah al- Kubra among other people, it would be highly improbable that she marry men from Banu Tamim and Banu Makhzum (the two “low” tribes). According to researchers, two children attributed to Khadijah were the children of Hala, Khadija's sister. After Hala’s husband’s death, Khadijah took care of Hala and (after Hala’s death) Hala’s children. Khadijah was 40 when she was married to Muhammad. However, some sources also claim that she was around the age of 25-28 or 30 by others. Marriage to Muhammad Khadijah entrusted a friend named Nafisa to approach Muhammad and ask if he would consider marrying. When Muhammad hesitated because he had no money to support a wife, Nafisa asked if he would consider marriage to a woman who had the means to provide for herself. Muhammad agreed to meet with Khadijah, and after this meeting they consulted their respective uncles. The uncles agreed to the marriage, and Muhammad's uncles accompanied him to make a formal proposal to Khadijah. It is disputed whether it was Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, Abu Talib, or both who accompanied Muhammad on this errand. Khadijah's uncle accepted the proposal, and the marriage took place. At the time of the marriage Muhammad was 25 years old and Khadijah was 40 years old. Muhammad and Khadijah were married monogamously for 25 years. After her death, Muhammad took other wives. Another Narration states Hisham bin Muhammad bin al-Sa’ib reports from his father Muhammad bin al-Sa’ib al-Kalbi from Abu Salih that Ibn ‘Abbas said: At the time of marriage with the Messenger of Allah, Khadija was twenty-eight years old. = Children = Muhammad and Khadijah may have had six or eight children. (Sources disagree about number of children: Al-Tabari names eight; the earliest biography of Muhammad, by Ibn Ishaq, names seven children; most sources only identify six). Their first son was Qasim, who died after his third birthday (hence Muhammad's kunya Abu Qasim). Khadijah then gave birth to their daughters Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatima; and lastly to their son Abd-Allah. Abd-Allah was known as at-Tayyib (\\"the Good\\") and at-Tahir (\\"the Pure\\") because he was born after Muhammad was declared a prophet by the Angel Gabriel as a direct message from Allah. Abdullah also died in childhood. Two other children also lived in Khadijah's household: Ali ibn Abi Talib, the son of Muhammad's uncle; and Zayd ibn Harithah, a boy from the Udhra tribe who had been kidnapped and sold into slavery. Zayd was a slave in Khadijah's household for several years, until his father came to Mecca to take him home. Muhammad insisted that Zayd be given a choice about where he lived, and Zayd decided to remain where he was, after which Muhammad legally adopted Zayd as his own son. Becoming the first follower of Muhammad A fictive medal of Khadijah seen in left According to the traditional Sunni narrative, when Muhammad reported his first revelation from the Angel Gabriel (Jibril), Khadijah was the first person to convert to Islam. After his experience in the cave of Hira, Muhammad returned home to Khadijah in a state of terror, pleading for her to cover him with a blanket. After calming down, he described the encounter to Khadijah, who comforted him with the words that Allah would surely protect him from any danger, and would never allow anyone to revile him as he was a man of peace and reconciliation and always extended the hand of friendship to all. According to some sources, it was Khadijah's cousin, Waraka ibn Nawfal, who confirmed Muhammad's prophethood soon afterwards. Yahya ibn \`Afeef is quoted saying that he once came, during the period of Jahiliyyah (before the advent of Islam), to Mecca to be hosted by 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, one of Muhammad's uncles mentioned above. \\"When the sun started rising\\", he said, \\"I saw a man who came out of a place not far from us, faced the Kaaba and started performing his prayers. He hardly started before being joined by a young boy who stood on his right side, then by a woman who stood behind them. When he bowed down, the young boy and the woman bowed, and when he stood up straight, they, too, did likewise. When he prostrated, they, too, prostrated.\\" He expressed his amazement at that, saying to Abbas: \\"This is quite strange, O Abbas!\\" \\"Is it, really?\\" retorted al-Abbas. \\"Do you know who he is?\\" Abbas asked his guest who answered in the negative. \\"He is Muhammad ibn Abdullah, my nephew. Do you know who the young boy is?\\" asked he again. \\"No, indeed,\\" answered the guest. \\"He is Ali son of Abu Talib. Do you know who the woman is?\\" The answer came again in the negative, to which Abbas said, \\"She is Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, my nephew's wife.\\" This incident is included in the books of both Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Al-Tirmidhi, each detailing it in his own Ṣaḥīḥ. Khadijah was supportive of Muhammad's prophetic mission, always helping in his work, proclaiming his message and belittling any opposition to his prophecies. It was her encouragement that helped Muhammad believe in his mission and spread Islam. Khadijah also invested her wealth in the mission. When the polytheists and aristocrats of the Quraysh harassed the Muslims, she used her money to ransom Muslim slaves and feed the Muslim community. In 616 the Quraysh declared a trade boycott against the Hashim clan. They attacked, imprisoned and beat the Muslims, who sometimes went for days without food or drink. Khadijah continued to maintain the community until the boycott was lifted in late 619 or early 620. Death Mausoleum Khadijah, Jannatul Mualla cemetery, in Mecca, before its destruction by Ibn Saud in the 1920s Khadijah died in \\"Ramadan of the year 10 after the Prophethood\\",Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998). Vol. 39, Biographies of the Prophet's Companions and Their Successors, p. 161. New York: SUNY Press. i.e., in November AD 619. Muhammad later called this tenth year \\"the Year of Sorrow\\", as his uncle and protector Abu Talib also died at this time. Khadijah is said to have been about 65 years old at the time of her death. She was buried in Jannat al-Mu'alla cemetery, in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.Muhammad, Farkhanda Noor.Islamiat for Students . Revised Edition 2000: pp. 74–75. Another report Muhammad bin Ishaq said,\\" Abu Talib and Khadija bint Khuwaylid died in the same year. This was three years before the emigration of the Messenger of Allah to Madina. Khadija was buried in al-Hajun. The Messenger of Allah buried her in her grave. She was 40 years old when the Messenger of Allah married her\\" In the years immediately following Khadijah's death, Muhammad faced persecution from opponents of his message and also from some who originally followed him but had now turned back. Hostile tribes ridiculed and stoned him. Muhammad migrated to Yathrib (Medina) after Khadijah's death.

She had the by-name \\"The mother of her father\\", as she took over caring for her father and being a support to her father once her mother died. She married Ali, who became the fourth caliph in 656. (According to early debate after the death of Muhammad, some would argue that Ali would be the proper succession to Muhammad.) Ali and Fatimah moved to a small village in Ghoba after the marriage, but later moved back to Medina to live next door to Muhammad. Muhammad forbade Ali to take additional wives because, \\"What caused pain to his daughter grieved him as well.\\" Fatima died after the attack on her house shortly after her father died. All of Muhammad's surviving descendants are by Fatima's children. Muhammad loved her two sons Hassan and Husayn, who would continue his heritage. *Zaynab (599–629). She married her maternal cousin Abu al-Aas ibn al-Rabee before al-Hijra. Later lived with Muhammad. Her husband accepted Islam before her death in 629 *Ruqayyah (601–624).

The Qur’an (33:59) says:  Shia view  According to some Shi‘ite sources, Khadijah and Muhammad together had only one biological daughter, Fatimah. The others either belonged to Khadijah's sister or were from a previous marriage and were treated by Muhammad as his own daughters. The Shi'i scholar Abu'l-Qasim al-Kufi writes: # Hind bint Atiq.

Waraqah had been proposed to marry Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, but the marriage never took place. Waraqah is noteworthy because he converted from polytheism to Christianity before Muhammad's revelation. Ibn Ishaq claims that Waraqah is also important because he plays a role in legitimizing Muhammad's revelation. \\"There has come to him,” Waraḳa says, “the greatest law that came to Moses; surely he is the prophet of this people” See also * Asiya * Muhammad's wives * Sumayyah bint Khayyat  Her important descendants ReferencesFurther reading * The True Mother of Believers – Hazrat Khadijah (s.a.)

The decision of a posek is known as a psak din or psak halakha (\\"ruling of law\\"; pl. piskei din, piskei halakha) or simply a \\"psak\\". In Hebrew, פסק is the root implying to \\"stop\\" or \\"cease\\"— the posek finalizes the process of legal debate. Piskei din are generally recorded in the responsa literature.  Formulating a ruling (psak din)  In formulating a ruling, a posek will base the psak din on a careful analysis of the relevant underlying legal principles, as well as a careful study of the application of these principles. A posek must therefore be thoroughly versed in rabbinic literature, from the Babylonian Talmud, through the major medieval codifications of the Law and up to recent decisions. The process of analysis usually entails: # an initial study of the relevant Talmudic Sugyas with commentaries; # tracing the development of all related material in the Rishonim (medieval rabbinic authorities prior to the Shulkhan Aruch) through the Arba'ah Turim and Shulkhan Arukh; # and finally, a close analysis of the works of the Acharonim (rabbinic authorities from about the 16th century onwards) discussing the Halakha as recorded in the literature of the Rishonim (and earlier Acharonim). The ruling itself is an attempt to apply the precedents and principles of the tradition to the question being asked. One common goal of poskim in this regard is, as far as possible, to be consistent with the codified law, as well as with the maximal relevant legal precedents, generally being decisions recorded in the Responsa literature (שאלות ותשובות).  The role of the posek = Orthodox Judaism = Poskim play an integral role in Orthodox Judaism in general and Haredi Judaism in particular. * In the Haredi world, each community will regard one of its poskim as its Posek HaDor (\\"Posek of the present Generation\\"). * Hasidic Jews rely on the Rov in their community (sometimes but not always Rebbes also get the position as Rov) or leading posek recommended by their Rebbe. Yet there are some hassidim (Jews who are hasidic), but not part of a specific movement. These hassidim will vary in who they follow, sometimes following generic hassid-style poskim like Rav Shmuel Wosner. * Modern Orthodox Jews may select a posek on a more individual rather than a communal basis, although customs vary. The approach taken here will, generally, be as above. Thus poskim will not overrule a specific law unless based on an earlier authority: a posek will generally extend a law to new situations but will not change the Halakhah; see the article on Orthodox Judaism. = Conservative Judaism = Conservative Judaism approaches the idea of posek, and Halakha in general, somewhat differently, poskim here apply a relatively lower weighting to precedent, and will thus frequently re-interpret (or even change) a previous ruling through a formal argument; see Conservative Halakha. Although there are some \\"poskim\\" in the Conservative movement - e.g. Rabbis Louis Ginzberg, David Golinkin, Joel Roth, and Elliot Dorff - the rulings of any one individual rabbi are considered less authoritative than a consensus ruling. Thus, the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly maintains a Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, whose decisions are accepted as authoritative within the American Conservative movement. At the same time, every Conservative rabbi has the right as mara d'atra to interpret Jewish law for his own community, regardless of the responsa of the Law Committee. = Progressive Judaism = Both Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not regard the Halakha as binding. Although Reform stresses the individual autonomy of its membership, it never completely abandoned the field of responsa literature, if only to counter its rivals' demands. Even Classical Reformers such as Rabbi David Einhorn composed some. Rabbi Solomon Freehof, and his successor Rabbi Walter Jacob, attempted to create a concept of \\"Progressive Halacha\\", authoring numerous responsa based on a methodology laying great emphasis on current sensibilities and ethical ideals. Full text collections of Reform responsa are available on the website of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. See a collection of CCAR Responsa. The Reconstructionist position is that if Jews would have formed cohesive communities again, their rulings would be binding, yet presently Judaism is in a \\"post-Halakhic state\\". Therefore, their basic policy is to allow tradition \\"a vote, not a veto\\" in communal and personal affairs.

Among these enterprises were mines and ironworks, forestry, and trade. Anna Paulsdatter Vogt was born into an affluent family in Christiania with ties to the government in Denmark. Her father, Paul Pedersen Vogt, was originally from Denmark and was responsible for the stores at Akershus Fortress but also a merchant, mill owner, and shipowner in Christiania. Anna's mother, Catarina née Bauman, was the daughter of Dominicus Brau(n)man, war commissary and also in charge of the stores at Akershus. Anna married Herman Krefting on 26 October 1699, when she was only 16 years old. The couple had at least seven children together. Anna was widowed while she was pregnant with the last child. She never remarried but took over the business and real estate interests of her husband and managed them for 54 years. In particular, the ironworks at Bærums Verk grew to be the largest of its kind in Norway during her time. But she was also responsible for purchase and sale of land, other ironworks, and mines. She also established a school for the children of her employees and contributed heavily to Tanum Church. She was in continuous litigation with count Ferdinand Anton Danneskiold-Laurvig over rights to mine iron ore on her property on the island of Langøy outside of Kragerø. In 1719 she and her son-in-law Andreas Walleur were granted exclusive rights by the crown to run the iron works at Dikemark. When Walleur died, Krefting let her widowed daughter Anna Katarina run the works. In 1762, the main building burned down at Bærums Verk, but Krefting managed its reconstruction. Since none of Krefting's descendants were interested in taking over her work, the property and holdings were sold on auction upon her death in 1766. Krefting's holdings were visited by two kings, Frederik IV in 1704, and Christian IV in 1733. Krefting also resisted the invasion by Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War in 1716 by notifying Norwegian forces of the Swedish troops' dispositions.

He was the DJ of the influential hip hop group Run-D.M.C. During the 1980s, Run-D.M.C. became one of the biggest hip hop groups and are credited with breaking hip hop into mainstream music.\\"The 50 albums that changed music\\", No. 40: Run D.M.C.: Run D.M.C. (1984), The Observer, July 16, 2006.The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 48) Run–DMC. Rolling Stone. Published April 15, 2004. Early life Jason Mizell was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Jesse Mizell and Connie Thompson Mizell (later Connie Mizell-Perry) whose other children are Marvin L. Thompson and Bonita Jones. At age 3, Jason began playing trumpet. He learned to play bass, guitar, and drums. He performed at his church and in various bands prior to discovering turntablism. After he and his family moved to Hollis, Queens, New York City in 1975 at the age of 10, he discovered the turntables and started DJing at the age of 13. He was high school friends with Wendell \\"DJ Hurricane\\" Fite, known for his 13-year collaboration with The Beastie Boys. As a teenager, Mizell was involved with a group that committed residential burglaries. An encounter with an armed security guard frightened him into stopping the burglaries, and as an adult he was known for discouraging criminal activities among his friends and family. For a time, he lived in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where turntablism pioneer DJ Def Lou Hauck taught him to crossfade. He caught on quickly because of his musical experience and after a year of DJing he felt that he was good enough to play in front of people. Originally calling himself Jazzy Jase, he attended high school at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. Career He first started playing at parks and later played at bars. He also began throwing small parties around the area. Once he got a pair of Technics 1200s he improved rapidly since he was able to practice at night with headphones on when he was supposed to be sleeping. Mizell became a DJ because he \\"just wanted to be a part of the band\\". Prior to joining Run-D.M.C., he played bass and drums in several garage bands. In 1982, he joined Joseph \\"Run\\" Simmons and Darryl \\"D.M.C.\\" McDaniels just after they graduated from high school and agreed to DJ for them because he wanted to be part of the band. On Run-D.M.C's album Raising Hell, Mizell played keyboards, bass, and live drums in addition to his turntable work. Mizell remained in his childhood neighborhood in Hollis, Queens his entire life. In 1989, Mizell established Jam Master Jay Records. The label is most known for signing 50 Cent and Onyx. Jam Master Jay Records folded after Jason Mizell was murdered on October 30, 2002. As of 2018, the crime was still unsolved. Mizell's legacy includes the Scratch DJ Academy in Manhattan. Founded in 2002, the year of his death, the academy was created to \\"provide unparalleled education and access to the art form of the DJ and producer.\\" Personal life Jam Master Jay was related to the Mizell Brothers, a popular production team for Gary Bartz, Johnny \\"Hammond\\" Smith, and others. On consecutive Christmas holidays, Mizell survived a car accident and a gunshot wound to the leg, respectively. Jam Master Jay was the father of three sons: Jason Mizell Jr. (who performs as DJ Jam Master J'Son), Jesse Mizell, and TJ Mizell (also a DJ), and a daughter, Tyra Myricks (born August 1992). Death Mural of Jam Master Jay in New York City On Wednesday, October 30, 2002, at 7:30 pm, Mizell was fatally shot by an unknown person in New York City in a recording studio on Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens. The other person in the room, 25-year-old Urieco Rincon, was shot in the ankle and survived. Following his death, several artists expressed their grief for the loss in the hip hop community and remembered him for his influence on music and the genre. Mizell was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York. In 2003, Kenneth McGriff, a convicted drug dealer and longtime friend of Murder Inc. founders Irving \\"Irv Gotti\\" Lorenzo and his older brother Christopher, were investigated for targeting Mizell because the DJ defied an industry blacklist of rapper 50 Cent that was imposed because of \\"Ghetto Qu'ran\\", a song 50 Cent wrote about McGriff's drug history. In April 2007, federal prosecutors named Ronald Washington as an accomplice in the murder. Washington also is a suspect in the 1995 murder of Randy \\"Stretch\\" Walker, a former close associate of rapper Tupac Shakur, who was also murdered. According to court papers filed by the prosecution, Washington \\"pointed his gun at those present in the studio, ordered them to get on the ground and provided cover for his associate to shoot and kill Jason Mizell.\\" However, he was never convicted. In 2018, Netflix released a documentary analyzing the circumstances of his murder. ReMastered: Who Killed Jam Master Jay?, the third episode of Netflix's ReMastered music documentary series, interviews several of Mizell's friends, family members and acquaintances who share stories they've heard regarding suspects in his murder. The documentary does not come to a conclusion regarding who the murderer(s) are. Also in 2018, former prosecutor Marcia Clark featured Jam Master Jay's murder in an episode of her series Marcia Clark Investigates The First 48 on A&E.; She interviewed investigative journalist Frank Owen, whose December 2003 article for Playboy, \\"The Last Days of Jam Master Jay\\", traced the murder to a drug deal gone bad.Owen, Frank (2003). The Last Days of Jam Master Jay, fxowen.com Owen said he uncovered evidence Mizell, not normally involved in crime as an adult, had turned to cocaine distribution to pay mounting bills, including substantial debts to the Internal Revenue Service, after his music career stalled in the late 1990s. According to Owen, several sources indicated Mizell traveled to Washington D.C. on July 31, 2002 to obtain ten kilograms of cocaine valued at about a quarter million dollars from a trafficker known as \\"Uncle\\", with an agreement to pay for the drugs in about a week. However, Mizell failed to repay Uncle, who allegedly arranged to have Mizell murdered. While Washington identified former Run DMC road manager Darren “Big D” Jordan as the shooter, Jordan denied this allegation. Owen further stated to Clark he did not know who shot Mizell, but believed the murder was facilitated by Mizell's close friend Washington. In 2020, Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan Jr. were indicted for Mizell's murder. The indictment alleges that Mizell had recently acquired 10 kilograms of cocaine from a distributor based in Maryland. Mizell, Washington, and Jordan had an agreement to sell the cocaine on consignment, but Mizell cut the two men out after a dispute. Washington had been considered a suspect very early in the investigation, and Jordan had been charged in August 2003 with attempted murder after shooting Mizell's nephew, Rodney Jones, in the leg.

The container or air- trailer was part of the fuselage but could be dismounted and towed on the road. Development The Miles M.68, sometimes but unofficially known as the Boxcar, generated considerable excitement at its launch in 1947 because of its novel approach to air freight. Miles M.68 Flight 4 September 1947 p. 252 The key idea was to pack freight into a wheeled container or \\"air-trailer\\" that could be towed on the road but which became part of the freight aircraft's fuselage for air transport. It was possible to do this by modifying the Miles Aerovan, which had a conveniently podded fuselage largely independent of the boom that then carried the tail. The M.68 was created by making the pod in two parts, the pilot's cockpit forward and a fairing behind, between which the container could be mounted. The span and length of the M.68 were the same as those of the Aerovan. The beam aft of the pod was unchanged, bearing the same tail unit with three fins, one central and two as endplates. All three carried rudders though only the central one was horn balanced, as on the Aerovan 2. The taper on the horizontal tail was carried by the trailing edge, which had unbalanced elevators with trim tabs. The wings, like those of the Aerovan were of low aspect ratio, with flaps along all the trailing edge not occupied by ailerons. The M.68 differed in having four rather than two engines, though because it used the 90 hp (67 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor II rather than the 155 hp (116 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Major 3s of the Aerovan, the net gain in power was only 50 hp (37 kW) or 16%. With the container in place the fuselage pod of both aircraft was about the same length; when no container was carried the rear fairing of the M.68 could be brought forward to mate with the rear bulkhead of the cabin. The container itself was 10 ft (3.05 m) long and 4 ft 6 in 1.37 m) on each side; it could carry 1,600 lb (725 kg) of freight The fixed main undercarriage of the Aerovan was attached to the lower fuselage. Since in the M.68 the equivalent section might not be present, a different layout was required and the M.68 used long fixed rearward sloping legs passing upwards through the inner engine cowlings. These each carried a pair of small landing wheels. Miles M.68 Flight 18 September 1947 p. 326 The fixed nose wheel was also different, being a little shorter and castored; the overall undercarriage arrangement placed the bottom of the container close to the ground. There were also changes to the cabin, which was less rounded and had less generous glazing than the Aerovan. Only one M.68, registered G-AJJM CAA registration G-AJJM was built. It flew for the first time on 22 August 1947 and appeared at the SBAC show at Radlett in September that year. Before it flew there, the outer endplate fins had been significantly modified from the blunt bottomed form of the Aerovan to a much deeper, symmetrical and near elliptical form. It was scrapped the following year, though its deep elliptical fins were used on the Lycoming powered Aerovan 6. 1947 was the last year of trading for Miles Aircraft Ltd, whose assets were taken over by Handley Page.

History Queenie McQueen had at least two children, daughters Marlena and Marguerite. Marlena has several children by several different fathers, including daughters Kathleen, Myra, Reenie and son Louis. Marlena fell pregnant with Kathleen in her early 20s. She married a man named Reggie soon after. They had one daughter, Myra. Reggie and Marlena divorced after several arguments and affairs like every other McQueen . It is unknown who are the fathers of Kathleen, Reenie and Louis. At age 14, Myra fell for the charms of Martin Brownlow and they began a relationship. They slept together and Myra fell pregnant by Martin, who left her. Ashamed of this, Marlena forced Myra keep her pregnancy a secret. When the baby arrived, Myra and Marlena left the baby, named Matthew, on the doorstep of a church with only a note as an explanation. The baby was subsequently put into care as Myra promised to return for her son one day. After this, Myra began a relationship with a man named Billy Alexander and became pregnant with her eldest daughter Jacqui one year after she had Matthew; Jacqui had always assumed she was the eldest. Myra chose to keep Jacqui instead of going through the pain of giving up another child. Myra had her second daughter with Billy one year later and named her Mercedes. Billy left Myra and his daughters soon after Mercedes was born. At aged 19, Myra gave birth to Tina following a one-night stand with a married man named Marvin Bassman who refused to be involved in his daughter's life. She named her daughter after Tina Turner. Later that year in 1985, Myra met Ricky Bowen and began a relationship with him. Myra had Carmel with Ricky. Two years later, while Ricky and Myra were on a break, she gave birth to a son called John Paul by a projectionist she met at a Chester cinema called Iain Naismith, however he left her so that he could transition into his female alter-ego, Sally St. Claire. Myra lied to Ricky and told him John Paul was his son. Finally, Myra had Michaela in 1991 by Ricky again. Ricky left the family in 1992 and later married and had another son named Richard. Kathleen had one daughter who she named Theresa, Theresa's father was believed to be a man named Don, but it was later revealed that Billy Alexander was her father after Kathleen had a one-night stand with him at a nightclub. It is assumed Kathleen lied to Don about Theresa being his daughter. Louis went on to join the army and has a son who was also called Louis. Louis Sr. was killed in action, this inspired Louis Jr. to follow in his father's footsteps and enroll in the army too. Reenie was repeatedly raped by Marlena's abusive boyfriend Derek Clough, which she kept a secret from the rest of her family; he impregnated her at 15 and she later gave birth to her daughter Porsche in 1991. Reenie was originally supposed to give Porsche up for adoption but decided against it. For years it was believed by everyone that Porsche's father was a boy named Mickey, who grew up in the same estate as the McQueens. Reenie had another two daughters with Porsche's presumed father Mickey. She gave birth to Celine in 1994 and then finally in 1998, she gave birth to Cleo. When the girls were young, Mickey was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Reenie's boyfriend, Pete Buchanan, subjected Porsche, Celine and Cleo to varying levels of abuse, most notably sexually abusing Porsche and Cleo and damaging Celine's confidence. There was an incident one Christmas where Derek got excessively drunk and punched Marlena, ultimately breaking her jaw. Marguerite was married to a pig farmer and they had at least four children, including Breda, Victor and Valene. Marguerite's husband was a violent alcoholic who would beat her and their daughters Breda and Valene. He supposedly died after drunkenly falling down the stairs and hitting his head, but it was later revealed Breda murdered him. Their son Victor continually shamed and disappointed his family by getting involved in crime and drugs. Victor married a woman named Sarah in the late 1980s. Sarah gave birth to Victor's son Bart. Victor was an unfaithful husband which ruined his marriage. Sarah left when Bart was five. Soon after the breakdown of his marriage, Victor remarried a woman named Joan. Joan immediately took on the responsibility of being Bart's mother and stayed loyal to Victor and his son even though Victor took advantage of her good nature and found it difficult to stay faithful. Joan died in 2010. Breda became a nanny and was devoted to the children she cared for. She was also a strict Catholic woman, married to a man named Vinnie Bletcher. On Christmas Day 1986, while pregnant with her and Vinnie's daughter, Goldie, Breda brought toys to the home of her charge, three-year-old Peter, who was being raised by an abusive father called Wes after his mother, Harriet, abandoned them. Wes was about to hit Peter before Breda bludgeoned him over the head with an angel ornament. After murdering his father, Breda took Peter in and adopted him, renaming him Sylver. They lived on a farm but Vinnie became abusive towards his Sylver and Goldie. Adoptive third cousins, Sylver and Mercedes, lost their virginity to each other when they were 14 years old. Soon after, thirteen- year-old Goldie learns she is pregnant to boyfriend Shane Sweeney. When a drunken Vinnie discovered this, he went flew into a violent rage, threatening Goldie and her unborn baby. During a struggle, Sylver pushed Vinnie down the stairs. Believing he had killed his stepfather, a terrified Sylver called the police. When Breda discovered Vinnie was still alive, she delivered the fatal blow that killed him. Breda allowed Sylver to think he had killed Vinnie and he went to prison for eighteen years. Goldie gave birth to twins, Prince and Hunter. Marguerite has at least one other son who died in prison after being incarcerated for arson. Valene has not yet been mentioned.

Michaela was later seen at her best friend Amy Barnes' house with her father Mike, who was embarrassing his daughter, but made Michaela happy. She pressured Amy into having sex with her short-term boyfriend, Ste Hay, so that her boyfriend, Wayne Tunnicliffe, would not dump her. Michaela claimed she had had sex with her previous boyfriend, Paul, and that a girl had to put out in order to attract boys. When Ste dumped Amy, Michaela's nasty streak became apparent as she abandoned her friend and teased her, before going off with Wayne and Ste, leaving Amy upset and alone. When Amy stood up to her, they had a fight in the playground. However, the next day Michaela got a taste of her own medicine when she was dumped by Wayne. He dumped her by text message, saying he only went out with her because she was easy. Amy and Michaela reconciled as friends, but Michaela then led her to shoplifting. Michaela was then retconned into being a McQueen with a large family and a mother. The next McQueen to make an appearance was her sister, Mercedes. The pair pulled off a scam at Evissa, in which Mercedes claimed to have been injured during a massage. The only McQueen not to appear was Jacqui, the explanation being that she was in prison for shoplifting. When she finally arrived, she came in tow with an old friend named Davey, who wanted his money from her. Carmel had already found this money and had spent it on breast implants. Davey left after Jacqui agreed to do him any favour. When he returned, he made Jacqui marry illegal immigrant, Aleksander Malota. Carmel and Alek fell for one another and began an affair, just as Jacqui fell for Tony Hutchinson. Being the only male, John Paul appeared to be pressured into \\"keeping the family name\\".

Jacqui and Tony had begun trying for a child. When she became pregnant, Jacqui lost the baby and was told she could not have children. Tony became agitated when everyone assumed Alek had been the father of the baby. Carmel decided to run away with Alek, however he could not take her away from her family so left her. Jacqui was shocked to discover Tony had a ten-year-old son named Harry Thomson. She became increasingly frustrated and jealous and told Tony to choose between her and his son. After he chose Harry, Jacqui left him. At this time, a drunken Mercedes comforted Tony and the pair had sex. Mercedes fell pregnant and decided to have an abortion. Jacqui pleaded with her to have the baby for her, not realising it was Tony's. Knowing this, Mercedes went ahead with the abortion leaving Jacqui devastated. Myra offered herself as a surrogate mother for Jacqui; however, realising Myra would have to go through yet another pregnancy, Jacqui refused. Tina then became the surrogate. After being neglected by Dom, Tina had sex with Russ. The McQueen sisters (L-R: Jacqui, Michaela, Tina, Carmel and Mercedes). A stranger arrived in Hollyoaks as a new hairstylist at Evissa. Niall Rafferty was soon revealed as a secret child of Myra, who she had been forced to give up when she was 14. Niall befriended most of the McQueens but fell under suspicion of Jacqui.

For each one she got right, she could choose one of her children to live and each she got wrong, she could choose one to die. Myra ended up getting two questions right.

Carmel later starts a feud with Theresa and also reunites with Jim, who proposes to her. Later, Carmel exposes Theresa's emails that prove Theresa is pretending to be her boyfriend Dodger's dead ex Texas, ultimately breaking up Dodger and Theresa. This infuriates Theresa, who then gets a drunken Jim to sleep in her bed and makes it look like the pair had sex but Nana soon uncovers the truth. Carmel then gets in contact with Calvin's brother Sonny Valentine, who is now a policeman and reveals to him that Theresa murdered Calvin. The pair later hatch a plan to get Kati away from Theresa. The police attempt to arrest Theresa for Calvin's murder, but she escapes, taking Kati with her. Later that month, John Paul is raped by Finn O'Connor. The next month, Jim is stabbed to death by Fraser Black, who makes it look like Jim is responsible for all of his crimes.

When they arrive at the lake, Myra, Mercedes and Phoebe all leave the car, although Myra accidentally leaves the handbrake on and the car rolls into the water with Sonny inside. Later, Mercedes and Phoebe visit Theresa in her hiding place, where Theresa reveals that she is pregnant. Later, the charges against Theresa are dropped after the McQueen's make it look as though Sonny manipulated Theresa in to admitting to Calvin's murder, and she goes on to give birth to Dodger Savage's baby daughter, Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen. Theresa eventually realises that somebody is framing her to look like a bad mother, and Carmel becomes prime suspect. It later transpires that Phoebe is framing Theresa, and it is revealed that she is working for Sonny, who is in fact alive and plotting revenge on all the McQueens. Phoebe continues to manipulate the situation for Sonny, which eventually culminates with Theresa and Carmel fighting and Myra throwing Carmel out. Phoebe later manipulates Carmel into leaving with Kati, although when driving through a country lane, Carmel realises she is being followed. When she gets out of her car to see who it is, it transpires to be Sonny, believing that she has brought Kati with her. It emerges that Carmel has in fact brought a doll, and Sonny chases her through the woods. Carmel then goes missing for several days with no explanation. In November 2014, Myra's niece Porsche arrives to announce she is engaged to Lockie Campbell, much to John Paul's disgust. Eventually, Carmel reappears in the village, going to the police and telling them what Sonny did to her. She explains that she can't remember where he took her, and she is delighted to be reunited with Myra, Phoebe, Theresa, Mercedes, Nana, John Paul and Porsche. When planning for Porsche's wedding to Lockie, Carmel sneaks off and calls Sonny, telling him that all the McQueens are going to be on a party train for Porsche and Lockie's wedding reception, implying that they are both planning on abducting Kati. On the day of the wedding, Carmel drives to the location where Sonny is, and explains that she can't go through with stealing Kati for him, and returns to the wedding. Back at the church, John Paul tells Porsche that Lockie has attempted to kiss him, but the pair get married anyway. During the party train, Theresa discovers that Carmel was planning on abducting Kati and tells the rest of the family and they disown her. Unbeknownst to the McQueen family, Sonny is on board the train and when Phoebe notices him, he brutally attacks her and leaves her locked in the toilet. After attacking Phoebe, Sonny grabs Theresa and hangs her outside the train, in an attempt to kill her. Meanwhile, Sienna Blake's car is stuck on the railway track after a collision with her father, Patrick, and she and Maxine Minniver are terrified when they notice the McQueen party train come towards them. The two women make it out of the car just in time, as the train hits the car and the train de- rails from the track and turning onto its side. Carmel is the first person to awaken from unconsciousness, and notices her cousin, Celine trapped underneath a table, and helps her out. She then realizes that Myra has badly injured her leg, while Porsche emerges from the rubble. Mercedes then appears, as does Lockie's brother, Cameron. Lockie and John Paul, however, are trapped under rubble in a different section of the train, while Dodger has badly injured his head. Carmel then exits the train to try to get help, while Sienna enters the wreckage to retrieve Dodger. Sonny and Theresa are both trapped separately from the rest of the party, and when Theresa regains consciousness, she tries to escape Sonny but he also awakens and keeps her hostage in the wreckage. As Mercedes and Cameron both save Phoebe from the wreckage, the fire brigade arrive and help most of the party out. Lockie and John Paul are then rescued by the fire brigade, which relieves Porsche. Carmel realizes that Sonny has Theresa and dashes back into the wreckage, and after noticing a gas canister leaking, she convinces Sonny that they have a future together in order to manipulate him, which makes him loosen his grip on Theresa who escapes just as the train explodes, sending Theresa and most of the wedding party flying across the railway track. After regaining consciousness, Theresa runs back into the wreckage, where she finds Carmel trapped under heavy debris. Carmel confesses to Theresa that she was going to run away with Kati and Sonny, and Theresa forgives her. They finally make amends over their past feud before Myra, Mercedes and Phoebe all enter the wreckage to say their goodbyes to Carmel, apologising for their harsh words. After telling the family that she forgives them for the horrible things that they said to her, Carmel asks Myra to tell her a story, and she dies with her family around her. John Paul then enters the wreckage and is distraught to find his sister deceased, as he never had chance to apologize for the things that he said to her. At the hospital, John Paul reveals the devastating news of Carmel's death to a distraught Nana, and Mercedes forces Myra to choose between her and Theresa, as Mercedes believes that Theresa ruined the final years of Carmel's life. The following week, Myra reveals that she has refused to choose between Mercedes and Theresa, and when Mercedes attacks Myra to choose, both Nana and John Paul ask Mercedes to leave for a few days. When Carmel's body is brought to the McQueen household, Nana notices that the ring on her finger has disappeared, and the entire family immediately blame Mercedes. Mercedes is disgusted and reveals to the McQueens how much she loved Carmel, before leaving the house. On the day of Carmel's funeral, Mercedes spots Freddie and Lindsey kissing in the hospital after Lindsey gives birth to Freddie's brother, Joe's baby son. Mercedes blackmails Freddie into buying her share of The Loft, however, she then visits Grace and offers her her share of The Loft too, in a bid to see who will pay more so she can leave the country for Alicante. Mercedes later gets drunk and arrives at Carmel's funeral, hurling abuse at Myra, Theresa and Phoebe, before Myra reveals that she wished Mercedes had died instead of Carmel. Mercedes then flees the church, devastated. Back at the McQueen household, Mercedes waits for either Freddie or Grace to arrive with the highest amount of money, but an unknown figure enters the house, grabs a knife and stabs Mercedes to death. Mercedes' corpse is then seen being dragged out of the house, and the figure mopping up all of her blood. The figure is later revealed to be Freddie. Meanwhile, at the wake of Carmel's funeral, Porsche reveals that she was the culprit who stole Carmel's ring, and not Mercedes. The entire family then rush home to try and catch Mercedes in time, but when she is not there, they all believe she has left for Alicante. The following day, Phoebe is suspicious of Mercedes' whereabouts and calls the police, with old friend D.S Thorpe questioning Myra. She explains that Phoebe is just being over-dramatic, and when she spills a cup of tea, D.S Thorpe notices blood on the floor, and calls for forensic scientists. He then reveals that he believes that Mercedes has been murdered in the kitchen, much to Myra's despair. Later that day, D.S Thorpe arrests Freddie for killing Mercedes. However, Lindsey's sister Kim Butterfield provides Freddie with a false alibi, which gets Freddie out of the frame. The police later ask Porsche to perform a reconstruction of Mercedes' last movements, which she reluctantly agrees to in order to find Mercedes' murderer. Grace is suspicious of Freddie and confronts him on The Loft balcony, where he continuously denies killing Mercedes, and after innocently pushing her away, she falls from the balcony and is hospitalised. When Joe is confronting Freddie about the murder of Mercedes, they are unaware that Myra is overhearing everything, until she makes a noise when she leaves. Freddie later tries to convince Myra that he had nothing to do with Mercedes' murder, which Myra refuses to believe. Myra leaves the village once again. Elsewhere, Theresa agrees to be a kidney donor for Sienna's teenage daughter, Nico Blake. Porsche continuously tries to talk Theresa out of it, as they believe that Sienna caused the train accident that killed Carmel. Theresa explains that Carmel would have wanted her to become a good person, but Porsche reminds Theresa of the risks and if she dies, then who will look after her children. Theresa then tells Nico and Sienna that she cannot be a donor, with Sienna insulting Theresa. Afterwards, Theresa has a change of heart and decides to be Nico's donor, but after the operation, Theresa is given far too much morphine and has to be examined by Dr. Charles S'avage. It is later revealed that Sienna gave Theresa the overdose as she does not want Theresa to get too close to her twin brother, Dodger. Celine, meanwhile, has been hired by the local hospital and makes friends with Kim and Tegan Lomax. It is then revealed that Mercedes is actually alive, and faked her death as part of a money scam. She returns to the village, however shortly after Phoebe is murdered by serial killer Lindsey Butterfield. Later, when Porsche and Celine's sister Cleo, mother Reenie and stepfather Pete arrive, Porsche reveals that Pete sexually abused her and Cleo when they were kids and made Celine feel insecure, however the family forgive him. Pete and Cleo secretly embark on a sick affair, and when it is discovered, Celine attempts to kill Pete. Pete then escapes and begins living in a van. Cleo visits him and they continue their affair. Reenie reveals that Nana's ex-boyfriend Derek also abused her when she was younger and as a result of these revelations, Porsche, Reenie and Nana all end up leaving the village with Porsche having split up with Lockie after he embarked on separate affairs with both Mercedes and John Paul.

She lived not for herself but for the Lord in a continuous attempt to forget herself in order to please God, always keeping her heart free from the world’s many attractions and enticements. She occupied herself solely with the thought of serving God and the complete fulfillment of His will, in order that Jesus must reign as absolute sovereign in her heart. She was determined to seek perfection with a firm resolution and not content herself with a comfortable life but rather with a holy life attained through the practice of all the virtues, thus her insistence in living in meditation, mortification and withdrawal. Then she wished to be the “victim of love”. To make amends for man countless offenses against the infinite goodness of God. Mother Isabella accepted everything from the hands of the Lord, endured everything with love, remained always faithful to the ideals of reparation. Years later, she was relieved of the burden of Superior General when she found herself alone and abandoned in the Mother House at Naples. There she wrote “Isabella, may your life in this corner so remote in the world be peaceful: for such is the Lord’s will”. =The concept of reparation= The concept of reparation shows up in all of her writings as a life long commitment and as a motive of joy. For the essence of reparation is love, which allows one to bear the cross together with Jesus without ever feeling its weight, experiencing only joy. The intense moments of the Reparatrix Spirituality: * Contemplation of Jesus’ passion, death and resurrection * Eucharistic adoration * Holy Mass * Holy Communion To this ideal, she desired that her institute be a witness to the name that she bestowed upon it: Reparatrix Sisters of the Sacred Heart.

The current archdeacon is Elwin Cockett. Brief history Historically, the Archdeaconry of Essex formed part of the Diocese of London, until the Victorian diocese reforms transferred it, on 1 January 1846, to the Diocese of Rochester.Dioceses Commission – The Dioceses of England: An Outline History The title first occurs in sources before 1100, as one of four archdeacons in the (then much larger) Diocese of London, but there had been four archdeacons prior to this point, some of whom may be regarded as essentially predecessors in the line of the Essex archdeacons. From 4 May 1877, the archdeaconry made up part of the newly created Diocese of St Albans until it became part of the newly created Diocese of Chelmsford on 23 January 1914. On 17 March 1922, the Archdeaconry of Essex was renamed the Archdeaconry of West Ham when the new Archdeaconry of Southend was created from part of the old archdeaconry.St John's Stratford – Timeline (1913–1927)Seax, Essex Archives Online – Archdeaconry of West Ham The role of Archdeacon of West Ham has existed separately from the Bishop suffragan of Barking since 1958;St John's Church the archdeaconry was itself divided to create the Harlow archdeaconry following a 1989 decision of the Diocesan SynodDiocese of Chelmsford – Transforming Leadership and again on 1 February 2013, by Pastoral Order of the Bishop of Chelmsford, the new Archdeaconry of Barking was created from the West Ham archdeaconry; initially, the Archdeacon of West Ham was also Acting Archdeacon of Barking.Diocese of Chelmsford – Archdeaconries in the Diocese of Chelmsford (Accessed 6 February 2013) List of archdeacons=High Medieval= *?–: Theobald *bef. 1102–bef. 1111: WalterWalter is not called \\"Archdeacon of Essex\\" in any sources; rather his territory can be deduced. *bef. 1132–1167 (d.): Richard Ruffus *bef. 1168–bef. 1196 : Robert Banastre *bef. 1204–aft. 1215: Richard de Hegham *bef. 1221–aft. 1225: Theobald de Valognes *bef. 1228–aft. 1243: Thomas de Fauconberg *bef. 1248–aft. 1250 (res.): Hugh de Sancto Edmundo *bef. 1253–aft. 1265: Stephen de Sandwic *bef. 1272–aft. 1271 (res.): Richard of Gravesend *bef. 1271–aft. 1274: Adam de Faversham *bef. 1274–1283 (res.): Roger de La Legh *bef. 1288–1293 (res.): Robert Winchelsey *bef. 1295–bef. 1297 (deprived): Laurence de Fuscis de Bera *31 March 1299–aft. 1301: Aldebrand Riccardi de Militiis =Late Medieval= *bef. 1307–aft. 1307: Hildebrand de Anibaldis *29 January 1315–bef. 1319: Stephen de Segrave *bef. 1328–bef. 1331 (d.): John de Elham *2 December 1331 – 3 September 1332 (exch.): William Vygerous *3 September 1332–bef. 1333 (d.): Robert de Canterbury *9 November 1333 – 22 January 1337 (exch.): Hugh de Statherne *22 January 1337– (res.): John de Bouser *20 June 1351 – 1361 (d.): William de Rothwell *30 November 1361–bef. 1367 (res.): John Barnet (son of Bishop John Barnet) *20 June 1367–?: John de Cantebrugg *?–bef. 1368 (res.): Roger de Freton (afterwards Dean of Chichester) *18 January 1368–bef. 1400 (d.): Henry de Winterton *11 February 1400–?: Richard Prentys *bef. 1406–7 September 1420 (exch.): Edward Prentys *7 September 1420–bef. 1435 (d.): John Shirborne *5 April 1435–bef. 1461 (d.): Zanobius Mulakyn *5 August 1461 – 1472 (res.): James Goldwell (also Dean of Salisbury from 1463) *3 October 1472 – 16 May 1478 (exch.): John Gunthorpe *16 May 1478–bef. 1479 (d.): John Crall/Sudbury *22 December 1479 – 1480 (res.): Edmund Audley *21 July 1480 – 1499 (res.): Thomas Jane *4 November 1499–bef. 1502 (d.): John de Lopez *1502–23 August 1503 (d.): François de Busleyden, Archbishop of Besançon *24 January 1503–bef. 1543 (d.): Richard Rawson =Early modern= *29 October 1543–bef. 1558 (d.): Edward Moylle *22 October 1558 – 23 October 1559 (deprived): Thomas Darbyshire (deprived) *3 January 1560–June 1571 (d.): Thomas Cole *10 July 1571–bef. 1585 (res.): John Walker *27 August 1585–bef. 1603 (res.): William Tabor *17 January 1603 – 1609 (res.): Samuel Harsnett *8 November 1609–bef. 1634 (d.): George Goldman *1634–11 August 1680 (d.): Edward Layfield *20 December 1680–bef. 1689 (res.): Thomas Turner *17 July 1689–bef. 1714 (d.): Charles Alston *22 July 1714–bef. 1737 (res.): Thomas Gooch *22 July 1737 – 9 August 1746 (d.): Reuben Clerke *6 February 1747 – 31 October 1752 (d.): William Gibson *28 November 1752 – 5 October 1771 (d.): Thomas Rutherforth *11 October 1771 – 5 April 1773 (d.): Stotherd Abdy *21 April 1773 – 10 November 1795 (d.): James Waller *2 December 1795 – 29 September 1813 (d.): William Gretton *11 December 1813 – 12 October 1823 (d.): Francis Wollaston *14 November 1823 – 1861 (res.): Hugh Jones :On 1 January 1846, the archdeaconry was moved to the Diocese of Rochester. =Late modern= *18 February 1862 – 13 July 1878 (d.): Carew St John MildmaySeax, Essex Archives Online – Chelmsford rural deanery :On 4 May 1877, the archdeaconry was again moved, this time to the newly-created Diocese of St Albans. *1878–1882: Alfred Blomfield *bef. 1883–17 March 1885 (d.): Gaspard-le-Marchant CareyNational Church Institutions Database of Manuscripts and Archives – Entry for a letter from CareyPub history – Chelmsford (inc.

He is best known for his time in WWE, under the ring name Justin Gabriel. He is currently signed to Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name PJ Black. A second-generation wrestler, Lloyd was initially trained by his father. Debuting in 1997 at the age of 16, where he competed in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and was the inaugural winner of the WWP World Cruiserweight Championship in World Wrestling Professionals as PJ Black. In 2008, Lloyd signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment, and was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, with Kris Logan, and the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship. In February 2010, he competed in the first season of NXT, finishing third, before being called to the main roster in June 2010 joining The Nexus. He joined The Corre in 2011. Teaming regularly with Heath Slater, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship three times in 2010 and 2011, which was the apex of Gabriel's success with WWE. He also won the TNA King of the Mountain Championship during his brief GFW crossover appearances with TNA in 2015.  Professional wrestling career = Early career (1997–2000) = Lloyd was originally trained by his father, a promoter and wrestler in South Africa, who was also known by his ring name The Pink Panther. His grandfather was a professional boxer and amateur wrestler. Lloyd grew up watching his father wrestle and in the early part of his training he used to practice in the backyard of his home, in which two rings were positioned. He made his professional wrestling debut at the age of 16. Using the ring name \\"PJ Black\\", he formed a regular tag team with Ray Leppan called Pure Juice. His father was shot and killed in front of him during Lloyd's final year in high school, and a year later he moved to the United Kingdom for five years. = United Kingdom and South Africa (2000–2008) = Lloyd spent five years in the United Kingdom, where he trained with Frontier Wrestling Alliance. He was trained by Alex Shane and Mark Sloan. In 2003 he made his FWA debut. He also made an appearance in International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. He debuted for the South African promotion World Wrestling Professionals (WWP) in 2005. In 2006, he returned to South Africa full-time, and returned to WWP. His most notable feuds during his tenure in WWP were against Tornado, Dameon Duke, Mikey Whiplash, and Joe E. Legend. On 1 November 2007, Black became the promotion's inaugural World Cruiserweight Champion, by defeating The Playa in a match to determine the inaugural champion. After holding the championship for 13 days, he lost it to Lizzard on 14 November. He then declared his intentions to compete in WWP's heavyweight division. Lloyd challenged unsuccessfully for the WWP World Heavyweight Championship against Joe E Legend on a WWP Thunderstrike episode that aired on 10 January 2009. During the match he suffered minor burns to the face after a fireball spot did not go as originally planned, and he had to be treated in hospital. His final match in South Africa took place on 8 November 2008 at WWP's bi-annual Carnival City Casino show, where he was defeated by Terri Middoux in front of a record attendance. = World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE = Florida Championship Wrestling (2008–2010)  FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion in January 2010 In 2008, Lloyd signed a three- year developmental deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), becoming the first South African person to do so. He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he made his debut under the name Paul Lloyd on 5 February, in a loss to Kawal. His first win in FCW came the following week, when he teamed with Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta to defeat Tyler Reks, Johnny Curtis, and DJ Gabriel in a six-man tag team match. The following month, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Angel'. He went on to wrestle against DH Smith, Barreta, Yoshitatsu, and Lance Hoyt over the next few months. In June, he formed a tag team with Kris Logan, with the pair defeating DJ Gabriel and Vic Adams in their debut match as a team. They quickly began to feud with The Dude Busters of Barreta and Croft, losing to them in several championship matches over the next month. At the 23 July 2009 tapings of FCW's television show, Angel and Logan defeated Barreta and Croft to become the Florida Tag Team Champions. They lost the championship on the same night to The Rotundos (Bo and Duke). Following the loss of the championship, Angel and Logan dissolved as a tag team, with Angel returning to singles competition. He went on a winning streak throughout August, defeating Alex Riley, Vance Archer, and Sheamus. Angel won the Florida Heavyweight Championship from Heath Slater in a two out of three falls match at the 24 September 2009 television tapings. He successfully defended the championship against Drew McIntyre, Eric Escobar, Slater, and Curt Hawkins throughout late 2009. In February 2010, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Gabriel' to coincide with his appearances on NXT. Further successful championship defenses occurred in early 2010, against competitors including Hawkins, Barreta, and Kaval. After a near six-month reign, Gabriel lost the championship at the 18 March television tapings, when Alex Riley won a three-way match, which also included Wade Barrett. Gabriel lost a rematch to Riley on 31 March and again on 20 May. In May, he started a feud with fellow South African Leo Kruger over who was the better wrestler. On 10 June, Gabriel beat Kruger, but Kruger reversed the result in a rematch at the 1 July television tapings, which was Gabriel's final appearance in FCW.  The Nexus and the Corre (2010–2011)  On 16 February 2010, it was announced that Angel was going to be competing on the first season of NXT under the name Justin Gabriel, with Matt Hardy as his storyline mentor. He made his in-ring debut on the 2 March 2010 episode of NXT in a tag team match with his mentor Hardy, against the team of William Regal and Skip Sheffield. Gabriel and Hardy won the match when Gabriel pinned Regal, making him the first rookie to pin a pro on the show. He went on to defeat Wade Barrett the following week, before suffering his first defeat on the 16 March 2010 episode of NXT, when he and Hardy were defeated by CM Punk and Darren Young. On 30 March, in the first Pros Poll, Gabriel was ranked third behind Daniel Bryan (first) and Wade Barrett (second). Before the first elimination, Gabriel won the Rookie Challenge earning immunity from elimination in the following Pros Poll. In that Poll, Gabriel remained in third place behind Wade Barrett (who was moved to first) and David Otunga (second). In the season finale on 1 June, Gabriel was the first eliminated, finishing in third place overall in the competition. The Nexus at SummerSlam On the 7 June 2010 episode of Raw, Gabriel and the other season one NXT rookies turned heel (villainous) by interfering in the Viewer's Choice main event match between John Cena and CM Punk, attacking both competitors, the announcing team and Justin Roberts, the ring announcer before dismantling the ring area and surrounding equipment. The following week on Raw, the rookies (excluding Daniel Bryan who had been released) attacked General Manager Bret Hart, when he refused to give them contracts. At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view, the seven rookies interfered in the WWE Championship match and cost Cena the championship. The following week on Raw, Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced the hiring of a new General Manager, who had signed the seven season one NXT rookies to contracts. The following week, the group was named The Nexus. On the 12 July episode of Raw, The Nexus competed in their first match together, without Darren Young, a six–on–one handicap match against John Cena, which they won when Gabriel pinned Cena. The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam. Gabriel was one of the final two Nexus members in the match, but Cena's team won when Cena eliminated Gabriel and then Barrett to win the match. On 3 October 2010, Cena was forced to join The Nexus as a result of losing to Barrett at Hell in a Cell and at the following pay-per-view Bragging Rights, Cena and Otunga won the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the 25 October 2010 episode of Raw, Barrett made a tag team match, with Gabriel and Heath Slater facing Otunga and Cena for the championship. Gabriel and Slater won when Barrett ordered Otunga to allow Slater to pin him, becoming the new Tag Team Champions. Gabriel and Slater held the championship for nearly two months before losing it to Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov in a four-way elimination match, also involving The Usos and Mark Henry and Yoshi Tatsu on 6 December. Gabriel and Slater received a rematch for the championship at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on 19 December, but lost by disqualification when Nexus member Michael McGillicutty interfered. Gabriel in 2012 On the 10 January 2011 episode of Raw, Gabriel and Slater refused to take part in new Nexus leader CM Punk's initiation and walked away from the group. The following day, at the tapings of the 14 January 2011 episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater helped former leader Barrett and Ezekiel Jackson attack Big Show. The following week, Gabriel, Slater, Barrett, and Jackson announced they had formed The Corre, and later that night Gabriel defeated World Heavyweight Champion Edge in a non-title match, following interference from the other members of The Corre. After winning a non-title match against the champions Kozlov and Marella on 4 February episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater received a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship two weeks later, but lost via disqualification when the other members of The Corre interfered. They received a rematch at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on 20 February and defeated Marella and Kozlov to win the WWE Tag Team Championship for the second time. The following night on Raw, Gabriel and Slater lost the championship to John Cena and The Miz, but won the championship back minutes later after Barrett invoked The Corre's rematch clause, and The Miz turned on Cena. During this time, The Corre had continued to feud with The Big Show, and at WrestleMania XXVII in April the team of The Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella, and Kofi Kingston defeated The Corre. At the 19 April taping of SmackDown, the duo of Gabriel and Slater lost the Tag Team Championship to the team of Kane and The Big Show. In a backstage segment following the match, Gabriel was attacked by Slater, who thought Gabriel blamed him for their loss. On the 6 May episode of SmackDown, Gabriel, Barrett, and Slater attacked Jackson, removing him from the group. The three remaining members of The Corre feuded with Jackson until the 10 June episode of SmackDown, when Barrett walked out on Gabriel and Slater during a six-man tag team match against Jackson and the Usos, causing Gabriel and Slater to proclaim the end of The Corre. Gabriel continued to ally himself with Slater despite the dissolution of The Corre, and the duo began a feud with The Usos. On the 17 June episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater were defeated by The Usos, but defeated them in a rematch the following week. They were again defeated by The Usos on the 8 July episode of SmackDown, resulting in the pair arguing in the ring. The following week, their team was ended when they faced off in a match won by Gabriel and Gabriel transitioned to a face (fan favourite) character.  Championship pursuits (2011–2013)  At Money in the Bank, Gabriel participated in the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match, which was won by Daniel Bryan. For the rest of 2011, Gabriel scored many wins on Superstars over wrestlers like Tyson Kidd, JTG and Jinder Mahal, but was not as successful on other shows. On Raw, he failed to win a battle royal for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on 26 September 2011; while on SmackDown, he lost singles matches to Wade Barrett, Hunico and Cody Rhodes. In January 2012, Gabriel began an alliance of sorts with Hornswoggle, saving him from Slater and Cody Rhodes, leading to matches with both which he won and lost respectively. At Elimination Chamber, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged Jack Swagger for the WWE United States Championship. Following a series of matches in early 2012, Gabriel and Tyson Kidd showed mutual respect for each other, and decided to team up and form a tag team to challenge Primo & Epico for the WWE Tag Team Championship. In a dark match at WrestleMania XXVIII on 1 April, also involving the Usos, they attempted to win the championship but were unsuccessful. During the match, Gabriel suffered a hyperextended and twisted elbow, rendering him inactive for several weeks. He returned on the 30 May episode of NXT, scoring the win for himself, Derrick Bateman and Percy Watson over the team of JTG, Johnny Curtis and Michael McGillicutty. Gabriel reunited with Kidd on 6 June, when they defeated Johnny Curtis and Heath Slater on NXT Redemption. At the No Way Out pay-per-view, Gabriel and Kidd were defeated by The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) in a number one contender four-way tag team match, also involving Primo and Epico and The Usos. When NXT merged with WWE's developmental territory FCW in August, Gabriel participated in a tournament to determine the inaugural NXT Champion, but was eliminated by Michael McGillicutty. On the 31 August episode of SmackDown, Kidd and Gabriel suffered their first loss as a team against the Prime Time Players. On the debut episode of Main Event on 3 October, the pair, now unofficially called International Airstrike, lost to Santino Marella and Zack Ryder in the quarter-finals of a tournament to decide the number one contenders. The following month, they were named part of a team for Survivor Series, and were on the winning side of a precursor match on 12 November when they, Rey Mysterio, and Sin Cara defeated the Prime Time Players, Primo, and Epico with Gabriel pinning Young. At Survivor Series, Gabriel and Kidd were part of the victorious team in a five-on-five elimination tag team match, alongside Mysterio, Sin Cara, and Brodus Clay. In January 2013, Kidd had suffered a torn knee meniscus, placing their partnership on hold. On the 17 April 2013 episode of Main Event, Gabriel won a battle royal to earn a recognition for the #1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship. His match against former ally Wade Barrett was later that night, but Gabriel was unsuccessful as Barrett pinned Gabriel after a devastating bull hammer elbow the finishing move of Barrett.  Final years (2013–2015)  Gabriel did not perform on pay-per-view for 2013; from May, he largely wrestled singles matches on Main Event and Superstars, with wins over Curt Hawkins and Darren Young, but lost to other wrestlers including Antonio Cesaro, Big E Langston, Damien Sandow, and Fandango. He was involved in a storyline in September; after weeks of authority figure Triple H emasculating the WWE roster, Gabriel and several other babyfaces finally saved Daniel Bryan from a beatdown by the Shield and Randy Orton on the 16 September episode of Raw. In response, Triple H arranged for Gabriel and Zack Ryder to face Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family on the next SmackDown, where Gabriel's team lost. On the next episode of Raw, Bryan, Gabriel and the other babyfaces faced the Shield in an 11-on-3 handicap elimination match; Gabriel was eliminated by Roman Reigns, but his team eventually won the match last eliminating Seth Rollins. In January 2014, the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter released a ranking of WWE's roster; Gabriel was ranked as a lower-tier babyface. He wrestled one match on pay-per-view for 2014, that being the André the Giant Memorial battle royal at WrestleMania XXX, which Gabriel failed to win. In mid-2014, Gabriel began competing more on NXT, which was now the show for WWE's rebranded developmental branch, but even there, Gabriel lost all of his televised singles matches, including to Adrian Neville, Tyler Breeze and Hideo Itami. After losing to Sami Zayn on the 3 July 2014 episode of NXT, Gabriel turned heel for the second time since 2011 by joining his former partner Tyson Kidd in a post-match assault on Zayn. The following week on NXT, Gabriel and Kidd's reunion was initially successful as they defeated Neville and Zayn in a tag match, but Zayn got revenge when he and Adam Rose eliminated Gabriel and Kidd in a tournament to determine the number one contenders to the NXT Tag Team Championship on the 7 August episode of NXT. Gabriel's last televised victory was on the 11 September 2014 episode of Superstars against Sin Cara. His last title opportunity came on the 28 November 2014 episode of SmackDown, when he was the first eliminated from a battle royal for the United States Championship. Toward the end of his run, Gabriel was primarily used as a jobber. His last televised match was a loss to Rusev on the 14 January 2015 episode of Main Event. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported on 24 January 2015 that Gabriel had quit WWE, one day before the 2015 Royal Rumble in which he was scheduled to compete. WWE officially confirmed his release on 25 January 2015. In March 2015, he did an interview with Chris Jericho on the podcast Talk is Jericho, where he revealed that he was the popular bunny character of Adam Rose's Exotic Express and that the Adam Rose character was intended for him. He also mentioned that Triple H did not approve of his ideas for a wolf-themed daredevil persona he had written his own promos for. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2015)= On 12 August, Black took part in a TNA angle where GFW invaded Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Edward Popham was son of Sir Francis Popham and supported parliament in the English Civil War. He was elected M.P. for Minehead in 1644. He commanded a force in Somerset and Dorset. He was appointed a commissioner for the immediate ordering of the navy in 1648 and commanded in the Downs and North Sea during 1649. In 1650 he joined Robert Blake at Lisbon in blockading Prince Rupert.  Biography  Edward Popham, the fifth and youngest son of Sir Francis Popham, and his wife Anne (née Dudley), was probably born about 1610, his brother Alexander, the second son, having been born in 1605. In 1627 Edward and Alexander Popham were outlawed for debt, their property being assigned to their creditors; cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 23 March, 15 August 1627 but the age of even the elder of the brothers suggests that the debtors must have been other men of the same name, the Edward being possibly his cousin, the man who represented Bridgwater in parliament from 1620 to 1626. cites: Returns of Members of Parliament. In 1636 Edward Popham was serving as lieutenant of in the fleet under the Algernon, Earl of Northumberland, cites: State Papers, Dom. Charles I, cccxliii. 72. and in March 1637 was promoted to be captain of Fifth Whelp. cites: State Papers, Dom. Charles I, cccxlix. 38, 66, cccl. 49. The Whelps were by this time old and barely seaworthy; most of them had already disappeared, and in a fresh breeze off the coast of Holland, on 28 June 1637, this one, having sprung a leak, went down in the open sea, giving Popham with the ship's company barely time to save themselves in the boat. Seventeen men went down in her. After rowing for about fifty miles, they got on board an English ship which landed them at Rotterdam; thence they found their way to Helvoetsluys, where an English squadron of ships of war was lying. cites: State Papers, Dom. Charles I, Popham to Earl of Northumberland, 4 July 1637, ccclxiii. 29. In 1639 Popham commanded a ship, possibly the Rainbow, in the fleet with Sir John Penington in the Downs, and was one of those who signed the narrative of occurrences sent to the Earl of Northumberland. cites: State Papers, Dom. Charles I, ccccxxx. 74. In the English Civil War he joined the Parliamentary cause, of which his father and brother Alexander were members. On the death of his father he succeeded him as member for Minehead. In 1642 Edward and his brother Hugh were with Alexander, then a deputy-lieutenant of Somerset, raising men for the parliament. In May 1643 Colonel Popham commanded \\"a good strength of horse and foot\\" in Dorset, and relieved Dorchester, then threatened by Prince Maurice cites: Sir Walter Erle to Lenthall, 3 June, Hist. MSS. Comm. 13th Rep. (Welbeck Papers), i. 711. This was probably Edward, as Alexander appears to have been then in Bristol. cites: Prynne and Walker, Trial of Fiennes, App. p. 4. In June 1644 both Pophams were, with Ludlow and some others, detached by Sir William Waller into Somersetshire, in order to raise recruits. It proved a service of some danger, as, with a body of about two hundred horse, they had to pass through a country held by the enemy. cites: Ludlow, Memoirs, ed. Firth, i. 91–3. On 11 June 1645 Edward was desired to repair to Romsey, take command of the troops assembling there for the relief of Taunton, and follow the orders of Colonel Sir Edward Massey; and on 17 June Alexander was directed to command a party of horse to Romsey, there to receive orders from Edward. It would seem that at this time Edward was considered the superior officer. cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. It is thus certain that he was not at the Battle of Naseby, but probable that he took part in the western campaign of July, and fought at Ilminster, Langport, and Bridgewater. It is, however, curious that as a colonel, second in command to Massey, his name is not mentioned. On 17 July 1648 he had instructions to accompany, Robert, Earl of Warwick, the lord admiral to sea, the Charles, Prince of Wales having a squadron on the coast; but three days later they were countermanded, and Sir Walter Strickland was sent in his stead. On 24 February 1649 an act of parliament appointed Popham, Blake, and Deane commissioners for the immediate ordering of the fleet, and on the 26th their relative precedence was settled as here given, the seniority being assigned to Popham on account, it may be presumed, of his rank and experience in the navy, independent of the fact that his brother Alexander was a member of the Council of State. Blake, too, had already served under one of the Pophams, apparently Edward, as lieutenant- colonel of his regiment, and it would seem not improbable that he was now appointed one of the commissioners for the fleet on Popham's suggestion. During 1649 Popham commanded in the Downs and North Sea, where privateers of all nations, with letters of marque from the Prince of Wales, were preying on the east-coast merchant ships. On 23 August the corporation of Yarmouth ordered three good sheep to be sent on board his ship then in the roads as a present from the town in recognition of his good service in convoying Yarmouth ships. cites: Hist. MSS. Comm. 9th Rep. i. 320 b. Early in 1650 he was under orders to join Blake at Lisbon with a strong reinforcement. An intercepted royalist letter of date 20 February has \\"Blake has gone to sea with fourteen sail. … A second fleet is preparing under Ned Popham. His brother Alexander undertakes to raise one regiment of horse, one of dragoons, and two of foot in the west; but good conditions, authentically offered, might persuade them both to do righteous things\\". cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. With eight ships Popham put to sea in the last days of April, and having joined Blake, the two were together on board the Resolution when, on 26 July, Rupert tried to escape out of the Tagus. The close watch kept by the parliamentary squadron compelled him to anchor under the guns of the castle, where, by reason of a strong easterly wind, the others could not come; and two days later, finding the attempt hopeless, he went back off Lisbon. cites: Popham and Blake to council of state, 15 Aug.; Welbeck Papers, i. 531. In November Popham returned to England, cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 14 November. and shortly afterwards resumed his station in the Downs in command of the ships in the North Sea. He died of fever at Dover, and in actual command if not on board his ship, on 19 August 1651. The news reached London on the 22nd, and was reported to the house by Whitelocke, and at the same time Sir Henry Vane the younger was ordered \\"to go to Mrs. Popham from the council and condole with her on the loss of her husband, and to let her know what a memory they have of his services, and that they will upon all occasions be ready to show respect to his relations\\". cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 22 August. A year's salary was granted to his widow Anne. Popham was buried at the expense of the state in Westminster Abbey in Henry VII's chapel, where a monument in black and white marble was erected to his memory. At the Restoration the body and the monument were removed, but, as Alexander Popham was still living and a member of parliament, the body was allowed to be taken away privately, and the monument to be placed in the chapel of St. John the Baptist, the inscription being, however, effaced and never being restored. His monument remains in the Abbey but the inscription was removed.A portrait by Cooper, belonging to Mr. F. Leyborne Popham, was on loan at South Kensington in 1868.  Family  In 1645 Edward Popham married Anne (b. about 1623), daughter of William Carr who had been a Groom of the Bedchamber to James I. They had two children: a daughter, Letitia (b. about 1648), and a son, Alexander (born deaf in about 1649), whose daughter Anne married her second cousin Francis, a grandson of Popham's brother Alexander. About ten years after Popham's death, his wife married secondly Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton on 26 August 1661. The household had eight children from Lord Wharton's first two marriages as well as the two Popham children. Within a year, Lord Wharton and Anne had a son, William. At this time, Lady Wharton approached Dr. John Wallis in Oxford to teach her son Alexander Popham to speak. The success of this work is one of the first documented cases of a deaf person learning to speak. Alexander later married and had a daughter Anne by his wife Brilliana Harley. Anne was not born deaf.

In early May, Jacobite sympathisers took control of northern Kintyre, and when government troops arrived to retake the peninsula, they ran into an ambush on the slopes of Loup Hill. Despite the advantage of height and surprise, the Jacobites fought ineffectively and quickly retreated; a few days later, they abandoned Kintyre. Losses on both sides were minimal and the battle itself was little more than a minor skirmish. However, the loss of Kintyre was a serious strategic setback for the Scottish rising, since it prevented them being easily re-supplied by their allies in Ulster. Background In February 1685, the Catholic James II & VII came to power with widespread support; the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant many in both England and Scotland feared the consequences of bypassing the 'natural heir'. A desire for stability led to the rapid collapse of the Monmouth Rebellion and Argyll's Rising in June 1685, both led by Protestant dissidents. By 1680, over 95% of Scots belonged to the Church of Scotland, or kirk; Catholics numbered less than 2% of the population and even other Protestant sects were barred. The 1681 Scottish Test Act required holders of public office to be members of the kirk; James' attempts to repeal it undermined his own supporters, while rewarding the extreme Presbyterians who backed Argyll in 1685. In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis, the first being the birth of James Francis Edward on 10 June. This created the prospect of a Catholic dynasty, rather than James being succeeded by his Protestant daughter Mary, and her husband William of Orange. The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops, which seemed to extend official policy beyond mere tolerance for Catholicism to an assault on the established church. Their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority in both Scotland and England. In 1685, many feared a return to civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, anti-Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one. William landed in Brixham on 5 November with 14,000 men; as he advanced, James' army deserted, and on 23 December, he went into exile in France. In February 1689, the Parliament of England offered the English throne to William and Mary. On 14 March, a Convention met in Edinburgh to agree a settlement for Scotland. It was dominated by supporters of the new administration, with 'Jacobites' restricted to those linked to James by religion or personal ties. However, the number of activists on either side was tiny, the vast majority being unenthusiastic about either option. On 12 March, James landed in Ireland, and the Convention offered the Scottish throne to William and Mary on 11 April. The next day Dundee raised the Royal Standard on Dundee Law, officially beginning the rebellion. Battle Close links between Scottish MacDonalds and Antrim MacDonnells, as well as between Presbyterians in Ulster and Argyllshire meant conflicts in one country often spilt into the other. By April, most of Ireland was held by Jacobites; in Ulster, only Derry was still held by a Protestant garrison. Kintyre was strategically important since it allowed Dundee to be resupplied from Ireland using small boats, which was essential as all major Scottish ports were held by the new government. In choosing sides, local rivalries were as important as allegiance to the Stuarts or religion. Kintyre was previously dominated by the MacDonalds and MacAlisters, before becoming subordinate to the expansionist Campbells in the 1670s. After Argyll's Rising in 1685, the original owners regained their independence, but with the advent of the new government and return of Argyll to favour, they faced losing it once again. Government-backed Campbell militia took possession of Tarbert Castle in April, shortly before a French merchant ship commandeered by Irish refugees arrived in Skipness, raising fears of an Irish invasion. The dangers of losing control of Kintyre were obvious to the government but they were short of troops; commissions for raising new regiments were only issued in April and many were still forming. A unit of around 500 men under Captain William Young was put together from those available and transferred in small boats to Tarbert where they landed on 15 May. Confident of Irish support, Gorrie Macalister of Loup, Macalister of Tarbert, Macneill of Gallachoille and Macdonald of Largie declared for James, and occupied Skipness Castle on the eastern side of the peninsula. Since this blocked Young moving south, he advanced across the peninsula to occupy their estates of Loup House and Largie. As he did so, he ran into a force of 200 men under Macneill and Gorrie Macalister, positioned on the slopes of Loup Hill. Young reported they fired at each other, before the Jacobites fled; his force suffered no casualties and they found only two enemy dead. Unwilling to trust his inexperienced troops with a night attack, he decided not to pursue, and continued on his way to Clachan, where he was joined by local government supporters. Aftermath Realising they were outnumbered, the Jacobite chiefs abandoned Kintyre to the government, and escaped to Ireland. Several of them fought at the Battle of Killiecrankie in July, and were subsequently outlawed for treason.

It is equally a philosophical system, a medicine, and a form of yoga. The system's theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that the entire cosmos and all that exists in the cosmos, including human beings, consists of vibrations, called nāda. This concept holds that it is the energy of vibrations rather than of matter and particles which form the building blocks of the cosmos. Nāda yoga is also a reverential way to approach and respond to vibrations. In this context, silent vibrations of the self (anhata), sound [and] music (ahata) carry a spiritual weight more meaningful, respectively, than what sensory properties normally provide. Silent vibrations of the self (anhata) and Sound and music (ahata) are considered to play a potential medium/intermediary role to achieve a deeper unity with both the outer and inner cosmos. Nāda yoga's use of vibrations and resonances are also used to pursue palliative effects on various problematic psychological and spiritual conditions. It is also employed to raise the level of awareness of the postulated energy centers called chakra. Music has been used by most Indian saints as an important and powerful tool in the quest for the achievement of nirvana; notable names to be mentioned here include Kanakadasa, Thyagaraja, Kabir, Meerabai, Namdeo, Purandaradasa and Tukaram. Description The Nāda yoga system divides music into two categories: silent vibrations of the self (internal music), anahata), and external music, ahata. While the external music is conveyed to consciousness via sensory organs in the form of the ears, in which mechanical energy is converted to electrochemical energy and then transformed in the brain to sensations of sound, it is the anahata chakra, which is considered responsible for the reception of the internal music, but not in the way of a normal sensory organ. The anahata concept refers to silent vibrations of the self, which are thought to be so closely associated with one's self and the Self that a person can not share their anahata with another human being. In other words, this inner sound, silent vibration of the self, is sacred and once reached will open the practitioner's chakras, which ultimately will unite the body to the divine/cosmos. With continued sounds and a focus on silent vibrations of the self and controlled breath, the individual can, according to Nāda yoga, \\"listen in on\\" their own anahata, their own \\"inner sound\\", which can take up to nine different forms. Such a process of inner awareness and sensitivity leads to increased self-recollectedness and finally to awakening. To concentrate on this inner sound (silent vibration of the self) as a support for meditation is very helpful to tame the mind, and when it has been clearly recognized, used for self-recollectedness in outer life as well. Eventually, it can be experienced as penetrating all matter and indeed vibrates eternally throughout the Creation. In Nāda yoga, one of the main breathing sounds is ahaṃ, where each part of the word (a ha ṃ) is focused on and spoken individually. The echoes produced by each of these spoken letters is a time where the yogi should immerse herself and rest. Now, because of imbalances within the human body, Nāda yoga begins by removing the ailments and impurities by \\"awakening the fire in the body (jāṭhara)\\" (Timalsina 212) with the use of a sound resembling that of a bee. It is important to note that when the yogi/yogini is forming sounds, their mind should not wander off to other entities. One group to incorporate yoga, Nāda yoga specifically, and the practice of sound into the spiritual transformation is the Josmanĩ. The Josmanĩ are identified as a Sant tradition, and they are a blend of Śrī Vaiṣṇava Bhakti tradition with the Nāth Yoga tradition. Yoga is used in \\"personal and social transformation\\" (Timalsina 202). The Josmani's spiritual quest interlinks the practice of Kuṇḍali and Nāda Yoga.Timalsina, Sthaneshwar. \\"Songs Of Transformation: Vernacular Josmanī Literature And The Yoga Of Cosmic Awareness.\\" International Journal of Hindu Studies 14.2 (2010): 201-228. Humanities Full Text. Web. 25 Sept. 2012. In the West, detailed indications and advice have been given by Edward Salim Michael in his book : the Law of attention, Nada Yoga and the way of inner vigilance. Ajahn Sumedho, from the Thai Forest Tradition also teaches the practice of this inner sound. The condition known in western medicine as tinnitus is considered in Ayurvedic medicine to possibly be caused by spiritual awakening to the anahata. Primary literature Nada Bindu Upanishad Shurangama Sutra The Śūraṅgama Sūtra, often spelled Shurangama Sutra or Surangama Sutra in English, is a Mahayana sutra and one of the main texts used in the Chán school in Chinese Buddhism. In the Surangama Sutra, Avalokitesvara says that he attained enlightenment through concentration on the subtle inner sound. The Buddha then praises Avalokitesvara and says that this is the supreme way to go. > \\"How sweetly mysterious is the Transcendental Sound of Avalokiteshvara! It > is the pure Brahman Sound.

(2005: p. 431) identifies the “primordial sound” (nāda) and its semantic field: > The primordial indestructible great vital essence (gdod ma'i mi shigs pa'i > thig le chen po), which is the root or ground of all of cyclic life > [samsara] and perfect peace [nirvana], is known as primordial (gdod ma) > because it has no beginning or end; as indestructible (mi shigs pa) because > it is indivisible; as vital essence (thig le) because it pervades the > various appearances; and as great (chen po) because there is nothing that it > does not encompass.

He was a JP for Wiltshire from 1597 and for Somerset by 1602. He was also Deputy Lieutenant for both counties. In 1603 he was made Knight of the Bath. He was elected MP for Wiltshire in 1604. In 1607 he succeeded to the estates of Littlecote on the death of his father. He became constable of Taunton Castle in 1613. In 1614 he was elected MP for Marlborough and in 1621, MP for Great Bedwin. He was elected MP for Chippenham at a by- election in 1624 and was re-elected for the same seat in 1625, 1626 and 1628. He sat until 1629 when King Charles dispensed with parliament for eleven years. In November 1640, due to the influence of his son-in-law Thomas Luttrell (1583–1644) of Dunster Castle, Somerset, Popham was elected MP for the Luttrell pocket borough of Minehead in the Long Parliament and sat until his death. Popham was considered to have inherited his father's grasping disposition. He was constantly involved in lawsuits, which he was charged with conducting in a vexatious manner. Like his father, he took an active interest in the settlement of the North American colonies of Virginia and New England, and was a member of council of both colonies.

Clones may reach hundreds to thousands of years old, although aboveground stems typically live only 11 to 15 years. Shinnery oak stems are usually 1–2 m tall and codominate the plant community with mid- and tall-grasses which are usually taller than the oaks. The specific epithet honors U.S. Army surgeon and botanist Valery Havard, who contributed much to the knowledge of southwestern plants. The word \\"shinnery\\" seems to be derived from chêne (French for oak), and not from the height of the plant.Oklahoma Biological Survey. Quercus havardii Rydb. Description Form: A low shrub to 2 m or occasionally a small tree, Q. havardii forms large clonal thickets by extending rhizomes through the sandy soil where it is usually found. Rhizomes range from 3–15 cm in diameter and are concentrated in upper 60 cm of soil, although penetration depths of 9 m has been reported. Lateral roots and woody rhizomes are widespread near the soil surface. Ninety percent or more of shinnery oak's biomass is under ground, and fortuitous root grafting is common. These underground stems commonly spread to form plants 3 to 15 m or more in diameter. Single clones are reported to cover up to 81 ha and to achieve ages over 13,000 years. Flowers: Shinnery oak is monoecious with both female and male flowers borne separately on the same plant. Male catkins are densely flowered, 1.5-3.8 cm long, and hang downward. Female catkins are 3–7 mm long, contain 1 to 5 flowers, and are usually axillary on young shoots. Shinnery oaks are wind pollinated, and flowering occurs in the spring. Acorns: Acorns develop in 1 year, maturing in the autumn. Acorns occur alone or in clusters of 2 or 3, and are 12–25 mm long by 14–18 mm wide. A scaly cup covers about 1/3 to 1/2 of the nut. On average, acorn crops are produced in 3 out of 10 years. Foliage: The leathery, highly variable leaves are grey green to olive green, have a lustrous upper surface, and are whitish and densely hairy below. Leaves are alternate, simple, with variable shape (oblong, ovate, or elliptical), and with wavy or shallowly lobed margins. Length is 2 to 8 cm and width 2 to 4 cm. Twigs: Twigs are brown or grayish, 1-2.5 mm diameter, glabrous or densely covered with short grayish or yellowish hairs, that are lost with age. Buds are dark red-brown, somewhat spherical, about 2 mm long, and sparsely pubescent. Bark: Bark on the larger stems is light gray and scaly. Taxonomy Shinnery oak populations in Utah and Arizona are considered a variety of shinnery oak (Quercus havardii var. tuckeri) by some taxonomists. However, introgression of shinnery oak with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and perhaps shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella) make taxonomic identification of these populations difficult. Shinnery oak hybridizes with Mohr oak (Quercus mohriana) and post oak (Quercus stellata). Post oak × shinnery oak hybrids are likely to be a result of post oak's historic range, which extended more westerly than it does today. Mohr oak × shinnery oak hybrids are restricted to habitats intermediate to those occupied by the two species. Mohr oak inhabits limestone soils, and shinnery oak occurs on deep sand soils. Native range Shinnery oak is native to western Oklahoma, west Texas, eastern New Mexico, and 2 isolated populations in southwest Kansas.R.L. McGregor Herbarium. Quercus havardii Rydb. herbarium records A variety also occurs in northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah.Flora of North America. Quercus havardii: Range Map. Sandy plains, sand dunes, and sand hills of the southern Great Plains are typical habitat. Management A majority of shinnery oak occurs on private land used for agriculture and/or livestock production. It is considered undesirable on grazing lands, because it competes with better livestock forage and its buds and leaves are toxic to cattle for several weeks in spring. In addition, where cotton is grown near shinnery oak, boll weevils overwinter in the oak litter and infest nearby cotton fields in spring. Thus, most research and other human effort concerning shinnery oak have been devoted to its eradication. The use of chemical and mechanical control methods has been extensive, making it likely that shinnery oak's distribution is decreasing. Most authorities do not recommend complete eradication of shinnery oak, indicating that forage production is typically greater if some shinnery oak remains in the community. Stocking rates and rotational grazing patterns exist that reduce the incidence of shinnery oak poisoning of cattle. Excessive control of shinnery oak is controversial because it can open sandy soils to wind erosion and can conflict with wildlife-habitat quality. Shinnery oak sprouts prolifically from rhizomes soon after fire. Researchers described the communities as \\"extremely fire hardy\\". Quercus havardii resprouting Uses Because shinnery oak thrives in a harsh environment, it functions as a sand dune stabilizer, protecting sandy soils from wind erosion. It also provides diverse wildlife species cover and food. Collared peccaries, lesser prairie-chickens, northern bobwhites, and many other wildlife species eat shinnery oak acorns. Deer, pronghorn, and southern plains woodrats browse shinnery oak. Shinnery oak habitats are used by black- tailed jackrabbits, desert cottontails, eastern cottontails, wild turkeys, western box turtles, a diversity of arthropods, approximately 25 snake species, and approximately 10 lizard species, including the endangered sand dune lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus). Many game species also rely on shinnery oak. Scaled quail and northern bobwhites use shinnery oak habitats extensively, and shinnery oak habitats are considered \\"the principal home for white-tailed deer in the southern Great Plains\\". Shinnery oak provides rich habitat for wildlife compared with the surrounding shortgrass plains. Maintaining wildlife habitat and improving vegetation for livestock grazing are often in conflict, and should be carefully considered before undertaking control of shinnery oak.

Ancient=Prophesied conqueror= King Philip had a dream in which he took a wax seal and sealed up the womb of his wife. The seal bore the image of a lion. The seer Aristander interpreted this to mean that Olympias was pregnant, since men do not seal up what is empty, and that she would bring forth a son who would be bold and lion-like.Plutarch Al. 2.2–3 (Ephorus FGrH 70 217) After Philip took Potidaea in 356 BC, he received word that his horse had just won at the Olympic games, and that Parmenion had defeated the Illyrians. Then he got word of the birth of Alexander. The seers told him that a son whose birth coincided with three victories would always be victorious.Worthington, Ian. Alexander the Great: Man and God\\", Routledge, 2004 When the young Alexander tamed the steed Bucephalus, his father noted that Macedonia would not be large enough for him. =Deified Alexander= In 336 BC, Philip sent Parmenion with an army of 10,000 men, as vanguard of a force to free the Greeks living on the western coast of Anatolia from Persian rule. The people of Eresus on the island Lesbos erected an altar to Zeus Philippios. Alexander himself was the model for the image of Apollo on coins issued by his father.Lendering, Jona. \\"Alexander the God\\", Livius.org When Alexander went to Egypt, he was given the title \\"pharaoh\\", which included the epithet \\"Son of Ra\\", declaring him to be the son of the sun. A story told that one night King Philip had found a huge snake in the bed next to his sleeping wife. Olympias was from Epirus and may have practiced a mystery cult that involved snake-handling. The snake was said to be Zeus Ammon in disguise. After his visit to the Siwa Oasis in February 331 BC, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father. Upon his return to Memphis in April, he met envoys from Greece who reported that the Erythraean Sibyl had confirmed that Alexander was the son of Zeus. By 330 BC, Alexander had started to adopt elements of Persian royal dress. In 327 BC he introduced proskynesis a ritualized honor accorded by Persians to their rulers. This Greek soldiers resisted, as such prostrations were reserved for honoring the gods. They considered this blasphemy on Alexander's part and sure to bring condemnation from the gods.Hamblin, William and Peterson, Daniel. \\"Alexander the Great wasn't content to be merely human\\", Deseret News, August 23, 2014 *When the Pythia refused to answer Alexander, he began to drag her to the temple. Whereupon Pythia exclaimed, You are invincible o young! (aniketos ei o pai!) (Plutarch Al. 14. 6-7) *The one who could manage to untie the Gordian knot would become the king of Asia. (Arrian 2.3) *Although Daniel does not refer to him by name, Alexander is the he-goat and King of Javan (Greece), coming from the west and crossing the earth without touching the ground. He charges the ram in great rage. He shatters the horns of Media and Persia and knocks the ram to the ground and tramples it.(Daniel 8:3-8).Willmington's Guide to the Bible By H. L. Willmington Page 821 *Alexander was born on the same day the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was burnt down. Plutarch remarked that Artemis was too preoccupied with Alexander's delivery to save her burning temple. Alexander later offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding, but the Ephesians refused on the ground that it was inappropriate for a god to dedicate offerings to other gods. (Strabo 14.1.22) *Apelles painted Alexander holding a thunderbolt of Zeus. *Decree of the Ionian League (uncertain date): … so that we should [pass the day on which King Antiochus] was born in … reverence [ … To each person participating in the festival] shall be given [a sum] equivalent to that given for [the sacrifice and procession for Alexander]The Hellenistic world from Alexander to the Roman conquest By M. M. Austin Page 242 =Offering of a Scythian donkey's horn at Delphi= Claudius Aelianus in the \\"Characteristics of Animals\\" write that they say that in Scythia there were horned donkeys, and their horns were holding water from the river Styx. Adding that Sopater brought one of these horns to Alexander, then Alexander set up the horn as a votive offering at Delphi, with an inscription beneath it.Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, § 10.40 Alexander Romance Eskandar fighting the enemy, 15th century Persian miniature, Czartoryski Museum In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely ascribed to the historian Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, exhibiting a plasticity unseen in \\"higher\\" literary forms. Latin and Syriac translations were made in Late Antiquity. From these, versions were developed in all the major languages of Europe and the Middle East, including Armenian, Georgian, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew, Serbian, Slavonic, Romanian, Hungarian, German, English, Italian, and French. =Oriental tradition= *The Gates of Alexander (Caspian Gates) were a legendary barrier supposedly built by Alexander in the Caucasus to keep the uncivilized barbarians of the north (typically associated with Gog and Magog) from invading the land to the south. * Alexander is often identified with Dhul-Qarnayn, literally \\"The Two-Horned One\\", mentioned in the Quran, Al-Kahf 18:83–94. Similarities between the Quranic account and the Syriac Alexander Legend were also found in recent research (see Alexander in the Qur'an). The Arabic tradition also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of Aristotle and Plato. Amir Khusrau Dihlavi, an illustrated manuscript from Mughal Empire, attributed to Mukanda c. 1597-98, Metropolitan Museum of Art * Persian accounts of the Alexander legend, known as the Iskandarnamah, combined the Pseudo-Callisthenes and Syriac material about Alexander, some of which is found in the Qur'an, with Sasanian Persian ideas about Alexander the Great. This is an ironic outcome considering Zoroastrian Persia's hostility to the national enemy who finished the Achaemenid Empire, but was also directly responsible for centuries of Persian domination by Hellenistic \\"foreign rulers\\".E.g. the Greek scholar G. G. Aperghis goes so far as to state: \\"Rather than considering the arrival of the Greeks as bringing something entirely new to the management of an empire, one should probably see them as apt pupils of excellent [Achaemenian] teachers. (link)\\" However, he is sometimes not depicted as a warrior and conqueror, but as a seeker of truth who eventually finds the Ab-i Hayat (Water of Life). Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of Darius II, making him the half- brother of the last Achaemenid king, Darius III. By the 12th century such important writers as Nezami Ganjavi were making him the subject of their epic poems. The Romance and the Syriac Legend are also the sources of incidents in Ferdowsi's \\"Shahnama\\". In the Shahnameh, the Persian epic, Kai Bahman's elder son Dara(b) is killed in battle with Alexander the Great, that is, Dara/Darab is identified as Darius III and which then makes Bahman a figure of the 4th century BC. In another tradition, Alexander is the son of Dara/Darab and his wife Nahid, who is described to be the daughter of \\"Filfus of Rûm\\" i.e. \\"Philip the Greek\\" (cf. Philip II of Macedon)Encyclopædia Iranica - Page 12 Alexander the Great was called \\"the Ruman\\" in Zoroastrian tradition because he came from Greek provinces which later were a part of the eastern Roman empire - The archeology of world religions By Jack Finegan Page 80 * A Mongolian version is also extant. *The Malay language Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain was written about Alexander the Great as Dhul-Qarnayn and the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families is traced from Iskandar Zulkarnain, through Raja Rajendra Chola (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the Malay Annals., such as the Sumatra Minangkabau royaltyEarly Modern History page 60 *Alexander the Great was claimed as the ancestor of the Hunza rulers. =Western tradition= Epic poems based on Alexander romance *Alexandreis Latin *Alexanderlied German *Li romans d'Alixandre French *Libro de Alexandre Spanish *Alexanders saga Old Norse-Icelandic *The Buik of Alexander Scottish *Aethicus Ister (Latin) has numerous passages which deal directly with the legends of Alexander *Azo a legendary ruler of Georgians, who had been installed by Alexander. Women and Alexander *According to Greek Alexander Romance, Queen Thalestris of the Amazons brought 300 women to Alexander the Great, hoping to breed a race of children as strong and intelligent as he. *According to Greek Alexander Romance, Alexander encountered the Nubian Queen Candace of Meroë *A popular Greek legendMermaids and Ikons: A Greek Summer (1978) page 73 by Gwendolyn MacEwen Folktales from Greece Page 96 talks about a mermaid who lived in the Aegean for hundreds of years who was thought to be Alexander's sister Thessalonike. The legend states that Alexander, in his quest for the Fountain of Immortality, retrieved with great exertion a flask of immortal water with which he bathed his sister's hair. When Alexander died his grief-stricken sister attempted to end her life by jumping into the sea. Instead of drowning, however, she became a mermaid passing judgment on mariners throughout the centuries and across the seven seas. To the sailors who encountered her she would always pose the same question: \\"Is Alexander the king alive?\\" (Greek: Zei o vasilias Alexandros?), to which the correct answer would be \\"He lives, still rules, and conquers the World\\" (Greek: Zei kai vasilevei kai ton kosmon kyrievei!). Given this answer she would allow the ship and her crew to sail safely away in calm seas. Any other answer would transform her into the raging Gorgon, bent on sending the ship and every sailor on board to the bottom. Alexander sees the whole world Alexander the Great carried aloft by griffins, Otranto Cathedral floor mosaic A medieval legend in the Alexander romance had Alexander, wishing to see the whole world, first descending into the depths of the ocean in a sort of diving bell, then wanting to see the view from above. To do this he harnessed two large birds, or griffins in other versions, with a seat for him between them. To entice them to keep flying higher he placed meat on two skewers which he held above their heads. This was quite commonly depicted in several medieval cultures, from Europe to Persia, where it may reflect earlier legends or iconographies. Sometimes the beasts are not shown, just the king holding two sticks with flower-like blobs at their ends. The scene is shown in the famous 12th-century floor mosaic in Otranto Cathedral, with a titulus of \\"ALEXANDER REX\\"; it also appears on the floor of Trani Cathedral. In a paper published in 2014, Sir John Boardman endorsed the earlier suggestion by David Talbot Rice that the figure on the Anglo-Saxon Alfred Jewel was intended to represent this scene, which refers to knowledge coming through sight, and so would be appropriate for an aestel, or pointer for reading, such as the jewel. Boardman detects the same meaning in the figure representing sight on the Anglo-Saxon Fuller Brooch.Boardman, John, \\"Alfred and Alexander\\", pp. 137-139, in: Gosden, Christopher, Crawford, Sally, Ulmschneider, Katharina, Celtic Art in Europe: Making Connections, 2014, Oxbow Books, , 9781782976585, google books Apocryphal letters *Leon of Pella wrote the book On the Gods in Egypt, based on an apocryphal letter of Alexander to his mother Olympias. *Epistola Alexandri ad Aristotelem concerning the marvels of India.

Curtiss Building, is a historic building located at Buffalo in Erie County, New York. Originally built for office use, the building was named for its owner Harlow Clarke Curtiss, a prominent Buffalo attorney and real estate investor. The building design resembles elements of the works of renowned Chicago architects such as Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan, both of whom also designed buildings in Buffalo. The Curtiss Building was designed by Buffalo-based architect Paul F. Mann, who was a brother-in-law of Curtiss. The building is one of the largest terra cotta structures of its type and period in downtown Buffalo.Buffalo as an Architectural Museum: John F. Mann Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Construction on the building began in 1912 and was finished in 1913. The building's earliest tenants included the Kittinger Furniture Company. Other occupants included lawyers, stationers, and paramedical companies, but Curtiss did not have his own office here. The building had a series of successive owners and tenants over the ensuing decades, but was vacant by the early 1990s. In 2008, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Developer Mark Croce bought the Curtiss in 2002, and acquired the adjacent former Continental nightclub and a parking lot in April 2009. Croce also owns the Hotel Statler in downtown Buffalo. As of June 2017, Croce completed an $18+ million renovation of the building to adapt it as the \\"Curtiss Hotel\\". The Curtiss is Buffalo's only 5-star hotel. It has 68 rooms and is open for business.http://www.curtisshotel.com/ Amenities include a first-floor corner 3-meal restaurant, featuring a revolving bar reminiscent of Buffalo's historic Chez Ami Supper Club. This will have patio seating along W. Huron Street. On the opposite corner of the building, adjacent to a porte cochère and main entranceway, the hotel features Buffalo's first all-weather, urban hot springs/Roman bath.Tim Scanlon, \\"Curtiss Gets Corniced, More\\", July 2015, Buffalo Rising website As of December 2015, project costs were estimated at $20 million because of upgrades.

In 2008, her work was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; it was the first time a New Zealander had been the subject of one-person show at the institution. Titled Shigeyuki Kihara: Living Photographs, the exhibition opened from 7 October 2008 to 1 February 2009. Kihara's self-portrait photographs in the exhibitions included nudes in poses that portrayed colonial images of Polynesian people as sexual objects. Her exhibition was followed by an acquisition of Kihara's work for the museum's collection. Much of Kihara's work challenges cultural stereotypes and dominant norms of sexuality and gender found across the globe. Kihara is also a fa'afafine, the third gender of Samoa. Born in Samoa, Kihara's mother is Samoan and her father is Japanese. Kihara immigrated to Wellington, New Zealand at the age of fifteen to further her studies.Pohio, Nathan. Bulletin of the Christchurch Art Gallery; Summer2017/2018, Issue 190, p40-43, 4p She trained in fashion design at Wellington Polytech (now Massey University). In 1995, while still a student, Kihara's Graffiti Dress – Bombacific was purchased by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa). Kihara's exhibition Teuanoa'i: Adorn to Excess was composed of twenty six t-shirts that took large corporations' logos and \\"[reappropriated them] to subvert the system of power, which governs the lives of Indigenous peoples today. The work also reflect the pride, angst and frustration amongst Pacific island youth living in an urban environment, which is what I was when I first started making them back in 1996.\\" Kihara lives and works in Samoa, where she has been based over the last 10 years.

(b) Combined image. (c) Combined image of a group of pollen grains. Optical sectioning is the process by which a suitably designed microscope can produce clear images of focal planes deep within a thick sample. This is used to reduce the need for thin sectioning using instruments such as the microtome. Many different techniques for optical sectioning are used and several microscopy techniques are specifically designed to improve the quality of optical sectioning. Good optical sectioning, often referred to as good depth or z resolution, is popular in modern microscopy as it allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of a sample from images captured at different focal planes. Optical sectioning in traditional light microscopes In an ideal microscope, only light from the focal plane would be allowed to reach the detector (typically an observer or a CCD) producing a clear image of the plane of the sample the microscope is focused on. Unfortunately a microscope is not this specific and light from sources outside the focal plane also reaches the detector; in a thick sample there may be a significant amount of material, and so spurious signal, between the focal plane and the objective lens. With no modification to the microscope, i.e. with a simple wide field light microscope, the quality of optical sectioning is governed by the same physics as the depth of field effect in photography. For a high numerical aperture lens, equivalent to a wide aperture, the depth of field is small (shallow focus) and gives good optical sectioning. High magnification objective lenses typically have higher numerical apertures (and so better optical sectioning) than low magnification objectives. Oil immersion objectives typically have even larger numerical apertures so improved optical sectioning. The resolution in the depth direction (the \\"z resolution\\") of a standard wide field microscope depends on the numerical aperture and the wavelength of the light and can be approximated as: D_z = \\\\frac {\\\\lambda n} {(\\\\mathrm{NA})^2} where λ is the wavelength, n the refractive index of the objective lens immersion media and NA the numerical aperture.Nikon MicroscopyU – Depth of Field and Depth of Focus In comparison, the lateral resolution can be approximated as:Nikon MicroscopyU – Resolution D_x = D_y = \\\\frac {0.61 \\\\lambda} {\\\\mathrm{NA}} Techniques for improving optical sectioning=Bright-field light microscopy= Beyond increasing numerical aperture, there are few techniques available to improve optical sectioning in bright-field light microscopy. Most microscopes with oil immersion objectives are reaching the limits of numerical aperture possible due to refraction limits. Differential interference contrast (DIC) provides modest improvements to optical sectioning. In DIC the sample is effectively illuminated by two slightly offset light sources which then interfere to produce an image resulting from the phase differences of the two sources. As the offset in the light sources is small the only difference in phase results from the material close to the focal plane. =Fluorescence microscopy= In fluorescence microscopy objects out of the focal plane only interfere with the image if they are illuminated and fluoresce. This adds an extra way in which optical sectioning can be improved by making illumination specific to only the focal plane. Confocal microscopy uses a scanning point or points of light to illuminate the sample. In conjunction with a pinhole at a conjugate focal plane this acts to filter out light from sources outside the focal plane to improve optical sectioning. Lightsheet based fluorescence microscopy illuminates the sample with excitation light under an angle of 90° to the direction of observation, i.e. only the focal plane is illuminated using a laser that is only focused in one direction (lightsheet). This method effectively reduces out-of focus light and may in addition lead to a modest improvement in longitudinal resolution, compared to epi fluorescence microscopy. Dual and multi-photon excitation techniques take advantage of the fact that fluorophores can be excited not just by a single photon of the correct energy but also by multiple photons, which together provide the correct energy. The additional \\"concentration\\"-dependent effect of requiring multiple photons to simultaneously interact with a fluorophore gives stimulation only very close to the focal plane. These techniques are normally used in conjunction with confocal microscopy. Further improvements in optical sectioning are under active development, these principally work through methods to circumvent the diffraction limit of light. Examples include single photon interferometry through two objective lenses to give extremely accurate depth information about a single fluorophore and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy. The optical sectioning of normal wide field microscopes can be improved significantly by deconvolution, an image processing technique to remove blur from the image according to a measured or calculated point spread function. = Clearing agents = Optical sectioning can be enhanced by the use of clearing agents possessing a high refractive index (>1.4) such as Benzyl-Alcohol/Benzyl Benzoate (BABB) or Benzyl-ether which render specimens transparent and therefore allow for observation of internal structures. =Other= Optical sectioning is underdeveloped in non- light microscopes. X-ray and electron microscopes typically have a large depth of field (poor optical sectioning), and thus thin sectioning of samples is still widely used. Although similar physics guides the focusing process, Scanning probe microscopes and scanning electron microscopes are not typically discussed in the context of optical sectioning as these microscopes only interact with the surface of the sample. Total internal reflection microscopy is a fluorescent microscopy technique, which intentionally restricts observation to either the top or bottom surfaces of a sample, but with extremely high depth resolution. 3D imaging using a combination of focal sectioning and tilting has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally in order to provide exceptional 3D resolution over large fields of view. Alternatives The primary alternatives to optical sectioning are: *Thin sectioning of the sample, for example as used in histology. *Tomography, which is particularly well developed for transmission electron microscopy.

Kyoto. 2010 , abbreviated as 幸福, is a Japanese political party founded by Ryuho Okawa on 23 May 2009 \\"in order to offer the Japanese people a third option\\" for the elections of August 2009. The HRP is the political wing of the conservative and anti-communist Happy Science religious movement. Okawa is the current president of the party. Electoral history In 2009, the party had 345 candidates, placing it on the ballots of 99% of Japan's 300 constituencies. Many perennial candidates such as Yoshiro Nakamatsu joined the HRP. Despite fielding a total of more than 1 million votes, the party did not win any seats in the election. In 2012, the party again failed to gain any seats. As of April 2018, the party had 21 elected local councilors. Manifesto According to its manifesto, the group's goal is to more than double Japan's population to 300 million through making child-rearing easier for mothers and actively accepting foreigners into the country. It also aims to change the pacifist Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution in order to increase Japan's economic and military power. The group identifies itself as \\"conservative\\" and is generally considered a right-wing party. The party advocates a nuclear deterrent for Japan, denies that the Nanking Massacre occurred and has called for China to be expelled from the United Nations Security Council. The party has formed links to the American right, having attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2012, and bringing with them members of the Tokyo Tea Party.

The industry has developed over recent years and is normally considered a branch or sub-discipline of public relations (PR). Given the broad nature of public affairs, what exactly the industry encapsulates remains a point of discussion. While often equated with lobbying, this is usually only a small part of what a public affairs practitioner might do. Other typical functions include research, strategy planning and providing advice. It is difficult to determine the size of the public affairs industry in the United Kingdom. Studies suggest the industry is becoming more professionalized, and that it is more widespread than often assumed. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), which is the UK's professional body for public relations including public affairs, estimates there are around 48,000 people involved in PR, of which 30% are involved in public affairs. This research is limited as it only measures specific job titles and those who declare themselves to be working in PR. There are large numbers of professionals providing public affairs services while working under different job titles across a wide variety of sectors. The job titles of public affairs practitioners may vary, depending on the focus of their role, but may include, \\"public affairs\\", \\"external affairs/relations\\", \\"corporate communications\\", \\"government/parliamentary affairs\\" and \\"policy\\". Organizations who make use of public affairs are typically large companies, charities, trade unions, membership organizations and interest groups. They will either have staff working directly for them or employ a firm of public affairs consultants. Very often public affairs staff will work with their non-PR colleagues who are experts in a given field.  Issues of contention in the industry  It has been argued that professional lobbying goes against democracy as it allows big business to buy power and influence with well funded campaigns giving them an unfair advantage. Steps are being taken in several countries to attempt to increase levels of regulation and transparency in the public affairs industry. Several countries have introduced a mandatory register for lobbyists. The European Union has been working with a voluntary register since July 2008. Many other governments including the United Kingdom are debating a register of some kind. In the United States, President Barack Obama has introduced several measures intended to increase transparency in public affairs. In an attempt to close the \\"revolving door\\" of executive-branch officials becoming lobbyists immediately following the expiration of their federal appointments, he issued Executive Order 13490 on January 21, 2009, dictating, among other things, a two-year ban on lobbying for former top executive branch officials related to any issue that they worked on during their final year in government employment. He also introduced a ban on verbal communication between lobbyists and the federal agencies tasked with awarding economic recovery funds. These measures have proved controversial and while some argue they are a positive and necessary step, others have deemed the policies as failures due to various loopholes.

History  In 1909, the term 'vierdaagse' was introduced for the first time in the Netherlands. The Dutch Association for Physical Education (NBLO) organised walking marches in those days. During the Second World War, these 'walking marches' were prohibited by the occupation forces. Since there was a demand for a walking event in the 't Gooi area, walks developed under the term 'wandelvierdaagse'. These walks were first held in 1940, and soon caught on in other places in the Netherlands. When occupation forces found out about this new form of walking, they banned the events as assemblies against the occupiers. After the Second World War, the avondvierdaagse was re-established by various municipalities and local associations. Within a few years, many avondvierdaagsen were being held again. Currently, almost all cities in the Netherlands have such events, and some of these have grown into major events such as the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen (Nijmeegse Vierdaagse). Today, overall coordination of these walks is done by the (Koninklijke Wandelbond Nederland), and the event has its own website.http://www.avondvierdaagse.nl/ Distances  Often, avondvierdaagsen are offered in 2 or 3 distances: typically 5 kilometres, 10 kilometres, and 15 kilometres. The same distance is usually not walked all 4 days, but the total distance usually comes out to average days multiplied by advertised kilometres. In many places, on the last day all participants walk the same distance. Large walking events (such as the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen) have much greater distances, e.g. 30, 40 or even 50 kilometres.

At this location in the ancient times existed the city of Kolonides. The Greek Pausanias (geographer) in his book \\"Messiniaka\\" reports that the people of Kolonides stated that they were not Messenians but Athenians brought from Attica by Kolainos(Greek:Κόλαινος).

In October 1418, he was awarded the governorship of Southampton Castle in succession to his father, holding it until 1441. After Henry V's death his appointments at Bayeux and Caen were terminated and he served the regent, John, Duke of Bedford as chancellor of France or of Normandy between September 1422 and January 1424, and later as Bedford's chancellor, lieutenant at Rouen (January–November 1429) and chamberlain (from April 1429). He fought at the sieges of Pontorson and Orléans and was closely involved with arranging the defence of Paris following French successes under Jeanne d'Arc in 1429. Back in England, he became Treasurer of the Household from 17 April 1437 until April 1439 and was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Hampshire in November 1439. He was again returned for Hampshire in 1449 and was nominated as Speaker of the House, but declined the responsibility on the grounds of ill-health. Death, burial and succession He died on 14 April 1463, and was buried in the Charterhouse. He had never married, and his estates passed to the four daughters of his cousin Stephen Popham (c. 1386 – 1444) of Popham, Hampshire.

History  The first reference to a church in Döbling dates from 1267, when a Ecclesia in Tobelico (church in Döbling) was mentioned in an official document, but it is not known where this church stood. The continuous existence of a church can be proven from the 15th century, as the names of the Döbling parish priests have been recorded since that time. The Döbling Parish Church was destroyed by Matthias Corvinus of Hungary in the 15th century, but it was quickly rebuilt. In 1640, the parish of Döbling was dissolved and the area was allocated to the parish of Währing. The church was destroyed for a second time during the second siege of Vienna in 1683; the remains were shored up but not rebuilt. The Johann-von-Nepomuk- Kapelle in the Döblinger Hauptstraße was used as a replacement until the parish church was restored following emperor Joseph II’s reform of the parishes and the restoration of Döbling to the status of an independent parish. The church however quickly proved to be too small. It was rebuilt between 1826 and 1828 in line with designs drawn up by Josef Reininger and dedicated to Saint Paul. The church features a Baroque main room; its temple- like appearance is typical for the period. The church’s three most prominent artistic features are the picture on the altar Bekehrung des heiligen Paulus (The conversion of Saint Paul) by Josef Schönmann (1829), the pictures on the side altars, which these are the work of J. Kreßler, the pulpit, which dates from the early 19th century, and a wooden statue of Mary dating from the 18th century.  References  * Christine Klusacek, Kurt Stimmer: Döbling.

The first edition of WFRP was published in 1986 and later maintained by Hogshead Publishing. A second edition was developed and published in 2004 by Green Ronin and Black Industries, respectively. Fantasy Flight Games published a third edition under license in November 2009. This edition used a new system retaining few mechanics of the original. A fourth edition rooted in the first and second editions was released under license by Cubicle 7 in 2018. Publishing history=First edition= Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay was first published in 1986 by Games Workshop. The product was intended as an adjunct to the Warhammer Fantasy Battle tabletop game. A number of GW publications – such as the popular Realm of Chaos titles – included material for both WFRP and WFB (as well as WH40K), and a conversion system was published with the WFRP rules. Following the publication of the popular The Enemy Within campaign series and a small number of additional supplements (including a character pack, GM screen, and the aforementioned Realm of Chaos books), Games Workshop made the decision to refocus its business. It had found that the miniatures business was much more profitable than pure publishing; WFRP sold very few miniatures, and adding WFRP material to WFB and Warhammer 40,000 supplements had done little to boost the sales of those products. Publication of WFRP material was turned over to Flame Publications, a division of Games Workshop focused exclusively on roleplaying, in 1989. Flame published a new series of adventures – the Doomstones campaign adapted from a set of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons modules written by a freelancer – and published the first issue of what was intended to become a monthly or quarterly publication, Warhammer Companion. In 1992, following financial problems, Flame ceased operations. Fan websites continued to publish new material and adaptations of Warhammer Fantasy Battle materials, but no new official material appeared for several years. Nexus Editrice, one of the main RPG publishers in Italy, asked for a license from Games Workshop. The game was out of print in English, but Nexus acquired the license and reissued the edition in Italian – editing the text and including new artwork by renowned artists such as Paolo Parente. The game was released in Spring 1994 and won the Best of Show prize at the Lucca Games show, the main game fair in Italy. It had several reprints, both hardback and paperback, and it was followed by the translation of the Enemy Within campaign, a Warhammer Compendium, a Warhammer collection of 28 issues in Italian newspaper kiosks with stories, an Encyclopaedia Albionica about the world of Warhammer and a Warhammer Adventures original board game. This success helped bring new licenses soon after, including German and Czech ones, which used Nexus's layout and artwork. In 1995, British publishing house Hogshead Publishing received a license to publish new and reprinted WFRP material. Hogshead published a revised edition of the main WFRP rulebook, as well as reprints of the Enemy Within campaign. New supplements also appeared, including the Realms of Sorcery magic supplement and a number of new adventures. Hogshead was subject to a number of restrictions in its rights regarding the WFRP license; Games Workshop retained extensive editorial control over the line, wanting to ensure that new WFRP material did not contradict the tone and details of the Warhammer Fantasy Battle line. In 2002, Hogshead owner James Wallis sold his business and returned the WFRP license to Games Workshop, leaving the future of the game in doubt. Several Hogshead projects were abandoned, including a Skaven supplement and a complete rewrite of the final episode of the Enemy Within campaign. =Second edition= In 2004, Games Workshop announced that the WFRP line would once again be published. Black Industries, a newly created division of GW's Black Library publishing arm, would oversee the publishing and distribution of a new second edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, designed by Green Ronin Publishing. The new edition uses the same basic system released in 1986, but revises and updates a number of features of the system – replacing the magic system, for instance. The new WFRP also brought the Old World setting of WFRP up to date with the developments in background story that had taken place in the Warhammer tabletop game since first edition by setting the events of the game after the Storm of Chaos. The new rulebook appeared in March 2005, and was soon accompanied by an aggressively-published slate of supplements and sourcebooks, including a new epic campaign (the Paths of the Damned series); monster, equipment and setting supplements; and a number of stand-alone adventures. Black Industries announced on 28 January 2008 that it would be exiting the roleplaying game market. The Thousand Thrones Campaign was their final WFRP publication. On 22 February 2008, Fantasy Flight Games announced that it had acquired the exclusive rights to publish board games, card games and role-playing games based on Games Workshop properties, including Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.Fantasy Flight Games/Black Industries press release The Career Compendium and Shades of Empire were FFG's only publications for second edition before it announced it would release a new edition of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay game. =Third edition= On 12 August 2009, Fantasy Flight Games announced 3rd edition for immediate release, packaged as a single box containing four rulebooks, over 300 cards and counters, with 36 custom dice. One year later FFG released the rules as standalone books/PDFs, allowing gamers to play the edition the traditional way (without boxes or counters) for the first time. On 12 August 2014, Fantasy Flight Games announced that the third-edition product line was \\"complete\\" and that no further products would be released for this edition. In September 2016, the companies announced an end to their licensing agreement. All Games Workshop-licensed FFG products were discontinued at the end of February 2017. =Fourth edition= On 24 May 2017, GW and Cubicle 7 announced a fourth edition of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay saying it would take \\"its direction from the first and second editions of the game\\". The fourth edition was released in digital formats in August 2018 with physical release in November 2018. Setting Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay shares the same doom-laden background as the Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB) wargame, with a focus on the Empire. Since it is a game devoted to individual characters rather than to entire armies, WFRP depicts the setting in much closer detail than its wargame counterpart. This change of focus also transforms WFRP into a more grim and perilous game than WFB. The primary setting of WFRP is the Empire, a region of the Old World based loosely on the Holy Roman Empire, with a number of baronies, counties and dukedoms fashioned after the fiefs of elector counts and dukes. Warhammer setting overviews. Other prominent regions include Bretonnia, initially based on medieval France, later reinvented using strong Arthurian mythology themes; Kislev, based on medieval Poland and Imperial Russia; and the Wasteland, whose sole city of Marienburg is based on the Low Countries. Other lands not explored as thoroughly but still frequently mentioned include the fragmented lands of Estalia and Tilea, fashioned after Spain and the city-states of Renaissance Italy respectively, and Araby, a mixture of Arabic Caliphate and Persia. Other lands with real-life analogies include Cathay (China), Ind (India), Naggaroth (northern North America), Ulthuan (Atlantis), Lustria (Mesoamerica), Norsca (Scandinavia) and the island of Albion (British Isles); however, very little official information has been released for these locales. While the setting of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay shares traits, such as the existence of elves and goblins, with other popular fantasy settings, it is technologically set slightly later than classic fantasy – close to the early Renaissance era in terms of technology and society. Firearms are readily available, though expensive and unreliable, and a growing mercantile middle class challenges the supremacy of the nobility. One of the most identifiable features of the Warhammer setting is Chaos. While the forces of Chaos in Warhammer Fantasy Battle are depicted primarily in the form of marauding dark knights and beastmen, Chaos in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is an insidious force gnawing at the fabric of society. Secret cults abound among all strata of society, seeking to overthrow the social order or to further their own power. Mutants lurk in the forests outside the great cities, while the Skaven (a race of rats) tunnel beneath them. Magic is widely feared and reviled, and not without reason. Magic is derived from – and thus corrupted by – Chaos, and its practitioners tread a fine line between death or corruption and relative safety. System Combat in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay descends from the system used for large-scale miniature combat, making it substantially more deadly than the combat featured in many other systems. Most human-level creatures and characters can absorb only one or two hits without receiving a serious injury, a \\"Critical Hit\\" that may instantly kill, cripple, or permanently maim a character. There are no regeneration or resurrection powers in WFRP and limited healing options. \\"Fate Points\\", which represent a character's fate or destiny, provide a limited number of opportunities to avoid crippling or killing results. =Careers= A central feature of all published editions of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is the career system. Characters advance by entering a series of careers that provide access to a series of new or improved skills and bonuses to attributes (called \\"advances\\"). The selection of careers available to characters reflects the late medieval/early Renaissance setting of the Old World. Basic careers might be filled by any individual with a modest amount of training or instruction. Advanced careers require greater preparation and training, and, particularly in later editions, tend to be more appropriate to the lifestyle of an active adventurer. The career system gives an idea of what a character might have been doing either before embarking on a career as an adventurer (working as a baker, night watchman, rat catcher, or farmer) or as an ongoing occupation during and between adventures (thief, ranger, wizard's apprentice, druid), as well as how the character has changed and developed through their career (becoming a mercenary, explorer, or ship's captain). =First edition= The set of numbers describing a character's abilities in first edition Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is closely based on early versions of Warhammer Fantasy Battle. The same basic array of characteristics (Weapon Skill, Strength, Initiative, and more) is employed for both games, although some traits rated 1–10 in WFB are rated 1–100 in WFRP to give more detail and differentiation between characters than is required in a wargame. =Second edition= The second edition hews closely to the first in most cases. In second edition, all primary attributes are ranked 1–100, but the tens digit of these values still corresponds to WFB's traits' values. Attributes are tested using percentile dice, with penalties or bonuses applied to the roll or the target value according to various favorable and unfavorable circumstances. One departure from first edition regards magic. Magical abilities (called 'spells') mainly affect individuals rather than battlefield units as in first edition. Characters no longer have 'magic points' – instead use of magic is controlled by a (small) risk of manifestations of Chaos that risk branding the character as a witch. Each school of magic now features its own signature spells, giving different abilities and strengths to the various spellcasters. =Third edition= Fantasy Flight Games implemented a completely new set of rules for third edition, which uses dice pools rather than the percentile system of previous editions. The seven types of dice are unique to the game and only available from Fantasy Flight. The new system comes with several tokens and counters, though FFG subsequently made the rulebooks available separately. A new mechanic focuses on party cohesion. There are multiple \\"Party Sheets\\" included in the core set and supplements. At the beginning of each new game, the players decide which party sheet they would like to use for their characters. These party sheets allow characters to share a talent (an ability or power that a character possesses) with the party, so that anyone in the party can use it. In addition to sharing talents, the party sheet provides a specific bonus ability that the party can use and certain negative effects that the party may suffer. =Fourth edition= The mechanics of the fourth edition are based on the percentile mechanics of the first and second editions, instead of the custom dice pools of the third. Characters are now much more free to advance their Characteristics and Skills independently of their careers, and the cost in experience point scales with higher numbers. Skill usage (especially in combat situations) is expanded with the concept of 'advantage', where continued success grants cumulative bonuses. Wizardly magic keeps many spells of second edition, but integrates the casting mechanism into the overall task resolution system. Fourth edition is the first to offer guidelines on downtime – what happens between adventures. Reception In the August 1987 edition of Dragon (Issue 124), Ken Rolston compared it very favorably to other fantasy role-playing games on the market, saying \\"WFR deliberately aims at adventures and settings with a less elevated tone... This shift in emphasis from genteel to grubby, gory fantasy, and the simplicity of the tactical and magic systems, are distinctive assets of WFR as it competes for a slice of the [fantasy role-playing game] audience.\\" Rolston called the character generation system \\"interesting and original\\", and the character advancement system \\"flexible and informal\\". Rolston also liked the monsters encountered, describing them as \\"charming — and visually compelling — intelligent monster antagonists... well illustrated and often supplied with dramatic and humourous backgrounds.\\" He called the setting the best part of the game, admiring the \\"epic theme of the Taint of Chaos.\\" Rolston reserved his only strong criticism for the magic system, saying it was \\"relatively limited and unexciting\\", although he did see it inevitable in a game that was relatively magic-poor. He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is strongly recommended for gamers in search of a fantasy system and campaign background, or in search of elements to steal and add to their current system and campaign. Its systems, presentation, and campaign setting are superior, and the campaign supplement/adventure support looks promising. Its strengths, when compared to other popular FRPG designs, are the simplicity of its systems, its support of grotesque and macabre themes, and the distinctive flavor of its campaign setting.\\" In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay was ranked fourth. Editor Paul Pettengale commented, \\"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is an extremely atmospheric game to play in\\", and described the game as feeling like a cross-breed between Dungeons & Dragons and Call of Cthulhu, saying \\"if you've played these other two games, you can probably imagine what a superb mix that can be.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #35 (Dec 1986) Awards At the 2005 ENnie Awards, the second edition's core rulebook, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, won Gold in the Best Production Values and Best Game categories.

Chiltern Railway has invested heavily in both infrastructure and rolling stock for the Chiltern group of lines. History West Wycombe original station was an intermediate station on the Wycombe Railway and opened on 1 August 1862. The station was provided with a single platform and a station building of typical Wycombe Railway design which was repeated exactly at Princes Risborough and Wheatley, although other stations Cookham, Marlow Road, Wooburn Green, Loudwater and Bledlow had the same design with an additional crossing keeper's house attached.

Hamina fortress is a Star fort, representing the Renaissance ideal city embodied by Palmanova city in northeastern Italy.  Construction  The location of the fortress used to be the marketplace of the Vehkalahti, which had received city rights in 1653 under the name of Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki. The city was destroyed in the Great Northern War in 1712. The construction of the fortress began by Swedish general Axel von Löwen after the Treaty of Nystadt in early 1720s. Von Löwen wanted to prevent the Russian advance into the Gulf of Finland as envisioned by the Tsar Peter the Great, who wanted to open the sea routes for Russia. Alongside the Hamina fortress the construction of another fortress also began in Lappeenranta. Protected by the six bastions, named after other Finnish fortified cities, of the fortress the garrison was responsible for defending the city and the coastal road. After the Russo–Swedish War of 1741–1743 the still-unfinished fortress had to surrender to Russian troops and the area was annexed by Russia. General Alexander Suvorov continued the construction of the fortress.  19th century  At the beginning of the 19th century Hamina fortress one of the many fortresses that were reinforced as part of the South- Eastern Finland fortification system. Dutch-born general Jan Pieter van Suchtelen considered the fortress obsolescent and inadequate, so the north- facing defences on the shore of Kirkkojärvi lake were demolished and replaced with a new large masonry bastion according with Caponier system in 1803. After the border between Russia and Sweden moved westwards to Torne River from Kymi River as result of the Finnish War, the fortress was abandoned in the 1830s and the Tsar Nicholas I gave the fortress area to Hamina town. Simultaneously the position of the commander of the fortress was dissolved. Hamina fortress saw action again in the Crimean War. The fortress was reinforced and the position of the fortress commander was re-established for the duration of the war.  Fortress today  Gallery and fortress wall The restoration of the fortress began in 1957 and since the 1980s Finnish National Board of Antiquities has been responsible for the renovating the fortress structures. Much of the fortress remains to this day, and it is used as a venue for different events. Perhaps the most notable is the Hamina Tattoo, an international military music event held bi-annually in Hamina. Parts of the fortress are still in military use, as the Finnish Reserve Officer School is located in the fortress.

He was the 2nd son of Edward Cutler, Salter, of London. He became a successful grocer who also participated in land speculation, acquiring the combined Gawthorpe and Harewood Castle estates in Yorkshire in 1656. He was knighted in 1660 and created a baronet (of London) later the same year. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London four times and became a councilman and alderman of the city of London.

Howard was created a Knight of the Bath in 1626. He was elected the MP for Oxford in 1640, but was never seated as he was given a writ of acceleration to the House of Lords before the beginning of the session. He was a Royalist sergeant-major of horse in 1643, and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Charles II in exile, from 1658 to 1660. He succeeded his father as Earl of Berkshire in 1669. As an influential member of the Catholic nobility, and a staunch supporter of the Duke of York, he was, like his cousin William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford (who was executed for treason in 1680), an obvious target of Titus Oates and other informers during the Popish Plot. More wary of the danger than was Stafford, he fled abroad in November 1678 before any accusation of treason was made against him, and died in Paris the following April. No credible evidence of treason was ever produced against him: a number of supposedly incriminating letters which he wrote in 1674 merely confirmed his political support for the future James II, who he promised to stand by \\"in the dark hour of his fortune\\", and an alleged deathbed confession to a treasonable conspiracy turned out to be a forgery.

Amongst her most memorable roles are Ghazi Apa in Uncle Urfi, Apa Begum in Tanhaiyaan and Fazeelat in Dhoop Kinarey. Television career She began her career with the Rawalpindi Studios of PTV in the late 1960s. Sherwani worked with some of the best producers in the country including Mohsin Ali, Shereen Khan, Shahzad Khalil, Sultana Siddiqui, Zaheer Khan and Sahira Kazmi. She also worked with some of the best writers of her time including Fatima Surayya Bajia, Haseena Moin and Anwar Maqsood. The role of Apa Begum in Haseena Moin's Tanhaiyan was undoubtedly the most famous of her career where Shahzad Khalil cast her as a tough taskmaster who ill-treated her employee, Buqrat, played by Jamshed Ansari. She logically argued (and winning in the end, of course) with him as to why he should get bus fare when walking can improve his health and solve the problem. Her character wanted her brother (Qazi Wajid as Faraan) to marry a dominant woman which, fortunately, does not happen. As Ghazi Apa in Uncle Urfi, she stood between the two love birds, quarrelled regularly with Hasnat Bhai (Jamshed Ansari again) and was the dominant force behind the extremely funny Shaheer Bhai (Qurban Jilani). In Sitara Aur Mehrunissa, she played the selfish mother of Sitara (Atiqa Odho) and in \\"Aangan Terha, she played the despised mother-in-law aka Saliha Begum of Mahboob Ahmed (Shakeel). Then she was the villainous Mai Jaina in Mera Naam Mangu in the early 1970s — a play about professional beggars — while she excelled in Haseena Moin's Parchaiyan as part of a star cast comprising Rahat Kazmi, Sahira Kazmi, Shakeel and Talat Hussain. She held her own in Bajiya's Afshaan with fellow cast members Shafi Mohammad, Shakeel, Qazi Wajid, Ishrat Hashmi and Begum Khurshid Mirza. In short, her histrionic talent set the standards for character acting on Pakistan television. Azra Sherwani worked with actors of all generations — from Qazi Wajid, Subhani Ba Yunus, Imtiaz Ahmed, Begum Khurshid Mirza, Qurban Jilani, Shakeel, Shafi Mohammad, Talat Iqbal, Anwar Maqsood, Akbar Subhan, Behroze Sabzwari, Shahnaz Sheikh, Marina Khan, Ishrat Hashmi, Jamshed Ansari, Babar Ali, Mazhar Ali, Mishi Khan, Atiqa Odho, Sania Saeed, Sajid Hasan and Sadia Imam. When the advent of private productions brought about the decline of quality plays on PTV, Azra Sherwani sustained for some time, working in plays such as Kanwal, Fatima Surayya Bajia'sGhar Ik Nagar and Sultana Siddiqui's Doosri Duniya. Her most memorable role during the later part of her career was that of Khala Khairan in Riffat Humayun's serial of the same name. Her character was such that she quarrels with Qazi Wajid, a tenant in the house of Khala's folks who refuses to either leave or pay the rent. =Dramas= * Dhoop Kinarey (1987) * Tanhaiyan (1986) * Uncle Urfi (1972) * Aangan Terha * Sitara aur Mehr-un-nisa * Afshan (1980) * Parchaiyan * Aagahi * Khaala Khairan * Doosri Dunya  Personal life  Sherwani was born in Meerut, India, according to family sources.

It was arranged and sung by the group's lead guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, who described their interpretation of it as psychedelic folk-rock. Called by nearly a dozen different names and with varying words, melodies and purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted of murder, and sees use in the 1950s as a folk song, before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane. Several of these different variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century.  Hymn  \\"Good Shepherd\\" originated in a very early 19th century hymn written by the Methodist minister Reverend John Adam Granade (1770–1807), \\"Let Thy Kingdom, Blessed Savior\\". Granade was a significant figure of the Great Revival in the American West during the 19th century's first decade, as the most important author of camp meeting hymns during that time. He was referred to by the Nashville Banner as the \\"wild man of Goose Creek\\", and was also variously known as \\"the poet of the backwoods\\" and \\"the Wild Man of Holston\\". Granade worked in part in the world of shape-note singing in the Shenandoah Valley, where a variety of musical sources both sacred and profane were at play. This new hymn had an immediate effect. A Thomas Griffin recalls hearing it in a Methodist meeting in Oglethorpe, Georgia in 1808. He wrote that the singing of the hymn \\"made the flesh tremble on me, and caused an awful sense of the hereafter to press on my mind\\"; he converted to Christianity a few days later. Granade's work can be seen in the 1817 hymnal A Selection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs in Two Parts as \\"Come good shepherd, feed thy Sheep\\", while the first line of the hymn also makes an appearance in one Eleazer Sherman's 1832 memoir. It then appeared in Joshua Leavitt's popular and influential 1833 tunebook The Christian Lyre as \\"Let thy kingdom\\", associated to the tune \\"Good Shepherd\\" with an 8.7. metrical pattern. It contained lines such as: :Let thy kingdom, blessed Savior, :Come, and bid our jarring cease; :Come, oh come! and reign for ever, :God of love and Prince of peace; : ... :Some for Paul, some for Apollos, :Some for Cephas—none agree; : ... :Not upheld by force or numbers, :Come, good Shepherd, feed thy sheep. It appears in this form in several hymnals of the 1830s and 1840s, including one created by the Mormons. The most likely tune for it, however, would have been different from the eventual gospel blues one. Titled \\"The Good Shepherd\\" and with only two verses printed instead of the previous six or seven, it appeared again in an 1853 New England Christian Convention hymnal. The hymn is on occasion still sung today.  Gospel blues  By the 1880s, \\"Let Thy Kingdom, Blessed Savior\\" could be found in Marshall W. Taylor's hymnal of African American religious songs, A Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies. It subsequently was transformed by the more general forces shaping American musical forms. The influence of Methodist hymns on Negro spirituals is a complex topic that scholars often disagree on, while there was a more definite and direct influence of African-American spirituals upon the blues.Lovell Jr., Black Song, pp. 463–465. In any case, the aging blind blues player Jimmie Strothers recorded the song, as \\"The Blood-Strained Banders\\", sometimes called \\"Keep Away from the Bloodstained Banders\\", for Alan Lomax and Harold Spivacke on behalf of the Library of Congress in June 1936. (The name was probably a corruption of \\"Blood Stained Bandits\\".) Strothers accompanied himself on four-string banjo, an instrument upon which his skill was well regarded. Coming from the Appalachian part of Virginia, Strothers had lost his sight in a mine explosion and had made a living playing on street corners and in medicine shows. Blind, itinerant street singers like Strothers were part of the tradition that kept African- American religious music alive. The recording was made at the Virginia State Prison Farm near Goochland, Virginia, where Strothers was serving time for having murdered his wife. (Although sometimes described as having murdered his wife with an axe, in letters to Governor of Virginia James H. Price requesting pardon Strothers wrote that he shot his wife with a pistol in self-defense. See in particular letters to governor of March 27, 1938 and May 1, 1939. The pardon was granted in 1939.) Lomax thought prisons were a good place to find old songs, and was also interested in illustrating the interaction of white and black music. This haunting recording was part of what Allmusic describes as a \\"group of songs that explore the boundaries between the sacred and the profane.\\" :If you want to get to heaven :... Over on, the other shore :Stay out of the way of the blood-stained bandit — :Oh good shepherd, :Feed my sheep. : :One for Paul, one for Silas ... :One for to make, my heart rejoice. :Can't you hear, my lambs acallin'? :Oh good shepherd, :Feed my sheep. \\"Blood- stained Banders\\" has been called a \\"dark homily [that] bubbles up archaic invectives for the devil that huddles behind every stranger's face.\\" Strothers' recording of \\"Blood-stained Banders\\" was described in the 1941 book Our Singing Country by Alan Lomax and his father John A. Lomax, with the transcription being done by Ruth Crawford Seeger. The recording was released in 1942 by the Library of Congress as Archive of Folk Song, Recording Laboratory AFS L3 Folk Music of the United States: Afro American Spirituals, Work Songs and Ballads, a collection of field recordings including those by State Penitentiary and State Farm prisoners. It first appeared on 78 rpm records, then was released again on LP album in the mid-1960s. In 1998, it was issued by Rounder Records on Compact Disc as Afro-American Spirituals, Work Songs & Ballads, which is also available from the Library of Congress. It also appears on the CD The Ballad Hunter, Parts VII and VIII from the Library of Congress, originally issued as Archive of Folk Song, Recording Laboratory AFS L52 in 1941. Transcribed in time, the Strothers recording's rhythm and melody are somewhat similar but still measurably different from what would come later. Free sample available. Not a Negro spiritual per se, it was not listed in the top 500 spirituals in a listing of some 6,000 constructed by scholar John Lovell, Jr. in 1972.Lovell Jr., Black Song, p. 637.  Folk  In 1953, Ruth Crawford Seeger collected and transcribed the song as \\"Don't You Hear The Lambs A-Crying\\" in her acclaimed volume American Folk Songs for Christmas. Dartmouth College music professor Larry Polansky comments that in doing so, Ruth Crawford Seeger took the hard-edged gospel blues and \\"revoice[d] it as a beautiful, shape-note influenced hymn.\\" The \\"Blood Stained Banders\\" form was then recorded by The Folksmiths in 1958 on their Folkways Records LP We've Got Some Singing to Do. This was an effort organized by Joe Hickerson, who would become director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. We've Got Some Singing to Do and its accompanying songbook were distributed to a number of summer camps, and were responsible for the popularization of several freedom-longing African-American songs such as \\"Kum Ba Yah\\". The song was circulating in folk circles in other forms as well, and Pete Seeger published a variant with a more explicitly political message, called \\"If You Want To Go To Freedom\\", in the mimeographed-but-influential Broadside Magazine in 1963. Meanwhile, a recording of the Ruth Crawford Seeger \\"Don't You Hear The Lambs A-Crying\\" was done for the 1989 album American Folk Songs for Christmas by Peggy Seeger, Mike Seeger, and Penny Seeger. Dartmouth's Polansky then arranged the song under that title for strings in 1999, which was premiered at that year's Spoleto Music Festival. The original strain of \\"Blood-Stained Banders\\" is still played; Bobby Horton recorded it in 2003 with an extended guitar part, as part of the soundtrack for the Ken Burns documentary Horatio's Drive. Hickerson also still performs the tune in the first decade of the 21st century.  Kaukonen and Jefferson Airplane  \\"Blood-Stained Banders\\" was thus the proximate source for what was taught to guitarist Jorma Kaukonen by folk singer Roger Perkins and friend Tom Hobson in the early 1960s. Kaukonen had grown up in Washington, D.C. and around the world as the son of a diplomat, then had migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area where he became a lover of various folk revival styles, especially acoustic blues and downhome blues. The song became part of Kaukonen's repertoire as he played around San Francisco clubs, well before he joined Jefferson Airplane. Kaukonen continued to evolve musically; the enticement of exploring the technology around the electric guitar led him to join the Airplane.Tamarkin, Got a Revolution, p. 26. An evolving rendition of Kaukonen's imagining of the song is captured on a circulating recording of his May 21, 1968, performance at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco during a jam session of area musicians led by Jerry Garcia. Now titled simply \\"Good Shepherd\\", a recording of the song became Kaukonen's major showcase number on the Airplane's November 1969 Volunteers album, where it avoided the political topicality of the most visible tracks on the rest of the album. \\"Good Shepherd\\" encompassed elements of both gospel and blues in its playing and showed that folk roots were still quite present in the Airplane's mixture of sounds and influences that led to psychedelic rock. Indeed, folk music underlay many aspects of the San Francisco psychedelic sound, with the Airplane as a prime example. The recording of \\"Good Shepherd\\", which took place from late March to late June 1969, featured a rare Kaukonen lead vocal backed by mellow harmonies from the group. Its arrangement incorporated Kaukonen's sharp, stinging electric guitar lines set against an acoustic guitar opening, with singer Grace Slick wordlessly doubling Kaukonen's guitar line during the instrumental break. The track was considered a beautiful standout on the album. Kaukonen himself later referred to it as \\"a great spiritual that I really liked. It's a psychedelic folk-rock song.\\" The arrangement was copyrighted by Kaukonen under BMI and published by the Airplane's Icebag Corporation. Volunteers soon became a gold record and gave the song its greatest visibility since its early days as a hymn. The Airplane \\"Good Shepherd\\" has been described as \\"an ageless representation of genius\\".Fenton, Take Me to a Circus Tent, p. 276. It was included on the band's 1970 greatest hits album The Worst of Jefferson Airplane. The song's first live performance by Jefferson Airplane was on May 7, 1969, in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, but with Grace Slick singing lead and Kantner doing the backing vocal.Fenton, Take Me to a Circus Tent, p. 18. Kaukonen would begin singing the lead two days later in Kansas City, and subsequently kept that role. The 2004 CD reissue of Volunteers included a live rendition of \\"Good Shepherd\\" as one of five live bonus tracks recorded November 28 and 29, 1969, at the Fillmore East in New York. This performance arrangement had no acoustic guitar part, but instead featured Kantner on electric guitar setting out a repeating but flexible pattern for the song, which Kaukonen then played against with his fills and solos. The song was last played during the original Airplane era in 1972. \\"Good Shepherd\\" was part of the set list of the Airplane's 1989 reunion tour.Tamarkin, Got a Revolution!, p. 351. It was included on the 1987/1990 Airplane compilation 2400 Fulton Street. As Kaukonen and Airplane bassist Jack Casady focused on the offshoot group Hot Tuna beginning in the early 1970s, \\"Good Shepherd\\" became a regular entry in their performance repertoire. One such performance was included on their 2000 DVD Acoustic Blues Live at Sweetwater. Hot Tuna performances of the song would occasionally draw old Airplane members to join in. By 2004, it was often used as a vehicle for a solo bass excursion by Casady. Besides Hot Tuna's, renditions of \\"Good Shepherd\\" also appeared on Kaukonen's 1985 live album Magic (and the 1995 expanded release Magic Two), which contained selections from his solo acoustic performances; as one of Kaukonen's efforts on the 1999 Phil Lesh and Friends live album Love Will See You Through; and on the 2001 Jorma Kaukonen Trio Live album. In the 21st century, the song continued to draw commentary from listeners. By now Kaukonen was offering the view that the \\"blood-stained banders\\" of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing \\"Good Shepherd\\" and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: \\"I guess you could say I loved the Bible without even knowing it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing.\\"  References  1800s songs 1936 songs 1953 songs 1969 songs American Christian hymns Gospel songs American folk songs Jefferson Airplane songs ","title":"Good Shepherd (song)"},{"id":"23728674","text":"Seventeen ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Dispatch, or the variant HMS Despatch: * was a 2-gun brigantine launched in 1691 and sold in 1712. * was a 14-gun sloop launched in 1745 and sold in 1763. * was a 14-gun sloop that foundered in a hurricane in 1772.

History  A view of the church from the Krottenbachstraße The area of the Glanzing parish originally belonged to the Pötzleinsdorf parish. The route to the parish church was however difficult, particularly in winter, and over time the church proved too small as well. As a result, the local population was invited to attend church services held from 1934 in the Glanzing Paediatric Clinic. The realisation of plans drawn up in 1937 to build a new church was frustrated by the outbreak of World War II. In the first weeks after the end of the war, in May 1945, a garage in the Koschatgasse served as a provisional venue for services; the City of Vienna earmarked a section of the gardens in the Glanzinggasse in July of the same year for the construction of a church. At first, a wooden structure with space for 110 people was erected on this site. This structure was sanctified on 29 September 1946 and given the title Mariä Verkündigung (Mary’s Revelation), but several years passed before a proper church could be erected. In 1957, a section of the garden belonging to the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences Vienna in the Krottenbachstraße was purchased, where the parish church Verkündigung des Herren (The Lord’s Revelation), designed by Josef Lackner, was built between 1969 and 1970. The wooden structure in the Glanzinggasse was taken down in 1972 but continued to serve as a provisional church in the settlement Am Biberhaufen in Donaustadt.

Beringovsky District–2011.Law #44-OZ As a municipal division, it was, together with Anadyrsky Administrative District, incorporated as Anadyrsky Municipal District. It was located on the southeastern shores of the autonomous okrug and bordered with Anadyrsky District in the west and the Bering Sea in the east. Its administrative center was the urban locality (an urban-type settlement) of Beringovsky. Population: The area of the district was . Geography The district was the smallest in area of all districts within Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. It was a particularly mountainous region, part of the Koryak Highlands, and was a center for glaciation within the okrug. As a result of this, and due to the fact that a significant proportion of the less rugged land in the interior of the district was used for reindeer pasture, the administrative center of Beringovsky and three other native villages in the district were all situated on the coast of the Bering Sea.Fute, p. 95f As the sea in this area rarely, if ever, freezes, it was the main transport route between settlements, especially considering that the road network within the district was almost non-existent. There is a short paved road at around from Beringovsky to the airport, a ice road from Beringovsky to Meynypilgyno, and a ice road from Meynypilgyno to Khatyrka. The other rural locality in the district, Alkatvaam, was not connected by road to any other populated places and despite its proximity to Beringovsky all transport was done by sea or a helicopter. Economy Aerial of photo of Pekulneyskoye Lake, near Meynypilgyno As with much of Chukotka, mining for coal and minerals was the main driver of the economy, leaving agriculture and other forms of commerce underdeveloped by all except indigenous peoples. The Nagornaya Mine JSC was the largest mining company in the district and extracted nearly 300,000 tons of coal during 2005. Other industries included the Federal State Enterprise, Bering Sea Port, which is one of the main cargo processing center in the autonomous okrug after Anadyr and Pevek, and the Bering Beer and Beverage Plant, although it filed for bankruptcy. Although medium to heavy industry dominated the district, and traditional economic drivers remained underdeveloped, the high percentage of indigenous Chukchi (around 40%) allowed three farms, centered around three separate rural localities, to carry on traditional reindeer farming and husbandry as well as farming a variety of other traditional animals. Status changes Before May 2008, Beringovsky Administrative District was municipally incorporated as Beringovsky Municipal District. In May 2008, Anadyrsky and Beringovsky Municipal Districts were merged, forming an enlarged Tsentralny Municipal District.Law #41-OZ This change, however, did not affect the administrative aspect of these districts. Both Anadyrsky and Beringovsky Administrative Districts continued to exist separately. In October 2008, the law mandating the change was amended and the name Tsentralny was discarded with the combined municipal district being renamed Anadyrsky Municipal District.

The initial idea, a free trade port in Manaus, came from Deputy Francisco Pereira da Silva and was subsequently formalized by Law No. 3.173 on June 6, 1957. The project was approved by the National Congress on October 23, 1951 under No. 1.310 and regulated by Decree No. 47.757 on February 2, 1960. It was then amended by rapporteur Maurício Jopper, engineer, who by agreement with the original author, justified the creation of a free economic zone instead of a free trade port.Official Website of Free Economic Zone of Manaus For the first ten years the ZFM (Manaus Free Trade Zone) was located in a warehouse rented from Manaus Harbour, in the Port of Manaus, and relied on federal funds. It was perhaps due to this lack of its own resources that there was little credibility in the project. On February 28, 1967, President Castello Branco signed Decree-Law No. 288,Decree-Law No. 288 (in Portuguese) whose draft accompanied the Exposition of Motives.

They were active from 2001 to 2010, gaining a cult following both in Finland and abroad. The band released two albums and several EPs and singles. The Micragirls did over 250 concerts, of which some 100 outside Finland. The band's principal line-up was a trio: drums, electric guitar and combo organ, with all band members singing. Story=Beginning, 2001–2002= The Micragirls got started during Provinssirock outdoor rock festival in June 2001. Four young ladies from Kuopio listened to garage rock compilation cassettes for the whole weekend in a Nissan Micra car, and decided to form a band. Their friends' band Aavikko, while performing at the festival, had dedicated one of their songs to \\"Micratytöt\\". This was then translated to the English name of the newborn group. Right after coming home from the festival the ladies walked into the rehearsal room of their friends and selected their instruments. Kristiina Haapalainen took on the drums as she had sat behind a drum kit a couple of times, her sister Katariina Haapalainen chose a career with keyboards, and petite Elina Hakkarainen picked up the bass guitar. Mari Halonen became the guitar player and lead vocalist, being the only one with any previous musical experience – on violin. The first private gig of The Micragirls was already that August, and they had seven public performances during 2001. Their first concerts abroad were in Saint Petersburg, Russia, before the group had published any records. The band members had been enthusiastic music consumers and had even organized some gigs for other groups. This had provided them with good contacts within the Finnish music circles, and it was easy for The Micragirls to get gigs. With help from the band Aavikko they also got the chance to make their first record. =First seven-inchers, 2002–2006= The Micragirls' first 7\\" EP Are You Insane, Girls? was published in August 2002. The EP consists of five songs, which were recorded during a weekend at the rehearsal room on single takes, with no overdubbing. The method provided a gig-like sound and atmosphere to the record. The second EP Mind Twistin' Weekend with the Micragirls was recorded and mixed at the rehearsal room and home studio of a Finnish fellow band The Slideshaker. The four-song 7\\" was released in April 2003. Around that time bass player Hakkarainen decided to leave the group. The Micragirls had a lot of concerts scheduled and the remaining trio rearranged and rehearsed the songs to be performed without a bass guitar. A little later Katariina Haapalainen furnished the band with a Hohner Basset keyboard bass that she played in addition to a combo organ, her main instrument. The Micragirls did around 30 concerts per year in 2002 and 2003. In addition to Finland they performed in Russia, Estonia and Sweden. In the end of 2003, back in the rehearsal room, The Micragirls recorded new material for their third 7\\" Primitive Homeorgan Blast. The four-song EP came out in the beginning of April 2004. Coinciding with the record release The Micragirls toured Sweden, Germany and Switzerland with The Slideshaker on their sixteen-show Surrender Tour. In 2004 The Micragirls had 35 gigs, of which 20 abroad. Next year was mostly spent on maternal leave. There were only seven concerts in 2005 but the group wrote new music even during their leave. The Micragirls were back at full speed in 2006: gigging and also working on the long-aspired 10-inch album. =Time of the albums, 2006–= The Micragirls recorded some new originals and cover songs in the beginning of 2006. Bone Voyage Recording Company, co-owned by members of the band 22-Pistepirkko, signed the group based on demo tapes from the sessions. \\"Feeling Dizzy Honey!?\\", a ten-inch vinyl album was published in November 2006. The nowadays rare 10\\" format was at that time considered by the trio as maximum dose of \\"micramusic\\". In January 2007 the eight songs from the 10\\" album were reissued on a double CD version of \\"Feeling Dizzy Honey!?\\", packed together with disc 2 containing the eight earlier songs from the group's second and third EP. The CD release helped The Micragirls to reach a larger audience, and their annual gig rate rose to about fifty. A Japanese domestic market one-disc CD edition of \\"Feeling Dizzy Honey!?\\" was published in end of 2007, containing the 16 songs and a bonus animated video of the song \\"Teenage Tiger\\". Yet another version of \\"Feeling Dizzy Honey!?\\" emerged in early 2008, this time a 12\\" colored vinyl LP record. After extensive rereleasing of earlier recordings, three completely new Micragirls songs were published in June 2008 on the 7\\" EP Haunted Heart. Guest bassist Minna Kortepuro from the Finnish band Risto played her double bass on two of the songs. She did occasionally play also onstage with The Micragirls. The Micragirls toured in Europe on many occasions, most notably in Germany and Switzerland. During 2007–2009 the ladies supported for example Heavy Trash, The Go! Team and Boss Hog on their European tours. The Micragirls did not perform in their home country between September 2008 and September 2009. The first domestic gigs of 2009 coincided with the release of a new album. The group's second album Wild Girl Walk was released on 2009-09-09, somewhat later than originally planned. Members of 22-Pistepirkko acted as producers and recording engineers as well as technical consultants in the album sessions during 2008 and 2009. The Micragirls has not performed in public since the 2010 Ilosaarirock outdoor festival. Style The characteristic sound of The Micragirls is based on primitive beat, howling organ, and fervent vocal performances. Along their career the band developed from sheer fun-having towards more soulful musical expression. There was a strong contrast between the looks and the sound of The Micragirls, especially during their fast-paced songs and notably when all the ladies were screaming simultaneously. The group usually wore 60s style uniforms on stage. The Micragirls are often compared to the Japanese band The 5.6.7.8's.

Life Shakespeare was born in 1906 in the working class area of Kates Hill, Dudley, the fourth of eight children of John Thomas Shakespeare and his wife Ada. His family subsequently moved to council housing in the nearby Wren's Nest Estate area. In 1920, after a chance meeting at the Dudley Museum and Art Gallery with Ivo Shaw, the principal of Dudley Art School, he was offered a place at the school where his fees were waived for his eight years attendance where he showed a talent for figure drawing and portraits. Eventually he attended Birmingham School of Art, where he studied anatomical drawing under Harold Holden from 1923 to 1927 and obtained an Art Masters Certificate in Anatomical Drawing, and qualified as a teacher. He taught part-time, mostly at Birmingham Art School and occasionally at Kidderminster College. For the rest of his life he continued to paint with a view to making that his career and produced a number of paintings each year (mainly in oil) that were submitted to the Royal Academy, and often accepted for exhibition. In 1933 he produced his most controversial painting, a self- portrait in which, it has been suggested, he is posing as the demonic figure Mephistopheles. In the same year, he had his first exhibit at the Royal Academy, \\"A Mulatto\\", a portrait of a lady which was later bought by Dudley Art Gallery. He also exhibited at the Paris Salon and at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, of which he was elected an associate in 1936. During this period, he was living in the family council house on the Wren’s Nest. Despite his success at having his paintings included in prestigious exhibitions, few of them sold and his only significant income was from his teaching. He had no studio and often painted in his small bedroom. When World War II broke out in 1939, he enlisted in the Royal Navy, and trained at HMS Vernon while continuing to paint in his spare time. In May 1943, whilst stationed ashore at Roedean School in East Sussex, he was killed in a bombing raid while he was walking alone opposite Marine Gate in Brighton.. Work=General= Shakespeare's work after leaving art school concentrated on figure drawings and portraiture, this continued until he started on his Thirties at Leisure series in 1936. His major works outside this series included the following: * Portrait of Alan Young (1928) * Gwendoline Shakespeare (c1929) * Girl in Green Ball Gown (c1929) * Self Portrait in pencil (c1930) * Rasp Grinders (1932) * View from Artists Bedroom /The Window (?1932) * Miss Molly Betteridge (1932) * The Rendezvous (1932) * Isobel (1932) *A Mulatto (1933) *Self-portrait with Trilby (Mephistopheles) (1933) *Mrs Neil Jenkins (1933) * Seated Nude (1933) *Morning Exercise (1934) *On the Rhine (1935) *White Gloves (1936) *Boy and Dog (1937) *Girl with Daffodils (1937) *Tennis Player (c1938) *Schoolgirl (1938) Gwendoline Shakespeare (b.1917) - Percy Shakespeare.jpgGwendoline Shakespeare, 1929 Percy Shakespeare View from the artist's bedroom .jpg View from the artist's bedroom, ?1932 A_Mulatto_-_Percy_Shakespeare.jpgA Mulatto, 1933 Self Portrait (Mephistopheles) - Percy Shakespeare.jpgSelf Portrait (Mephistopheles), 1933 Mrs Nell Jenkins - Percy Shakespeare.jpg Mrs Neil Jenkins, 1933 Seated Nude (Summer) - Percy Shakespeare.jpg Seated nude, 1933 Percy_Shakespeare_Morning_exercise.jpgMorning Exercise, 1934 On_the_Rhine_- _Percy_Shakespeare.jpgOn the Rhine,1935 Boy and Dog - Percy Shakespeare.jpg Boy and Dog, 1937 Girl with Daffodils - Percy Shakespeare.jpg Girl with Daffodils, 1937 The_Tennis_Player_-_Percy_Shakespeare.jpgThe Tennis Player, c1938 Schoolgirl_-_Percy_Shakespeare.jpgSchoolgirl, 1938 =The Thirties at Leisure series= From 1936, Shakespeare embarked on a series of oil paintings showing groups of people at leisure. These compositions were the result of intense work with many preliminary drawings of the component figures. It has been noted that the drawings themselves are of considerable merit in their own right. He painted one or two of these compositions each year and submitted them to the Royal Academy and often they were accepted. They are remarkable in their colour and figure arrangements and together they present a fascinating picture of leisure activities in the period leading up the Second World War. This series included the following works: *The Bathing Party (1936) *Tennis (1937) *The Crooner (c 1938) *Afternoon at the Ice Rink (1938) *Seaside photographer (c1938) *Pavilion (at Dudley CC) (c1938) *The Team Race (c1938) *The Bird House (1939) *The Boat Shed (1939) *The Broads (1940) *Caravanners (1941) There were two other paintings made in Sussex during Shakespeare's war service with a tenuous relationship to this series: *December on the Downs (1942) *The Ante Room HMS Vernon (1942) The_Crooner_- _Percy_Shakespeare.jpgThe Crooner, c 1938 Afternoon_at_the_Ice_Rink_- _Percy_Shakespeare.jpgAfternoon at the Ice Rink, c1938 Tropical Bird House, Dudley Zoo - Percy Shakespeare.jpgThe Bird House, 1939 The Boat Shed - Percy Shakespeare.jpg The Boat Shed, 1939 December_on_the_Downs%2C_Wartime_- _Percy_Shakespeare.jpgDecember on the Downs, 1942 Legacy In an obituary, Ivo Shaw was quoted as saying: \\"He was the best painter in oils the School had produced\\". Many of the paintings he left behind are held at Dudley Museum and Art Gallery.

The front carriage hit the sides of a cut through a hillside twice, before breaking apart from the second impact. According to Croatian news reports, the cause of the derailment was slippery fire retardant that was just sprayed on a steep downhill section of the track, a normal practice in extreme summer heat but executed improperly using a new chemical. With brakes ineffective, the train gained a speed higher than the track configuration could handle and derailed.  Investigation  From the very beginning of the rescue operation, the initial investigation was focused on the fire retardant that was sprayed on the railroad approximately 10 minutes before the derailment. Investigators were suspicious about traction on the tracks because the rescue train, which was coincidentally the same railway service vehicle that supported spraying of the fire retardant, suffered a loss of braking and derailed at the same location as the passenger train, narrowly missing rescuers who were cleaning up the accident site. On 27 July 2009 a cleaning operation on the stretch of railroad between the stations Kaštel Stari and Labin Dalmatinski begun, but was stopped within an hour because of a new discovery important for the investigation. The cleaning teams followed the fire retardant supplier's directions and washed the tracks with hot water. However, the cleaning supervisor quickly noticed that while most of the retardant washed off, a yellow-brown film of an unknown slippery substance remained on the tracks. A sample of the substance was taken as evidence and sent to Zagreb for chemical analysis. According to the TG-300 retardant description, it is an \\"aqueous based resin liquid penetrate\\" but its exact composition is unpublished. Three days after this accident, the fire retardant manufacturer added a warning \\"do not spray on tracks\\" to their TG-300 web site.TG-300 web site  Aftermath  Police brought to the interview responsible people from the HŽ supply office as well as the responsible people from the company that had imported retardant. Director of HŽ Infrastructure, a company within HŽ Holding, and two of his associates were removed from their positions by the act of the Minister of Transport Božidar Kalmeta. Two people who played the most important role with purchase and application of the retardant were, by the order of new HŽ Infrastructure director, put on suspension and subsequently fired from the company.http://www.hznet.hr/iSite3/fgs.axd?id=3148 Sixteen of the total of 55 injured passengers had remained in treatment in the Split central hospital for several weeks. The driver, Josip Palinić was discharged after his physical injuries were treated, and was not charged with any wrongdoing by the police. Criminal charges were brought upon Ivan Medak, the chief of ecology of HŽ Infrastruktura, Drago Rogulj, chief of the fire department of HŽ Split, Ivan Tomašković, the director of Intrade, Jozo Bazina, Intrade employee, and Branko Tišljar, a fireman involved in the spreading of the fire retardant. Croatian police continued to investigate and reveal the circumstances of the obtainment as well as application of the fire retardant, prompting widespread consternation in the Croatian press and public regarding the state of management and mishandling of public tenders in the Croatian Railways. After recovering the wreckage from the site and needed track repair, the traffic was resumed on 2 August 2009 at 20:00 GMT for freight traffic only, while the scheduled passenger service resumed the day after on 3 August 2009 at 4:00 GMT. Trial On 13 April 2010 the County Attorney in Split indicted Ivan Medak, Ivan Tomašković, Jozo Bazina, Drago Rogulj and Branko Tišljar in court on criminal charges of premeditated general gross negligence with fatal consequences. In a May 2013 verdict, Medak and Bazina were sentenced to four and three years in prison respectively, and the rest of the defendants were acquitted.

Stud games are also typically non-positional games, meaning that the player who bets first on each round may change from round to round (it is usually the player whose face-up cards make the best hand for the game being played). The cards dealt face down to each individual player are called hole cards, which gave rise to the common English expression ace in the hole for any hidden advantage. History Stud poker variants using four cards were popular as of the American Revolutionary War. Five-card stud first appeared during the American Civil War when the game was much played among soldiers on both sides, and became very popular. Later, seven-card stud became more common, both in casinos and in home games.http://www.pagat.com/poker/variants/7stud.html These two games form the basis of most modern stud poker variations. Play The number of betting rounds in a game influences how well the game plays with different betting structures. Games with four or fewer betting rounds, such as five-card stud and Mississippi stud, play well with any structure, and are especially well suited to no limit and pot limit play. Games with more betting rounds are more suited to fixed limit or spread limit. It is common (and recommended) for later betting rounds to have higher limits than earlier ones. For example, a \\"$5/$10 Seven-card Stud\\" game in a Nevada casino allows $5 bets for the first two rounds and $10 bets for subsequent rounds. Also common is to make the final round even higher: a \\"$5/$10/$20\\" game would allow $20 bets on the last round only. Another common rule is to allow the larger bet on the second round if there is an \\"open pair\\" (that is, at least one player's upcards make a pair). Some casinos (typically in California) use the smaller limit on the first three rounds rather than just the first two. It is a common convention in stud poker to name the betting rounds after the number of cards each player holds when that betting round begins. So the bet that occurs when each player has three cards is called \\"third card\\" or \\"third street\\", while the bet that occurs when each player has five cards is \\"fifth street\\". The final round, regardless of the number of betting rounds, is commonly called the \\"river\\" or simply the \\"end\\". Specific variants As mentioned above, seven-card stud is probably the most common form of the game, with most other games being variants of that, although five-card stud is also a basic pattern upon which many variations are built. =Six-card stud= Six-card stud is usually played as identical to seven-card stud, except that the last face-up round is removed (thus it is two down, three up, one down). With Flip, the last card is dealt face-down, but one of the face-down cards must be flipped face-up. Six-card stud can also be played as 1-4-1, where the first betting round occurs after only two cards are dealt (one down and one up). This latter form more closely resembles five-card stud with an extra downcard. =Razz= Razz is a variant where the lowest hand wins the pot instead of the highest. Versions differ in the rules for treating straights and flushes as high or low. London Lowball is a popular version that counts straights against the player. =High-low stud= High-low stud is played using high-low split betting, where the pot is split between the player with the highest hand and the player with the lowest hand. In the most common form, known as \\"eight-or- better\\" or \\"stud eight\\", an 8-high hand or lower is required to win low. If there is no qualifying low hand, high hand takes the entire pot. Another form of high-low split stud is played under the same rules as stud eight, but there is no qualifier required for the low half of the pot. Often referred to as Q, it is much less common than stud eight, and is generally played at higher limits. =Mexican stud= Various forms of roll your own five-card stud, often with a stripped deck and wild cards, are called Mexican stud, Mexican poker, or stud loco. One such variant played by the Casino San Pablo in northern California has these rules: 8s, 9s, and 10s are stripped from the deck, and a single joker is added (the deck therefore contains 41 cards). The 7-spot and the J become consecutive, so that 5-6-7-J-Q is a straight. A flush beats a full house (with fewer cards of each suit, they are harder to get). The joker plays as a bug if it is face up, and fully wild if it is face down. The game is played as five-card stud choose-before roll your own. It is usually played with a very high ante, and the high card on the first round pays the bring-in. The game of Shifting sands is Mexican stud in which each player's hole card (and all others of that rank) are wild for that player only. =Caribbean stud= Caribbean Stud Poker is a casino game that has been developed using the poker hands and general rules of 5 card stud poker. The game combines poker elements and standard table game elements in that each player dealt into the hand is playing against the dealer. Originally invented by gambling author David Sklansky using the name Casino Holdem with some slight rule variations, the game was first introduced at the Grand Holiday Casino and eventually all the remaining hotels in Aruba in the 1980s. =Miscellaneous= *Five-card stud played high-low split with an added twist round is called Option alley or five-card option. *The game Scandinavian stud or Sökö is five-card stud with two new hand values added: Four-card flush and four-card straight. Hand ranking is therefore: High card, one pair, four-card straight, four-card flush, two pair and then on as usual. A four-card straightflush is not a hand in itself, it's merely counts as a four-card flush. *The term English stud is used ambiguously to refer to several games, including six-card stud played 1-4-1 with a twist (also called six-card option), London lowball, and a seven-card stud game where both sixth street and seventh street are twist rounds. *In the game of seven-card flip, each player is dealt four cards face down, and chooses two of them to turn up. All cards are turned up simultaneously after everyone has chosen. As this point, the game proceeds as if it were standard seven-card stud starting on fourth street. *Kentrel, or \\"48\\", is a seven-card stud variation which starts with each player being dealt four downcards. Each player must then discard one, choose one of the remaining three to turn face up (leaving two down and one up as normal), and then proceed as with eight-or-better high-low stud. *The game of Show Hand, which is not commonly played but made famous by Hong Kong gambling films, is a twist in 5 card stud. Players with the highest face up cards decide whether to check the round or raise; or, if the player with the highest face up card or hand checks, it will proceed to the next street. However, the last round of betting after the river is dealt is unlimited. In Show hand poker the last card is dealt face down. Players now choose from 1 of the 2 face down cards to reveal to other players. This variant is usually played with a set time-limit and bet limit to prevent players from taking advantage of checks and not betting to prolong the game. *The game of Chicago is seven-card stud in which the high hand splits the pot with the player who has the highest-ranking spade \\"in the hole\\" (among his downcards). There is also Little Chicago (also called Southside), in which the lowest ranking spade in the hole splits the pot; players who play Little Chicago call the high spade variant Big Chicago. This also known as Chicago high by night and Chicago low by night. In Chicago by night the Deuces and One-eyed jacks are usually called as wild cards. *The Bitch is a variant on Chicago above, played with a combination of up and down cards, usually two down, four up, and one down. The twist is that the Queen of Spades is designated as the highest ranking Spade, followed by the Ace, King, Jack, and so on. Also, if the Queen of Spades is ever dealt as an upcard to any player, all players turn in their cards, re-ante, and replay the game. This can lead to quickly increasing pots, especially if the re-ante amount is increased on each iteration. The high hand splits the pot with the high spade. *Several different games played only in low-stakes home games are called Baseball, and generally involve many wild cards (often 3s and 9s), paying the pot for wild cards, being dealt an extra upcard upon receiving a 4, and many other ad hoc rules (for example, the appearance of the queen of spades is called a \\"rainout\\" and ends the hand, or that either red 7 dealt face-up is a rainout, but if one player has both red 7s in the hole, that outranks everything, even a 5 of a kind). These same rules can be applied to no peek, in which case the game is called \\"night baseball\\". See main article: Baseball Poker. *Cowpie poker is played as seven- card stud until after the seventh-street bet. All remaining players then split their hands into a five-card hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must outrank the two-card hand, and the latter must contain at least one downcard. After the split there is one more betting round and showdown. Upon showdown, the highest five-card hand and the highest two-card hand split the pot. The name of the game is a pun on Pai Gow. *Number Nine is a variant of seven-card stud in which 9s are wild, and any two number cards that add up to 9 may make one wild card, at the player's option. Aces count as 1 for wild card purposes. The player is not obliged to make any wild cards, and can play cards that could make 9s at face value or as wild cards, at his option. Cards used to make wild cards may not figure in the resulting hand twice. The player cannot add three or more cards. Sometimes, 9s themselves are not wild, and wild cards can be made only by addition. *Dr Pepper is a stud variant where 10's, 2's, and 4's are wild (the name comes from one of the original Dr Pepper advertisements of the 1920s: \\"Drink a Bite to Eat at 10, 2, and 4 o'clock\\"). *Draft (or \\"socialist poker\\") is usually a variant of seven-card stud in which the second and subsequent upcard rounds are dealt this way: for each player remaining, one upcard is dealt to the center of the table (not to any specific player). The player with the worst showing hand gets to choose which of them he will take for his next upcard, then the player with the second-worst showing hand chooses his upcard from those left, and so on, until the player who previously had the best showing hand takes the remaining card. Then betting occurs as normal. In seven-card stud, this makes for three \\"draft\\" rounds (the first three cards are dealt normally, as is the final downcard). *Auction is a similar variation in which each upcard round (or possibly just those after the first) begins with an \\"auction\\" phase. Instead of dealing each player one upcard, the first card is dealt to the center and all players bid on it; the player who bids the highest amount places that amount into the pot, and then has the right to either keep the auction card as his own upcard, or designate another player who is required to take it as his. After the first card is auctioned off and placed, the remaining players are dealt a random upcard as usual, and betting proceeds as usual. This variation is commonly played as high-low split, so it is common for a player to \\"purchase\\" a high card to force it upon an opponent seeking low, for example. *Telesina is a stud variant which is played with a stripped \\"French\\" deck. The play follows most five card stud games except that after the fourth betting round a 6th community card called the vela card is placed in the center of the table. The vela card may be used by all players to improve their hand after which another round of betting occurs. The standard hand ranking applies with the slight difference in that a flush beats a full house because it is easier to get a full house than a flush. This is because instead of 13 cards per suit there are only 8 having the cards from 2-6 removed.

The Port of Manaus is an important commercial center for ocean-going vessels traveling the Amazon. In fact, it is the main transport hub for the entire upper Amazon basin. It imports beef from the hinterlands and exports hides and leather. Important industries in the Port of Manaus include manufacturing of soap, chemicals, electronics equipment as well as shipbuilding, brewing, and petroleum refining. Several mobile phone companies have manufacturing plants in the Port of Manaus, and other major electronics manufacturers have plants there. Major exports include Brazil nuts, chemicals, petroleum, electrical equipment, and forest products, and eco-tourism is an increasingly important source of income for the city. The recent discovery of petroleum in the area brings great promise of further wealth and commerce to the Port of Manaus. With so much industry and commerce, the Port of Manaus has become a sophisticated cosmopolitan center. Located next to the Amazon rainforest, it also attracts crowds of tourists who find a variety of land and boat trips into the jungle. Wildlife is plentiful, even within the city, and it is home to the pied tamarin, one of Brazil's most endangered primates. Tour boats take visitors to see the point where the black waters of the Rio Negro meet the Solimões River's brown waters, flowing together without mixing for nine kilometers. Tourists can find many hotels in the jungle where they can enjoy nature in comfort. History Europeans first settled the Port of Manaus by building a small fort in 1669. A Christian mission and small village called Villa de Barra grew up around the fort. In 1809 the town was called Barcelos. In 1850 it was renamed Manaos after a local Indian river tribe, and became the capital of the Rio Negro region and of the Amazonas province. The natural rubber industry brought an economic boom to the Amazon region that lasted from the late 19th century to about 1920. Manaus acquired magnificent houses and other buildings, including a dramatic opera house. The port's commerce began in that period with the need to ship rubber products downriver to the Atlantic Ocean. Manaus was one of the first cities in Brazil to have electricity. The Polish engineer Bronisław Rymkiewicz and his company began to improve port facilities in 1892. They added a customs house, a stone quay, storage, and floating wharves. Many of the buildings were ordered from Europe. Amazonas state Governor Silvério José Néri enforced processing of rubber in Amazonas, rather than shipping the raw rubber downstream to Pará to be processed for export. In June 1903 he inaugurated the Port of Manaus] operated by the Manaus Harbour limited company. He also funded new shipping lines serving various ports in the interior. When the rubber market collapsed in the 1920s, the Port of Manaus declined and did not recover until 1967 when it was made a duty-free zone. The city has been called Manaus from 1939. In the late 1970s, the area saw devastating deforestation as the Brazilian government and private interests exploited mineral and agricultural resources. Brazil's government built a fishing terminal in the Port of Manaus.

There are various styles of poker, all of which share an objective of presenting the least probable or highest-scoring hand. A poker hand is usually a configuration of five cards depending on the variant, either held entirely by a player or drawn partly from a number of shared, community cards. Players bet on their hands in a number of rounds as cards are drawn, employing various mathematical and intuitive strategies in an attempt to better opponents. Given the game's many different forms and various dynamics, poker strategy becomes a complex subject. This article attempts to introduce only the basic strategy concepts. The fundamental theorem of poker David Sklansky at the World Series of Poker The fundamental theorem of poker, introduced by David Sklansky, states: Every time you play your hand the way you would if you could see your opponents' cards, you gain, and every time your opponents play their cards differently from the way they would play them if they could see your cards, you gain. This theorem is the foundation for many poker strategy topics. For example, bluffing and slow-playing (explained below) are examples of using deception to induce your opponents to play differently from how they would if they could see your cards. There are some exceptions to the fundamental theorem in certain multi-way pot situations, as described in Morton's theorem. Learn for about a year before gambling anything then understand you have to rely on understanding your own experience or the extent of it before betting with larger sums more wisely. poker for dummies Pot odds, implied odds and poker probabilities The relationship between pot odds and odds of winning is one of the most important concepts in poker strategy. Pot odds are the ratio of the size of the pot to the size of the bet required to stay in the pot. For example, if a player must call $10 for a chance to win a $40 pot (not including their $10 call), their pot odds are 4-to-1. To have a positive expectation, a player's odds of winning must be better than their pot odds. If the player's odds of winning are also 4-to-1 (20% chance of winning), their expected return is to break even (on average, losing four times and winning once for every five times they play such a pot). Implied odds is a more complicated concept, though related to pot odds. The implied odds on a hand are based not on the money currently in the pot, but on the expected size of the pot at the end of the hand. When facing an even money situation (like the one described in the previous paragraph) and holding a strong drawing hand (say a Four flush) a skilled player will consider calling a bet or even opening based on their implied odds. This is particularly true in multi-way pots, where it is likely that one or more opponents will call all the way to showdown. Deception By employing deception, a poker player hopes to induce their opponent(s) to act differently from how they would if they could see their cards. David Sklansky has argued that winning at poker is often decided by how much one player can force another to change his/her style while successfully maintaining their own strategy. Bluffing is a form of deception where players bet strongly on a weak hand to induce opponents to fold superior hands. Related is the semi-bluff, in which a player who does not have a strong hand, but has a chance to improve it to a strong hand in later rounds, bets strongly on the hand in the hopes of inducing other players with weaker \\"made\\" hands to fold. Slow-playing is deceptive play in poker that is roughly the opposite of bluffing: checking or betting weakly with a strong holding, attempting to induce other players with weaker hands to call or raise the bet instead of folding, to increase the payout. Position A standard Texas hold 'em game with blinds Position refers to the order in which players are seated around the table and the strategic consequences of this. Generally, players in earlier position (who have to act first) need stronger hands to bet/raise or call than players in later position. For example, if there are five opponents yet to act behind a player, there is a greater chance one of the yet to act opponents will have a better hand than if there were only one opponent yet to act. Being in late position is an advantage because a player gets to see how their opponents in earlier position act (which provides the player more information about their hands than they have about his). This information, coupled with a low bet to a late player, may allow the player to \\"limp in\\" with a weaker hand when they would have folded the same hand if they'd had to act earlier. Position is one of the most vital elements to understand in order to be a long-term winning player. As a player's position improves, so too does the range of cards with which they can profitably enter a hand. Conversely this commonly held knowledge can be used to an intelligent poker player's advantage. If playing against observant opponents, then a raise with any two cards can 'steal the blinds,' if executed against passive players at the right time. Reasons to raise Unlike calling, raising has an extra way to win: opponents may fold. An opening bet may be considered a raise from a strategy perspective. David Sklansky gives seven reasons for raising, summarized below. * To get more money in the pot when a player has the best hand: If a player has the best hand, raising for value enables them to win a bigger pot. * To drive out opponents when a player has the best hand: If a player has a made hand, raising may protect their hand by driving out opponents with drawing hands who may otherwise improve to a better hand. * To bluff A player raises with an inferior or \\"trash\\" hand attempts to deceive other players about the strength of their hand, and hopefully induce a better hand to fold. * To semi- bluff A player with a drawing hand may raise both to bluff and for value. While technically still a bluff, as the player may not end up with a made hand and is primarily trying to drive out players, the player still has the opportunity to make his or her hand and win the pot if the bluff is called. * To block Players on drawing hands may put out a \\"blocking bet\\" against players who are likely to bet when checked to, but unlikely to raise when bet into. This is a small bet made on a drawing hand to lessen the likelihood of having to call a larger bet from a player in late position. * To get a free card: If a player raises with a drawing hand, their opponent may call the bet and check to them on the next betting round, giving them a chance to get a free card to improve their hand. * To gain information: If a player raises with an uncertain hand, they gain information about the strength of their opponent's hand if they are called. Players may use an opening bet on a later betting round (probe or continuation bets) to gain information by being called or raised (or may win the pot immediately). * To drive out worse hands when a player's own hand may be second best: A combination protection and probe raise, a player with a strong hand but not the \\"nuts\\" (the hole cards that make the best possible hand given the current face-up cards) may raise, both to induce drawing hands that may improve to the \\"nut hand\\" to fold, while also testing to see if another player has the \\"nuts\\". * To drive out better hands when a drawing hand bets: If an opponent with an apparent drawing hand has bet before the player to act, if the player raises, opponents behind them who may have a better hand may fold rather than call two bets \\"cold\\". This is a form of isolation play, and has elements of blocking and protection. Reasons to call There are several reasons for calling a bet or raise, summarized below. * To see more cards: With a drawing hand, a player may be receiving the correct pot odds with the call to see more cards. * To limit loss in equity: Calling may be appropriate when a player has adequate pot odds to call but will lose equity on additional money contributed to the pot with a raise. * To avoid a re-raise: Only calling (and not raising) denies the original bettor the option of re-raising. However, this is only completely safe in case the player is last to act (i.e. \\"closing the action\\"). * To conceal the strength of a player's hand: If a player has a very strong hand, they might smooth call on an early betting round to avoid giving away the strength of their hand on the hope of getting more money into the pot in later betting rounds. * To manipulate pot odds: By calling (not raising), a player offers any opponents yet to act behind them more favorable pot odds to also call. For example, if a player has a very strong hand, a smooth call may encourage opponents behind them to overcall or even raise, building the pot. Particularly in limit games, building the pot in an earlier betting round may induce opponents to call future bets in later betting rounds because of the pot odds they will be receiving. * To set up a bluff on a later betting round: Sometimes referred to as a long-ball bluff, calling on an earlier betting round can set up a bluff (or semi-bluff) on a later betting round. For instance, a player with a strong initial hand may call instead of raise to see the flop cheaply. That flop may not benefit the player, but the player may still have many \\"outs\\" (cards left to deal that could make a strong hand), or even if the odds are slim they can try to bluff. By raising, this scenario may appear to an opponent like a player who has \\"limped in\\" with a weak initial hand, but after the flop now has a strong made or drawing hand. A recent online term for \\"long-ball bluffing\\" is floating. Gap concept The gap concept states that a player needs a better hand to play against someone who has already opened (or raised) the betting than he would need to open himself. The gap concept reflects that players prefer to avoid confrontations with other players who have already indicated strength, and that calling only has one way to win (by having the best hand), whereas opening may also win immediately if your opponent(s) fold. Sandwich effect Related to the gap effect, the sandwich effect states that a player needs a stronger hand to stay in a pot when there are opponents yet to act behind him. Because the player does not know how many opponents will be involved in the pot or whether he will have to call a re-raise, he does not know what his effective pot odds actually are. Therefore, a stronger hand is desired as compensation for this uncertainty. A squeeze play exploits this principle. Loose/tight play Loose players play relatively more hands and tend to continue with weaker hands; hence they do not often fold. Tight players play relatively fewer hands and tend not to continue with weaker hands; hence they often fold. The following concepts are applicable in loose games (and their inverse in tight games): * Bluffs and semi-bluffs are less effective because loose opponents are less likely to fold. * Requirements for continuing with made hands may be lower because loose players may also be playing lower value hands. * Drawing to incomplete hands, like flushes, tends to be more valuable as draws will often get favorable pot odds and a stronger hand (rather than merely one pair) is often required to win in multi-way pots. Aggressive/passive play Aggressive play refers to betting and raising. Passive play refers to checking and calling. Unless passive play is being used deceptively as mentioned above, aggressive play is generally considered stronger than passive play because of the bluff value of bets and raises and because it offers more opportunities for your opponents to make mistakes. Hand reading, tells and leveling Hand reading is the process of making educated guesses about the possible cards an opponent may hold, based on the sequence of actions in the pot. The term 'hand reading' is actually a misnomer, as skilled players do not attempt to assign a player to an exact hand. Rather they attempt to narrow the possibilities down to a range of probable hands based on the past actions of their opponent, during both the current hand and previous hands played by this opponent. Tells are detectable changes in opponents' behavior or demeanor which provide clues about their hands or their intentions. Educated guesses about opponents' cards and intentions can help a player avoid mistakes in his own play, induce mistakes by the opponents, or influence the opponents to take actions that they would not normally take under the circumstances. For example, a tell might suggest that an opponent has missed a draw, so a player seeing it may decide a bluff would be more effective than usual. Leveling or multiple level thinking is accounting for what the other opponents think about the hands. This information can then be used to the player's advantage. Some players might be able to make educated guesses about opponents' hands; this could be seen as the first level. The second level could be thought of as the combination of the first level and deducing what the opponents think the player's hand may be. Skilled players can adjust their game play to be on a higher level than that of less skilled opponents. Table image and opponent profiling By observing the tendencies and patterns of one's opponents, one can make more educated guesses about others' potential holdings. For example, if a player has been playing extremely tightly (playing very few hands), then when he/she finally enters a pot, one may surmise that he/she has stronger than average cards. One's table image is the perception by one's opponents of one's own pattern of play. A player can leverage their table image by playing out of character, and thereby inducing his/her opponents to misjudge his/her hand and make a mistake. In live poker, as opposed to internet, stereotypes are often used for initial 'reads'. For instance, people of retirement age are often witnessed to play tight. Players will often project this image on unknown people of retirement age. Young people wearing headphones and hoodies are often witnessed to play more aggressively and mathematically if they played a lot of winning internet poker. These stereotypes can often be good bases to start a profile. Often, there is a rather small pool of players in a given card playing venue. People will carry their history of playing with them in these environments. Internet poker players can use large databases of hand histories to get a more precise player profile. Statistical information about opponents is displayed on the tables in the form of a heads up display. The most commonly used software is PokerTracker and Hold'em Manager. Equity Players' equity in a pot is their expected share of the pot, expressed either as a percentage (probability of winning) or expected value (amount of pot * probability of winning). Negative equity, or loss in equity, occurs when contributing to a pot with a probability of winning less than 1 / (number of opponents matching the contribution+1). :Example :Alice contributes $12 to a pot and is matched by two other opponents. Alice's $12 contribution \\"bought\\" the chance to win $36. If Alice's probability of winning is 50%, her equity in the $36 pot is $18 (a gain in equity because her $12 is now \\"worth\\" $18). If her probability of winning is only 10%, Alice loses equity because her $12 is now only \\"worth\\" $3.60 (amount of pot * probability of winning). :Texas hold 'em example :Alice holds J♦8♠. Bob holds K♥7♠. After the flop, the board is 5♥6♥7♦. If both hands are played to a showdown, Alice has a 45% chance to win (which she is unaware of, because she does not know what hand Bob holds), Bob has a 53% chance to win and there is a 2% chance to split the pot. The pot currently has $51. Alice goes all-in for $45 reasoning that she can take the pot immediately if Bob folds or that Bob calls with a worse hand. Bob's simple pot odds for the call are also 32%; since his equity of 53% is greater than the pot odds he has to call, Bob has a positive expected value for the call (if he knew Alice's hole cards). Short-handed considerations When playing short-handed (at a table with 3-6 players), players must loosen up their play (play more hands) for several reasons: * There is less likelihood of another player having a strong hand because there are fewer players. * Each player's share of the forced bets increases because there are fewer players contributing to the forced bets, thus waiting for premium hands becomes more expensive. This type of situation comes up most often in tournament style play. In a cash game, the adjustments are very similar, but not quite as drastic as the table can ask for what is known as a 'rake break.' A rake break occurs when the floor-man, who represents the casino, agrees to take a smaller portion than usual for the hand. For example, a random casino might normally receive 10% of the pot up to 5 dollars for a 'rake.' In this case the table would only owe 10% up to 3 dollars until there are a sufficient number of players again. In online poker rake breaks are determined automatically. Structure considerations The blinds and antes and limit structure of the game have a significant influence on poker strategy. For example, it is easier to manipulate pot odds in no-limit and pot-limit games than in limit games. In tournaments, as the size of the forced bets relative to the chip stacks grows, pressure is placed on players to play pots to avoid being anted/blinded away. Mindset considerations In 2014, Bwin conducted a study to see what makes a professional poker player. The brain activity of poker players, of varying degrees, was monitored using EEG headsets and visualised into brain maps.Your Brain on Poker Leading sports psychologist, James Hazlett, then interpreted the findings: * More experienced players showed higher levels of focus and concentration throughout the game. * The amateur players had less control over their emotions, and were prone to allowing negative emotions, such as frustration, distract them. * Whilst opponents were taking their turn, the expert players opened up another table or watched replays of hands they had played poorly to improve. * The brain maps showed that the professional players were led more by logic and intuition. The conclusions of the study suggest that poker players can improve their strategy by considering their mindset. Mental training techniques, commonly used by athletes, could therefore help to improve performance by working on elements such as self- control and concentration.

All the basic amenities are present at a commutable distance. History Sekha used to be a cluster of 22 villages called 'Bahia' (in Punjabi meaning composed of twenty-two entities). The people living here were of Sidhu clan. Once Guru Teg Bahadur ji, the ninth Sikh Guru, arrived in the 'Bahia' during his Malwa Visit. But the ruler of 'Bahia' refused to give the Guru a piece of land to live on for few days. The ruler asked the Guru to leave the place. Guru Teg Bahadur got angry and cursed the 'Bahia' by saying \\"Bahia Hoju Thehia\\"(Punjabi: ਬਾਹੀਆ ਹੋਜੂ ਥੇਹਿਆ) meaning- \\"Bahia will collapse into a heap\\" Due to his curse the whole of Bahia turned into a heap of debris. This The (Punjabi: ਥੇਹ) still exists to the west of the main village and the place where Guru Teg Bahadur ji meditated has been turned into a beautiful Gurudwara named 'Gurudwara Patshahi Naumi, Sekha'. Every year on 22 Poh(Punjabi Calendar) i.e. in early January a three-day fair is held in the village in remembrance of the Coming of Guru Teg Bahadur ji to the village.

The descriptions below assume the reader is familiar with the general game play of poker, and with hand values (both high and low variations). They also make no assumptions about what betting structure is used. In home games, it is typical to use an ante, and betting always begins with the player to the dealer's left. In casino play, it is more common to use blinds; the first betting round thus begins with the player to the left of the big blind, and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left, thus draw games are very positional. Some sample deals below will assume that a game is being played by four players: Alice, who is dealing in the examples, Bob, who is sitting to her left, Carol to his left, and David to Carol's left. Standard five-card draw This is often the first poker variant learned by most players, and is very common in home games although it is now quite rare in casino and tournament play. Two to eight players can play. Other draw games=Gardena jackpots (\\"Jacks to open\\" or simply \\"Jackpots\\")= Played as above, with standard hand values, and with a single joker in the deck acting as a bug. It is always played with an ante and no blinds. On the first betting round, no player is allowed to open the betting unless their hand already contains a pair of jacks or a better hand. Other players who checked on the first round may subsequently call or raise if someone else opens. If no player opens, a new deal begins and everyone antes again into the same pot. The player who opened the betting keeps their discarded cards near them on the table so that they can prove, if necessary, that they had a sufficient opening hand. For example, a player with the K, J, 9, and 7 of clubs and the J of hearts has a pair of jacks and may open. They may wish to \\"break openers\\" in this case by discarding the jack of hearts in an attempt to make the club flush, so they keep the discarded jack to prove that they were entitled to open. In addition to the opening requirement, no one is allowed to win a pot with less than three of a kind. In the event no one makes the winning requirement, the pot is moved on to the next hand. The strongest possible hand in this game is five aces which is achieved if the player obtains the four aces plus the joker (joker counts as an ace if there's neither a straight nor a flush to complete). This can result in some enormous pots, and is where the term 'Jackpot' comes from. The game is named after the city of Gardena, California, where this game was especially popular from the 1930s to 1970s (though it was always secondary to lowball). At that time, there were more public poker tables in that small city than in all the rest of the United States. Public poker rooms are still a big industry there, though Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and other locations now have many more poker rooms than they did at that time. Because \\"Jacks to open\\" was the primary form of high-hand draw poker played there, traditional draw poker was often described by the retronym \\"Guts to open\\". In home games, it is common that when a deal is \\"passed out\\" (that is, when no one opens), the players re-ante, and the qualifier to open is raised to a pair of queens. If that deal is passed out, the qualifier is raised to kings, and finally to aces. This is called \\"progressive\\" jackpots. =California lowball= This was the primary poker game played in California during the heyday of Gardena in the 1970s. It is still played today, though its popularity has somewhat lessened since the introduction of stud poker and community card poker to the state. Played as above, using ace-to-five low hand values, with a single joker in the deck. Always played with blinds rather than antes, so players may not check on the first betting round (but may on the second round). A player with a 7-high hand or better who checks after the draw forfeits his right to win any money placed in the pot after the draw. (In other words, a \\"seven\\" may not be checked unless the player intends to fold when another player bets). Another common rule in low-limit games is that a player who checks on the second betting round may not subsequently raise on that round. This latter rule is never used in games with a pot limit or no limit betting structure. =Kansas City lowball= Five-card draw, with no joker, and deuce-to-seven low hand values is called \\"Kansas City\\" or \\"Low Poker\\" or even \\"Billy Baxter\\" draw in honor of the player who dominated the world championship in the event for many years. Often the game is played no-limit. The 7-high rule and the no check-and-raise rule do not apply. In the eastern United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, ace-to-six low hand values are common. =Double-draw and Triple- draw= Any game above can be played with two or three draw phases and therefore three or four betting rounds. Triple draw lowball, either ace-to- five or deuce-to-seven, has gained some popularity among serious players. The 2004 World Series of Poker included a deuce-to-seven triple-draw lowball event, and each WSOP from 2007 on has featured one event as well. The Poker Player's Championship, which was introduced in 2010 as the replacement for the $50,000 buy-in HORSE tournament that had been in every WSOP since 2006, includes 2–7 triple-draw lowball as one of its rotating games. =Badugi= Sometimes spelled as Padooki or Badougi, Badugi is a four-card ace-to-five low lowball variant where traditional poker hand rankings are changed. A Badugi is a four-card hand where all the cards are of different ranks and suits. Any card which match another card in rank or suit does not play and the first criterion for evaluating hands is the number of cards which are playing. The following is the ranking of several example of hands from best to worst: #Ace of spades, 2 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 4 of diamonds: 4-card 4-high best possible Badugi #4 of spades, 6 of hearts, 8 of diamonds, J of clubs: 4-card J-high Badugi #Ten of clubs, J of hearts, Q of diamonds, K of spades: 4-card worst possible Badugi #Ace of hearts, Ace of diamonds, 4 of clubs, 5 of spades: 3-card hand, 5-high #Ace of clubs, Ace of spades, 4 of spades, 6 of spades: 2-card hand, 4-high #Four kings: 1-card hand, worst possible hand Badugi is usually played triple-draw, with a 1-1-2-2 betting structure, although it is sometimes played in pot limit or 1/2 pot limit structures. =Baduci= Not to be confused with Badugi, Baduci is a lowball hybrid of Badugi and deuce-to- seven triple draw low. This game has a split pot, one half for the strongest Badugi hand and the other half for the best deuce-to-seven triple draw hand. Players are essentially trying to form two different sets of hands by using five cards with a goal of winning both halves of the pot in the same hand. =California high/low split= Played as above, with a single joker, used as a bug. High hand and low hand (using the ace-to-five low values) split the pot. An 8-high or better low is required to win low. If no hand qualifies for low, the high hand takes the whole pot. Played cards speak, that is, players do not declare whether they intend to win the high or low half of the pot (or both); they simply show their cards and the best hands win. Because ace-to- five low values are used, a hand such as a low straight or flush can win both high and low, called \\"scooping\\" or \\"hogging\\" the pot. =High/low with declare= This is common in home games but is rarely found in casinos today. Played as are other versions of five-card draw, but after the second betting round and before the showdown, there is a simultaneous declaration phase. Each player takes two chips from his stack and takes them under the table, bringing up a closed fist that contains either no chips (indicating that the player intends to win the low half of the pot), one chip (indicating that the player intends to win the high half), or two chips (indicating that he intends to scoop). When everyone has brought up the closed fist, the players all open their hands simultaneously to reveal their choices. If any player shows two chips, and his hand is the best low and the best high, he scoops the pot. Otherwise, half of the pot goes to the player with the highest hand who declared high, and the other half to the player with the lowest hand of those who declared low. There is no qualifying hand to win either high or low, and if no one declares in one direction, the full pot is awarded in the other (for example, if all players declare low, the low hand wins the whole pot rather than half). A player who declares for a scoop must win both ends outright, with no ties. For example, if a player declares scoop, has the lowest hand clearly but ties for high, he wins nothing. The other player with the same high hand wins the high half of the pot and the next-lowest hand wins low (assuming he declared low—if no other player declared low, the high hand who declared high wins the whole pot). This game can be played with deuce-to-seven low or ace-to-six low hand values, but in that case it is nearly impossible to scoop (though the whole pot could still be won if everyone declares the same direction). =Four-before= Another variation that can be applied to any game above, but that is especially suited to lowball. On the initial deal, only four cards are dealt to each player. A betting round follows, then each player draws one more card than he discards, completing his hand to five cards. Then the final betting round and showdown. Note that it is impossible to be dealt a \\"pat\\" hand, that is, a hand (such as a straight or flush) that is complete before the draw. =Johnson (and \\"Jacks back\\")= Played with one joker which acts as a bug. Must be played with antes and no blinds. Each player is dealt five cards. The first betting round begins with the player to the dealer's left, who may check or open with anything. If any player opens, the game continues as traditional five-card draw poker. If the first round is passed out (that is, no one opens), then the player to the dealer's left may now open if he chooses, but the game has switched to California lowball. On the rare occasion that the deal is passed out yet again, players re-ante and deal again. This game plays well head-up (that is, with only two players). When the game is played that a pair of jacks or better is required to open on the first high-hand round, the game is called \\"Jacks back\\". =Q-Ball= This is a lowball game designed by Michael Wiesenberg that combines some of the variations mentioned above. It is generally played with three blinds—one unit from the dealer, one unit to his left, and two units for the second player to the dealer's left. The deck contains one joker. Each player is dealt three cards, followed by a round of betting beginning with the player immediately after the big blind who may call the big blind, raise, or fold (there is no checking on the first round). Next, each player is dealt a fourth card, followed by a second round of betting starting with the still-active player to the dealer's left. No checking is allowed on this round either, despite the fact that there is no bet facing the first player; the first player must open or fold. Each player is then dealt a fifth card, followed by a third betting round beginning on the dealer's left. At this point, checking is allowed. Finally, each player draws as in normal draw poker, followed by a fourth betting round and showdown. Ace-to-five low values are used. Played at fixed limit, it is recommended that the betting structure be 1-2-2-4; that is, the second and third betting rounds should allow a bet of twice the amount of the first round, and the final bet should allow four times the amount of the first round. \\"Home\\" games These are somewhat less-serious games that are typically played only in home games at small stakes. This does not necessarily mean that there is less opportunity for skillful play, just that the games are seen as more social than competitive. To help grow the betting pot in a home game, one can add a variant known as the \\"kill card\\" to the rules. Kill cards work best with stud games or shared card games as no one player can control when the \\"kill card\\" is played. =Shotgun (\\"Roll 'em out\\" and \\"Skinny Minnie\\")= This is a draw game that plays much like a stud game. First five cards are dealt to each player, followed by a betting round, and a draw. Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a rollout phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves. Each player's top card is now revealed, followed by a betting round. Then each player reveals his next card, followed by a betting round. Then a third card is revealed, followed by a betting round, a fourth card, a betting round, and finally a showdown. Players may not change the order of their cards at any time during the rollout phase. This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at high-low split, in which case it is called \\"Skinny Minnie\\". =Spit in the ocean= This might be classified as a hybrid draw/Community card game, but it is placed here because it plays mostly as a draw game. On the initial deal, each player is dealt four cards, and then a single card is dealt to the center of the table face up. This card plays as if it were the fifth card in every player's hand. It is also a wild card, and every other card of its rank is also wild. The first betting round is then played, followed by a draw in which each player replaces cards from his hand with an equal number, so that each player still has only four cards in hand. A final betting round is followed by a showdown. High-hand values are used. (An alternative is to deal similar to a regular draw poker hand, during which any player can shout \\"Spit!\\", whereupon the next card is dealt face up, after which dealing resumes until all players have five cards. In some variants, only the \\"spit\\" card can be used as a wild card.) Here's a sample deal: Alice deals four cards to each player, then deals the next card face up to the center of the table. it is the 6 of diamonds, and this makes all 6-spot cards wild. Bob opens for $1, Carol raises to $2, David folds, Alice and Bob call. Bob discards two cards, and receives two replacements. Carol draws one card, and Alice draws one. Bob checks, Carol bets $2, Alice raises to $4, Bob folds, Carol reraises to $6, and Alice calls. The cards in Carol's hand are Q-Q-6-4. Because the 6 in her hand and the one on the board are wild, her hand is four queens. Alice's hand contains K-J-9-7, all spades. With the shared wild card, this gives her a flush, which loses to Carol's four queens. The game is mentioned in the Ray Stevens song \\"Shriner's Convention\\". =Anaconda (\\"Pass the trash\\")= Seven cards are dealt to each player. Before the first betting round, each player examines his hand, and removes exactly three cards from his hand and places them on the table to his left. After each person has thus discarded, he picks up the cards discarded by his right-hand neighbor and places them in his hand (thus, each player will have given three cards to his left-hand neighbor). It is important that each player discard before looking at the cards he is to receive. After the first pass, there is a betting round. Then a second pass occurs, each player passing two cards to his right. A second betting round is followed by a third pass, each player passing one card to his left. Finally, a third betting round and a showdown, in which the player with the best five-card high hand he can make out of the seven in his hand wins the pot. In some casual games, the showdown is replaced by a rollout phase, as described above in \\"Shotgun\\". This makes a total of eight betting rounds in the game, which generally destroys any chance for skillful play in the later rounds. Ad hoc variants Any of the above games can be modified in many ways upon player whim, by designating additional wild cards, betting rounds, more or fewer cards, altered hand values, and any other change agreed upon by all players prior to each deal. Such a game can be announced by using the name of an existing game and specifying the variations, for example \\"Three-card Triple-draw California lowball, Kings wild\\". Many times this will result in a game that does not play well, but occasionally will produce a game that is well-suited to a particular group of players. Here are some general guidelines: * If designating some normal suited cards as wild, it is advisable to choose cards that would otherwise be bad for the game being played. For example, deuces wild for high-hand games, kings wild for lowball, 9-spots wild for high-low split (where an 8-high or lower is necessary to win low). * High- low split games play best with more than four players. * When playing high-low split, it is necessary to have either a declaration phase or a qualifier (but not both). The most common form is 8-high or better to qualify low, but also common is any pair/no pair (that is, a pair or better is required to win high, and no pair or better low is required to win low), and 9-high for low. * Designating more than four wild cards (or possibly six) will result in considerable confusion and many ties. * Two to five betting rounds makes a good game. One round or more than five rounds reduces the amount of skill involved. * Sometimes there is no betting round before the draw; players pick up their cards, discard and draw, and then the betting starts. * Giving each player more than eight or nine cards can often make a bad game. In Anaconda, each player will have seen up to thirteen cards.

This was the railway company that operated for the longest period of time in the country (from 1838 to 1947) and covered a large geographical area that included big cities such as London, industrialised areas including the West Midlands, areas of coal and mineral mining such as South Wales, and Somerset and other important agricultural districts. In 1902 the company owned 59,036 wagons, and by 1926 this had risen to 88,580. The first wagons were just open boxes but covered vans were added from the 1860s and a wide range of special wagons were eventually built to handle many specialised traffics. Towards the end of its existence these were all painted in a grey livery, but before that both black and red had been used at different times. Design development Most early vehicles were open wagons with four wheels, although a few six-wheeled vehicles were provided for special loads. Covered vans followed, initially for carrying cattle but later for any kind of goods that needed to be protected from the weather during transit. The first bogie wagons appeared in 1873 for heavy loads, but bogie coal wagons were built in 1904 following on from the large four-wheeled coal wagons that had first appeared in 1898. Rated at , these had been twice the size of typical wagons of the period, but it was not until 1923 that the company invested heavily in coal wagons of this size and the infrastructure necessary for unloading them at the railway-owned docks; these were known as \\"Felix Pole\\" wagons after the GWR's General Manager who promoted their use. Container wagons appeared in 1931 and special motor car vans in 1933. Indeed, special wagons were built for many different commodities such as gunpowder, china clay, motor cars, boilers, long girders, sheets of glass, cattle, fruit and fish. When the GWR was opened no trains were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to individual wagons and trains conveyed brake vans where guards had control of screw-operated brakes. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and some general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed the majority of the fleet on 1 January 1948 when the railway was nationalised to become a part of British Railways. In common with most other British railways, goods trains were coupled together by a large three-link chain between sprung hooks on each wagon. Some vacuum-braked wagons were fitted with screw couplings which could be tightened so that wagons did not bounce back and forwards on their buffers, in which the middle link of the coupling was a threaded bar with a handle to rotate it. More common on GWR wagons was an instanter coupling, in which the middle link was specially shaped so that they could be shortened when in vacuum-fitted trains. Livery Wagons were painted brown in the early years of the GWR, but this changed to red before the end of the broad gauge in 1892. A dark grey livery was introduced about 1904 and continued to be used until 1947. The owner of the wagon was identified by 'G.W.R' painted in small letters on the underframe or bottom plank of the body. When wagons were painted red many were fitted with cast iron plates instead. From 1904 the initials changed to a large () painted 'GW' which was reduced to just in 1920. About 1937 the design returned to just a small 'GW' painted just above the wagon’s number. Types of wagons=Opens= O13 open with end doors The earliest wagons were of an open type, essentially a four-sided box with a drop-down door in each side carried on four or sometimes six wheels. Those with just one or two side planks and an 8 ton capacity were built until 1872 by which time 9 ton, four- wheel, three-plank wagons were being constructed. 1886 saw the introduction of four-plank wagons which were rated to carry 10 tons but a few longer ones ( instead of the usual ) were rated at 12 tons. Five-plank wagons were standard construction from 1902 but from just two years later all new open wagons were built with seven planks.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 13 Many early wagons were built with semi-circular raised ends that could support a tarpaulin cover or 'tilt'. From 1902 a number of open wagons were instead constructed with a longitudinal bar above the middle of the wagon and fixed to a pivot at each end. This was able to support a tarpaulin, or 'sheet' as they were by now known. An experimental bogie open, coded 'Tourn', was built in 1889. long, it was two-planks high but soon raised to four planks and rated to carry 25 tons. From 1925 the standard wagon length for four-wheeled wagons was increased to to meet Railway Clearing House standards. A number of longer wagons were constructed for special traffics such as metal tubes or lengths of timber and given the telegraphic code 'Tube C'. The first of these, built in 1907, were long and rated at 14 tons; from 1945 they were long and could carry 21 tons. Specific wagons were built for special traffics, including diagrams O12 and O13 with end doors that allowed china clay to be unloaded into ships by tipping the whole wagon. Diagram O25 were built with hopper discharge in the floor for grain traffic, while O27 had strengthened underframes for their heavy tinplate traffic. Diagrams N23, N24, N31 and N32 were large 20 ton iron opens built for coal traffic, many of which were hired to specific collieries or coal merchants at cheap rates as these were more efficient for the railway to haul than the 12 ton wooden vehicles that these businesses generally owned and operated themselves at the time.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 12 'Tadpole' wagons were long open wagons that could be operated at passenger train speeds to carry fish. Some of these were rebuilt on former broad gauge coach chassis.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 17 =Vans= Early wagons were always open at the top, but from the 1860s covered vans were built in ever increasing numbers. These 'Mink' vans were initially constructed from wood, but between 1886 and 1902 iron was used instead and more than 4,000 such vehicles were built. Most were rated at 9 or 10 tons, but some bogie vans rated at 30 tons were also built in 1902 and 1911. These were identified by the 'Mink F' telegraphic code.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 20 Construction of wooden-bodied vans resumed in 1902, but unlike the vans with wooden body frames of forty years earlier, these were built using iron angle section frames. Standard 'Minks' built in 1902 were long and high inside. The height was increased on new vans built during the next few years, first by a little over , then again to just over , but it eventually settled on the middle height. Ventilators which could be closed by shutters were fitted in some vans (code 'Mink A') but these later became hooded vents. Up until 1921 four- wheeled vans were generally rated at 10 tons, but improvements then allowed this to be increased to 12 tons. From 1927 vans were built to a length. Larger vans continued to be produced, first of all long ('Mink B', or 'Mink C' with ventilators), and then ('Mink D' with ventilators). These were only rated at 10 tons, but in 1931 long 20 ton vans were built ('Mink G'). Vans for special loads included shock-absorbing vans with the body anchored to the underframe by springs (diagrams V27 and V28) and grain hoppers (V20). Perishable traffic was carried in 'Mica' ventilated (X1) and 'Mica A' or 'Mica B' refrigerated (X2 etc.) meat vans,Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 22 'Bloater' fish vans (S6 etc.), or fruit vans with extra ventilation (although banana vans were fitted with heating equipment to help ripen their loads). Motor cars were loaded through doors in the ends of 'Asmo', 'Damo' and 'Mogo' vans (G24-G32, G43), also the bogie 'Bocar' (G33-G38, G44, G45).Atkins, AG et al.

From the 1880s, the milk was delivered direct from the farmer to the local railway station in milk churns. So to remove the need for moving unprocessed milk from one container to another, and hence potential cross contamination or need to install hygienic washing facilities, the decision was taken to transport the milk churns. From the 1880s, the GWR had introduced the GWR Siphon series of passenger carriage chassis-based high-speed and ventilated enclosed wagons, but with volumes rising and production systems changing, the transport system had to change. Introduced from 1926, Milk Tank Wagons were initially built on two-axle GWR chassis, and from 1936 on three-axle. The glass-lined tank which carried the milk was supplied and owned by the dairy firm. Typically weighing when loaded with of milk product, it resulted in a wagon that was as heavy as an express passenger coach. Formed into specialised milk trains, to reduce time delays to market they were hauled by topline express locomotives, including Kings, Castles and Halls, unlike the similarly heavy coal trains.http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/gansg/7-fops/fo-milk.htm =Flat and well wagons= J28 Macaw B There were a large number of different types of wagons for carrying large loads, but many were only built in small numbers, each given a telegraphic code with an additional letter to distinguish the particular dimensions of the wagon concerned. 'Beavers' were flat wagons, including many six-wheeled types and the bogie version known as a 'Beaver D'. From 1931 specialised flat wagons known as 'Conflats' were built with special fittings to carry containerised goods. These were all in the H-series of diagrams.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 7 The J-series was for bolster wagons, which means that loads were carried on raised wooden baulks or 'bolsters' and generally had movable stakes at either end of each bolster to prevent loads sliding off the side of the wagon. Most of these were given 'Macaw' telegraphic codes but there were also a few given 'Beaver' or 'Gane' names. For example, , 30 ton bogie vehicles were coded 'Macaw B' but vehicles rated at 40 tons to carry rails for the company’s use were coded 'Gane A'. 'Mite's were permanently coupled pairs of single bolster wagons on diagram J9.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 8 'Crocodiles' were boiler trucks (later known as trolleys) that had the body dropped down between the wheels to increase the available load height. These were given diagram numbers in the C series if loads had to be lifted in by crane, or F if a slope allowed loads such as steam rollers to be driven into the well of the body. Well wagons with angled trestles for carrying wide, flat loads were known as 'Hydra'. Similar but more lightly constructed vehicles for carrying ordinary carts, lorries and motor cars were coded 'Loriot' or 'Serpent'.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 3 =Specialised wagons= Four A6 Pollens The railway needed a number of specialised vehicles to carry traffic that could not be easily or safely carried by the standard open, covered or flat wagons. These included strong wagons for metal ingots, etc. ('Totems', diagram B1 etc.);Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 2 special well wagons for glass sheets ('Coral', D1 and D2)Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 4 and propellers ('Morel' and 'Aero', E1 etc.).Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 5 'Pollens' (A1 etc.) were low single- ended wagons for exceptionally long items such as boilers and girders; they worked in pairs but some could be uncoupled and then one attached to each end of an exceptionally long load, similar to a Schnabel car.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 1 Cattle wagons had a large gap between the top of the sides and the roof, but the ends were similar to vans in that they went right up to the roof. These were for a while built as 'small', 'medium' or 'large' sizes. Later construction was all to the large size but with a moveable partition that could reduce the capacity if that was what a farmer required; if cattle were left with too much space they would hurt themselves if they fell over when the train was in motion. Cattle wagons were given the telegraphic code 'Mex' for ordinary beasts and 'Beetle' for pedigree cattle that needed to be accompanied by a drover, and could be found in diagrams W1 to W14.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 21 =Railway service vehicles= P15 ballast wagon A wide variety of specialised wagons were reserved for the use of various railway departments. The Locomotive Department had a large fleet of coal wagons and many were constructed from iron. They were allocated diagrams in the N series alongside ordinary mineral wagons for revenue earning traffic but were identified by a large 'LOCO' painted on the sides. The more common designs carried either 10 tons (diagrams N6 and N7) or 20 tons (N2, N4 and N5) but there were some exceptionally large bogie wagons such as diagram N11 that carried 40 tons. The Engineers Department had many different wagons for their specialised needs such as the ballast wagons which were all given diagram numbers in the P series. Most of these were small iron open wagons varying from 8 to 20 tons capacity, but some had specialised discharge systems – P6, P7 and P22 were hoppers, and a number of side-tipping wagons were also bought in 1930 but never allocated a diagram number.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 14 Rail wagons () were mixed in with revenue earning bogie bolsters in the J diagrams, but open wagons for new sleepers had their own T diagram series, which also included special well wagons to carry sleepers with their rail chairs fixed to them (T1, T12 and T13).Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 18 M4 shunters truck The operating department had a requirement for wagons to carry gas for carriage lighting. These were given the telegraphic code 'Cordon' and came in two distinct styles, with two long tanks along the length of the wagon (diagram DD5) or nine short tanks stacked across the wagon (DD4).Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 28 There were also match or 'shunting' trucks to connect broad and standard gauge wagons until the broad gauge was abandoned in 1892, or to run with overhanging or dangerous loads.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 10 These were originally just ordinary flat trucks run without a load, but in later years a number of old wagons were kept for this purpose and given diagrams L21 to L23. Cranes also had match trucks of various styles in diagrams L1 to L20. Shunters trucks were another kind of flat wagon and could be found in diagrams M1 to M5. These had full length footboards and handrails for shunters who rode on them during movements around stations and depots; they carried a distinctive asymmetrical toolbox and usually had their depot name painted on this.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 11 =Brake vans= Diagram AA20 Toad Every goods train needed a brake van at the end for the guard to travel in. Most wagons were fitted with only hand brakes and so the brake van had an important part to play in the safe running of goods trains, but even once trains fitted with vacuum brakes were introduced (from 1904) a guard was required to travel at the rear of every train. Most carried the name of their home depot on the side. Early vans were just 10 or 12 tons weight, but this gradually increased to 20 tons.Atkins, AG et al. (1976) chapter 25 The familiar Great Western brake van (given the telegraph code of 'Toad' and allocated diagrams in the AA series) had a large cabin extending about two- thirds of the length of the van, with the remaining 'veranda' open on three sides but covered with a roof. Full length footboards and hand rails allowed the guard or a shunter to ride on the outside during shunting movements, and a door in the veranda portion allowed him to enter the cabin. A full height door allowed access from the veranda to the cabin which was fitted with windows in both ends to allow him to see out and keep an eye on his train. Sand boxes were fitted to allow the rails to be sanded if necessary to stop the wheels slipping, and tool boxes, cupboards, a seat and stove were also part of the equipment.

Many had an extra letter added to identify distinctive features, for example a 'Macaw A' was a bolster wagon, but a 'Macaw B' was a bolster wagon. * Aero - airscrew wagon (from 1941) * Ale - cattle wagon converted for beer barrels (from 1940) * Asmo - covered motor car truck * Beaver - flat truck * Beetle – special cattle truck * Bloater – fish van * Bocar - covered truck for car bodies * Cone - gunpowder van * Conflat - flat wagon for containers * Coral - glass wagon * Cordon - gas reservoir truck * Covcar - covered carriage truck * Crocodile - well trolley * Damo - covered motor car truck * Fruit - fruit van * Gadfly - aeroplane truck * Gane - engineers rail truck * Grano - covered grain hopper * Hydra – passenger vehicles well truck * Loriot - machine truck * Macaw - timber truck * Mayfly - transformer truck * Mex – ordinary goods cattle wagon * Mica - meat van * Mink - covered goods van * Milta - milk tank * Mite - twin timber trucks * Mogo - covered motor car wagon * Morel - propeller truck * Open - open wagon * Parto - covered van with movable partitions * Pollen - girder or boiler truck * Rectank - trolley for machinery * Roder - flat truck for road vehicles (to 1935) * Rotruck - road-rail truck for milk tanks * Serpent - carriage truck * Tadpole – open fish wagons * Tevan - converted Mica for special traffic * Toad - goods brake van * Totem - armour plate and girder wagon * Tourn - eight-wheeled open (to 1934) Diagram codes With very few exceptions, all GWR wagons were allocated a page in a diagram book that showed its major dimensions and characteristics.

He analyzes the causes of the rural economic decline: in the context of deregulation and globalization agricultural conglomerates have taken over local businesses. As a result, jobs have disappeared, towns became depopulated, and tax revenue shrunk. Use of meth proliferated in response in the depressed areas. In Iowa, in 2004 it was mostly produced locally using cold medicine as the drug precursor. That year Iowa law enforcement closed 1,370 meth labs (page 29). When, after a long delay, cold medicine became more restricted as a precursor material, Mexican operatives moved in. With superlabs in Mexico, drug lords used illegal immigrants hired as cheap labor by agricultural conglomerates as distributors for their networks. Reding notes that the 2006 Combat Meth Act had been watered down by pharmaceutical lobbyists so that local meth labs were also able to recover from their decline and evolve. Reception While Reding's book received positive reviews from the New York Times Sunday Book Review and Washington Posts Book World, it was severely criticized by Cedar Rapids columnist Laura Behrens, who wrote, \\"it is so ridden with errors of basic reporting that the credibility of its larger premises is crippled\\", pointing out several factual errors. Scott Martelle from the Los Angeles Times writes that \\"Reding neither romanticizes nor moralizes. Instead, he opens a window onto a disturbing landscape that we might not want to see, but that we can't avoid.\\" References 2009 non-fiction books Non- fiction books about drugs Methamphetamine in the United States Crime in Iowa American non-fiction books ","title":"Methland"},{"id":"23729401","text":"Highline Lake State Park is a Colorado state park.

It was discovered in a (c. 300 BCE) Warring States period tomb from the southern Chinese state of Chu. History The provenance of the Chu Silk Manuscript is uncertain, like many illicit antiquities. Sometime between 1934 and 1942, grave robbers discovered it in a tomb near Zidanku (literally \\"bullet storehouse\\"), east of Changsha, Hunan. Archaeologists later found the original tomb and dated it to around 300 BCE. In 1946, the art collector Cai Jixiang () owned the manuscript. John Hadley Cox then transported it to the United States. How John Hadley Cox acquired the manuscript from Cai Jixiang remains a controversy: Cai claimed that Cox had been asked to help scan the manuscript only; Cai's efforts to have the manuscript returned had persisted till the late 1970s but failed.\\"楚帛书在异乡哭泣,\\" Sina, 5 December 2005\\"文物专家解密长沙子弹库楚墓 出土缯书被骗流散美国 ,\\" Rednet, 12 March 2009 The philanthropist Arthur M. Sackler purchased the ancient manuscript in 1965, and it is preserved in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C. Papers related to the manuscript can be found at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives. Recent excavations of Chu-period tombs have discovered historically comparable manuscripts written on fragile bamboo slips and silk – the Chinese word zhubo (竹帛 literally \\"bamboo and silk\\") means \\"bamboo slips and silk (for writing); ancient books\\". The Chu Silk Manuscript was roughly contemporaneous with the (c. 305 BCE) Tsinghua Bamboo Slips and (c. 300 BCE) Guodian Chu Slips, and it preceded the (168 BCE) Mawangdui Silk Texts. Its subject matter predates the (c. 168 BCE) Han Dynasty silk Divination by Astrological and Meteorological Phenomena. Content The Chu Silk Manuscript is 47 cm long and 38 cm wide, with worn edges and folds. Exposure to light has made some portions dark and unreadable, but infrared photography helped to decipher some illegible portions. This silken document contains 926 ancient characters in three sections, each of which involves some aspect of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. Li and Cook (1999) call them the \\"Year (Inner Long Text)\\", \\"Seasons (Inner Short Text)\\", and \\"Months (Surrounding Text)\\". The Inner Long and Short Text are alternate blocks, respectively with thirteen lines of text upright and with eight lines inverted (cf. Greek Boustrophedon). Jao Tsung-I (Lawton 1991:178) proposes the former section is written right side up because it discusses the creation myths of the Chu people, and the latter is upside down because it describes events when heaven is in disarray. The Surrounding Text in the four margins pictures a color-symbolic tree in each corner plus twelve masked zoomorphic figures with short descriptions. Scholars associate the twelve pictures with the Chu gods for the months and the four trees with the mythic pillars holding up the heavens. The Inner Short Text describes Gong Gong knocking down one heavenly pillar and causing the earth to tilt. Although these twelve figures have no certain interpretation, Loewe (1978:105) reasons, \\"it seems likely that they may represent twelve guardian gods or holy spirits, severally invested with powers of action for each of the twelve months. Alternatively they may represent twelve shamans or intermediaries, wearing masks and capable of communicating with such deities.\\" Li Xueqin (1987) identified these twelve gods with the ancient names for the months given in the Erya (8/15, Chu 陬, Ru 如, Bing 寎, ...). The manuscript's sides represent the four directions and seasons. In traditional Chinese terms, the Four Symbols are the Azure Dragon of the East (), Vermillion Bird of the South (), White Tiger of the West (), and Black Tortoise of the North (). Each direction is divided into seven sectors, constituting the Twenty-Eight Mansions () of the lunar month. The Chu Silk Manuscript concerns Chinese astronomy and Chinese astrology, describes the creation myths of Fuxi and Nuwa, and reveals ancient religious perspectives and cosmogony. Li and Cook (1999:172) conclude that, \\"Generally, the writer of the manuscript was concerned that the calendar be used with proper respect and knowledge. Otherwise, the text threatens, cosmic collapse and evil catastrophic events would occur.\\" Li and Cook identify the design with the shitu (式圖 \\"cosmic model diagram\\"). > The Chu Silk Manuscript consists of both illustrations and texts; it is > designed to resemble a divination board (shi; also sometimes called a > diviner's board or cosmograph), which is itself a model of the cosmos. This > type of instrument, of which several have been found in Han tombs, consists > of a round board symbolizing heaven that can rotate on a pivot on top of a > square board representing the earth. (1999:172) This shi (式, literally \\"model; standard; form; pattern\\") or shipan () was the precursor for the luopan () or \\"feng shui compass\\". Translations Interpreting the Chu Silk Manuscript's brush-written Chinese characters is especially difficult. Some of these ancient logograms are illegible and some are missing in lacuna. Others are what Barnard (1981:181) calls \\"descendantless graphs\\" unidentified with standard characters, which \\"may reflect something of the Ch'u (written) \\"dialect\\" rather than more general characteristics of pre-Han character structures.\\" Barnard (1973) provided the first English translation of the manuscript, followed by Li and Cook (1999). To illustrate the subject matter, the translated beginning of each section is quoted below. Note that the ellipsis \\"[...]\\" marks obliterated or untranslatable characters. \\"Year (Inner Long Text)\\" has three subsections; warning about unnatural events if the months are improperly calibrated, stressing the importance of a proper calendar for an auspicious year from the gods, and cautioning people to respectfully sacrifice to the gods. \\"Seasons (Inner Short Text)\\" also has three subsections; describing how the gods separated heaven and earth and determined the four seasons, Yandi and Zhu Rong supported the heavens with five pillars of different colors, and Gong Gong divided time into periods, days, months, and years. This \\"stepped\\" refers to ritual Yubu (禹步 \\"Steps of Yu\\", later known as bugang 步罡 \\"walking the guideline\\", Andersen 1989). Yu was the legendary founder of the Xia dynasty who controlled the Great Flood's waters and regulated the four seasons. \\"Months (Surrounding Text)\\" in the margins has twelve subsections that picture the monthly gods and list their calendrical rules. Textual genre Several Chinese classics are comparable with the Chu Silk Manuscript. For instance, Major (1999:125) says it \\"anticipates later ritual and astrological calendars, such as the \\"Yueling\\" [月令 \\"Monthly Commands\\"] of the Lüshi chunqiu, in emphasizing the importance of performing certain actions and refraining from others in each month of the year in order to ensure safety and good fortune for the community as a whole.\\" In addition, Jao (1985, Lawton 1991:176) compares the manuscript with both the Tianguan shu (天官書 \\"Essay on Astronomy\\") in the Records of the Grand Historian and the bamboo Rishu (日書 \\"Almanacs\\") from the Chu burials at Yunmeng and the Qin burials at Tianshui. Within traditional terms for Chinese schools of thought, Li Ling (1985, Lawton 1991:179) classifies the manuscript as the oldest example of shushu (數術 \\"numerals and skills\\"). \\"Shushu not only includes astronomy and the calendrical and mathematical sciences, but also the various related areas in divination (based on deduction) and physiognomy (based on observation).\\" Shushu contrasted with fangji (方技 \\"prescriptions and techniques\\"), which included Traditional Chinese medicine, neidan, Dao yin, etc., and both specialties were associated with fangshi \\"diviners; magicians\\". \\"Shushu is primarily related to the universal order (hence, the cosmos), while fangji is primarily related to the human order (hence, the human body).\\" Li concludes the Chu Silk Manuscript's cosmic model was based on liuren () or Da Liu Ren () calendrical astrology.

The modern chair-like pose is said to originate with Krishnamacharya. An older version of the pose, with the yogin squatting lower down on to the heels, is shown in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi. Description In Utkatasana, the knees are hips- width apart, the knees are bent, the hips are back, the chest is forward, and the arms are above the head, in line with the ears. Variations Parivritta Utkatasana is the rotated variant. Utkata Konasana, Goddess Pose, has the legs wide apart, the feet turned outwards in line with the thighs, and the knees bent. The arms are usually raised with the elbows bent; variants have the arms straight up, or the hands may be held in Añjali Mudrā, prayer position in front of the chest.

He was born in Algeria to a Sephardic Jewish family. In 1987, with the Club Dorothée, he developed a new concept for a youth TV show which had great success beginning in the 1980s until 1997, on TF1, one of the most important French TV channels. In 1997 TF1 somewhat mysteriously cancelled all its contracts with Azoulay production company' \\"AB\\", even though AB content was, by far, the most popular on French TV at the time. In the 1990s he created an astonishing number of extremely successful so-called \\"sitcoms\\", including Salut les Musclés\\", \\"Premiers Baisers\\", \\"Hélène et les Garcons\\", \\"Le Miel et les Abelles\\", \\"Le Philo selon Philippe\\", \\"Les Filles d'a coté\\". In addition to these he created many others which had lesser success, such as \\"Le College des Coeurs Brisés\\", \\"Un homme a Domicile\\", \\"Talk Show\\", L'un Contre L'autre\\", \\"Les Garcons de la Plage\\" or \\"Else, un roman photo\\". \\"Premieres Baisers\\" and its spin-off, \\"Hélène et les Garcons\\", each of about 200 episodes, both had several sequels. \\"Hélène et les Garcons\\" in particular was followed by \\"Le Miracle de l'Amour\\" and then \\"Les Vacances de l’Amour\\" (produced on location in the carabian) and Azoulay has recently revived the series, with the same actors, now 20 years older, in \\"Les Mysteres de l'Amour\\", which has so far seen three seasons. Azoulay's \\"sit-coms\\" are based on both American sitcoms and soap opera, though in fact they are a genre in their own right, which adds elements from French theatrical farce and the old traditional 'roman'. The AB production method called for shooting 4 episodes per week; of the many hundreds of episodes produced during the period from the launch of \\"Salut les Musclés\\" in the late 1980s until the 1997 close-down, Azoulay is either author or co-author of most of them. Jean-Luc Azoulay is the songwriter for Dorothée and Hélène, also producing all of their shows at the largest venues in France as well as major sites in Asia. In October 2004, he produced 12 shows at the Palais des congrès de Paris for the legendary French singer Sylvie Vartan. In 2000, he produced the successful TV series Navarro, L’Instit, Quai n°1, along with other prestigious TV series like Les Liaisons Dangereuses and Les Rois maudits, establishing him as one of the top primetime TV producers. In October 2007, he adapted Baie des Flamboyants from the Mexican telenovela Codigo Postal.

Genex sold the team to a group from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and it moved there for the 2006-2007 season, playing at the Colisée Isabelle- Brasseur and renamed from 2006 to 2008 as the St-Jean Summum Chiefs. The Saint-Jean Summum Chiefs won the Futura Cup in 2006-2007, after having played their last two playoff series in their former home, the Colisée de Laval. The Chiefs moved to Saint-Hyacinthe in 2008 to become the Saint-Hyacinthe Chiefs folding the following season. =2008-2012: Saguenay 98.3 / Saguenay Marquis= With a move to Saguenay in 2008, it became knawn as the Saguenay 98.3, after the local radio station that sponsored the team, CKRS-FM (at the time under ownership of Corus Entertainment) and from 2009 onwards Saguenay Marquis. The players were sold but not the name \\"Summum Chiefs\\", which was retained by Genex. Instead the team adopted the name \\"Marquis\\". =2012–present: Jonquière Marquis= Since 2012, the team is playing in Jonquière, a borough (arrondissement) of the city of Saguenay, Quebec and is known as the Jonquière Marquis.

On first learning of Edwin Hubble's discovery of a linear relation between the redshift of the galaxies and their distance, Einstein set the cosmological constant to zero in the Friedmann equations, resulting in a model of the expanding universe known as the Friedmann–Einstein universe.Physics ArXiv preprint In 1932, Einstein and de Sitter proposed an even simpler cosmic model by assuming a vanishing spatial curvature as well as a vanishing cosmological constant. In modern parlance, the Einstein–de Sitter universe can be described as a cosmological model for a flat matter-only Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW) universe.Lars Bergström & Ariel Goobar: \\"Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics\\", 2nd ed. Springer (2004), p. 70+77. . In the model, Einstein and de Sitter derived a simple relation between the average density of matter in the universe and its expansion according to H02 = кρ/3, where H0 is the Hubble constant, ρ is the average density of matter and к is the Einstein gravitational constant. The size of the Einstein–de Sitter universe evolves with time as a\\\\propto t^{2/3}, making its current age 2/3 times the Hubble time. The Einstein–de Sitter universe became a standard model of the universe for many years because of its simplicity and because of a lack of empirical evidence for either spatial curvature or a cosmological constant. It also represented an important theoretical case of a universe of critical matter density poised just at the limit of eventually contracting. However, Einstein's later reviews of cosmology make it clear that he saw the model as only one of several possibilities for the expanding universe. The Einstein–de Sitter universe was particularly popular in the 1980s, after the theory of cosmic inflation predicted that the curvature of the universe should be very close to zero. This case with zero cosmological constant implies the Einstein- de Sitter model, and the theory of cold dark matter was developed, initially with a cosmic matter budget around 95% cold dark matter and 5% baryons. However, in the 1990s various observations including galaxy clustering and measurements of the Hubble constant led to increasingly serious problems for this model. Following the discovery of the accelerating universe in 1998, and observations of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy redshift surveys in 2000–2003, it is now generally accepted that dark energy makes up around 70 percent of the present energy density while cold dark matter contributes around 25 percent, as in the modern Lambda-CDM model. The Einstein-de Sitter model remains a good approximation to our universe in the past at redshifts between around 300 and 2, i.e. well after the radiation-dominated era but before dark energy became important.

Other major characters are Angie Polaski and Faith Mitchell. There are currently 9 books and two novellas in the series. Slaughter also writes the Grant County series. She has over 17 million books in print and is published in 30 languages. Some of her book titles differ in the US and other countries. Biography Will was found in a trashcan when he was a baby, and taken to the Atlanta Children's Home where he grew up. Despite the name, it was little more than a state orphanage. The woman who ran it and her assistants did the best they could, though they were understaffed and underpaid. The children were fed and clothed, the place was kept clean, some stability was provided. The state tried to place the children with foster families, which sometimes led to adoption into a loving environment, but more often than not that wasn't the case. Will never gave up, carefully grooming himself every visiting day, so that someone would want to adopt him. Will became one of The Doors, the nickname given to the children who always came back, as if the system was just a big revolving door. When he reached the legal adult age of eighteen, he left the home. When Will was eight he met eleven-year-old Angie Polaski, recently arrived at the home. First they became allies and friends, eventually sexual partners, then developed a relationship. Though they admit they love each other, they are not in love. Will is comfortable with the familiarity and not interested in other women; Angie isn't and is interested in other men. She's left Will over a dozen times, but always comes back. He finally gave her an ultimatum and she agreed to marry him. After leaving the home, Will began working for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). He worked in the Major Case Squad, where he had a reputation for being a good agent who didn't get along well with others. He was drafted into the Special Criminal Apprehension Team, a new unit headed by Amanda Wagner. Will has solved 89% of his cases, a phenomenal clearance rate. He is an excellent puzzle solver, one of the best agents in the bureau. However, he is dyslexic. Will looks at his dyslexia as a personal failure and has never sought help for it. He uses all kinds of tricks to hide it: wearing a wristwatch to tell his left from right, using color-coded folders to identify his cases, using a digital recorder and voice recognition software to generate his reports, pretending that he forgot his glasses when someone hands him something to read. He shops for groceries based on familiar-looking labels or pictures on the packaging, and avoids new restaurants because he doesn't have the menu memorized. He has trouble with the signs when driving in unfamiliar areas, and he can not read roadmaps. He hates changing technology—a new cell phone or stereo or television costs him hours laboriously reading the directions or programming the functions. Despite his problem, he can take apart, repair, and reassemble almost anything with moving parts. He restored two automobiles, he can fix a piano or a washing machine or a lawnmower. Will Trent is 6'3\\" tall and broad-shouldered, lanky and strong, with short dirty- blonde hair. He has huge hands. He has a scar on his upper lip where it was split so badly it couldn't be sewn back together properly, another running from his ear down into his collar, and still another on the back of his head from a shovel attack. He has scars from a whip, electrical burns, cigarette burns, and an open fracture. He also has a self-inflicted scar on one forearm from a suicide attempt. In spite of all the scars, some women find him good- looking, but he only has eyes for Angie. And in spite of the dyslexia, Will finished high school and got a college degree. Though he worked ten times harder than the other students, he barely passed. He went further and obtained dubious upper-level degrees through correspondence schools. Will is controlled and not likely to be impulsive or spontaneous. Loud noises make him flinch. He's a snappy dresser with a penchant for three-piece suits. He is eminently fair and reasonable, has poor social skills, and is kind to animals. Major characters= Angie Polaski= Angie Polaski was 11 when she joined the Atlanta Children's Home. By that time she'd been abused by an endless string of her drug addict mother's boyfriends and found her mother overdosed in the bathroom just prior to entering a vegetative coma. She suffered more still at the hands of various foster parents and always ended up back at the home. The home itself became the source of some of her happiest childhood memories due to the devotion of Ms. Flannery, who ran the place and, though not particularly nurturing, conscientiously cared for her charges as best she could with what she had. After leaving the home Angie joined the Atlanta Police Department, and her long, strange relationship with Will Trent continued. One time Angie tried to count the number of men she had left Will for and came up with eleven. All of a type, as Will was happy to point out, that were bad for her. And every time she ended up back on Will's doorstep, and he took her back. When Angie was with the APD she worked vice, dressing as a prostitute to lure and arrest men. She developed a kinship with the working girls, as she shared a similar background of abuse with many of them. There but for the grace of God and all that. Angie never knew who her father was, and perhaps the most painful aspect of her childhood was the treachery of her mother, Deidre Polaski, tossing her maternal duties for drugs. Angie left the police department due to medical disability brought on by an attack in the line of duty which would have restricted her to a desk job had she stayed. At the end of Fractured, she has moved in with Will and they are engaged. =Faith Mitchell= Faith Mitchell is named after her grandmother. She is tall and blonde and pretty. She is a homicide detective with the Atlanta Police Department. Faith's mother, Evelyn, was one of the city's highest- ranking police commanders when Faith got her gold shield five years ago at the ripe young age of twenty-eight, which brought on rumors of nepotism. But Faith's competency soon quelled them and she was accepted into the squad. However, Faith's mother is no longer a police captain; six of her detectives were caught skimming money off of narcotics busts and she refused to testify against them. They were fired and she was forced to retire. The man who led the investigation was Will Trent. When Faith was fourteen, she met a boy, and became pregnant. Upon learning the news, he disappeared. She waited until she was in her third trimester to tell her parents, and they ultimately left the decision up to her. Her son Jeremy was born and she didn't give him up for adoption. She eventually got used to the stares and the comments, but it was many years later that she found out that her father, a very devout man, was forced to leave his church. Though early, Faith's motherhood was relatively normal. She loved her son dearly, anxiously passing many hours worrying about where he was, about drinking and drugs and accidents, that he might repeat her own mistakes. Faith has a brother Zeke who is a surgeon in the Air Force, serving overseas in Brandenburg, Germany. Her father, Bill, died of pancreatic cancer. His death left a huge hole in Faith's life. It was not long after his death that she was promoted to homicide, becoming one of only three women in the division. After seeing the toll the internal investigation took on her mother, transforming her into an old woman before Faith's eyes, Faith came to hate Will Trent. In Fractured, she meets him, and ends up having to work with him. Over time, she grew to like Will, and at the end of Fractured, She accepted Amanda Wagner's offer to join the Georgia Bureau of Investigation as Will's partner. Other characters Amanda Wagner -- Amanda is Will Trent's tough as nails supervisor. Caroline -- Caroline is Amanda's secretary. Leo Donnelly -- Another homicide detective, Leo may or may not be the victim of a bad rap. Throughout Triptych he's castigated by the other cops for his bad manners, his bad breath, his bad hygiene, but he's the one with the contacts and he's the one with the instincts to first smell the hinky smell. In Fractured, as Faith's partner, he screws up and schedules emergency surgery so he can go on medical leave rather than face Amanda's wrath. Leo's been divorced four times. Pete Hanson -- Pete is a verbose, eccentric and able coroner. He's been divorced three times. He likes to gamble and wears a big gold medallion and shorts or scruffy jeans under his starched white lab coat. He admires Will Trent's intellect and skill as an investigator. Charlie Reed -- Charlie is a crime scene technician with the Criminal Apprehension Team, another of Amanda's recruits who's been around almost as long as Will. Charlie's meticulous and a good investigator who always goes the extra mile, and Will requests him on all his cases. Charlie is not above bending the rules if it will save lives. Victor Martinez -- The Dean of Student Relations at Georgia Tech. He and Faith spark the second time they meet. Hamish Patel -- Hamish is a hostage negotiator for the GBI, trained by Amanda. Ivan Sambor -- A Polish cop. Books in the series= Triptych = When Atlanta police detective Michael Ormewood is called out to a murder scene at the notorious Grady Homes, he finds himself faced with one of the most brutal killings of his career: Aleesha Monroe is found in the stairwell in a pool of her own blood, her body horribly mutilated. As a one-off killing it's shocking, but when it becomes clear that it's just the latest in a series of similar attacks, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are called in, and Ormewood is forced into working with Special Agent Will Trent of the Criminal Apprehension Team — a man he instinctively dislikes. But then, only 24 hours later, the violence Michael sees around him every day explodes in his own back yard. And, it seems the mystery behind Monroe's death is inextricably entangled with a past that refuses to stay buried... =Fractured= When Atlanta housewife Abigail Campano comes home unexpectedly one afternoon, she walks into a nightmare. A broken window, a bloody footprint on the stairs and, most devastating of all, the horrifying sight of her teenage daughter lying dead on the landing, a man standing over her with a bloody knife. The struggle which follows changes Abigail's life forever. When the local police make a misjudgement which not only threatens the investigation but places a young girl's life in danger, the case is handed over to Special Agent Will Trent of the Criminal Apprehension Team –- teamed with detective Faith Mitchell, a woman who resents him from their first meeting. But in the relentless heat of a Georgia summer, Will and Faith realize that they must work together to find the brutal killer who has targeted one of Atlanta's wealthiest, most privileged communities -– before it's too late... =Undone= Released July 2009, Undone brings together the Will Trent series and the Grant County series. Someone had spent time with her — someone well-practiced in the art of pain... Three years ago former Grant County medical examiner Sara Linton moved to Atlanta hoping to leave her tragic past behind her. Now working as a doctor in Atlanta's Grady Hospital she is starting to piece her life together. But when a severely wounded young woman is brought in to the emergency room, she finds herself drawn back into a world of violence and terror. The woman has been hit by a car but, naked and brutalized, it's clear that she has been the prey of a twisted mind. When Special Agent Will Trent of the Criminal Investigation Team returns to the scene of the accident, he stumbles on a torture chamber buried deep beneath the earth. And this hidden house of horror reveals a ghastly truth – Sara's patient is just the first victim of a sick, sadistic killer. Wrestling the case away from the local police chief, Will and his partner Faith Mitchell find themselves at the center of a grisly murder hunt. And Sara, Will and Faith – each with their own wounds and their own secrets – are the only thing that stands between a madman and his next crime... =Broken= When the body of a young woman is discovered deep beneath the icy waters of Lake Grant, a note left under a rock by the shore points to suicide. But within minutes, it becomes clear that this is no suicide. It's a brutal, cold-blooded murder. All too soon former Grant County medical examiner Sara Linton – home for Thanksgiving after a long absence — finds herself unwittingly drawn into the case. The chief suspect is desperate to see her but when she arrives at the local police station she is met with a horrifying sight — he lies dead in his cell, the words 'Not me' scrawled across the walls. Something about his confession doesn't add up and deeply suspicious of the detective in charge, Lena Adams, Sara immediately calls the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Shortly afterwards, Special Agent Will Trent is brought in from his vacation to investigate. But he is immediately confronted with a wall of silence. Grant County is a close-knit community with loyalties and ties that run deep. And the only person who can tell the truth about what really happened is dead. =Fallen= There's no police training stronger than a cop's instinct. Faith Mitchell's mother isn't answering her phone. Her front door is open. There's a bloodstain above the knob. Her infant daughter is hidden in a shed behind the house. All that the Georgia Bureau of Investigations taught Faith Mitchell goes out the window when she charges into her mother's house, gun drawn. She sees a man dead in the laundry room. She sees a hostage situation in the bedroom. What she doesn't see is her mother... \\"You know what we're here for. Hand it over, and we'll let her go.\\" When the hostage situation turns deadly, Faith is left with too many questions, not enough answers. To find her mother, she'll need the help of her partner, Will Trent, and they'll both need the help of trauma doctor Sara Linton. But Faith isn't just a cop anymore — she's a witness. She's also a suspect. The thin blue line hides police corruption, bribery, even murder. Faith will have to go up against the people she respects the most in order to find her mother and bring the truth to light — or bury it forever. =Snatched (Novella)= Will Trent, a dedicated agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for fifteen years, knows that there's definitely such a thing as a cop's intuition. Which is why he should have listened to his own. While in an airport restroom at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, Will overhears a girl's pleading, plaintive voice: \\"Please, I wanna go home.\\" Something isn't right here, thinks Will. He feels it in his gut. But he waits too long to act, and now the girl and the anxious, angry man she's with have disappeared into the crowds at the busiest passenger airport in the world. After a desperate search and with time running out, Will makes a call to his supervisor, Amanda Wagner. Will's partner, Faith Mitchell, immediately sends out an abducted child alert. The entire airport will soon be grinding to a halt: Eighty-nine million passengers a year. Five runways. Seven concourses. Six million square feet of space that sprawled across two counties, three cities, and five jurisdictions. All shut down on a dime because Will has a hunch that he is certain is true: a girl, maybe six or seven years old, has been snatched from God knows where. And he intends to bring her back—no matter what it takes. =Criminal= Will Trent is a brilliant agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Newly in love, he is beginning to put a difficult past behind him. Then a local college student goes missing, and Will is inexplicably kept off the case by his supervisor and mentor, deputy director Amanda Wagner. Will cannot fathom Amanda's motivation until the two of them literally collide in an abandoned orphanage they have both been drawn to for different reasons. Decades before, when his father was imprisoned for murder, this was Will's home. It appears that the case that launched Amanda's career forty years ago has suddenly come back to life—and it involves the long-held mystery of Will's birth and parentage. Now these two dauntless investigators will each need to face down demons from the past if they are to prevent an even greater terror from being unleashed. =Busted (Novella)= Detective Will Trent is standing in a Georgia convenience store, waiting on an obstinate Icee frozen drink machine. To the surveillance cameras and bored staff of the Lil' Dixie Gas-n-Go, however, Will appears to be someone very different—the menacing ex-con Bill Black. Going undercover as Bill, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent is about to infiltrate the most corrupt town in the most corrupt county in the new American South. But first: his Icee. Everything changes in one horrific instant, as all hell breaks loose at the Lil' Dixie. A cop is shot. A bag of cash goes flying across the floor. A young woman disappears while a killer takes off in a battered pick-up truck. Within seconds, Will is in pursuit. =Unseen= Will Trent is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent whose latest case has him posing as Bill Black, a scary ex-con who rides a motorcycle around Macon, Georgia, and trails an air of violence wherever he goes. The cover has worked and he has caught the eye of a wiry little drug dealer who thinks he might be a useful ally. But undercover and cut off from the support of the woman he loves, Sara Linton, Will finds his demons catching up with him. Although she has no idea where Will has gone, or why, Sara herself has come to Macon because of a cop shooting: Her stepson, Jared, has been gunned down in his own home. Sara holds Lena, Jared's wife, responsible: Lena, a detective, has been a magnet for trouble all her life, and Jared's shooting is not the first time someone Sara loved got caught in the crossfire. Furious, Sara finds herself involved in the same case that Will is working without even knowing it, and soon danger is swirling around both of them. =The Kept Woman= With the discovery of a murder at an abandoned construction site, Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is brought in on a case that becomes much more dangerous when the dead man is identified as an ex-cop. Studying the body, Sara Linton — the GBI's newest medical examiner and Will's lover — realises that the extensive blood loss didn't belong to the corpse. Sure enough, bloody footprints leading away from the scene indicate there is another victim — a woman — who has vanished . . . and who will die soon if she is not found. Will is already compromised, because the site belongs to the city's most popular citizen: a wealthy, powerful, and politically connected athlete protected by the world's most expensive lawyers — a man who has already gotten away with rape, despite Will's exhaustive efforts to put him away. But the worst is yet to come. Evidence soon links Will's troubled past to the case . . . and the consequences will tear through his life with the force of a tornado, wreaking havoc for Will and everyone around him, including his colleagues, family, friends—and even the suspects he pursues. =The Last Widow= On a hot summer night, a scientist from the Centers for Disease Control is grabbed by unknown assailants in a shopping center parking lot. Vanished into thin air, the authorities are desperate to save the doctor. One month later, the serenity of a sunny Sunday afternoon is shattered by the boom of a ground-shaking blast—followed by another seconds later. One of Atlanta's busiest and most important neighborhood's has been bombed—the location of Emory University, two major hospitals, the FBI headquarters, and the CDC. Medical examiner Sara Linton and her partner Will Trent, an investigator with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, rush to the scene—and into the heart of a deadly conspiracy that threatens to destroy thousands of innocent lives. When the assailants abduct Sara, Will goes undercover to save her and prevent a massacre—putting his own life on the line for the woman and the country he loves.

For some children, diet is suspected of playing a role in the multiple behavioral and cognitive symptoms of ADHD.  Food coloring and additives  Since the 1970s and the well- publicised advocacy of Benjamin Feingold, there has been public concern that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children. These concerns have led the FDA and other food safety authorities to regularly review the scientific literature, and led the UK FSA to commission a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the \\"Southampton 6\\")) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007. The study found \\"a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity\\" in the children; the advisory committee to the FDA that evaluated the study also determined that \\"because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended\\". The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that \\"the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects\\" for any of the dyes. The US FDA did not make changes following the publication of the Southampton study, but following a citizen petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 2008, requesting the FDA ban several food additives, the FDA commenced a review of the available evidence, and still made no changes. There is no evidence to support broad claims that food coloring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children. It is possible that certain food coloring may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence is weak.  Sugar regulation  A number of studies have found that sucrose (sugar) has no effect on behavior and in particular it does not exacerbate the symptoms of children diagnosed with ADHD. One study demonstrated the impact of expectancy effects in parents' perceptions of their children's hyperactivity after consuming sugar. In this study, parents who were told their child had ingested a high concentration of sugar in drink form (even though the drink was actually flavored with aspartame), reported their child as being more active, inattentive and resistant to parental demands. This was in comparison to the group who were told (accurately) that their child had ingested no sugar.  Omega-3 fatty acids  Some research suggests that children with ADHD may have low blood levels of essential omega-3 fatty acids. However, it is unknown if decreased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids can cause or exacerbate ADHD or whether lower blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids associated with ADHD are caused by an underlying mechanism. Several other studies showed similar effects, especially of Omega 3 fatty acids with Zinc and Magnesium.

National Expansion In April 2006, the Scottish Government extended the SVRU’s remit nationwide (Scotland) thus creating a national centre of expertise on violent crime. In June 2019, following the success of the Scottish VRU and implementation of a new London unit headed by Lib Peck (former leader of Lambeth council), the Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that he was giving £35m to police and crime commissioners in 18 local areas to set up their own local violence reduction units. This would include over £3 million to set up a VRU in the West Midlands. Projects=Historic Initiatives= In 2008 the SVRU set up the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) in a bid to end violence between established street gangs once and for all. The initiative was heavily modelled on the successful Boston Ceasefire Project (Operation Ceasefire) and Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence. The CIRV has three basic components (enforcement; services and programmes; the moral voice of the community) and is a partnership between Police Scotland, Social services in Scotland, Education Scotland and other entities. Police operational activity, diversion projects, and help with careers, education, and anger management are all used in an attempt to end gang violence. Within three years of its introduction, more than 400 young men had joined the initiative. Due to the correlation between alcohol misuse and violence in Scotland, in 2012 the SVRU piloted the use of SCRAMx transdermal alcohol monitors (\\"sobriety bracelets\\") which allow the blood alcohol concentration of the wearer to be monitored remotely so allowing compliance with sobriety to be monitored. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper Niven Rennie (Director of the SVRU since 2019) defended the use of stop and search, saying it was a key element of the unit's early work (\\"you can't have enforcement without search\\"). Stop and search is a controversial power which gives police the authority to stop, question and search a person they suspect may be committing any of a variety of offences which often comes under criticism for giving police officers the power to target certain groups (for example, those from Black or Minority Ethnic communities). =Current Initiatives= The Navigator programme works out of hospital emergency departments with the aim of stopping the \\"revolving door of violent injury\\" seen in Scottish hospitals and easing the pressure of violence on the NHS. =Medics Against Violence= The unit collaborates closely with the Medics Against Violence charity, which sees NHS staff and healthcare students educate secondary pupils on the risks and consequences of engaging in violence. In addition, MAVS provides training to dentists to intervene in domestic violence while the patient is in the dentist's chair.

Almost all students graduating from high school in Japan have had several years of English language education; however, many still do not have fluent English conversation abilities. History The earliest record of the initial contact between the Japanese and a native English speaker took place around 1600 when it is believed that Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa Feudal Government, met with Englishman William Adams. Although it is reported that the only interpreter between the two men was only well-versed in the Portuguese language, it did not stop Tokugawa Ieyasu from having a very positive relation with William Adams who remained in Japan for the remainder of his life. However, after the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1616, a change in the foreign policy of the Bakufu ordered the closing of the English merchants' office in 1623, which consequently prompted the English to leave Japan. The English were refused permission to return in 1673. In 1808, the British ship Phaeton seized goods in Nagasaki and by 1825 the Bakufu ordered the feudal lords to repel all foreign ships, except the Dutch and Chinese. The first translation of any English grammar book into Japanese was accomplished by Shibukawa Rokuzo, a high-ranking official of the Bakufu who had studied Dutch, in 1841 when he translated Murray's English Grammar from Dutch into Japanese. Then in 1848, American Ranald MacDonald came to Japan, after pretending to be shipwrecked, and taught English to fourteen official Japanese interpreters of Dutch in Nagasaki under Bakufu orders. It would be one of MacDonald's students named Moriyama who would act as interpreter between the United States and Japan in order to establish trade relations. After being rescued from a shipwreck and studying in the United States for ten years, Nakahama Manjirō wrote an English textbook called Ei-Bei Taiwa Shokei (A Shortcut to Anglo- American Conversation),Ike, Minoru. \\"A historical review of English in Japan (1600-1880).\\" World Englishes. 14.1 (1995) 3-11. which used Japanese kana for pronunciation and the kanbun (Chinese classics) word-order system. This text would later become influential in shaping the methods of teaching and learning English in Japan. Yokohama Academy, one of the first English schools, was founded in Japan by the Bakufu in 1865 where American missionaries such as James Curtis Hepburn taught there. By the year 1874, there were 91 foreign language schools in Japan, out of which 82 of them taught English. And in 1923, Englishman Harold E. Palmer was invited to Japan by the Ministry of Education, where he would later found the Institute for Research in English Teaching in Tokyo and introduce the aural-oral approach to teaching English. However, beginning from the 1880s, when Japan was quickly becoming a modernized country, books such as Shiga Shigetaka's Nihon Jin (にほんじん or 日本人) (The Japanese People) began to surface in order to warn the Japanese public about the alleged dangers of Western influences. Hence, up until the end of World War II, there was a growing tension between Western ideology and national pride amongst the Japanese people. In modern Japan, there seems to be conflicting views over how the Japanese people view the English language. On one side, it appears that there is much interest in acquiring a working knowledge of the English language, which can be demonstrated by the annual rise in STEP EikenTanaka, Sachiko Oda. \\"The Japanese media and English.\\" World Englishes. 14.1 (1995) 37-53. applicants and the number of Japanese media outlets that have begun to incorporate English-language programs into their repertoire, in order to participate in the global economy and international community.

Web. 28 November 2009. point out that Japan maintains itself as one of the most independent nations on Earth due to its geographic isolation and amazing translation industry which results in hardly any need of English in daily life. The modern English- language industry has recently experienced an incredible boom, followed by a number of hardships, including declarations of bankruptcy for two very large English conversation school chains. Difficulties Japanese students experience great difficulty in studying English, due to fundamental differences in grammar and syntax, as well as important differences in pronunciation. Japanese word order, the frequent omission of subjects in Japanese, the absence of articles, the functional absence of plural forms, as well as difficulties in distinguishing l and r all contribute to substantial problems using English effectively. Indeed, Japanese have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English. An additional factor has been the use of English in daily life for \\"decorative\\" or \\"design\\" rather than functional purposes. That is, for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers per se, and as a way of appearing \\"smart, sophisticated and modern\\". Indeed, it is claimed that in such decorative English \\"there is often no attempt to try to get it right, nor do the vast majority of the Japanese population . . . ever attempt to read the English design element in question . . . There is therefore less emphasis on spell checking and grammatical accuracy.\\" Thus exposure to English encountered in daily life in Japan is unlikely to be helpful as a learning aid. (see Engrish) School system According to the Ministry of Finance (Japan), in the 2004 fiscal year (FY) the General Account expenditures\\"Understanding the Japanese Budget 2004.\\" Budget: Ministry of Finance. 22 July 2008.

Japan is ranked 22nd in the world in the UN Education Index, but scores highly in science according to PISA. MEXT took steps beginning in 1998 for a select number of public primary schools to have mandatory English classes;Honna, Nobuyuki, and Yuko Takeshita \\"English Language Teaching in Japan: Policy Plans and their Implementations.\\" RELC Journal 36.3 (2005) 363-383. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 30 November 2009. many Japanese parents send their children to Eikaiwa schools starting even before elementary school. According to 2003 statistics provided by MEXT children from ages 12 to 14 spend roughly 90 hours annually in a school classroom setting. Traditionally, the Japanese have used the Grammar- translation method, thanks in part to Nakahama Manjirō's kanbun system, to teach their students how to learn the English language. However, there are innovative ways that have been adapted into and outside the classroom setting where mobile phonesThornton, Patricia, and Chris Houser \\"Using mobile phones in English education in Japan.\\" Journal of Computer Assisted Learning 21.3 (2005) 217-228.

In April 2011 English instruction became compulsory starting in the 5th grade of elementary school (age 10). It is planned to make English activity classes mandatory for third- and fourth-graders, and turn them into full-fledged lessons for fifth- and sixth-graders by 2020.English heads for elementary school in 2020 but hurdles abound The Japan Times Private sector Private language schools for English are known as eikaiwa. The largest of these chains were Aeon, GEOS, and ECC; only ECC and AEON have not yet filed for bankruptcy. The industry is not well regulated. Nova, originally by far the largest chain with over 900 branches in Japan, collapsed in October 2007, leaving thousands of foreign teachers without money or a place to live. Other teachers work in universities, although most university positions now require a graduate degree or higher. Agencies, known in Japan as haken, or dispatch companies, are increasingly used to send English speakers into kindergartens, primary schools, and private companies whose employees need to improve their English for business. Agencies have recently been competing fiercely to get contracts from various Boards of Education for elementary, junior and senior High Schools, so wages for teachers have decreased steadily in the last four years. Average wages for teachers in Japan are now under 250,000 Yen per month,\\"Teach English in Japan\\" , With a degree and a TEFL certificate, you should be able to demand somewhere in the region of 230,000 and 250,000 Yen a month. That's about US$2,200. although that can rise slightly depending on experience. Along with wages, working conditions have also steadily declined, resulting in industrial action and court battles that have made the news in local and international press.Currie-Robson, Craig (2015); English to Go: Inside Japan's Teaching Sweatshops JET Programme Employees of The Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme are sponsored by the Government of Japan to assist language teachers at Japanese high schools and elementary schools in the Japanese rural countryside and cities.

His works range from literal translations of fanciful sayings to kitschy depictions of everyday terminology.Coraggio, Jack, \\"Iconoclastic in Litchfield\\", Litchfield County Times 12/11/08 Early life Robert grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, his mother a talented portrait artist and fashion model who died when Deyber was sixteen, his father Robert Deyber Sr., a real estate broker and POW, survivor of the Bataan Death March. Deyber began painting and drawing in his teens, and continued to develop a style that was original and surreal, drawing inspiration from the cultures that surrounded him as he lived in various parts of the country, from New York City to San Francisco. Deyber eventually wound up in Perugia and Milan, Italy where he studied and observed the works of Giotto di Bondone and other Italian painters. His early work from the 1980s and 1990s involves work that he describes as neo-surrealism or surreal American mythology. While he continued to develop and show his work, he was an executive in the airline industry, which allowed him to travel all over the world, exposing himself to art in many museums. He continued for twenty years to exhibit his work in the Boston area. Current activities After leaving the airline industry in 2001, Deyber moved to Atlanta, Georgia to be closer to his siblings. It was at that time that he began to focus on his artistic career and began exhibiting his work in the surrounding areas. With much success, his work began to grow in popularity, and he soon was represented in many surrounding and distant states. By 2004, Deyber had been selling works around the world and had collectors in 27 countries. At the time he was self-published and selling original paintings and prints through many galleries across the country and was routinely featured in the Artful Home catalog. He opened a contemporary fine-art gallery in Roswell, Georgia, \\"Iridium Gallery\\", which featured his own works and those of about a dozen other artists. He later sold the gallery and began selling works directly from his studio and website and other larger galleries in the Atlanta area. After singer-songwriter Tom Petty and his wife Dana began collecting his work, Petty commissioned Deyber for the artwork of his album Highway Companion, which was released in 2006.Tom Petty, Peter Bogdanovich, \\"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\\" Chronicle Books, 2007, page 224.

Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus parvus possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Paracynarctus was named by Wang et al. (1999). Its type is Paracynarctus sinclairi. It was assigned to Cynarctina by Wang et al. (1999). Morphology Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built.

With the personal guarantee of Peter the Great, he was one of the pioneers to develop Russian domestic metallurgy and metal production. In the mid-18th century, Dugna, Brynsky, and Vyrovsky plants annually produced 19,000 poods of iron for the local market and additionally exported large quantities to St. Petersburg. Production of iron at these three factories at that time ranged from 40 to 70 thousand poods a year, which corresponded to melting of approximately 60-100 thousand poods of iron.

Borophagus dudleyi existed for approximately .PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus dudleyi, basic info Overview Borophagus dudleyi was originally named Pliogulo dudleyi by T.E. White in 1941.T. E. White. 1941. Addition to the fauna of the Florida Pliocene. Proceedings of the New England Zoological Club 67-70 Borophagus dudleyi, like other Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus parvus possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Borophagus dudleyi was recombined as Cynogulo dudleyi by Kretzoi in 1968. It was recombined again as Osteoborus dudleyi by Webb in 1969 and Munthe in 1998. The animal was then synonymized subjectively with Borophagus crassapineatus by Richey in 1979. In 1987, Richard H. Tedford returned its original name and Xiaoming Wang along with Richard H. Tedford and Beryl E. Taylor concurred in a 1999 examination. Morphology Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about 80 cm in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Fossil distribution Borophagus dudleyi fossil specimens are exclusive to a coastal area of North Carolina. Sister genera Carpocyon, Epicyon, Paratomarctus and Protepicyon.

This range of solutions is strongly linked to the Viessmann purpose, i.e. the guiding principle of the company \\"We create living spaces for Generations to come\\". The company was founded in Hof an der Saale in 1917 by Johann Viessmann, and has been family owned for four generations. As of 2019, the company employs 12,300 people and reports annual sales of € 2.65 billion.  Profile  With 22 production companies in 12 countries and worldwide with sales companies, agencies and trade partners in 74 countries, Viessmann is internationally oriented. 56 percent of turnover is generated abroad. Since January 2018, the operational business of the Viessmann Group has been managed by two CEOs. Maximilian Viessmann has assumed responsibility for the Heating Systems Division and the digital new business, while Joachim Janssen concentrates on the Industrial Systems and Cooling Systems Divisions. For the company's 100th anniversary in 2017, a new research and development center was inaugurated at the headquarters in Allendorf in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. With a volume of 50 million euros, the \\"Technikum\\" represents the largest single investment in the history of the company. In addition to the business fields of air conditioning solutions, industrial solutions and cooling solutions, Viessmann is also active in the fields of investment, real estate and VC/O. Viessmann Investment develops growth potential and new markets through targeted acquisitions in medium-sized companies. Viessmann Real Estate deals with real estate, hotels and catering. VC/O is Viessmann's digital unit, which observes and shapes developments with regard to digitalisation and new business models. The VC/O includes, among others, the Maschinenraum in Berlin. The Viessmann Group includes Viessmann Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung GmbH (formerly ESS Energie Systeme & Service GmbH) as a producer of combined heat and power units, and Schmack Biogas Service GmbH as a market leader in the biogas sector. The group also includes the French medium boiler manufacturers Stein Energie and Sodiet (Viessmann Industrie France), as well as Viessmann Eis-Energiespeicher GmbH. In 2012, the Viessmann Group acquired 100 percent of shares in Viessmann Kältetechnik AG in Hof. The company is one of the most important manufacturers of temperature-controlled rooms for trade and industry. In addition, the Finnish Norpe Group, the leading Scandinavian manufacturer of commercial refrigeration units, finned products and cooling units for the food retail trade, was acquired in 2013. In September 2016, Viessmann launched heizung.de, an information and advice portal aimed specifically at end users such as new builders and refurbishment companies.

Also in 2018, the company built a solar park next to its headquarters in Allendorf to cover up to 7 percent of the company's own electricity requirements. The plant has an output of 2 MW and was built without state subsidies. Instead, the project is financed by the company's own consumption of electrical energy. The company also operates the Allendorf airfield.  Products  On the purely technical side, Viessmann provides an extensive range of HVAC products as well as services, industrial and refrigeration solutions. *Condensing technology oil and gas systems *Solar thermal systems *Photovoltaic systems *Heat pumps *Biomass heating systems (wood) *Combined heat and power generation (CHP) *Biogas systems *Fuel cell systems *Ventilation and air-conditioning equipment * Digital services for seamless connectivity with products and systems for commercial, industrial, and residential purposes ranging from 1.5 to 120,000 kW.  History  The Viessmann Group originated in Hof on the banks of the Saale, where Johann Viessmann set up a small workshop in 1917 specialising in the construction of steel boilers. In 1937 he moved operations to Allendorf (Eder) in northern Hesse. After World War II, Hans Viessmann took over his father's company and modernized it by introducing series production and industrial processes. In the 1950s and 1960s, oil replaced the previously used solid fuels, whilst steel boilers became increasingly important. Viessmann seized these growth opportunities and developed into a medium-sized industrial enterprise with 1,400 employees. The 1970s were a time of expansion. In 1972, Viessmann opened its first foreign factory in Faulquemont (France), followed by Waterloo, Ontario (Canada), the first site outside Europe, in 1978. With the development of new technologies, the company responded to the challenges of the energy crisis: In 1976, the first solar collectors were produced, followed by the first heat pumps in 1978. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up new markets – initially in the former East Germany and later in Eastern Europe. At the end of 1991/start of 1992, Dr. Hans Viessmann handed the company over to his son Dr. Martin Viessmann. In the 1990s, major structural changes were taking place: from floorstanding boilers to wall mounted boilers, from oil to gas, from gas-fired boilers to condensing technology. Viessmann set up a new production facility for wall mounted gas boilers in Allendorf, whilst developing an international sales office and branch network. As of 2005, the company launched the \\"Efficiency Plus\\" campaign focusing on demonstrating energy saving and sustainable processes and reducing the company's environmental footprint, whilst also expanding the product range with the acquisition of other technologies. Viessmann first acquired wood combustion specialists Mawera and Köb, followed by KWT, a manufacturer of large heat pumps and ESS for combined heating and power systems. BIOFerm, Schmack and Carbotech acquisitions covered the area of biogas technology, and with an evacuated tube solar collectors plant in Dachang (China), the company has expanded its market presence into solar thermal systems. Following the introduction of the company's \\"Efficiency Plus\\" campaign, Viessmann received both in 2009 and 2011 the German Sustainability Award for most sustainable production and most sustainable brand in Germany, respectively. In 2010 the company also received the Energy Efficiency Award for optimising energy production and use in its manufacturing facilities. In 2013, the company received the German Sustainability Award for the third time. Since January 2018, Martin Viessmann leads the Group as Chairman of the Executive Board. The operative business is headed by two Group-CEOs: Max Viessmann is responsible for the Climate Solutions division and new digital business, while Joachim Janssen concentrates on the Industrial Systems and Refrigeration Solutions divisions. Viessmann Academy The Viessmann Academy was unofficially established by the company in the 60s, in order to meet the ever growing demand for training and expertise of employees and trade partners, which was reflecting the constant expansion of the technological spectrum of modern HVAC systems. Today, the Viessmann Academy, with its new facilities located in Allendorf (Eder) provides a comprehensive programme of basic as well as advanced training courses for HVAC contractors, planners, architects, property developers, flue-gas inspectors, education institutions and Viessmann's own employees, in total of more than 92,000 industry specialists each year.  Vocational training  Since summer 2011, together with Edertalschule in Frankenberg and Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, Viessmann has been offering upper school students an insight into the engineering profession in the topics robotics and IT in the Young Engineer Academy project. In addition, various excursions are offered. Furthermore, in cooperation with Battenberg Comprehensive School, Viessmann offers pupils at Middle School the opportunity to become intensively involved in technical apprenticeships in the MINT sector. The project is called \\"Young Technician Academy\\" (YOTA).

Hopper, ‘Potter, Vincent (c.1614–1661?)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008 accessed 24 July 2009 Early life and career Potter was born in Warwickshire. In 1635 as a member of the Massachusetts Bay Company he sailed to Boston, Massachusetts, where he was employed as a soldier at Castle Island Fort. He spent four years in North America before returning to England and may have fought in the Pequot War. A strict Puritan, he traded with New England until he joined the parliamentarian army. In January 1643 he was commissioned as an officer of horse by Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke. After Greville's death he continued to fight as a cavalry officer for Parliament until 1645 when he took over as parliamentary commissioner to the army from his brother Captain John Potter. Devotion Potter was a diligent commissioner. He drew up lists of former soldiers (\\"Potter's lists\\") to help him settle army pay arrears, and became the foremost administrator in this area. He continued to perform as a commissioner during the Second Civil War. Controversy Potter was one of the 59 Commissioners who sat in judgment at the trial of Charles I. He attended the trial every day in Westminster Hall, and attended in the Painted Chamber on all days but five- January 8, 12, 13, 18, and 20. He was present on 27 January 1649 when sentence was pronounced against Charles, and he signed and sealed the death-warrant, which commanded Charles to execution.Noble,p. 129 On 6 March the same year, he also signed the death warrants of five prominent Royalist peers who had been captured during the Second Civil War, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, Lord Capel, the Earl of Holland, and the Earl of Norwich. Career under Cromwell In June Potter was made a full colonel and helped to plan and organise the logistics of Cromwell's Irish campaign. He performed a similar service for Cromwell during his Scottish campaign in 1651. He remained in Scotland with a mandate to improving lands in Scotland occupied by the English Army. In 1652 he was posted to Ireland to assist the parliamentarian regime. One account states that in 1660 at the restoration of the monarchy Potter surrendered himself in obedience to the proclamation, and was one of those excepted both as to life and estate in the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, but judgment was not to follow, for the pains and penalties were to be such as would be expressed in a future act of parliament. However, Robert Howcott, who arrested John Downes, who was another of the regicides, stated in a petition to King Charles II that he has also discovered and apprehended Vincent Potter and taken him to the Lord Mayor (presumably of London) who sent him to the \\"Serjant at armes\\".The National Archives: SP29/9 Trial and death He was arraigned at the Sessions House in the Old Bailey, October 16, 1660, and pleaded not guilty. His trial commenced on the 16 November, at which he asked for a delay as he pleaded he was ill and in great pain (probably from kidney stones). However the trial went ahead and he was found guilty of high treason and condemned to death for his part in the regicide of Charles I, but he died in the Tower of London in late 1661 or early 1662 before the sentence could be carried out.House of Lords Journal Volume 11: 7 February 1662 References ;Attribution Regicides of Charles I 1661 deaths Year of birth uncertain Prisoners in the Tower of London English army officers People of colonial Massachusetts ","title":"Vincent Potter"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",I]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/1.md","filePath":"people/1.md"}'),D={name:"people/1.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
