It is produced by Full House Media of Sonali Jaffer and Amir Jaffer. The final broadcast was on 29 September 2017. Plot The show is set in Haryana. It focuses on issues related to superstition. The plot revolves around a child named Devanshi \\"divinely\\" selected as a dedication to the goddess. The mystery is that the innocence of the child outwits the wiles of adults around her. =14 year leap= After 14 years, Devanshi and Sakshi have grown up and both left Jwalapuri as per their father's wish. However, due her to sister's mental illness, she has to come to Jwalapuri again. Sakshi becomes an obstacle in the path of the divas. Instead of Sakshi, Devanshi becomes a target of fire bow but Vardhan, now a little cruel towards this superstitious belief, saves her. The villagers misunderstand Sakshi for Devanshi and Devanshi for Sakshi. They both become targets of the angry villagers and Kusum, but Vardhan always saves them. Meanwhile Devanshi and Vardhan start falling for each other. After all everyone finds out that Devanshi is Sakshi and Sakshi is Devanshi. Due to this Sakshi is cured of her mental illness and falls in love with Vardhan, but soon realizes that Vardhan is in love with Devanshi. Devanshi finds out about Kusum's sins including her parents' death. Sakshi and Kusum start plotting against Devanshi, but later Sakshi realizes that Devanshi loves her a lot and stops her plotting. Kusum tries to kill her and Devanshi asks her to leave for while, so Sakshi does. Devanshi and Vardhan get married. With Ishwar's help, she exposes Kusum in front of the villagers, but Kusum manages to escape with Mohan's help. There comes Menka, who is married for Vardhan's cousin Golu, but she is in love with Vardhan. Kusum enters as Menka's bua and plots against Devanshi. Devanshi and Vardhan consummate when Kusum and Mohan try to make Menka and Vardhan close. Devanshi gets pregnant, but is framed that she is having illegitimate child. Ishwar dies from a heart attack caused by Kusum. The villagers try to kill Devanshi and she falls in the river and loses her child. She plans her revenge. =10 months later= Everyone thinks that Devanshi is dead, while she has become a business woman named Kalki Shah. She returns to Jwalapuri and makes everyone's life difficult. She makes Mohan and Kusum against each other, wins Nutan, Bhupi and tries to separate Menka and Vardaan. Kusum eventually tries to make Vardaan and Kalki fall for each other and marry, because Kalki's husband will get 50% of her property. This makes Menka really jealous and she tries to kill Kalki and put the blame on Kusum. But there comes Pavan Bakshi, who loves Kalki, and states that Kalki is his wife and eventually saves her from Menka's deadly trap. Pavan starts falling in love with Devanshi whilst helping her and does not want her to go back with Vardaan so starts plotting against her. Eventually, she is successful in helping Vardaan see that Menka is only after his money and thus their wedding does not happen. Vardaan later on learns about the innocence of Devanshi and his sadness melts Kalki's heart who wanted to make his life difficult. Further to this, she exposes the truth about Kusum Sundari once again to everyone with the help of Pavan who wants to save Devanshi from Kusum, Mohan and the villagers. An 11-year old girl comes out of the hundi who happens to be called Kalki and tells everyone she is from an orphanage and to leave 'Devanshi didi' alone. When Vardaan finds out the whole truth, he is initially very upset with himself and tries to kill himself but Devanshi stops him, deciding to give him another chance. Kusum Sundari and Mohan are arrested by the police, although Mohan tries to escape so Pavan and Vardaan chase after him to kill him. Devanshi comes and see them and is upset with them for trying to kill Mohan. The police inspector asks who hit Mohan on the head last. Devanshi saw Vardaan hit him last but doesn't want Vardaan to go to jail. Pavan decides to take the blame on himself for Devanshi's happiness. He tells Devanshi the truth that he was plotting against her because he did not want her to be with Vardaan and that he has realizes what true love is. The police are about to take Pavan away but she stops them. She tells the police that it was actually Vardaan who hit Mohan. Vardaan is shocked. Devanshi assures him that she will get him out of jail but she cannot lie and so she hopes he will understand. However, much to her shock he pushes her away and accuses her of telling the police the truth to get revenge on him so that she can be with Pavan. Pavan comes to her rescue. She tells Vardaan he is not worth her love. Vardaan goes with the police. She is angry with Pavan because he betrayed her trust by plotting against her. Kalki(child) later reminds Devanshi that Pavan saved her life and deserves a second chance. She also makes Pavan her brother. Vardaan begins plotting against Devanshi. Another evil villain enters in their lives she is the child of Kukarni Devi who is against Maiyya and targets Kalki (child). Kukarni Devi's child takes the avatar of Pavan's sister who is called Maya. Her truth is exposed and Pavan and Devanshi decide to fight against her together. Vardaan becomes jealous when he enters the house and sees Pavan with Devanshi. At first, he tries to remind Devanshi that he is her husband though this results in her becoming angry as he is forcing himself on her. She decides to divorce Vardaan though he refuses to divorce and creates trouble for her. Soon, Vardaan is murdered by Mohan for revenge. After defeating all the major villains in the show, Pavan and Devanshi get married because Devanshi realizes Pavan's true love for her and reciprocates. They live happily ever with Kalki, the child.

In 2015, they were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the world respectively. In September 2015, they were publicly accused of cheating by orienting a played card to show a missing high honour (Ace, King, Queen) in the led suit at the European Bridge Championship in 2014. Three separate investigations were conducted, one by the (FIGB), one by the European Bridge League (EBL) and one by the American Contract Bridge League. On March 19, 2016, the FIGB banned the pair for three years. The FIGB hearing also investigated cheating by Fantoni and Nunes against Italy in the finals of the Bermuda Bowl in 2013 using the same method. Fantoni and Nunes appealed this ruling to both the FIGB and the Italian Olympic Committee; the appeals were rejected. On July 2018 FIGB revoked the judgment. On July 18, 2016, the European Bridge League (EBL) banned each from play for five years. On July 26, 2016, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) expelled them from their league and stripped them of all related masterpoints, titles, ranks and privileges. The players' appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the EBL ban resulted in a judgement in their favour in January 2018.CAS 2016/A/4783 Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes v. European Bridge League (EBL) Retrieved 3 February 2018 Only the ACBL sanction remaines in force, and the EBL publicly stated that they were still barred from all EBL events at least until April 2019 However the Federal Appeal Tribunal of the FIGB subsequently lifted the players' suspension from FIGB events. Procedures In Italy, cheating allegations and hearings related to the game of contract bridge have three stages of proceedings: 1st ‚Äì Italian Bridge Federation (la Federazione Italiana Giuoco Bridge, FIGB); 2nd ‚Äì Federal Court of Appeals (Corte d‚ÄôAppello Federale); 3rd ‚Äì Italian National Olympic Committee (Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano, CONI) under its Sport Guarantor's Committee (Collegio di Garanzia dello Sport). As a member of the European Bridge League, the Monaco Bridge Federation is subject to its disciplinary procedures.  Previous allegations = The \\"black-out\\" deal = On May 1, 2015, during the Italian Open Teams Championship, Nunes made a defensive play which enabled him and Fantoni to defeat opponents' slam contract by three tricks. The play, and the rapidity with which it was made, were considered sufficiently unusual for the deal to be referred by FIGB to the National Sports Judge for adjudication. The charge was transmission of unauthorized information. The judge, a lawyer by profession, heard evidence from witnesses of fact and expert evidence from bridge players. Nunes said in his defense that he had had 'un momento di \\"obnubilamento\\"' (English: a moment of clouding) or '\\"black-out\\"'. On June 12, 2015, the judge handed down a reasoned written decision in which he addressed both the facts and the law. He concluded that illegal transmission of information had not been proved and acquitted Fantoni and Nunes; no appeal was filed. The Italian proceedings have been summarised in English.  Card orientation signals  Maaijke Mevius, a Dutch amateur bridge player and trained scientist, noticed a correlation between horizontal or vertical orientation of the cards played by Fulvio Fantoni and Claudio Nunes and their honor holdings in the suit. In brief, the hypothesis was that a card played vertically signaled the presence of an otherwise unknown honor card (A, K or Q) in the suit, and that a card played horizontally denied it. In September 2015, Mevius emailed the evidence to Boye Brogeland, who, after consultation with Ishmael Del'Monte, Australian bridge professional and Vice-Chair of the WBF High Level Players Commission, and American player Brad Moss, decided to issue an ultimatum to Fantoni, a personal acquaintance of his, to come forward with a confession before the findings were published. No such confession was made. On September 13, 2015, American expert Kit Woolsey published an article on the Bridge Winners website demonstrating a statistical proof of Mevius's hypothesis. The allegations were reported both by official bridge organizations and in mainstream media. =Monaco withdraws from 2015 Bermuda Bowl= Monaco was to be have been represented at the 2015 Bermuda Bowl in Chennai, India by a team consisting of Fulvio Fantoni, Claudio Nunes, Geir Helgemo, Tor Helness, Franck Multon and playing captain Pierre Zimmermann. In recognition of the controversy caused by the public allegations against Fantoni and Nunes, the Monegasque Bridge Federation decided to withdraw from the Bermuda Bowl 2015 \\"in order to preserve the interests of bridge and so that the event may be played with the greatest serenity.\\" On September 16, 2015, the World Bridge Federation announced that Monaco would be replaced by Denmark. = Hearings = FIGB Hearings: On March 19, 2016, the Italian Bridge Federation (FIGB) issued a three-year ban against each player. On June 10, 2016, the Corte d‚ÄôAppello Federale upheld the decision. On July 19, 2016 Fantoni and Nunes submitted an appeal to the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) against the FIGB ban, which the CONI eventually rejected on October 4, 2016. EBL Hearings: On July 18, 2016 Fantoni and Nunes were banned from all European Bridge League events by its Disciplinary Commission for a period of five years, and banned from playing as a partnership for life. The English Bridge Union (EBU) report of the EBL ruling of July 18, 2016 includes a link to a YouTube video made by EBU website designer Michael Clark \\"showing the incidents taking place\\", focusing on Fantoni's opening leads. ACBL Hearings: During the summer North American Bridge Championships held in Washington, D.C., the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) held a three-day hearing regarding the accusations made against Fantoni-Nunes. On July 26, 2016, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) announced that the ACBL Ethical Oversight Committee had unanimously found that overwhelming evidence established that Fantoni and Nunes had engaged in collusive cheating. In consequence, the latter were expelled from the ACBL and stripped of all their ACBL masterpoints, titles, ranks and privileges. Further, their partners and teammates were subject to mandatory forfeiture of all masterpoints, titles and ranks earned during the four years preceding the final of the 2015 Spingold Trophy. On July 29, 2016, the ACBL clarified and corrected that announcement: forfeiture by partners and teammates applied only to events in which they had played with Fantoni or Nunes, and only to the four years preceding the date of the decision; namely, July 24, 2016. Partly due to the Fantoni-Nunes case, the ACBL created a permanent anti-cheating committee. Court of Arbitration for Sport and EBL and FIGB reaction: On April 26 and 27, 2017, the Court of Arbitration for Sport conducted a hearing, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes v. European Bridge League (EBL). In January 2018 the Court of Arbitration for Sport published its judgement on the players' appeal. It found in their favour, saying that \\"the majority of the Panel concludes that the exchange of information through the Code has not been proven to its comfortable satisfaction and rules that the appeal filed by the Players shall be upheld\\". The EBL clarified that the pair were still barred from play at least until April 2019. It is considering making changes to its rules on eligibility for future EBL championships. In the light of the CAS verdict, the Federal Appeal Tribunal of the FIGB subsequently lifted the players' suspension. Fantoni and Nunes have said that they do not intend to play together in future.

However, this never existed as a breed. Although Refrigerator Cats are frequently described as a lost longhaired breed, the reports describe them as thick-furred.  Breed standards  There is no standard for this extinct variety. The cats upon which the reports were based were pink-eyed albino cats.  Behavior  Newspapers reported these cats to be cold-loving, light-sensitive and prone to heat exhaustion or fits at normal temperatures.  History of the cat breed  In 1894, the New York TimesNew York Times, July 29th, 1894The Reading Times, July 30th, 1894 ran reports about a race of thick-furred, short-tailed chubby cats that had arisen through natural selection in the cold storage warehouses in Pittsburgh. These cats supposedly suffered heat exhaustion and fits if taken from their home in a cold storage warehouse and placed near a warm stove. According to news reports that circulated, the cats had been developed to combat the thick-furred rats that had evolved to live in cold storage warehouses in Pittsburgh. They preyed upon the rats with the same enthusiasm that cats at normal temperatures hunted prey. The Reading Times attributed the story to The New York Tribune. The story of the Refrigerator Cats became more elaborate as it was reprinted elsewhere. Readers were told that the ordinary rats of the United States had originated in the cold climate of Spitzbergen and were well-adapted to a cold climate. They were fat with long, thick hair, furry tails and they had begun to infest cold storage warehouses.The Philadelphia Record of December 1894 This, according to the stories, necessitated the introduction of cats into the warehouses. Most of the cats died due to the excessive cold, but one cat thrived when introduced into the cold storage rooms of the Pennsylvania Storage company. In 1895, The Pittsburgh Dispatch printed a much-embroidered version of the story.March 1895, The Pittsburgh Dispatch It told its readers that in the Union storage warehouses there was a particular cold-loving cats descend from ordinary well- behaved fireside cats. It was custom in the storage house to collect all of the cats into one room at the end of the day, but this one cat was often missing and was to be found lying on one of the cooling pipes which run along the ceiling of the room, fast asleep. The pipes were covered with a frost of about a half inch, and, while the temperature of the room was maintained at 10 degrees (Fahrenheit) above zero (-12 degrees Celsius), the cooling pipes were much colder. Another peculiar effect of the cold upon the cats was its ability to rejuvenate them. Old cats became as playful and active as young kittens. This account was widely recirculated during March and April 1895. A month later, a report in the Cincinnati EnquirerCincinnati Enquirer, April 1895 transplanted the story from Pittsburgh to New York, crediting it to an anonymous traveling man: ‚ÄúFinally a thick-furred cat was procured, that lived, and subsequently a mate for it. A litter of kittens came, and it was noticed their fur was longer than that of the parent cat. There have now been five generations born in the warehouse, the fur of each a little longer and thicker than that of the preceding generation, until now they are covered with fur as thick and close as that of a muskrat, and when removed from the warehouse they cannot stand the warm climate, and soon die. It is a distinct breed of cold- storage cats.‚Äù In Britain, the respected naturalist, Richard Lydekker appears to have taken the story at face value. His monograph in a volume of Allen's Naturalist's Library in 1895, though wholly based on an American newspaper report, gave credibility to the story. That monograph was the origin of the term Refrigerator Cat. The Spectator was cynical of Lydekker's unquestioning acceptance of newspaper accounts, in particular the claim that if the cats were taken into the open air from the cold storehouse during the hot season they became sick and died. As The Spectator noted, refrigerating-houses were cold enough to prevent meat from thawing, but not so cold as to \\"induce such a change in the natural habits of cats.\\" It wrote that the story probably needed revision.The Spectator. 4th May, 1895 In 1896, Lydekker documented the supposed cold storage cat in his Handbook to the Carnivora, Part I,Lydekker, Richard. Handbook to the Carnivora. Part 1, Cats, civets, and mungoose. 1896, pages 158-160 describing them as a \\"peculiar breed of Cats, adapted to the conditions under which they must exist to find their prey.\\" He noted that they were short-tailed and chubby, with thick under-fur and remarkable ‚Äòfeelers‚Äô. Their cheek whiskers and eyebrow whiskers apparently grew to a length of five and six inches, rather than the normal three inches. He attributed this adaptation to the dim light in the cold storage warehouses making the cats primarily dependent on their sense of touch. His account mentioned that taking such a cat into the open air, particularly during the hot season, caused it to die within a few hours because it could not endure a high temperature. An introduction to a stove, normally a favoured haunt of domestic cats, would allegedly send it into fits (seizures). The cold storage cats story was investigated, and debunked, as early as June 1895 in several papers.The Salt Lake Tribune, June 30th, 1895Pittsburgh Refrigerator Cat, Messybeast.com wrote that the truth about the wonderful ‚Äúbreed‚Äù had been published in the American Naturalist,The American Naturalist (Vol XXIX, 1895) and was far less remarkable than the original stories circulating in the press. The American Naturalist noted that an account of the cats had been reprinted in some \\"excellent scientific journals\\" in England, though the journals had shown a lack of caution in reprinting material from newspapers without independently verifying it. Mrs. Alice Bodington had written to the secretary of the Cold- Storage Company to ascertain the truth about the cats. He responded that the newspaper article was an exaggeration. The cold-storage house was divided into rooms of various sizes, with temperatures ranging from 10 degrees to 40 degrees above zero Fahrenheit (-12 to +4 Celsius). When the company discovered mice (not rats) in one of those rooms, they transferred one of the cats from the general warehouse to the affected cold-storage room. While there, the cat had a litter of seven kittens. Four kittens were transferred to the general warehouses, while three remained in the cold-storage house. Once the cold-room kittens were old enough to be independent, their mother was returned to the general warehouse. The sudden change of temperature made her listless, but when she was returned to the cold-storage room she immediately revived. The secretary of the Cold-Storage Company described the cats' whiskers as being normal length (contrary to Lyddeker's description) while the fur was thicker than the cats in the other warehouses. He wrote that the cats living in the cold room were larger, stronger and healthier than the cats in any of the other warehouses. The American Naturalist concluded that the change of environment had the same effect as the change of season from summer to winter i.e. the cats grew a thicker coat. It was not a case of survival through natural selection of a chance variation. It was also likely that the thick- furred adult cat simply found the sudden change back to warm quarters uncomfortable, just as a person in a heavy coat would find the sudden change uncomfortable. Nevertheless, reports continued to circulate later in 1895 stating that it was impossible to keep the mother cat in good health in the warm rooms, but that she thrived in the cold rooms.Logansport Pharos Tribune, November 1st, 1895 According to a widely reprinted report in 1899,Pittsburgh Dispatch, December 1899 Mr. F. Lydekker, an Englishman and Fellow of the Royal Society, had published the first scientific account that did justice to a variety of cat peculiar to the US, and found in the vicinity of Pittsburgh. In 1901Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, January 1901Chicago Tribune, February 17, 1901 attached the Refrigerator Cat story to a topical story about the development of a large cold storage depot in Manila in the Philippines. The immense cold storage depot which had just been completed at Manila was in need of cats. According to the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, the facility was to be supplied with cats developed about five or six years earlier at the Union Storage company. The Union Storage company was said to have experimented with various cat breeds to find cats suitable for living in the cold rooms. It had, according to the news story, tried a pair of high-bred cats, but they had sickened and died. Finally a pair of white felines without a pedigree were obtained and were first placed In the general storage room for a time; and then into a room where the temperature was gradually lowered until it was below the freezing point. When they were accustomed to the low temperature they were placed in the cold storage rooms where the temperature was never above 32 Fahrenheit (0 Celsius). According to that report, and ignoring Bodington's investigation and report of 1895, the offspring of the original pair were able to withstand even lower temperatures and within a few generations, their descendants had become a distinct breed of cats, able to stand the lowest temperatures at the storage rooms. The company allegedly bred about fifteen of such cats and distributed them to other warehouses, but then contradicted itself by stating the company had between ten and thirty such cats. The cats were said to be very tame when within the confines of the cold storage vaults, but when they permitted to go out into the sunlight and heat they became quite wild. When shipping them, it was necessary to place them in boxes before they left the warehouse. They had to be shipped in baskets or boxes well lined with ice, as they would otherwise suffer from the heat. In addition to mice, the Refrigerator Cats were given milk and a weekly serving of meat. They were described as short-tailed, with heavy fur over an inch long. Their eyebrows and whiskers were longer, thicker and stronger than those of a house cat. They were described as resembling an Angora, at that time a generic term for any long-haired cat including Persians and Maine Coon cats. The original story was again revived in 1902Indiana Weekly Messenger, December 17, 1902 after which it seemed to go quiet in the press until 1912 when the New York Mail ran a report on cats employed by the government.New York Mail, September 1912 It attributed its source as The Hutchinson News: \\"Uncle Sam maintains in the Philippine Islands a small army of ‚Äòcold storage‚Äô cats. Their upkeep costs the government about $15 a year each.\\"The Hutchinson News, September 9th, 1912 While the government did indeed fund working cats at various locations, the fictitious Refrigerator Cats would not have been among them. The urban legend of the Pittsburgh Refrigerator Cats periodically resurfaced in the twentieth century. The Greenfield Daily Report (January 21, 1929) printed a contributor's reminiscence regarding the local carpenter having an odd-looking kittens. It was a white long-hair, but did not look like a Persian. The correspondent described it as looking more like a polar bear's cub. The carpenter claimed it was a Cold Storage Cat. The account was attributed to Mara Evens in the Saturday Evening Post, adding that after several generations roaming the neighbourhood, the descendants of the Cold Storage cats reverted to shorthairs. This would have been the case if long- hair cats bred with short-haired cats, because the gene for long-hair is recessive. In 1936, Carl Van Vechten wrote about this fictitious breed, telling his readers that some of the first felines carried into the bleak quarters of the cold store perished, but a few survived and, after a winter or two, grew an astonishing fur coat as thick as beaver fur. He repeated the claim that the cold-storage cats would suffer from heat exhaustion if they were exposed to a New York July day.Carl van Vechten, The Tiger in the House, 1936, page 12 Ida M Mellen, a leading American authority on cats, further investigated the original story in 1949. She interviewed people who had known the cats in the 1890s, and she found that Lydekker's apparently learned article had been based on a highly inaccurate newspaper report. There had been no attempt to establish cats in the Pittsburgh cold-storage warehouse because there had never been any rats in there due to the extreme temperatures. In reality, a cat belonging to one of the employees had given birth to a litter of kittens in one of the cold rooms, and had raised them. Far from being distributed around the other cold-storage warehouses (there being no others in the city at that time) the kittens did not thrive. However, there was one interesting fact about the family of cats at the cold storage warehouse - they were not blue-eyed white cats, they were albinos. Her research uncovered the fact that the mother was a pink-eyed albino and the father was also white (eye colour unknown). The kittens were all pink-eyed albinos which means that the father was either a carrier of that gene or, more likely, was also a pink-eyed albino. In all likelihood the parents were closely related. The cats had excellent hearing, but none of them could tolerate bright light due to their unpigmented eyes.Ida M Mellen, 1949. The science and mystery of the cat.

It is considered to be the most perfect ancient Greek theatre with regard to acoustics and aesthetics.

At a maximum capacity of 13,000 to 14,000 spectators, the theatre hosted music, singing and dramatic games that were included in the worship of Asclepius. It was also used as a means to heal patients, since there was a belief that the observation of dramatic shows had positive effects on mental and physical health. Today, the monument attracts a large number of Greek and foreign visitors and is used for the performance of ancient drama plays. The first modern performance conducted at the theatre was Sophocles's tragedy Electra. It was played in 1938, directed by Dimitris Rontiris, starring Katina Paxinou and Eleni Papadaki. Performances stopped due to World War II. Theatrical performances, in the framework of the organized festival, began again in 1954. In 1955 they were established as an annual event for the presentation of ancient drama. The Epidaurus Festival continues today and is carried out during the summer months. The theatre has been sporadically used to host major musical events. In the framework of the Epidaurus Festival, well-known Greek and foreign actors have appeared, including the Greek soprano Maria Callas, who performed Norma in 1960 and M√©d√©e in 1961.  Description  The monument retains the characteristic tripartite structure of a Hellenistic theatre that has an theatron, orchestra, and skene. During Roman times, the theatre (unlike many Greek theatres) did not suffer any modifications. The auditorium is divided vertically into two unequal parts, the lower hollow or theatre and the upper theatre or epitheatre. The two sub-sections are separated by a horizontal corridor for the movement of spectators (width 1.82 m.), the frieze. The lower part of the auditorium wedge is divided into 12 sections, while the upper part is divided into 22 sections. The lower rows of the upper and lower auditoriums have a presidency form, namely places reserved for important people. The design of the auditorium is unique and based on three marking centres. Due to this special design, the architects achieved both optimal acoustics and an opening for better viewing. The circular orchestra, with a diameter of 20 m, constitutes the centre of the theatre. In the centre is a circular stone plate, the base of the altar or thymele. The orchestra is surrounded by a special underground drainage pipeline of 1.99 m width, called the euripos. The euripos was covered by a circular stone walkway. Opposite the auditorium and behind the orchestra develops the stage building of the theatre (skene), which was constructed in two phases: the first is placed at the end of the 4th century BCE and the second in the middle of the 2nd century BCE. The format of the scene (which is partly preserved today) is dated up to the Hellenistic period and consisted of a two-storey stage building and a proscenium in front of the stage. There was a colonnade in front of the proscenium and on both of its sides, the two backstages slightly protruded. East and west of the two backstages there were two small rectangular rooms for the needs of the performers. Two ramps lead to the roof of the proscenium, the logeion, where the actors later played. Finally, the theatre had two gates, which are now restored.  Excavations  The first systematic excavation of the theatre began in 1881 by the Archaeological Society, under the direction of archaeologist Panayis Kavvadias and preserved in very good condition thanks to the restorations of P. Kavvadias (1907), of A. Orlandos (1954-1963) and the Preservation Committee for Epidaurus Monuments (1988 to 2016). With the work done, the theatre has been recovered - except the stage building - almost entirely in its original form.

The mountains hold a well-preserved remnant of Atlantic Forest, and are contained in the fully protected Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station. Location The name \\"Jur√©ia\\" means prominent point in the Tupi-Guaran√≠ language. The Serra da Jur√©ia is a Precambrian horst on the coast of the municipality of Iguape in the south of S√£o Paulo state. The massif covers and rises to . The eastern side falls steeply to the ocean. It is an inselberg connected to the mainland by a sandy alluvial plain that was formed 5100 years ago during the post-glacial Canan√©ia Transgression, when the sea was about higher than at present. The Paranapu massif, part of the Serra dos Itatins, rises from the plain to the north. Hydrology The streams formed in the Serra da Jur√©ia are clear, with a pH of 5-6.5, and are low in nutrients. A few originate in springs in the campo, but most are rain-fed and intermittent. Quiet streams may become torrential during times of heavy rainfall. The Una do Prelado River, a blackwater river, meanders in a northeast direction through the plain between the Serra da Jur√©ia and the Serra dos Itatins. The Serra da Jur√©ia is divided by the valley of the Rio Verde, which flows south to the ocean. Environment Average annual temperatures range from . Average annual rainfall is . The climate is tropical humid with no dry season. At least of rain falls in the driest month. The Serra da Jur√©ia and its surroundings hold one of the best preserved remnants of Atlantic Forest on the coast of S√£o Paulo. Above the mountains are covered by campo vegetation - fields of grass, herbs and shrubs. The slopes and base of the mountain are clothed in evergreen tropical forest. There is a wide variety of species of flora, some rare. Conservation The Department of the Environment planned to develop a \\"green\\" housing project on the banks of the Rio Verde. The project was cancelled in the 1980s when the Empresa Nuclebr√°s Brasileira decided to build the Iguape 4 and Iguape 5 power plants in a area that included the entire Serra da Jur√©ia. By law, the area surrounding the nuclear power plant would have to be made an ecological station. The power plant project was abandoned but the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station was created on 20 January 1986, covering the Jur√©ia Massif and the entire watershed of the Una do Prelado River.

The site is composed of grassland, heath, ponds, and associated damp habitats now rare in Northumberland. Location and natural features Arcot Hall Grasslands and Ponds is located in the north-east of England on of land situated to the south-east of the town of Cramlington. The A1068 at its south- east extent forms an easterly boundary for the area of the site, and the A19 at its north-east extent forms the southern boundary. The site is at about above sea level, within a relatively flat terrain of farmland with encroaching residential and industrial areas - notably the development of Cramington new town from 1958 onwards. The site covers a spectrum of habitats running from an inundated pond area, through wet and dry grassland and heath, to woodland. It is considered to be of regional importance for its invertebrate population, including 33 species of water-beetle. The site also provides a habitat for nationally rare Least Minor moth, Photedes captiuncula. The wet areas of the site are relatively new, arising out of upwelling water from circa 1966 onwards, and so exhibit early stages of vegetative colonisation. =Vegetation= The grassland sections of the site are colonised by adder's-tongue Ophioglossum vulgatum and dyer's greenweed Genista tinctoria, both uncommon in Northumberland, as well as yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, common knapweed Centaurea nigra, common milkwort Polygala vulgaris, cat's-ear Hypochaeris radicata, eyebright Euphrasia officinalis, and common spotted and lesser butterfly orchida Dactylorhiza fuchsii and Platanthera bifolia. Acid grassland on the site is a habitat for mat-grass Nardus stricta, tormentil Potentilla erecta, heath-grass Danthonia decumbens, devil's-bit scabious Succisa pratensis and betony Stachys officinalis, as well as, in wetter areas, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and pepper-saxifrage Silaum silaus. Heathland on the site is dominated by heather Calluna vulgaris. Scrub areas are composed of birch, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, gorse Ulex europaeus, blackthorn Prunus spinosa bramble Rubus fruticosus and creeping soft-grass Holcus mollis. Wetter areas of the site are dominated by soft rush Juncus effusus, and stable wet areas exhibit Sphagnum moss. Other areas have sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and herbs such as water mint Mentha aquatica and sneezewort Achillea ptarmica. The bulrush Typha latifolia, floating sweet-grass Glyceria fluitans and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris are also found. =Condition= The site is divided into three units for SSSI management purposes; all were rated \\"unfavourable - recovering\\" in 2011.

Life Katherina Ekey was born in Hungen, a small town in the hilly countryside to the north of Frankfurt am Main. By the time she had married a man called \\"Guttmann\\" she had moved to Hamburg and joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). In 1914, when war broke out, the decision of the SPD party leadership to support funding for the war was not universally supported within the party, and became more contentious as the slaughter on the frontline and destitution at home grew. In 1917 the party split apart, primarily over the issue of support for the war, and Ketty Guttmann moved over with breakaway faction, which became known as the Independent Social Democratic Party (Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands / USPD). During the year of revolution that followed the war Guttmann gained a reputation as a public speaker and activist. It is not clear when her husband died, but in connection with the events of 1919 she is described as a \\"36 years old widow\\". She started a union for prostitutes in Hamburg and fought for collective bargaining rights for prostitutes. The union disintegrated once the revolutionary events died down. When the USPD itself split at the end of 1920 she was part of the majority that made up the newly created German Communist Party. In 1921 she was elected as a Communist member to the \\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\" (as the regional legislature was known), retaining her seat till 1924. She also campaigned for the rights of prostitutes. She was a co-founder, and then one of the two principal contributors, to the weekly news sheet \\"The Pillory - Publication of the Hamburg Rent Girls\\" (\\"Der Pranger ‚Äì Organ der Hamburger Kontrollm√§dchen\\"), which was produced by the Hamburg Prostitutes' Union. After the short lived Hamburg Uprising in October 1923 she fled to Moscow where she remained for some months. She came home in 1924, disillusioned. Under the slogan \\"Away from Moscow\\" (\\"Los von Moskau\\") - also the title of a leaflet she published on the subject - she launched a tirade against the Communist Party and the Comintern which she condemned as opportunistic and counter-revolutionary. She called for the Comintern to be broken up because, far from representing the workers' revolution, it simply followed the foreign policy interests of the Soviet Union. In some ways her position came close to that of the breakaway Communist Workers' Party (\\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\\" / KAPD). She found some support for her views among workers' groups in Hamburg, but the Communist Party German leadership, which nurtured cordial relations with its Soviet sister party, was unimpressed, and in July 1924 Ketty Guttmann was expelled from the party. Outside the party she nevertheless remained active as an extreme left-wing communist, joining the \\"council communist\\" General Workers' Union Unity Organisation. Over the next few years she contributed articles to Heinrich Laufenberg's radical left-wing culture journal, \\"Die Harpune\\". For most purposes her footprint disappears from subsequent historical sources, but it is known that she survived the Nazi years and relocated to Burscheid from where she was in correspondence with Ruth Fischer in 1947. In the 1950s, she still published in anarchist periodicals References Members of the Hamburg Parliament Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Independent Social Democratic Party politicians Communist Party of Germany politicians German feminists Prostitution in Germany Socialist feminists People from Hungen People from Giessen People from the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1883 births 1967 deaths ","title":"Ketty Guttmann"},{"id":"51120308","text":"Angle Lake can refer to: *Angle Lake, Alberta, an unincorporated area in Canada *Angle Lake (Alberta), a lake in Canada *Angle Lake in Angle Township, Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota in the United States *Angle Lake, Washington, in SeaTac, Washington *Angle Lake station, a rail transit station in SeaTac, Washington ","title":"Angle Lake"},{"id":"51120339","text":"Ghosts is an anthology of themed fantasy and science fiction short stories on the subject of ghosts edited by Isaac Asimov, Martin H.

Biography  When Laroque was constable of the Royal Guard, a cannonball smashed his leg during the battle of Malplaquet, and they had to cut it off above the knee. He left the service with the Cross of Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis and a pension from Louis XIV. In 1721, he took over the privilege of the Mercure de France, to which his brother Jean de Laroque also participated and perfected it, writing in collaboration with Fuzelier and Dufresny, from June 1721 up to 31 October 1744.Jonathan Haddad, ¬´ Lire la ¬´ Litt√©rature turque ¬ª dans le Mercure. ¬ª, Dix-septi√®me si√®cle 1/2016 (n¬∞ 270) , (p. 35‚Äì48) read online When Dufresny died in October 1724, Laroque was left alone to administer the review and d‚ÄôAntoine also participated.

Abbott Pellegrin under the name Laroque gave the theater his tragedy Med√©e et Jason, which was even printed several times under his own name from 1716 until 1760. Antoine Laroque was also known for being a great collector, particularly of paintings. In 1745, Gersaint, the famous art dealer of the Pont Notre-Dame, wrote a catalog of chevalier Laroque's cabinet. Among the 300 paintings from his collection were the Flight into Egypt by Paul Veronese, a St. George by Rubens, drinkers and auctioneers by Terburg, a lady by G√©rard Nesscher, Bathsheba leaving her bath by Nicolas Poussin, two landscapes by Claude Lorrain, three paintings by Wouwerman, two paintings by Antoine Watteau etc. All these paintings would be sold at a modest price, probably given the disasters of France.Emile Perrier, Les bibliophiles et collectionneurs proven√ßaux, Barthelet, Marseille, 1897, (p. 271‚Äì274)  References   Sources  * Antoine de L√©ris, Dictionnaire portatif historique et litt√©raire des th√©√¢tres (Leris), Paris, C.

Originally from a merchant family, he joined the Lithuanian Army shortly after the independence of Lithuania, rising to the rank of captain while also securing a college degree in law and economics. He married a non-Jew and worked at several jobs, including as a teacher, accountant, and an administrator. When Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens headed the Jewish hospital in Vilnius before the formation of the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and believed that it was possible to save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October‚ÄìDecember 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy. Gens was shot by the Gestapo on 14 September 1943, shortly before the ghetto was liquidated and most of the residents sent either to labor camps or to execution at an extermination camp. His Lithuanian wife and daughter escaped the Gestapo and survived the war. Early life Gens was born on 1 April 1903 in near ≈†iauliai in what was then the Russian Empire and is now Lithuania. His father was a merchant and Gens was the oldest of four sons. Gens attended a Russian-language primary school and then a secondary school in ≈†iauliai. He was fluent in Lithuanian, Russian, German, and Yiddish, and knew some Hebrew, Polish, and English. In 1919, Gens enlisted in the newly formed Lithuanian Army. He was sent to officers' school and completed the training as a junior lieutenant.Tushnet Pavement of Hell p. 186 N. Karni, who was a cadet with Gens, said that he \\"had great personal charm. I do not remember him ever being in a bad mood.\\" Karni also felt Gens had \\"leadership qualities, he had personality, he was a man of principles\\".Quoted in Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 125‚Äì126 footnote 10 Gens' participation in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War and the completion of his secondary schooling earned Gens a promotion to senior lieutenant.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 105 Gens was transferred into the army reserves in 1924 and moved to Ukmergƒó to teach physical education and the Lithuanian language at a Jewish school. In 1924, Gens married Elvyra Budreikaitƒó, a non-Jewish Lithuanian. He appears to have wanted to transfer from the infantry into the Lithuanian Air Force, but at the time it was accepting only unmarried men.Hilberg Perpetrators Victims Bystanders pp. 110‚Äì111 The couple had a daughter, Ada, in 1926, and moved to Kaunas the following year. Gens studied at Kaunas University and worked as an accountant at the Ministry of Justice. He graduated in 1935 with a degree in law and economics. He was called back to the regular army in the late 1930s and promoted to captain.Schneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 106 He worked for the Shell Oil Corporation for two years from 1935, then took a job with , a Lithuanian co-operative.Tushnet Pavement of Hell p. 187 Gens was a Zionist, and was a follower of the Revisionist Zionism school,Tushnet Pavement of Hell p. 188 which called for most European Jews to immediately emigrate to create the State of Israel in what were then the League of Nations mandates of Palestine and Trans-Jordan.Snyder Black Earth p. 63 He belonged to Brith ha- Hayal, a Jewish organization for military reservists.Friedman \\"Two Saviors\\" Commentary p. 484 Administrator of Jewish hospital After the formation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940,Stearns and Langer Encyclopedia of World History p. 715 Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas ≈™sas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital did not need to be informed of his employment.Tushnet Pavement of Hell pp. 189‚Äì190 During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 107 The German Army entered Vilnius on 24 June 1941,Friedman \\"Two Saviors\\" Commentary p. 483 as part of their invasion of Russia in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in Vilnius.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism pp. 151‚Äì152 During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from Vilnius. When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included within the confines of the larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to either do without a hospital or set up a makeshift one.Beinfeld \\"Health Care\\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies p. 3 Chief of the Vilnius Ghetto police A faded work permit for Uri Elichski, a Jewish worker in the Vilnius Ghetto (October 1941) In September 1941, Gens was named the commander of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 114 The police force comprised around 200 men at the start,Rojowska and Dean \\"Wilno\\" Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos II and Gens appointed Salk Dessler as his deputy commandant. Other chief subordinates included Joseph Muszkat and Meir Levas. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the Betar, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists.Arad Holocaust in the Soviet Union p. 48 The police force included many other former Betar members, and this may have been because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the Bund, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted the police force to be more of a militia, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 126‚Äì127 =Aktions of 1941= The smaller ghetto was liquidated in mid-October 1941, which left the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto was subject to Aktions, selections of people for deportation and execution in Ponary. Gens was afraid that the actions of the Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes pp. 112‚Äì113 Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 285 During the deportations, he tried to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them.Gilbert Holocaust p. 216 He attempted to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3‚Äì5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes ‚Äì which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16 ‚Äì were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place under the supervision of German officials, who did not intervene.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 154 All those removed from the ghetto were taken to Ponary where they were killed.Gilbert Holocaust p. 228 The last deportation took place on 21 December 1941, leaving between 12,500Dawidowicz War Against the Jews pp. 288‚Äì289 and 17,200 residents in the ghetto. Of those, about 3,000 were \\"illegal\\", or residents without a work permit. At least 60,000 Jews had lived in Vilnius when the German occupation began.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism p. 157 Gens and the Judenrat in the larger ghetto were aware of the executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when survivors began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 177‚Äì178 Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 182 =Relations with the Judenrat= Map of the Vilna Ghetto (the small ghetto in olive green; Judenrat marked with yellow Star of David; Jewish hospital with blue dot) After the Aktions in late 1941, no further large-scale deportations or other massacres took place in the Vilnius Ghetto. This period of calm lasted throughout 1942 and early 1943. During this period, Gens' department oversaw the three police precincts the ghetto had been divided into, as well as the ghetto's prison. The police force in early 1942 had about 200 policemen.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 273‚Äì275 During early 1942, Gens became involved in a power struggle with the head of the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 284‚Äì285 Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 286‚Äì287 The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 289 In February, the Germans allowed the Judenrat to set up a judicial system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 291 In June 1942,Kruk Last Days p. 300 Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time.Porat \\"Justice System\\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies p. 63 Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.Cesarani Final Solution p. 394 Gens had a dispute with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a tailoring workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts to go through the Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 299‚Äì300 Gens also came into conflict with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which would not be the case if there were German guards at the gates.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 303‚Äì306 Head of the Vilnius Ghetto On 10 July 1942, the Judenrat of the Vilnius Ghetto was dissolved by Franz Murer, the German deputy for Jewish Affairs, for incompetence and ineffectiveness.Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 236Midlarsky The Killing Trap p. 298 Gens was appointed as head of the ghetto; he retained his position as chief of the Jewish police force, and took the title of \\"chief of the ghetto and police in Vilnius\\".Trunk Judenrat p. 12 Dessler was named Gens' deputy for police functions and Friend was Gens' deputy for administration. Gens asked the rest of the Judenrat to remain in the administration as heads of the various ghetto departments, which they did.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 328‚Äì329 =Views and policies= Inhabitants of the ghetto referred to Gens derisively as \\"King Jacob the First\\".Quoted in Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 240 The historian Lucy Dawidowicz describes him as one of a group of \\"strong, even dictatorial\\" leaders who were \\"the policy and decision makers in their ghettos, the strategical thinkers on the ghetto's possibilities for survival\\".Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 240 Gens thought that labor would provide a way for the inhabitants to survive. Along with several other ghetto leaders, he hoped to preserve some of the ghetto inhabitants and outlast the Nazi occupation.Altskan \\"On the Other Side of the River\\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies p. 13 Historian Michael Marrus describes Gens' leadership style as \\"intensely authoritarian\\" and Marrus argues that Gens came to \\"believe that [he] alone could save a portion of the ghetto inmates\\".Marrus Holocaust in History p. 115 This belief has made Gens a controversial figure both at the time and to this day. He sought to save at least some of the population by working for the Germans and to do that he relied on the police force.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism p. 154 As part of his efforts to secure support, he held a \\"political club\\" of sorts in his home, bringing together some of the community leaders for colloquia to discuss Jewish history, recent events, and the fate of the Jews.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism p. 159Roskies \\"Jewish Cultural Life\\" Lithuania and the Jews p. 33 =Liquidation of smaller ghettos= In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens to give up 500 children and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis.Arad Holocaust in the Soviet Union p. 261 The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 237 In late 1942, the Germans consolidated some small ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, ≈†venƒçionys, Soly, and Michaliszki.Trunk Judenrat p. 40 During one of these consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana.Gilbert Holocaust pp. 483‚Äì484 He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 346 The Jewish police from Vilnius as well as some Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some.Friedl√§nder Years of Extermination p. 437 By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4‚Äì5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains under the supervision of the Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains.Arad Holocaust in the Soviet Union p. 316 Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all. =Relations with Jewish resistance= Gens' relations with the various Jewish resistance groups were strained. He allowed some resistance members to escape the ghetto, but opposed the plans for resistance because he felt they would threaten the entire ghetto's existence. Gens promised to provide aid to the resistance groups and may have promised to join them in a revolt if the time was right.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism p. 156 He did provide money, taken from the various Judenrat funds, to the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), a resistance group in the ghetto. Because of the need for secrecy, the FPO did not have a way to directly solicit money from the ghetto inhabitants.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 256‚Äì257 Gens provided funds to another resistance group, the \\"Struggle Group\\" established by Boris 'Borka' Fridman.Woolfson Holocaust Legacy p. 216 It later merged with the \\"Yechiel Group\\", established by Yechiel Sheinbaum,Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes pp. 84‚Äì88 to form the \\"Yechiel's Struggle Group\\". He provided a pistol to the Struggle Group, its first. The FPO tried to prevent the formation of other resistance groups in the ghetto, mainly because they feared that it would increase the chances of German discovery as well as competition for scarce resources. Gens' support for the Struggle Group appears to have led to friction between himself and the FPO.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 263‚Äì270 On 26 June 1943, Gens ordered the arrest of Josef Glazman, who had previously worked for Gens but now was a leader of the FPO. Glazman was arrested but, while being escorted towards a labor camp, was freed by a group of FPO members. Gens then negotiated with the FPO and secured Glazman's rearrest in return for assurances of Glazman's safety.Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 326 In July 1943, Oberscharf√ºhrer Bruno Kittel demanded that Gens hand over Yitzhak Wittenberg, a leader of the FPO.Midlarsky The Killing Trap p. 302 Although Wittenberg was arrested, he was freed by FPO members. Gens' reaction to this was to spread word that unless Wittenberg turned himself in, the Germans would destroy the ghetto. The ghetto residents supported Gens in this dispute.Cesarani Final Solution p. 638 On 16 July, Wittenberg turned himself in. What happened next is unclear: some sources report that Wittenberg committed suicide while in custody, possibly with a cyanide pill provided by Gens;van Voren Undigested Past pp. 102‚Äì103 others state that Wittenberg was poisoned by Gens then turned over to the Gestapo,Porat Fall of a Sparrow pp. 126‚Äì127 or that he was tortured to death by the Gestapo and given a cyanide pill by Gens' second-in-command.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes pp. 63‚Äì64 =Welfare and cultural efforts= While Gens was in control of the ghetto, he continued to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos.van Voren Undigested Past p. 100 A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed children under the age of 16.Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 320 In May 1942, Gens secured German permission for residents of the ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept more than half the value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 308‚Äì309 In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942‚Äì1943.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 214‚Äì315 Gens started a theater in the ghetto, where poetry readings as well as the production of new and old plays took place.van Voren Undigested Past p. 101 Gens continued the policy of supporting the ghetto library and in March 1943 he ordered that all ghetto residents should turn their privately owned books over to the library, except for textbooks and prayer books.Trunk Judenrat p. 221 He also set up a ghetto publishing house. Nothing was ever published, but the authors were paid for their manuscripts. An archive of historical documents relating to the ghetto was set up.Friedman \\"Two Saviors\\" Commentary p. 485 The ghetto had a symphony orchestra, the formation of which owed some impetus to Gens and his police force.Arad Holocaust in the Soviet Union p. 471 Gens justified these cultural activities by claiming that the Jewish administration \\"wanted to give man the chance to be free of the ghetto for a few hours, and we succeeded in this. Our days here are harsh and grim. Our body is here in the ghetto, but they have not broken our spirit.\\"Quoted in Arad Holocaust in the Soviet Union p. 471 Personal privileges and family Gens' wife and daughter at first went to Kaunas but, after the formation of the ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes pp. 107‚Äì108Porat Fall of a Sparrow p. 87 Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking a leading role in the government of the ghetto and urged him to \\"pass\\" as a Lithuanian.Tushnet Pavement of Hell p. 191 It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said \\"This is the first time in my life that I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto.\\"Quoted in Friedl√§nder Years of Extermination pp. 436‚Äì437 Gens' mother and a brother, Solomon, were both imprisoned in the Vilnius Ghetto. Another brother, Ephraim, was head of the ghetto police in the ≈†iauliai Ghetto, and was the only Gens brother to survive the Holocaust. The Germans allowed Gens some privileges not accorded to other Vilnius Jews. He was not required to wear the yellow badge of the Star of David on the front and back of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave the ghetto at any time, and his daughter was not required to live in the ghetto, even though other half-Jews were confined within the ghetto.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes pp. 109‚Äì110 Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.Porat \\"Jewish Councils\\" Modern Judaism p. 155 Death On 13 September, the Germans ordered him to report to the Gestapo headquarters on the following day. He was urged to flee but chose to go,Gilbert Holocaust p. 608 telling others that if he fled \\"thousands of Jews will pay for it with their lives\\".Quoted in Gilbert Holocaust p. 608 Gens was shot by Obersturmfuhrer Rolf Neugebauer, head of the Vilnius Gestapo, on 14 September 1943.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 130 The Gestapo said that he was killed for funneling money to the FPO. Dessler was named as Gens' successor as ghetto chief,Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 426 but was soon replaced with a council which included Friend and Gens' brother, Solomon.Arad Ghetto in Flames pp. 428‚Äì429 The ghetto was liquidated between 22 and 24 September 1943. Three thousand six hundred residents went to labor camps (including 2,000 sent to labor camps in Vilnius); 5,000 women and children went to Majdanek, where they were gassed to death; and a few hundred elderly and sick were sent to Ponary and shot. The few Jews who remained in Vilnius were shot just before the Soviet Army arrived. A few FPO members escaped to the nearby forests.Friedl√§nder Years of Extermination pp. 532‚Äì533 Gens' wife and daughter were living near the ghetto on the day he was shot. A Jewish policeman informed them that Gens had been shot and that the Gestapo was looking for them. They fled and managed to stay in hiding until Soviet troops arrived. In 1945, they obtained papers for repatriation to Poland.Ustjanauskas Interview pp. 146‚Äì147 From there they moved to West Germany as Jewish aliyah.Ustjanauskas Interview p. 151 They emigrated to Australia in 1948Ustjanauskas Interview pp. 168‚Äì169 and to the United States in 1953.Shneidman Three Tragic Heroes p. 131 Legacy The role of the Judenrats has been controversial. Both Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, early historians of the Holocaust, argued that without the help of the Judenrats, the Germans would have been hampered in their extermination efforts. Arendt went further and condemned those Jews who served as leaders in the ghettos for helping destroy their own people.Fischel Holocaust p. 90 More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex ‚Äì they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.Bergen War & Genocide pp. 114‚Äì119 Gens himself has been called \\"one of the most controversial Jewish ghetto leaders\\". Chaim Lazar, a member of the FPO, wrote of Gens that \\"It may be charged that his course was harmful, but everyone knows that he was never a traitor. All that he did during his tenure as Chief of the Ghetto was for his people\\".Quoted in Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 427 Yitzhak Arad, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens \\"erred in his fundamental conception ‚Äì that the German administration regarded the existence of the ghetto and its inhabitants vital for economic reasons\\"Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 427 and that \\"the policy laid down by Jacob Gens was the only one that afforded hope and some prospect of survival\\".Arad Ghetto in Flames p. 470 Vadim Altskan, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that \\"... Holocaust historiography treated people such as ... Jacob Gens ... as instruments of destruction in the hands of the Nazi killing machine. ... Applied retrospectively, these charges for the most part are judgmental and add very little to our understanding of the events. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'ordinary' Jews had any practical or psychological experience in dealing with the grim reality of the Nazi occupation, because never before in their long history of persecution had the Jews experienced an assault of such magnitude and careful design.\\"Altskan \\"On the Other Side of the River\\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies p. 24 Regarding the charge of collaborating with the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, \\"to say that [Gens and others like him] 'cooperated' or 'collaborated' with the Germans is semantic confusion and historical misrepresentation\\".Dawidowicz War Against the Jews p. 348 The Israeli Zionist poet Nathan Alterman investigated the history of the Vilnius Ghetto, including interviewing survivors such as Abba Kovner, and stated \\"Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been on the side of the Judenrat.\\"Quoted in Friedl√§nder Years of Extermination pp. 773‚Äì774 footnote 227 Gens is one of the main characters in Joshua Sobol's plays Ghetto and Adam.

The building was one of a number of high or medium rise concrete buildings built in the city in the post Second World War period including the main building of Hull College, 'Telephone House' (Carr Lane), and the Hull Royal Infirmary, as well as numerous high rise tower blocks. Before the Hull Blitz bombing of 1941‚Äì5 the area contained buildings of a type common in the town area north of Queen's Dock, dating to before the 1850s.

The building was originally intended to form part of an (unbuilt) wider redevelopment in the area, including a hotel, shopping centre on the other side of Bond Street.

The modernist design fell out of favour during the latter half of the 20th century, and by the 21st century the building was often referred to as an 'eyesore'. In the Hull Pevsner architectural guide it is described as \\"uninspired\\". Office tenants included Humberside County Council (up to 1980), later Humberside Police, and after 1996 Hull City Council. In 2014 the council offered the building for sale after relocating staff based there as part of cost-cutting exercises; demolition and wider redevelopment were seen at the time as potential options for the site, alternative plans (2015, withdrawn) included redevelopment of the buildings as apartments. As of 2014 the buildings were also used for various telecommunications equipment including aerial leases to Vodafone, Arqiva, Orange PCS, Cable & Wireless, and EE/Hutchinson 3G. In mid 2017 Trade- park Ltd. acquired the property from Hull City Council. In September 2017 the company announced plans to convert the building into a combination development named \\"K2\\", consisting of a 100-bed hotel, 14 apartments, and office space.

Ancestry His ancestry was Cathal son of Aodh son of E√≥ghan son of Tom√°s na Feasoige (d. 1458) son of Fearghal (d. 1393) son of Tom√°s (d. 1343) son of Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in (d. 1298).M.V. Duignan (1934), \\"The Ui Bri√∫in Br√©ifni genealogies\\", pp. 90‚Äì137, in JRSAI Vol. LXIV His uncle was √âamonn M√°g Samhradh√°in, chief of the clan whom he succeeded as chief. Cathal's brothers were Toirdealbhach (who was T√°naiste of the clan and died in 1512), Tadhg (d. 1498) and Maghnus ‚ÄòThe Cleric‚Äô (d. 1498). Career There was internecine warfare between the McGovern clan and the reigning chief, Domhnall ‚ÄòBernach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in, was slain on 15 February 1496 by Cathal and others in Templeport Church. As this was on the anniversary of the previous chief's drowning, Feidhlimidh M√°g Samhradh√°in, the First, it may have been in revenge for that and the killing probably happened during the anniversary mass. The Annals of Ulster for 1496 state- Mag Samradhain, namely, Domnall Gapped-tooth, son of Thomas, son of Fergal Mag Samradhain, was slain in treachery by Maghnus, son of Thomas, son of Thomas, son of Fergal Mag Samradhain and by the sons of Aedh, son of Eogan, son of Thomas, son of Fergal and by the sons of Brian of Tellach-Eathach, namely, Tadhg and Philip, that is, sons of Feidhlimidh, son of Brian. In Tempoll-an-puirt that was done, on the feast day of Berach, at the end of a year from the day his other brother and his tribe- head was drowned. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1496 state- Mac Samhradhain, i.e. Domhnall Bernach, son of Thomas, son of Ferghal, was killed in treachery. The Annals of Connacht for 1496 state- Mac Samradain, that is Domnall Bernach son of Tomas son of Fergal, was treacherously killed. The internecine fighting continued and Cathal and his brothers were involved. The Annals of Ulster for 1497 state- Maghnus, son of Thomas Mag Samradhain, was slain by the descendants of Eogan Mag Samhadhain on the 7th of the Ides of November (7th of November). On 28 September 1498 two of Cathal's brothers, Tadgh and Manus the priest, were killed in a Maguire raid on the castle of Ballymagauran. The Annals of Ulster for 1498 state- Philip, son of Toirdelbach, son of Philip Mag Uidhir, went on an inroad into Tellach-Eathach (Tullyhaw) and the sons of Edmond Mag Uidhir and the sons of Gilla-Padraig Mag Uidhir went with him thither and the country was traversed by them to Snam-na-neach (The Swimming of the Horses). And the town of Mag Samradhain (Ballymagauran) was burned by them and they turned back and came not on cattle-spoils or chattels. And the worthies of the country overtook them on that retreat with a very large pursuing party and those nobles turned on the pursuing party and defeated them spiritedly, successfully then and slew three and twenty of the pursuing party in that rout, two sons of Aedh, son of Eogan Mag Samradhain, namely, Tadhg and Maghnus (that is, the cleric). And the other portion of them slain were of the Clann-Imair and of the Clan of Mac-in-taisigh and of the muster of Tellach- Eathach also. And there was slain also by the Fir-Manach in the heat of that rout Flaithbertach, son of Donn, son of Edmond Mag Uidhir. And on the vigil of Michaelmas precisely those deeds were done. The next year the McGoverns took revenge on the Maguires. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1499 state- Manus, the son of Godfrey Oge, son of Godfrey Roe Maguire, was slain by the people of Teallach Eachdhach (Tullyhaw). The Annals of Ulster for 1499 state- Maghnus, son of Godfrey junior, son of Godfrey Mag Uidhir the Red, was slain this year by the Tellach Eachach. Chieftainship On the death of the chief, his uncle √âamonn M√°g Samhradh√°in in 1504, Cathal took the chieftaincy and moved to the chief's residence in Ballymagauran. The Annals of Ulster for 1505 state- The daughter of Mag Samradhain, namely, Una, wife of Failghe, son of Domnall Ua Raighilligh the White, died this year. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1506 state- Manus, the son of Godfrey Roe Maguire, and Felim, the son of Brian of Teallach-Eachdhach (Tullyhaw), died. The Annals of Ulster for 1506 state- The son of Brian of Tellach-Eathach, namely, Feidhlimidh, died. The internecine warfare continued in 1507 when Cathal's brother, Toirdealbhach, the T√°naiste of the clan, killed the son of a previous chief Domhnall ‚ÄòBernach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1507 state- Brian, the son of Magauran (Donnell Bearnach), was slain by Turlough, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran. The warfare with the Maguire clan of Fermanagh also continued during Cathal's reign. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1508 state- Cormac, the son of Niall, son of Gilla-Duv, son of Hugh Maguire, was slain in a nocturnal assault, by the people of Teallach-Eachdhach (Tullyhaw) and by the sons of Philip, son of Brian Maguire. In 1512 there was conflict with Tom√°s M√°g Samhradh√°in, the Fourth who was the leader of a dissident sept within the McGovern clan and was attempting to claim the chieftainship. He enlisted the aid of the Maguire clan and Cathal was captured. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1512 state- Philip, the son of Turlough Maguire, with his sons and the sons of Thomas, son of Manus Magauran, made an incursion into Teallach- Eachdhach (Tullyhaw), and took a prey from Turlough, the son of Hugh Magauran, Tanist of the territory; and they slew Turlough himself as he followed in pursuit of the prey. From thence they proceeded to the Crannog of Magauran, which they took; and they also made a prisoner of Magauran himself, although he was sick, but they afterwards left him behind, because they could not conveniently take him with them. The son of O'Reilly, i. e. Edmond Roe, the son of Hugh, son of Cathal, afterwards came up with these men of Fermanagh, and with the grandsons of Manus, defeated them, and slew Donough, the son of Redmond, son of Philip Maguire; Philip, the son of Owen, son of Donnell Ballagh Maguire; Hugh, the son of Owen, son of Turlough Maguire; Murtough Roe, son of Murrough; and James, the son of Magrath Maguire, besides many others; and many horses were taken from them on that day. Death Cathal died in 1512 probably of the sickness and rough treatment referred to above. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1512 state- Magauran (Cathal, the son of Hugh, son of Owen) died; and Thomas, the son of Manus Magauran, was styled Lord.

By the British North America Act, 1867 (part of the constitution of Canada), education falls entirely under provincial jurisdiction. There is no federal government department or agency involved in the formation or analysis of policy regarding education. Also by constitutional right, Roman Catholics are entitled to their own school system; this led in New Brunswick to contention in the early years of the nation, and, in 1871, to the first case sent from Canada to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Maher v Town Council of Portland. Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools are administered by the Ministry of Education and Early Childhood Development, while colleges and universities are administered by the Ministry of Post Secondary Education, Training and Labour. History One-room schoolhouse at Wakem Corner. As higher education in New Brunswick is summarized on a separate page, the text below relates primarily to primary and secondary education. From the year of the scission of the province from Nova Scotia, 1784, until 1802 there was no law in New Brunswick about government-funded education. In 1802, an Act to enable Parish Schools to be funded publicly was passed by the Assembly. Later on, in 1805 and again in 1816 Grammar Schools were enabled; it seems that the Grammar School (and its attached funding) was available only to county shire towns. The Parish Schools, which were permitted only elementary education, initially were controlled by the Justices of the Peace; later they fell under Parish School trustees. By contrast, the Grammar Schools by fiat from the first had instituted boards of governors and were responsible for both elementary and secondary education. Grammar Schools were to teach English Grammar, Latin, Greek, Orthography, Geography, and Mathematics. The 1816 Act granted each Board ¬£100, provided that the local contribution was at least ¬£50. Neither Parish nor Grammar schools were free at this time, however regulations mandated that a small number of students (usually four or five) were to be admitted free of charge. The first schools in the province were often only one-room schoolhouses. After 1833, school boards were required to divide their territory into districts, and ¬£20 per district school was granted by the province if the work were considered satisfactory. The local voters were taxed to fund the other ¬£20 of district expenditure. St.-Louis-de-Kent in 1910. The churches were of course free to operate schools without interference from the government. This occurred in a great number of places; the Catholic church in particular constructed prominent and grandiose buildings, such as the Convent at St.-Louis-de-Kent depicted at right. The Catholic church, not being restricted by mundane things like taxes and electors, could afford to establish residential schools wherever it seemed propitious. The Anglican Church in New Brunswick operated, from about 1820 until at least 1870, \\"Madras Schools\\" along the lines drawn by Andrew Bell. The Anglican system was useful, notes a biographer of Bell, \\"when funds were sparse and teachers in very short supply.\\"Blackie Prior to the establishment in 1848 of the Teacher Training School, the appointment (in rural areas at least) of a new master to a position of provincially governed responsibility included the certification of (as the case was) the local magistrate and/or board of trustees that the candidate was known to them to be of good character and repute, and that he could carry out his duties in a proper fashion. Two property owners in the neighbourhood seem also to have served as witnesses, upon which the Lieutenant-Governor appointed the candidate. The budget seems to have been paid in arrears at mid-year or at year-end on a satisfactory report of progress from the supervisors. A significant fraction of the rural schoolhouses were privately owned, and presumably leased to the authorities. In 1847, the syllabus at one Grammar School was: Science, History, Geography, Arithmetic, Bookkeeping, Grammar, and Latin. The first Teacher Training School in the province was not established until 1848. A Superior School teacher earned in 1858 roughly ¬£125 a year. Superior Schools, one per Parish, were established in that year apparently so that residents would engage competent teachers. The Superior School teacher designation was obtained from the Teacher Training School. Principals of such schools were required to have an additional qualification for Latin and for Mathematics. Whereas formerly the Grammar Schools operated under the supervision of local Boards of Trustees, they were placed in 1861 under the supervision of the provincial Chief Superintendent of Schools, who at this date was named Bennet. At this time, the number of Grammar Schools in operation in the province was twelve, and the sum of $300 was paid by the province to a one-room schoolhouse teacher. Superintendent Bennet was pleased to note that parallel rows of hardwood- topped desks facing the teacher's rostrum and blackboard had replaced the old system of pine desks with backless benches arranged around the periphery of the schoolroom. Bennet made his case for larger schools, in which graded levels would be the norm, whereby a greater number of teachers could further specialise their lessons. Bennet would go on to chafe against the instruction of Latin grammar as a means to teach that of the English, although the former means of instruction would prevail for many years to come. A new set of regulations were instituted in 1863. These included that 1) the Master of a County Grammar School be degreed or have a certificate of qualification issued by the provincial Board of Education; 2) the school have no less than 150 cubic feet of air per pupil; 3) the school have \\"all necessary appurtenances\\"; 4) the school required at least 15 pupils aged 10 years or more; 5) at least five of whom were to study Latin, Greek and Mathematics, and ten of whom were to study English Composition and History. The Free Schools Act of 1871 added to the taxpayer's burden the cost of the education system. The Common Schools Act, also of 1871 (CSA), established a whole new system in the province; the place of religion in the school system was a topic of debate as early as 1863, and this Act was its ostensible solution: schools became non-sectarian. Opposition was directed at Sections 14 through 18, which concerned the levy of taxes on all private property throughout each (newly ordained) district, and Section 60, in which a non-sectarian system was specified. The grammar schools were allowed until 1884 to operate independently. Schools were financed from three sources: 1) school district poll tax on all male inhabitants of the district above 21 years of age; 2) school district property tax (real or personal) and income tax applied to non-residents' and residents' property alike; 3) County School fund tax equal to 30 cents per inhabitant according to the previous census. The debate over the place of religion in the schools came to a head in 1875. Section 5 of the CSA allowed the provincial board of education to make regulations. In the programme of studies (under Regulation 16) no mention was made of the teaching of religion, while under Regulation 20 \\"no symbols or emblems distinctive of any religious organization\\" could be employed or exhibited \\"in the school room or on the person of any teacher or pupil\\". But Regulation 21 allowed the teacher to open and close the daily exercises by reading a portion of Scripture and by offering the Lord's Prayer. Any other prayer could, with the permission of the Board, be employed. Roman Catholic citizens were especially concerned over Regulation 20. Civil disorder broke out in January 1875 over this regulation, and two men lost their lives in Caraquet. By 1876, a high school principal earned a yearly stipend of $500.00. In 1893, New Brunswick Supreme Court Justice John James Fraser was commissioned by Lieutenant-Governor Samuel Leonard Tilley to investigate complaints related to the \\"School Law or Regulations\\" in Gloucester County. Some Protestant ratepayers were very concerned that the Catholic administrators of the Bathurst Grammar School had infringed them, especially the non-denominational nature of the School Law. One item of complaint was that the catechism was taught using school facilities during lunch hour; another, that the application of a Protestant teacher had been discarded without good reason by the administration; and several others. The Commissioner found, after a very full investigation, that no blame could be attached to the Board of Education. Since the Compulsory Attendance Act of 1940, children have been required to attend classes; parents otherwise faced fines. In contrast, the US state of Mississippi in 1918 was the last state to enact a compulsory attendance law. School buses were not seen in great numbers until the early 1960s. Since the government of Louis Robichaud during the 1960s, and especially the New Brunswick Official Languages Act (1969), attention on group educational rights has turned toward the linguistic variety. An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswickoriginally SNB 1981, c O-1.1 was passed in 1981 by the government of Premier Richard Hatfield. It provided independent school boards for both linguistic groups. Its principles were later expanded and incorporated into the Constitution of Canada, through the insertion of section 16.1 in 1993 under the government of Frank McKenna:Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick), see SI/93-54 Until 28 December 1997, New Brunswick had under the Schools Act, publicly funded school boards which were led by elected representatives and which had been administered at arm's length from the provincial Department of Education.canlii.org: \\"Schools Act, SNB c S-5.1\\" On that date the Education Act was written in the 53rd New Brunswick Legislature to replace the Schools Act.laws.gnb.ca: \\"Education Act (S.N.B. 1997, c. E-1.12)\\" As of September 2012, the Government of New Brunswick decided to merge and rename all the school districts changing the number of districts from fourteen to seven.cbc.ca: \\"Jody Carr cuts school districts to 7\\", 11 Jan 2012 By doing this, Jody Carr, then the province's minister of education, estimated that $5 million per year would be saved in administrative costs.\\"Halving the number of school districts would save $5 million\\", 12 Jan 2012 At the time, New Brunswick had a total of 321 schools, which were filled on average to less than 60 per cent of capacity. School council members were to be paid $3,000 a year, while council chairpeople would get $6,000 annually. Carr stated that in the previous decade, the number of students in the province had dropped by 15 per cent while the costs to operate schools had increased by 37 per cent. In 2012, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test for 15 year-olds showed that the scores in reading ability for both the anglophone and francophone systems in New Brunswick were the lowest in Canada, and that overall New Brunswick students finished below the Canadian average in math.cbc.ca: \\"Francophone students lag behind anglophone peers in tests\\", 3 Dec 2013 In 2013, the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada sponsored a test called the Pan-Canadian Assessment Program, which was administered to a sample of more than 32,000 Grade 8 students from across the country.\\"Tests show provincial differences in math, reading, science education\\", 7 Oct 2014cmec.ca: \\"Home > Programs and Initiatives > Assessment > Pan-Canadian Assessment Program (PCAP) > PCAP 2013\\" \\"Level 2 was designated as the acceptable level of performance for Grade 8/Secondary II students.\\"cmec.ca: \\"PCAP 2013 Technical Report\\" The lowest proportion, 87%, of students meeting \\"level 2\\" in the science test was found in New BrunswickPPP p.5 while the scores of the students in the science test were, on a statistically significant basis, much lower than the Canadian average.PPP p.7 The readingPPP p.8 and mathematicsPPP p.9 tests gave similarly poor results for New Brunswick.cmec.ca: \\"PCAP 2013 PowerPoint Presentation\\" Students were asked, for example, \\"to classify substances according to their physical properties, and to describe how the movement and tilt of the Earth affects cycles such as years, days and seasons\\".\\"National Science Test Results Stir Debate\\" New Brunswick lengthened its school day by 30 minutes early in the oughties in hopes of improving its academic performance, and in recent years some school districts ended \\"potato break\\", a two-week break that allowed students to work during the fall potato harvest. As a result, the province now has the longest school year in the country, at more than 1,000 hours for high school students, according to Statistics Canada. Yet its students scored below average among Canadian provinces on 2014 international math tests.macleans.ca: \\"Canadian students have more math class, lower test scores\\", 9 Jan 2014 New Brunswick ranked 22nd among the 26 comparator jurisdictions in the 2014 Conference Board of Canada How Canada Performs study.

In that year, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) decided in Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island that the by-population French- speaking minority of Summerside PEI could exercise their Section 23 Charter right to native-language local education.Supreme Court Judgments : Arsenault- Cameron v. Prince Edward Island\\", 2000 SCC 1 The analysis of this decision by Ministry staff posits that separate-by-language buses must be operated along with separate-by-language schools, and such has been applied. In the 2014-15 school year, New Brunswick budgeted to spend $64.8-million in order to bus 90,000 students; or in other words, $720 for each student.nationalpost.com: \\"N.B. education minister angry after learning French and English students have been sharing a school bus\\", 26 Mar 2015 The Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick's only Acadian MLA in March 2015 threatened to split from the party if discussion were re-opened on school bus re-unification.cbc.ca: \\"School bus language debate creates mixed messages from Tories\\", 30 Mar 2015 However, the SCC decision at paragraph 61 states that \\"The Appeal Division erred in... concluding that buses could be considered educational facilities.\\" Tristin Hopper, a journalist for the National Post observed in 2015 that it \\"would appear to place [schoolbuses] outside the realm of the Charter\\", which deals in Section 23 with \\"minority language educational facilities.\\" Still and all, NB Attorney-General and at the time Minister of Education Serge Rousselle mandated his department to eliminate a unified schoolbus service arrangement that had developed organically in Richibucto.

The game was first released through Steam Early Access on July 24, 2014, with an eventual full game release on August 18, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, SteamOS and Ubuntu. The game takes place in a mysterious dark forest somewhere in Poland or within the Eastern Bloc countries, where the main characters have been trapped for an unknown amount of time. On March 20, 2019 a Nintendo Switch version was announced during the Nindies Nintendo Direct and was released on May 16, 2019. The game was also ported and released for the PlayStation 4 on May 14, 2019 and for Xbox One on May 16, under the publisher Crunching Koalas.  Gameplay  The game features a semi-open world, with the player unlocking new areas as the storyline progresses. It also features a crafting system, a day/night cycle, trading and non-player character (NPC) interaction, a skill system, stealth and combat, as well as multiple storyline branches which alter several aspects of the world. During daytime, the player can explore the world and scavenge for supplies at several locations scattered around each biome, the player may also spend this time repairing doors or barricades around the hideout and crafting new items and upgrades at the workbench. During the day the player can also \\"cook\\" certain items at his stove in order to gain access to various skills, any beneficial skill that the player chooses requires a detrimental skill to also be chosen. During the night the player cannot leave the hideout and must defend against possible intruders until morning. Planning a defensive strategy is key and players have the opportunity to lay traps and barricade doors or windows to slow down any intruders. Should the player survive the night, they will gain reputation with the trader which can be used to trade for more expensive items. If the player dies during the night, they will wake up in the next morning without receiving any bonuses. Should the player die while out scavenging, they will suffer a loss of half their inventory which is then marked on the map for later collection. Higher difficulties have higher penalties for death such as the loss of lives or permanent death. The storyline is shaped based on how the player reacts to the requests and actions of NPCs. Aiding different ones will lead to different endings, and sometimes influences sub-plots relating to several other NPCs. The game switches to a different map in its second chapter, with the previous regions becoming locked and several new gameplay elements and NPCs being introduced. Different characters from the first chapter may appear too, depending on the player's actions. The game features two different main endings, with each character's subplot being defined by other, smaller actions as well as which of these endings the player has achieved.  Synopsis  =Setting and Characters= Darkwood is set somewhere in Poland (as indicated by the writings on the ground, and The Wreckage, an area of the map showing a Polish Air Force Mil Mi-8 helicopter) or somewhere else in the Eastern bloc countries in the late 1980s where a mysterious forest has occupied a large amount of land and is continuing to expand. Many people have been left trapped by the forest and a strange plague is ravaging the survivors, killing and causing victims to transform into monsters and abominations. A group named \\"The Outsiders\\" consisting mostly of government officials and soldiers were sent to investigate the woods, setting up hideouts and a tunnel system to get in and out of the forest. By the time the game takes place most of the Outsiders are dead or evacuated from the zone. In the prologue, the player takes control of an apparent doctor as he searches for supplies. The Doctor seems to be disillusioned with his job of helping people and is hellbent on escaping the forest. After the prologue, the player takes control of \\"The Stranger\\", a man who is searching for the stolen key that will lead him through an underground passageway out of the forest. Other characters include a trader who helps the protagonist in the prologue, a half-man half-wolf hybrid known only as \\"The Wolfman\\", a cyclist drunk known as the \\"Bike Man\\" and Piotrek, who is mesmerised by space travel and wishes to build a rocket. =Plot= Prologue The game begins with The Doctor rambling about the forest and how it has consumed all exits and trapped its inhabitants, his inability to treat the plague and his devotion to escaping the woods before he perishes. The Doctor awakens and prepares to scavenge the surrounding area for gasoline. While scavenging, The Doctor comes across the Stranger, injured and unconscious after an unknown accident. After looting a large key from his body, the Doctor theorizes that the Stranger possesses knowledge on how to escape the forest. The Stranger is then captured, sedated and eventually beaten as the Doctor interrogates him regarding an escape route. The story focus and controls switch to the Stranger as he engineers an escape from the Doctor's house. After some exploration, the cottage is broken into by several monsters and the Stranger blacks out. Chapter 1 It is implied in cutscene that the Trader stumbled across the Doctor's cottage and rescued the Stranger, bringing him back to a hideout in the Dry Meadow (The first biome in the game). The Stranger first explores the underground entrance to make sure the Doctor hasn't gone through with the key, but finds that the door hasn't been opened in a while. The player may then side with the Wolfman or the Musician in order to find the Doctor, or accomplish this by his own devices. Once finding the Doctor in the train wreck (either by exploring his house from the prologue, or getting an appointment from the Musician), he will attempt to resist the Stranger. If the player followed the Musician's path, the player will enter a dream sequence with several different outcomes: if the player dies in the dream sequence the Stranger will wake up and find the Doctor gone, and once the Stranger checks the underground entrance he will find the armoured door wide open. If the player survives the dream sequence, the Doctor will be at the mercy of the player who can kill him and take the key, take the key and leave the Doctor or allow the Doctor to accompany the player through the underground passage. One way or another, progressing through the armoured door leads to the end of chapter 1. Chapter 2 As the Stranger leaves the tunnel he finds that it no longer leads out of the forest and instead leads to a swamp (the fourth and final biome). The Stranger will also find the beheaded corpse of the Trader after the first night. Chapter 2 is where many choices in Chapter 1 affect the outcomes of certain characters, for example, if players did not aid the Wolfman then he will steal items from the player and lure them into a trap. The Stranger finds a large talking tree that blocks the exit of the forest, which indirectly asks the Stranger to explore a radio tower. Meanwhile, a cripple requests that the Stranger burns this tree. Both pathways offer ways of leaving the forest and of reaching the Epilogue. The Epilogue The Stranger pushes through the forest until reaching a town and their old apartment, where he settles in for a long sleep. However, careful exploration reveals this ending to be an illusion which the player can uncover, if they spot the odd things in the apartment block. The Stranger eventually finds roots growing under the floorboards and a hole under his bed. Crawling through will have the Stranger wake up naked, with his clothes discarded nearby, in a passage overgrown with roots. The \\"Road Home\\" did not lead home, and indeed may be entirely illusory, as the player awakens in a chamber filled with thousands of people curled up around a strange being, sleeping and muttering in bliss. The being attempts to entice the Stranger by making him feel warm and tired, if the player does not resist then they will fall unconscious and be back in the apartment with only one course of action available: bliss and ignorance. If the Player resists, then the Stranger will find a flamethrower among the sleepers and burn the being and all those around it to death. The fire spreads so rapidly that the Stranger is unable to escape, with the flames quickly spreading and consuming most of the forest, killing many of its inhabitants but with the death of the strange being and the Stranger sacrifice had allow the military deploy to the forest safely saving the remaining surviving inhabitants and restore order. In both endings, text blocks detailing each character's fate appear, which can be influenced by the player's actions during the game.  Development  The game's reveal was made through the release of a pre-alpha gameplay trailer on YouTube, on March 5, 2013. A page for the game was created on Steam Greenlight on March 11, 2013, with the following months seeing the release of a campaign on the popular crowdfunding website Indiegogo which funded the game's initial developing. The campaign collected over US$57,000, totalizing 143% of the established goal (US$40,000). On July 24, 2014 the game was released to the public in an alpha stage, with updates being released ever since. Support for 32-bit Linux systems, although present at first, was dropped mid-development, as a survey done by the developers showed no players currently using such a system. On June 6, 2017, the game was pushed out of alpha, and into version beta 1. A live action trailer produced by the Polish studio Film Fiction was released on July 19, and the full game was released on August 18, 2017. On August 25, the developers released a blog post on image hosting website Imgur, telling the story of the game's development process and releasing a free torrent of it, asking the players to buy it if they enjoy it. This move was motivated by two reasons, they wanted some players who couldn't afford the game to be able to play it, and also received several e-mails related to theft of game keys. They stated that they preferred to give the game for free to some people than feed the leeching key-reselling websites. On January 22, 2018, the developers released the 1.2 update, bringing Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and German translations to the game. The translations were worked on with the help of the community. They also stated that more language localizations were in development. In May 2019, the official Nintendo Switch version was released. On August 7, 2019, the 1.3 version was released, containing a number of bugfixes, optimizations and localizations for Simplified Chinese, Italian, Turkish and Hungarian. A French localization was also confirmed to be in development. According to the developers, Darkwood was inspired by: > \\"The works of David Lynch, Strugacki brothers, Stanis≈Çaw Lem. Games like > Fallout, Dark Souls, Project Zomboid, Teleglitch. Slavic folklore. And, > well, life.\\" Reception Critics wrote positive pieces regarding the game prior to and after its public release. It has a score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 16 reviews. Metacritic also included it in their \\"top 100 best videogames of 2017\\" list. The game was nominated for \\"Most Fulfilling Community-Funded Game\\" at the 2018 SXSW Gaming Awards. The announcement of the Nintendo Switch version was followed by articles by Variety and IGN. In the second one, Tom Marks (writing for IGN) praised the game for \\"not taking cheap shots\\" and \\"playing surprisingly well with a Switch Pro Controller\\".

Early life McIver is originally from San Jose, California and moved to New York City at age 14 on a Ford Foundation Scholarship for dance. In New York, McIver trained at George Balanchine's School of American Ballet during the summers of 1965 and 1966, and was enrolled full-time in the advanced division courses at the School of American Ballet 1967‚Äì70.

McIver later issued a statement explaining that Trump had shared with her a passage from Obama's 2008 convention speech as an example of her feelings. Due to a misunderstanding, McIver thought the passage expressed Trump's own thinking, so she included that passage in the speech. According to the Associated Press, \\"McIver took the blame but made it clear that Mrs. Trump knew the passages were from the first lady's speech.\\" The Trump family declined McIver's offer to resign over the incident.

The department's scientific journal, published continuously since 1937, was also renamed as the Proceedings of A. Razmadze Mathematical Institute in his honor. Biography Andrea Razmadze was the son of Mikhail Gavrilovich Razmadze, a railway worker, and Nino Georgievna Nodia. He graduated from Kutaisi nonclassical secondary school in 1906 (where Public School #41 has been renamed for him), then studied at Moscow University, earning a Diploma in 1910, and then a Masters in 1917 while teaching at local classical and secondary schools. At the invitation of the university, he briefly stayed in Moscow University to teach mathematics in 1917, but soon left to become one of the founders of Tbilisi University. Though he died just 11 years later, during his time there he greatly expanded Georgian mathematical terminology by publishing three textbooks in that language, and insisting that all courses be taught in Georgian, an approach that attracted renowned mathematician Nikoloz Muskhelishvili to the school. He also founded the \\"Georgian Mathematical Union\\" on February 21, 1923 and was its first president; this institution lapsed on his death, but was reorganized from 1962 to the present. He is most famous for his work in the calculus of variations, where he discovered an efficient method for finding the extrema of integral functions, and a comprehensive theory for finding the extrema of discontinuous (\\"angular\\") functions that can be represented by a finite number of curves. He presented this last result at the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, for which he was awarded a Sc.D. by the Sorbonne.

History The union was founded in 1865, when the Manchester Plumbers' Society and the Liverpool Plumbers' Society merged with small organisations from Scotland, Ireland, the English Midlands and other areas of northern England to form the United Operative Plumbers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland (UOPA). By the following year, the union had 1,500 members, and it soon expanded to also cover southern England.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, p.75 Many of the union's Scottish members left in 1872 to form the rival United Operative Plumbers' Association of Scotland, with the remainder transferring gradually, leaving the union with no Scottish members after 1891. Despite this, overall membership continued to grow, reaching 10,000 in 1900. In 1911, the union was renamed as the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers Association of Great Britain and Ireland (UOPA), financial difficulties leading a move away from craft unionism and to accept workers in relate trades. In 1921, the Scottish union rejoined the national body, which in 1931 became the Plumbers', Glaziers' and Domestic Engineers' Union, and adopted its final name in 1946.

She specialised in eighteenth-century British art and, particularly, the work of George Stubbs.  Early life and career  Egerton was born in Melbourne, Australia as the third of five children to Jean (n√©e Muecke) and Keith Attiwill, a journalist. She was educated at Lauriston Girls' School and, from the age of 17, at Janet Clarke Hall, then the women's college of the University of Melbourne, where she read History and graduated with first-class honours in 1948. She married Ansell Egerton in 1949 (dissolved in 1974) and the couple emigrated to the United Kingdom, briefly living in Oxford. When her husband became a Lecturer in Economics at Queen's University Belfast, she held the post of tutorial assistant in History. While in Belfast, she became a close friend of the poet Philip Larkin, who was then a sub-librarian at the university. The Egertons returned to London in 1956. While raising her two daughters, Egerton worked on the British Dictionary of National Biography and the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Later career In London, Egerton came into contact with the watercolour specialist Dudley Snelgrove with whom she worked in the late 1960s, cataloguing the sporting art pictures being bought by Paul Mellon. It was during this period that Egerton became interested in the work of George Stubbs. Egerton was appointed as a Research Assistant Grade I of the British school at the Tate Gallery in 1974, being promoted to Assistant Keeper Grade I by 1980. She was responsible for curating the exhibition George Stubbs, Anatomist and Animal Painter, which opened in August 1976, and concerned his anatomical drawings. Egerton wrote the catalogue raisonn√© on Stubbs, published by the Paul Mellon Centre in 1984, and curated the major exhibition on the artist which was held from 1984 into 1985 at the Tate and the Yale Centre for British Art in Connecticut. She remained at the Tate until 1988. Egerton also worked on well-known British artists Joseph Wright of Derby and William Hogarth. She curated a show at the Tate Gallery in 1990 on Wright of Derby and worked with Hogarth expert, Elizabeth Einberg, on compiling a catalogue of the Tate's permanent collection of Hogarth artworks titled The Age of Hogarth. She also wrote Hogarth's Marriage-A-La-Mode, which was re-published by Yale University press in 2011 with an accompanying DVD narrated by Alan Bennett. Egerton was employed by the National Gallery from 1988 to 1998 to revise the British school catalogue and became a senior research fellow of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art from 1997 until 2007.  Archive  The Judy Egerton Archive was donated to the Paul Mellon Centre by her daughters in 2012.

Gateway students typically have had difficulty in mainstream classrooms due to a language-based learning disability (dyslexia, expressive and receptive language delays, reading and writing disorders); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and/or executive function disorder.  History  The Gateway School of New York was established in 1965 by Elizabeth Freidus and Claire Flom. Freidus was an educator at Columbia University Teachers College; Claire Flom was the mother of Gateway's first student. The initial class consisted of five students in a space rented from Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The school remained in this location for 36 years. In 2001, Gateway moved into a converted brownstone at 236 Second Avenue near Union Square. With the decision to add a Middle School to the existing Lower School, Gateway began searching for an even larger building, and it debuted its current home on West 61st Street, near Lincoln Center, in 2008.

Kierner and Sandra Gioia Treadway, Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times, vol 2 (University of Georgia Press 2016) pp. 333 et seq. Early and family life Born in Waco, Texas to U.S. Department of Agriculture employee Daniel Naylor Shoemaker and his wife Frances Hartley, Dorothy Shoemaker was raised in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area (where her parents helped found the Florida Avenue Friends Meeting). She later remembered attending women's suffrage parades in which her mother marched.Treadway at p. 337 She attended Central High School, then Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, from which she graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1929. Her family had roots in Loudoun County, Virginia, ancestors having attended the Goose Creek meeting. In 1932, Dorothy married fellow Swarthmore graduate Norman Hugh (\\"Mac\\") McDiarmid (1907‚Äì1993), and their marriage lasted 61 years until his death. Beginning in 1939, they lived on a 50-acre farm between Vienna, Virginia and Reston, Virginia. Career Dorothy McDiarmid taught school at the Sidwell Friends School for a time, as well as in northern Virginia. She was active in the Parent Teacher Association (becoming President of the Fairfax County federation chapter and uniting the white and black PTAs) as well as the League of Women Voters, Democratic Women's Club, Boy Scouts and Vienna community activities while raising their children. She and her husband \\"Mac\\" were partners in McDiarmid Realty and McDiarmid Associates. Political career In 1959, she ran for the general assembly (a part-time position) to oppose the Byrd Organization's plan of Massive Resistance to the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, which included a Prince Edward County, Virginia case. Governor Thomas Stanley, following the direction of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd proposed to close any school or district that integrated, even those integrating pursuant to court order, as in nearly Arlington as well as Norfolk and Albemarle County. McDiarmid championed public schools, as well as improved services for children and women and distribution of state budget monies according to population. Several newspaper surveys ranked her among the ten most effective delegates.Washington Post obituary McDiarmid succeeded in adding kindergarten to the public school schedule, as well as helped create George Mason University and five community colleges in Northern Virginia. Early in her political career, she proposed Virginia's creation of a Committee on the Status of Women, which was defeated legislatively, but established as an executive branch committee by Governor Albertis S. Harrison Jr.. McDiarmid also advocated ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and abolition of the death penalty, but her Virginia General Assembly colleagues never passed those measures (although the 1970 Virginia constitution does include an equal rights section). Although temporarily defeated for re-election in 1961 and 1969 (as discussed below), McDiarmid became one of the most influential women ever elected to the House of Delegates. She was the first woman appointed to the Committee on Rules, ranking member of the House Education Committee, and from 1986 until her retirement, she became the first woman to preside over the committee that prepared the state's budget (the House Committee on Appropriations). After retiring from the General Assembly, McDiarmid served as vice chair of the Governor's Commission on Educational Opportunity for All Virginians. During her lifetime, McDiarmid won the PTA's Lifetime member achievement award, the first annual award of the Fairfax County Human Rights Commission, and the Fairfax County Woman of Achievement Award (1971, 1972).http://sca.gmu.edu/finding_aids/mcdiarmid.html She also received the Outstanding Virginian award in 1989 and the George Mason medal (a lifetime achievement award) from the George Mason University Board of Visitors in 1990.C-span GMU 1990 commencement after approximately minute 55, available at http://www.c-span.org/video/?12345-1/commencement-address Due to the redistricting issue eventually resolved by the Supreme Court in Davis v. Mann, Fairfax County only had two delegates in the 1961 election, and Democrat John C. Webb (another named plaintiff in Davis v. Mann, with Arlington's C. Harrison Mann) and one-term Republican Glenn A. Burklund outpolled McDiarmid, who thus lost her seat until again elected two years later. In the Republican landslide of 1969, Republicans Vincent F. Callahan Jr., Warren E. Barry, David A. Sutherland and Byron F. Andrews Jr., and Democrat Clive L. DuVal II outpolled McDiarmid for the five seats allowed Fairfax County. She defeated Andrews in 1971 and 1973. Following the 1972 election, Callahan was appointed to the Appropriations Committee on which McDiarmid also served (and chaired from 1986 until her retirement in 1989); Callahan would later also chair that powerful committee. Complicating matters somewhat, before the 1960 census, delegate districts were not numbered. Following the 1970 census, both she and Callahan were delegates from the 18th house district, and other sections of Fairfax were in the 19th House district, which had 3 delegates. Following the 1980 census, McDiarmid represented the 35th Delegate district and Callahan the 34th. Other house districts including portions of Fairfax County included the 33rd and 36th through 47th, although some of the districts above the 42nd also included parts of the Cities of Alexandria and Arlington.Fairfax County Public Library Guide to the Virgnia General Assembly, 1979‚Äì1997 After McDiarmid announced her retirement in 1989, DAvid A. Battaglia won the Democratic primary to succeed her, but lost to Republican real estate developer Richard L. Fisher in the November general election. Death and legacy McDiarmid died of a heart attack at Inova Fairfax Hospital on June 9, 1994, within a year after her beloved husband Mac's death, though survived by their children and grandchildren. Her memorial service at the Washington Friends Meeting featured many accounts of her gentleness and strength. She and her husband are buried at the Goose Creek burying ground in Loudoun County, Virginia. Her papers are in the George Mason University special collections, and are being indexed. In 2015, the Library of Virginia honored her service as one of its Virginia Women in History.

It was released worldwide on Netflix on February 9, 2018. Plot Noah Ashby falls in love with Avery Martin after meeting her at a 2014 Halloween party, but Avery comes to regard him as a friend. Three years later, Noah remains distraught at being unable to win over Avery, who met her fianc√© Ethan the next day. When he becomes intoxicated at Ethan and Avery's engagement party, Noah winds up in the photo booth he used with Avery during their first meeting and drunkenly operates it before falling asleep. Awakening in his bed, Noah discovers that the photo booth brought him back to the day he met Avery and he resolves to change the events of the day to ensure he and Avery end up together. Noah uses his pre-existing knowledge of Avery to his advantage in his first attempt to win her over, but Avery and her roommate Carrie Grey suspect him of being a stalker, and he returns to 2017 now ostracized from Avery. For his second attempt, Noah follows his friend Max's advice of being a rude alpha male and successfully beds Avery, but he develops a self-absorbed personality in the present and his relationship with Avery is purely sexual. Recognizing that Avery and Ethan are still attracted to each other, a conversation with Carrie helps Noah deduce that Avery is attracted to stable and dependable men. Noah gets a job at Max's company and presents himself in a more mature manner to Avery for his third attempt, which results in him successfully becoming engaged to her. However, his friendship with Max has ended due to taking the vice president position that Max was working to obtain, his job commitments prevent him from spending time with Avery, and Ethan is now distraught over Avery being unable to return his love for her. Following another conversation with Carrie, Noah recognizes that Avery does not love him and she is meant to be with Ethan. He also realizes that having bonded with Carrie through their personal conversations, he is meant to be with her. Traveling back to 2014 for a fourth time, Noah arranges for Avery and Ethan to meet at the Halloween party while he pursues Carrie, whom he discovers he has more in common with than Avery. His actions restore Ethan and Avery's engagement and his friendship with Max, but Noah learns that he did not win Carrie's love and instead caused her to resume dating her ex-boyfriend Phil. Noah finally realizes that he needed to first become friends with Avery in order to meet Carrie and he travels back one last time to meet Avery as he did originally. With the present fully restored, Noah initiates a conversation with Carrie at the engagement party and the two begin their own relationship.

It was influenced by the artist's fascination with chronophotographic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, and one of the most important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery since 1984. Description and context The painting depicts a dachshund on a leash and the feet of a lady walking it, both in rapid motion as indicated by the blurring and multiplication of their parts. Chronophotographic studies of animals in motion, created by scientist √âtienne-Jules Marey beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts‚Äîperhaps in an effort to imitate these mechanical images. Such multiplication can be seen in Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, painted the same year as Balla's painting. Balla's interest in capturing a single moment in a series of planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, more abstract works created during World War I, Balla used planes of color to suggest movement. The decomposition of movement into moments in time which Balla created in Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash likely inspired the photodynamic technique of Futurist photographer Anton Giulio Bragaglia. Published in Arthur Jerome Eddy, Cubists and Post-impressionism, A.C. McClurg & Co. Chicago, 1914, p. 165Arthur Jerome Eddy, Cubists and Post-impressionism, A.C. McClurg & Co. Chicago, 1914 Provenance The painting was exhibited in the Galerie Der Sturm's Autumn Salon in Berlin from September to December 1913, accompanied by a photograph of the scene. It was sold by the artist in 1938 to the industrialist Anson Conger Goodyear. Upon his death in 1964, Goodyear bequeathed the painting jointly to his son, George F. Goodyear, with a life interest, and to the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. The gallery acquired the painting in December 1984. Critical responses In 1943, artist Cornelia Geer LeBoutillier criticized the painting, comparing it unfavorably with Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase (a work with which it is often compared) and Picasso's Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, calling Balla's work \\"more crude, less mature, almost childish indeed ... Balla takes himself and his dog so seriously, so studiedly, that it is doubtful that any pleasure has ever come out of it anywhere; certainly no movement has.\\" Writing in 1947, critic Henry R. Hope called Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash \\"a clich√© of modern art\\". Writer Geoffrey Wagner declared Balla's painting to be anathema to the Vorticist aesthetic of British painter Wyndham Lewis, who criticized Futurism for its \\"romantic excess\\" and dynamism. However, S. I. Hayakawa credited Balla's \\"classic\\" for its introduction of the time dimension in its representation of its subject. In 2009, art critic Tom Lubbock declared the painting \\"one of the most striking\\" chronophotography-inspired works, pointing to several features which create a comical effect: the \\"abrupt close-up\\" on a trivial subject‚Äîa \\"twee prim sausage dog\\"‚Äîwhich might have been a single detail in an Impressionist street scene; the bathetic juxtaposition of the word dynamism, \\"with its connotations of heroism, of the mighty modern machine world\\" against that subject; the cropping of the owner at the knee, giving a dog's view (and anticipating Tom and Jerry cartoons); and the apparently frenetic motion of the dog's limbs and tail coupled with the stillness of its body, suggesting little forward progress. Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as \\"creating new sensations and new phenomena\\", and evoking the motion of shuffling cards and the embodiment of ghosts. In 2014, art critic Robert C. Morgan declared Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, along with Gino Severini's paintings Blue Dancer and Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin, to be \\"probably the most elegant and accurate works ever painted in the Futurist tradition.\\" He credits these works with \\"moving status into kinesis, stillness into motion, and thus giving life to culture, bringing it back from the bucolic ornaments of the 19th century.\\" Influence outside art A 2002 research paper on machine vision by computer scientists Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, to illustrate the mathematical representation of periodic motion using a small number of eigenshapes.

History The 270th Engineering Installation Squadron was originally activated at Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the 603rd Signal Light Construction Company on 12 April 1949. Federal recognition of the unit was extended on 17 May 1949 when the unit's manpower consisted of 2 officers and 11 Airmen. By 1 Jan. 1951, the unit reached strength of 5 officers and 86 Airmen. When the 111th Bombardment Group, the unit's Pennsylvania Air National Guard host, was mobilized on 10 April 1951 for the Korean War, the 603rd was left as the only Air Guard unit in Philadelphia. Due to the large amount of military air traffic in the area, one officer and six Airmen were placed on permanent duty with a mission to refuel and service military aircraft; maintain operational service and logging record on a 24-hour, 7-day per week basis. The wire construction mission continued with the unit winning several awards for military professionalism. On 1 Oct. 1952 the unit was reorganized and designated as the 270th Communications Squadron, Operations. The mission was changed from installation to operation of base communications equipment facilities to include telephone and teletype equipment. During annual training periods, unit members were integrated with active-duty Air Force communications units. When the 111th Bombardment Group returned to Philadelphia International Airport from Spokane, Washington, the 270th was relocated to the First Regiment Armory of the National Guard at 335 ‚Äì 347 North Broad and Callowhill Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The unit then returned to the Philadelphia International Airport and occupied temporary hangars where Atlantic Aviation, now Macquarie Infrastructure Company operates a Fixed-Base Operator Facility. In October 1960 the unit was reorganized and designated the 270th Ground Electronics Engineering Installation Agency (GEEIA) Squadron, and returned to the fixed communications installation mission. The gaining command at the time was the Air Materiel Command. They were then relocated to Fort Mifflin, Philadelphia until 1963 when the 111th Air Transport Group was reestablished to Willow Grove Naval Air Station, in Horsham, Pennsylvania. At that time, the 270th returned to the Philadelphia International Airport to become the sole military occupant and only Air National Guard unit in Philadelphia. In May 1970, GEEIA was absorbed into the Air Force Communications Service, which later became the Air Force Communications Command (AFCC). The 270th was designated the 270th Electronics Installation Squadron at that time. The unit was then rebranded in December 1982, to the designation of the 270th Engineering Installation Squadron with no change in mission or command. The 270th was relocated from Philadelphia International Airport to its current modern facilities at Willow Grove Air Reserve Station 15 Oct. 1985. Finally in July 2005, the 270th EIS, along with the other 19 Air National Guard and active duty Engineering Installations Squadrons, transferred from Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to Air Combat Command (ACC). At present, the 270th EIS now falls under the 24th Air Force and Air Force Space Command. When fully mobilized as a wartime asset, the unit is gained by the 253rd Combat Communications Group located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Mass. The 270th Engineering Installation Squadron typically performs thousands of hours of real world engineering and installation of command, control, communications, and computer systems annually for the US Air Force as an adjunct to training.

Drawing from his studies and experience through a Kagyu lineage, as well as his stay in Shunryu Suzuki's S≈çt≈ç Zen Monastery (Tassajara Zen Mountain Center) in California and Aitken Roshi's lay- practitioners' temple in Honolulu, Hawaii, his writing, interviews and public talks offer a secular and non-sectarian approach to being at peace with the world, both within and around us. Hawkeye does not consider himself a teacher or master of anything or anyone, but rather a translator of ancient wisdom into a language that people today can go beyond understanding to actually implementing into their daily lives. His intention is to awaken, enlighten, enrich and motivate readers to contemplate how they contribute to their own suffering, so that they can create healthier behavior patterns of inner peace despite external conflict, and looking at life through the lens of gratitude and abundance, not lack. \\"By no longer identifying as victims of our past,\\" Timber says, \\"we are empowered to change our future.\\"  Early life  Hawkeye was born Tomer Gal in Bat Yam, and raised in Katzrin, a small town in the Golan Heights of Israel, until he moved with his parents and older sister to San Francisco at the age of 13. He was introduced to books by Eknath Easwaran at 16, and that's what sparked his interest in mindfulness and meditation. Hawkeye describes his teenage years and early twenties as an ongoing attempt to embody what the media portrayed as the definition of being \\"American\\" and \\"Successful.\\" He started out as a paperboy at 14 delivering the San Francisco Examiner in the Sunset District, got his start in Corporate America during his senior year of high school when he worked for State Compensation Insurance Fund, and many office jobs after that (from the California State University, Stanislaus Foundation Department his first year of college, to paralegal jobs at law firms around the Bay Area and later in Seattle, Washington, focusing mainly on commercial real estate.  Transformation  In his books, interviews and public talks, Hawkeye mentions a couple of key moments that changed the trajectory of his life: # When he moved from San Francisco, CA to Seattle, WA, he accepted a job at a law firm that offered him 50% of the annual salary he received in California, but he loved Seattle so much and found himself twice as happy in the Pacific Northwest as he had been in Northern California. At that moment he realized that how happy he is has nothing to do with how much money he makes (despite the media constantly telling us otherwise). # After five years of working at the same law firm in Seattle, another paralegal at the firm was celebrating her 30-year anniversary, and Hawkeye says the fact that she was celebrating 30 years in a cubicle terrified him, as it had already been a total of ten years for him in California and Washington. That's when he decided there's got to be more to life than just working for a paycheck. He sold everything he ever owned and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii with the intention to lead a simple and uncomplicated life. He worked odd jobs on the island just to cover minimal expenses, and spent the rest of his time playing beach volleyball and tennis, hiking, and independently studying world religions and psychology simultaneously to better understand what people believe and why they believe what they do.  Books  Hawkeye's first book Buddhist Boot Camp is a collection of emails he had sent to his friends from Hawaii over the course of approximately eight years, which is why each chapter in the book is only a page or two long and can be read in any order. Buddhist Boot Camp was initially self-published through LuLu, but their distribution channels do not meet the specific requirements that independent bookstores and Barnes & Noble, for example, have for ordering books. He re-published it through Lightning Source, but within a month HarperCollins contacted him to republish the book for a third time, now in hardcover with twice as many chapters, multiple languages, and worldwide distribution. Buddhist Boot Camp went on to become an international bestseller, as well as part of the required-reading curriculum at a few high schools in California, and a guide used by therapists, veteran support group leaders, and correctional facilities across the globe that offer inmates free yoga and meditation classes as well. After touring with Buddhist Boot Camp across the U.S., U.K. and Australia, Hawkeye moved into a little cabin in the East Sierras to write and publish his second book (a memoir called Faithfully Religionless). Hawkeye Publishers, which was set up by Hawkeye in early 2016, was established to assist other authors through the publication process, as the world of independent publishing continues to evolve. His intention is to allow authors to focus on their writing instead of the often-overwhelming process of publishing, distribution, and marketing. Faithfully Religionless targets audiences who consider themselves spiritual, but not religious. It aims at aiding readers to lead a simple and uncomplicated life with happiness at their fingertips. It helps one discover the difference between feelings and emotions, the disparity between truths and facts, and the countless benefits of mindfully living a simple and uncomplicated life. Faithfully Religionless is a memoir by Timber Hawkeye. = Reception = Faithfully Religionless was launched at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, and many churches not only embrace Hawkeye's message as perfectly in line with their own invitation to establish a personal relationship with God, not against it, but have hosted Hawkeye on his book tour across the U.S. (including Saint Augustine's Episcopal Church in New Orleans, the Center for Spiritual Living in Camarillo and Napa Valley, Unity Church in Kansas City, and the Unitarian Universalist Church in Ventura).

Ordered on 15 September 1799 and built at Bucklers Hard shipyard, she was launched 23 September 1801. More than fifty of her crew were involved in the Easton Massacre when she visited Portland in April 1803 to press recruits. Much of her career as a frigate was spent in home waters where she fought the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809; initially providing support to the crews of the fireships, then forcing the surrender of the stranded French ships, Varsovie and Aquilon. Later that year she left The Downs to take part in the Walcheren Campaign where she carried out a two-day long bombardment of Flushing, leading to its capitulation on 15 August. In October 1811, Aigle was sent to the Mediterranean where she and her crew raided the island of Elba before being asked to provide naval support during the invasion and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord Paget. From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a receiving ship before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870. Construction and armament Aigle was the first of two frigates designed by naval surveyor, Sir John Henslow.Winfield p.156 Built under contract by Balthazar Adams, she was ordered on 15 September 1798 and her keel was laid down in November at Bucklers Hard shipyard in Hampshire. Launched on 23 September 1801, her dimensions were: along the gun deck, at the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . This made her 970 tons burthen (bm). Although classed as a 36-gun fifth rate, Aigle was armed with a main battery of twenty-six on her upper gun deck, four on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. She additionally carried ten carronades, eight on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. Service A plaque in St George's Church, Portland, remembering two quarrymen, a blacksmith and a young lady who died during the Easton Massacre Aigle was first commissioned for the English Channel, under Captain George Wolfe in December 1802. A large press gang from Aigle, of more than 50 marines and sailors, led by Wolfe, put ashore in Portland on 2 April 1803. In what became known as the Easton Massacre, a scuffle broke out between the inhabitants and Wolfe's forces.Adkins pp.109‚Äì110 Several civilians were shot and four were killed,Adkins p.110 while sixteen members of the press gang received injuries. Nine were wounded so seriously they had to be discharged. Wolfe and three officers stood trial for murder but were acquitted and left Portland, aboard Aigle, on 10 April to continue their patrol in home waters. Taking a French frigate, Franchise on 28 May, Aigle went on to capture six merchant vessels over the course of a week. A French privateer, Alerte, of 14 guns was taken on 27 September, off Vigo. Not far from the Cordouan Lighthouse, on 12 July 1804, Aigle encountered two French naval vessels, the 20-gun Charente and the 8-gun Joie out of Rochefort.James (Vol.III) p.270-271. At 17:00 Aigle caught up with them. The French ships shortened sail and looked as if they were about to do battle but after discharging their guns, both ran aground. Many of the French sailors were drowned when the boats they were attempting to escape in were engulfed by the large waves. Unable to re-float the stranded ships due to the heavy swell; Wolfe ordered them destroyed. Boats from Aigle were sent after some small craft, seen in the early hours of 27 November 1804 in the Bay of Gibraltar. On hearing some small-arms fire, Captain Thomas Dundas in set off in the direction of the noise and discovered a flotilla of Spanish gun-boats of which he managed to capture two. The boats and crew of Aigle were recovered without loss of life.Heathcote p.59. On 15 December 1804, Aigle accidentally ran down and sank His Majesty's hired armed schooner off Ushant, France. Aigle rescued Gertrude‚Ä≤s crew., p. 399. In January 1805 the Danish vessel Frederica Dorothea foundered while sailing from Bourdeaux to London. Here, too, Aigle rescued the crew. Temporary command was given to Henry Sturt in February 1805 but Wolfe was back in charge by 21 August 1805, when Aigle discovered a small British squadron under Captain John Tremayne Rodd comprising the frigates and Niobe and three smaller vessels.James (Vol.III) pp.302‚Äì303 Rodd had been shadowing the French fleet at Brest under Vice-Admiral Ganteaume, which had since left and was now at anchor between Camaret and Bertheaume. Shortly after her arrival, Aigle was dispatched to update the Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet, Admiral William Cornwallis of this development.James (Vol.III) p.303 Nine Spanish gun boats attacked Aigle in Vigo Bay on 28 September 1805. For an hour she had to endure their fire before the wind got up and the previously becalmed Aigle was able to launch a counter-offensive; capturing one gun boat and driving the others away. Two Chasse-mar√©es were taken by the crew of Aigle, in a cutting- out expedition on 15 October 1807 and while cruising with the 32-gun and 74-gun Gibraltar in December, she assisted with the capture of a Spanish schooner, Bueno Vista. A few days later the same three ships took a French Lugger and had more success in the first quarter of the following year, when four more Chasse-mar√©es were seized and a former British brig, Margaret was recaptured. =Action off Groix= A painting by Thomas Whitcombe thought to be Aigle capturing Le Sirene Aigle was in action again on 22 March 1808 against two large, French frigates; Italienne of 40 guns and the 38-gun Sirene. A squadron comprising Aigle, the 32-gun frigate , the two seventy- fours Imp√©tueux and , and two or three smaller vessels were anchored between the Gl√©nan islands, whilst being resupplied by a transport convoy.James (Vol.V) p.26 At 15:45, two French frigates to the south-east were simultaneously seen from Aigle's masthead and by the British schooner , which was stationed midway between the squadron and the island of Groix. Aigle immediately gave chase, and coming within hailing distance at 19:30, Wolfe directed Cuckoo to relay to Imp√©tueux and Narcissus, now following two miles behind, his intention to cut off the French ships by sailing between Groix and the mainland. An hour later, having endured the fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a position to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Imp√©tueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.James (Vol.V) pp.26‚Äì27 Saturn, Narcissus and Cuckoo joined Aigle and Imp√©tueux during the night and the following morning at dawn, the five British returned to the island but no further attempt was made on either of the French frigates. Six days later the stranded ship was re-floated and both vessels arrived safely in Lorient.James (Vol.V) p.27 Early in 1809, Aigle was back chasing merchantmen, securing five in January and February. =Battle of Basque Roads= Map illustrating the position of Aigle off the Boyart Shoal shortly before the British attack on the night of 11 April Aigle was part of the fleet under Admiral James Gambier that fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. The French ships were anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the Isle d'AixJames (Vol. V) pp. 103‚Äì104 when on 11 April Lord Cochrane led an attacking force of fireships and explosive vessels.James (Vol.V) p.105 Just prior to the attack, Aigle took up a position just north-east of the Boyart Shoal; anchored behind HMS Imperieuse, and ahead of and Pallas. It was the job of these four frigates to take on board the returning fireship crews and give assistance to the escorting boats, if required. The fireships had a partial success; the French, having anticipated such an attack, had rigged a boom across the channel.James (Vol.V) p.104 One of the explosive vessels however breached the boom, leading the French to cut their cables and drift on to the shoals.James (Vol.V) pp. 108‚Äì109 The following day, after much delay, Gambier took the rest of his fleet into the Basque Roads. The British ships anchored, with springs, in a crescent around the stranded French, and exchanged fire. Aigle took up a position, second in line behind Unicorn, and just ahead of and Indefatigable. These ships directed their fire mainly towards the French ships of the line, Varsovie and Aquilon, both of which struck at around 17:30.James (Vol.V) p.114. =Walcheren Campaign= The bombardment of Flushing Aigle was part of a large expeditionary force in the summer 1809. Comprising more than 600 vessels and nearly 40,000 troops, it left The Downs on 28 July, intent on destroying the dockyards and arsenals at Antwerp, Terneuse and Flushing, and capturing the French fleet stationed in the river Scheldt.James (Vol.V) pp.131‚Äì132 Troops were landed on the Island of Walcheren at 16:30 on 30 July, while bomb-vessels and gun-boats began a bombardment of Veere. The town surrendered immediately but it took several days of fighting, before the fort was captured on 1 August.James (Vol.V) p.133 The British then mounted an attack on Flushing, and the island of Zuid-Beveland which was taken unopposed; the forts there having already been deserted.James (Vol.V) pp.133‚Äì134 However, the British neglected Cadzand on the south-west side of the Scheldt, where more than 5,700 French troops crossed the river to reinforce Flushing.James (Vol.V) pp.134‚Äì135 The capitulation of Fort Rammekens allowed the British to besiege the town on 3 August and to prevent further aid being sent, a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched to the western arm of the Scheldt, to cut it off on the seaward side. The British then began locating and marking a channel for larger ships on 6 August.James (Vol.V) pp.135‚Äì136 A large squadron of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually able to make its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries on both sides of the river for more than two hours.James (Vol.V) p.136 Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded. Sick troops being evacuated from Walcheren on 30 August 1809 A two-day long bombardment of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, it left the British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops.James (Vol.V) p.137 Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August.James (Vol.V) p.138 The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when the British were still at sea.James (Vol.V) p.134 Between the British and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, it was decided to abandon the expedition in early September.James (Vol.V) pp.138‚Äì139 After a 13 hour chase across the Atlantic on 12 September 1810, Aigle captured a French privateer from Bordeaux: Phoenix, armed with eighteen 18-pounder carronades and carrying a well trained crew of 129, had been successfully preying on British and American shipping. =Mediterranean service= Sir John Louis was appointed captain in October 1811 and took Aigle to the Mediterranean. Aigle and used boats to land marines and seamen near the harbour of Campo del Porto, Elba, on 20 June 1813. When the batteries protecting the town were over-run and the troops there routed, the French scuttled three of their own ships to prevent them from becoming prizes. The following morning, having returned to the boats, the marines captured a small convoy of three settees and drove the brig protecting them into Portoferraio. Two large feluccas were taken from the town of Mesca in the Gulf of Spezia, on the 28 June. Prevented by the wind from using the ships, the British once more took to boats but only succeeded in driving their quarry inshore. Later that evening the wind changed direction and Aigle and Curacoa were able to bombard the town while marines took the feluccas from the beach. Four merchant vessels surrendered to , Alcmene and Aigle on 11 April 1814, then when a Sicilian army under Lord William Bentinck invaded and occupied Genoa eight days later, Aigle provided naval support as part of a fleet under Vice-Admiral Edward Pellew. Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle underwent repairs and alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square transom removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved protection in the rear and allowed a better field of fire.James (Vol.VI) Appendix p.21 She was subsequently laid up then repaired and cut down to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831.

He made his first rescue at the age of 11 and went on to save a total of 140 lives.Ken Worpole, \\"Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West\\" (Reaktion Books Ltd., London, 2003) p.109 He is one of only four people to have received the Royal Humane Society bronze medal with three clasps in relation to numerous rescues from the sea at Gorleston.W.H.Fevyer and Craig P.Barclay, \\"Acts of Gallantry: Volume 3\\" (The Naval and Military Press, 2002) , p.60 William Adams also has the distinction of having his name appear twice in the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust Roll of Honour. He was known as \\"The Hero of Gorleston Pier\\" and also as \\"Professor\\" Adams in recognition of the expert swimming tuition he provided. Notable rescues and awards William Adams developed into a highly proficient swimmer at an early age. He made his first rescue when only 11 by saving the life of a young girl who had fallen from the pier into the sea.Robert Bagshaw, \\"More Memories of Norfolk\\" (Geo. R. Reeve Ltd., Wymondham, 1992) p.128-131 This event marked the beginning of a lifetime of lifesaving. Adams took up employment as a tinsmith in the winter months. However, every summer he would return to his alternative occupation as a proprietor of beach huts and swimming instructor on Gorleston beach. Consequently, he was usually close at hand if a bather required assistance. He was never a member of a lifeboat crew and instead saved lives by swimming or diving to the aid of the stricken swimmer. In 1890 William Adams was the proud recipient of the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal for his bravery in rescuing a local lad named Robert Drane. He soon became well known as the \\"Hero of Gorleston Pier\\" and reports of his rescues appeared with great regularity in the local, national and also international press.see: Hero of Gorleston Pier: Great Yarmouth Mercury 20 September 1890 In 1896 a Norwich man called Rimmington got into difficulties whilst bathing in the sea at Gorleston. A man called Collins, from London, went to his aid but soon also found himself in danger as Rimmington panicked and clutched to him frantically. It was at this point that Adams became aware, swam to the two men and brought them both ashore together on his back. For this \\"double rescue\\" William Adams was presented with a row of four bathing huts. Another famous rescue occurred when Adams swam out to sea and brought safely to shore a rowing boat which contained two couples. The vessel had drifted dangerously out to sea and appeared to be unmanageable by the occupants.see: Savior of Sixty Lives: The Morning Leader, London 10 September 1900 He was honoured on numerous occasions in recognition of his outstanding life saving record. In 1906 the Mayor of Great Yarmouth presented Adams with an illuminated address. The testimonial, signed by 90 subscribers, stated that he had saved 77 lives up to that time. The 1st of two entries for William Adams in the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust Roll of Honour As a swimmer and swimming instructor In 1881 the annual Gorleston Marine Regatta added a 400 yards swimming contest for a gold challenge medal and a silver cup to its programme of events. This event was won by a 17 year old William Adams and he repeated the feat in 1882 and 1883 therefore winning the gold medal outright.David Tubby, \\"Great Yarmouth's Sporting Heritage: Part 1 - The Early Years\\" (David Tubby, Gorleston-on-Sea, 2013) p.10 He coached some of the best swimmers of the day and gave lessons to many schools and clubs, acquiring the title of \\"Professor\\" Adams in the process. One young pupil who greatly benefited from the swimming tuition Adams provided was Frank Keymer, whose life Adams had saved in 1898 after a particularly perilous rescue. Subsequently, Keymer became a member of the Gorleston Swimming Club of which Professor Adams was instructor. It would seem Adams taught him well, for in an extraordinary coincidence Keymer himself saved a life in 1905.Stewart W. Adams & Dr. Ian F. Keymer, \\"Brave Men, Brave Deeds (article in 'Yarmouth Archaeology', 2005) the annual publication of the Great Yarmouth & District Archaeological Society. Personal life William was born in Gorleston and was the son of Gorleston Trinity House Maritime pilot Abel Adams. William married Ellen Eliza Durrant in 1884 and they brought up a family of eight children together; two daughters followed by six sons. The Great Yarmouth Mercury once recorded that the five eldest sons were all strong swimmers like their father. Death William Adams died 14 October 1913 at the age of 49. Despite having been in failing health he had made his last, dramatic rescue at Gorleston beach only a month earlier. The Revd. Ritso spoke of this final act of bravery in his moving funeral address: Reading the Great Yarmouth Mercury account of the funeral it is clear that William Adams had been held in the very highest regard by his fellow townspeople: William Adams dedicated his life to life saving, using his physical strength and swimming prowess to save others. The Great Yarmouth Mercury carried an eloquent tribute: From a distance his headstone does not look any different from the others that surround it. However, on closer inspection the depiction of a man diving to the rescue of a drowning figure can be seen. The headstone bears the following inscription: Legacy His name was immortalised when a road was named in his honour in 2007The life story and likeness of William Adams have been used in recent years in a number of interesting and diverse ways. He has been the subject of local history exhibitions and lectures, school assemblies, poetry, artwork and even textile design. In addition his story has been mentioned in a number of books and websites. Notably he was the subject of the 1st blue plaque to be installed in Gorleston by the Great Yarmouth Local History and Archaeological Society. This event took place on 28 May 2004 when the plaque was unveiled at his former home, 199 Bells Road, Gorleston.Compiled by Alan Hunt, \\"Plaques in and around Great Yarmouth and Gorleston\\" (Great Yarmouth Local History and Archaeological Society, 2013) p.32 & 33 On 11 April 2007 his name became immortalised in a road name, William Adams Way, which serves as a busy route into Gorleston. On 13 March 2018 a brand new ¬£2.2 million JD Wetherspoon pub, The William Adams, was officially opened in Gorleston by the Mayor with four generations of descendants of William Adams in attendance. The name of this local hero was chosen following a public vote.

The film stars Ansel Elgort as Theodore Decker, whose life changes after his mother dies in a terrorist bombing at a museum and a dying man convinces him to take a famous painting called The Goldfinch from the museum. Oakes Fegley, Aneurin Barnard, Finn Wolfhard, Sarah Paulson, Luke Wilson, Jeffrey Wright, and Nicole Kidman appear in supporting roles. Film rights to the novel were sold to Warner Bros. and RatPac Entertainment, with ICM Partners brokering the deal. Two years later, Crowley was hired to direct the film adaptation, and Elgort was selected to portray Theodore Decker. Most of the remaining cast joined from October 2017 to January 2018. Filming began in New York City in January 2018 and moved to Albuquerque in April 2018 for the rest of the production. The Goldfinch premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival and was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb, with estimated losses for the studio as high as $50 million. Plot Thirteen-year-old Theodore Decker's mother is killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the aftermath of the explosion, a dying man urges him to take a painting ‚Äì The Goldfinch ‚Äì and his engraved ring. Theo hides the painting at his apartment, and is placed with the Barbours, the family of his childhood friend Andy. Theo reconnects with Andy and becomes close to Mrs. Barbour, who encourages his interest in antiques and art. Following the instructions of the dying man, Theo locates the antiques shop run by James \\"Hobie\\" Hobart, whose partner Welton \\"Welty\\" Blackwell gave the ring to Theo to return. Hobie allows Theo to visit Pippa, Welty‚Äôs niece who was injured in the bombing, and the children bond before Pippa is sent to live with her aunt in Texas. Theo visits Hobie regularly and settles into life with the Barbours, as Andy hints that his parents are considering adopting him. However, Theo's estranged father Larry, claiming to be newly sober, arrives with his girlfriend Xandra to relocate Theo to Las Vegas; Theo brings The Goldfinch, keeping it hidden. In Las Vegas, Theo befriends Boris, a Ukrainian classmate whose father is physically abusive. Boris, who has also lost his mother, introduces Theo to drugs and alcohol, which follow him into adulthood. Deep in gambling debt, Larry fails to extort Theo's education fund, and is killed in a drunk driving accident. Theo runs away to New York, taking Xandra's dog Popper and the painting, but is unable to convince Boris to join him. Hobie allows Theo to live with him. Eight years later, Theo has made Hobie‚Äôs shop successful, selling his restored antiques. He runs into Andy's older brother Platt, who reveals that Andy and their father were killed in a boating accident during one of Mr. Barbour‚Äôs bipolar episodes. Theo visits the ailing Mrs. Barbour, and reconnects with her daughter Kitsey. Reeve, a disgruntled art dealer, confronts Theo for selling him a fake. Having deduced that Theo stole The Goldfinch, Reeve accuses him of using it as collateral to finance his shop. Unknown to anyone else, Theo keeps the wrapped painting in a storage locker. Theo becomes engaged to Andy's younger sister Kitsey, but harbors a secret love for Pippa, who now lives in London. Theo catches Kitsey cheating on him, but they remain engaged due to his love for Mrs. Barbour and Kitsey's permissive attitude toward his drug habit. Pippa visits Theo and they confess their feelings for each other, but she tearfully rejects him, citing the instability caused by their shared childhood trauma. Seeking to buy drugs at a bar, Theo is reunited with Boris, who apologizes for stealing The Goldfinch years ago, using it to finance his life of crime before it was then stolen from him. At his storage locker, Theo discovers Boris had replaced the painting with a school textbook. After a visit from Reeve, a heartbroken Hobie confronts Theo for selling his restorations as ‚Äúreal‚Äù forgeries, and the theft and loss of The Goldfinch. At Theo's and Kitsey's engagement party, Boris arrives with a plan to recover The Goldfinch. Theo accompanies him to Amsterdam, where Boris seizes the painting at gunpoint, but they are ambushed by another pair of criminals. Boris kills one of them but is shot, and Theo is forced to kill the other assailant, but another man escapes with the painting. Theo tries to commit suicide in his hotel room, but is rescued by Boris, who explains that he had a tip called in to the police to recover the painting. Organizing a raid, the authorities safely recover the painting along with other lost and stolen art, including a Rembrandt. Boris persuades Theo that this was all for the greater good: The Goldfinch survives, and other lost works were recovered. Theo returns home to repair his damaged relationships.

Pictures and RatPac Entertainment with ICM Partners brokering the deal. Two years later, John Crowley was hired to direct the film adaptation. In August 2017, Warner Bros. finalized a deal with Amazon Studios to co-finance the adaptation, where Amazon would invest in more than a third of the project's budget and obtain streaming rights to the picture on its Prime service, while Warner Bros. would distribute the film in theaters worldwide. On October 4, 2017, after a two-month casting search, Ansel Elgort was cast in the lead role of Theodore \\"Theo\\" Decker, following his breakout turn in Baby Driver. On the same day, cinematographer Roger Deakins revealed to Variety that The Goldfinch was his next project after Blade Runner 2049. Later that month, in light of his recent performance in Dunkirk, Aneurin Barnard was cast as Boris. On November 15, Sarah Paulson was cast as Xandra. By late November, Trevor Gureckis was hired as the film's composer. In December 2017, Willa Fitzgerald and Ashleigh Cummings joined the cast. During the same month, Kelley Dixon from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul was enlisted to be the film's editor. In January 2018, Jeffrey Wright, Luke Wilson, Finn Wolfhard, and Luke Kleintank joined the cast. Later that month, the rest of the cast was announced as principal production commenced. Principal photography began in New York on January 23, 2018, before moving to Albuquerque on April 3, 2018 for the rest of production. Marketing Footage from the film was first shown at CinemaCon on April 2, 2019. The first official images were released on May 28, 2019, as well as the first official teaser poster of the film. The first official trailer was released on May 29, 2019. About six months prior to its release, following test screenings, Warner Bros. knew the film would possibly perform poorly and in turn \\"dramatically\\" trimmed their prospective marketing plan. Release The Goldfinch premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019. It was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019, after previously being set for October 11. Reception =Box office= The Goldfinch grossed $5.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $4.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $9.4 million, against a production budget of around $45 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Hustlers and was originally projected to gross $5‚Äì8 million from 2,542 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making just $870,000 on its first day, estimates were lowered to below $3 million. It went on to debut to just $2.6 million, the sixth-worst saturated opening of all-time for a film playing on over 2,500 screens. Following its poor opening, many publications had already labeled the film a box-office bomb and estimated it would lose as much as $50 million ($25‚Äì30 million for Warner Bros. and $16‚Äì18 million for Amazon Studios). The film plunged 71% in its second weekend to $770,000. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 24% based on 216 reviews, with an average rating of 4.49/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Beautifully filmed yet mostly inert, The Goldfinch mishandles its source material, flattening a complex narrative into a largely uninvolving disappointment.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. A.O. Scott, writing for the New York Times, said the film \\"looks and sounds like a movie without quite being one. It's more like a Pinterest page or a piece of fan art, the record of an enthusiasm that is, to the outside observer, indistinguishable from confusion.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it \\"a botch job for the ages\\" and said it \\"appears to be adapting the Cliff‚Äôs Notes version of the book instead of the book itself, producing an unplayable series of scene snippets\\".Review: ‚ÄòThe Goldfinch‚Äô Is a Stolen Opportunity.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the mountainsides of Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. It has stoloniferous, spreading rhizomes, long, sword shaped, bright green leaves, long slender stem (taller than the leaves) and 1 flower in Spring (between March and April). The large flower is pale yellow, creamy-white, or white background. Which is covered with reddish-brown, maroon brown, purple-brown, purple, blue-purple, or blue veins, markings or spots. It has a dark signal patch and dark purple to black beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions (i.e. Europe or America), as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. Description Iris bismarkiana is similar in growth to Iris susiana and Iris lortetii, (both also Oncocyclus Irises), they only differ in the colour of the flowers. It is a geophyte, It has short, stoloniferous rhizomes,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) British Iris Society (1997) which are narrow, around 1.5 cm in diameter. It forms long thin stolons, that can reach up to a few meters, into the ground, seeking minerals. The rhizomes and stolons are very prone to viral diseases. The creeping, habit forms small clumps of plants. It has 6‚Äì8 leaves, which are ensiform (sword-shaped), glaucous, and bright green. They can grow up to between long, and between 2‚Äì2.5 cm wide. They form erect fans of leaves, which are similar in form to I. susiana leaves. It has a long, slender stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. Although, some stems can reach tall. The stem is usually taller than the leaves. The stem has a green, lanceolate, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which is long. The stems holds 1 terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in spring, between March and April. In the UK, it flowered in May. The flowers are in diameter, and they have a pale yellow, yellow-green, cream, creamy-white, or white ground. Which is covered with reddish-brown, maroon brown, purple-brown, purple, blue-purple, light violet, lilac, or blue veins or spots. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. It has ovate shaped falls, which are long and 4 cm wide. They are densely spotted or veined and have a purple-brown, or dark purple signal patch. The signal is at the entrance to the perianth. It is similar coloured to the spotting or veining. In the middle of the falls, a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is dark purple, or blackish. The standards are much paler (in colour) than the falls, and are orbicular (circular), which are long. They have paler veining or spotting as well, in blue purple, purple or blue. The flowers are very similar in form to I. susiana. It has oblong shaped stigmas, which are a similar colour to the petals, and are also densely veined. It relies on a small number of pollinator species whose pollinators are specialists. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, that opens up into three sections, to hold multiple seeds. = Genome = As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted by Marc Simonet in 1934. It has twenty chromosomes (2n=20). Taxonomy It is commonly known as Nazareth Iris, due to being found on the mountains near Nazareth in Israel. It is known in Arabic as 'Saoosan' (A-Natsir), or ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿµÿ±Ÿá . while in Hebrew, it is written as ◊ê÷¥◊ô◊®◊ï÷º◊° ◊†÷∏◊¶÷∞◊®÷∏◊™÷¥◊ô . It is occasionally misspelt as Iris bismarkiana. The Latin specific epithet bismarckiana refers to Prince Otto von Bismark (1815-1898, 1st Chancellor of the German Empire). In 1888, rhizomes of the plant were sent from Lebanon to Germany, by Messrs. Dammann & Co., of Naples. It was then described by E. Dammann and Carl Sprenger in Wiener Illustr. Gartzeitung (Wien. Gartenz.) Vol.352. fig. 72 in 1890 (with an illustration). It was then widely published by Regel in Vol.17 of Wiener Illustr. Gartzeitung on page 855 in 1892. In 1893, Foster described a new iris species, Iris sari var. nazarensis from the Nazareth area in Israel, (in Gardener's Chronicle Vol. 33,) but then in 1904, (in Botanical Magazine Vol.7986,) Sprenger thought the two plants were the same. In 1934, John Edward Dinsmore published two species called Iris nazarena (from Nazareth) and Iris hermona (from the Golan Heights). Later, in 1970, Mouterde decided all the species were one type 'I. bismarckiana'. 'I. sari var. nazarensis' and 'I. nazarena' became synonyms of 'I. bismarckiana'. In 1972, Avishai disagreed, and thought that Iris hermona was a separate species, especially due to the rhizome differences (stoloniferous in 'I. bismarckiana' and compact in 'I. hermona'). Feinbrun-Dothan in 1986 agreed. It is listed as 'I. bismarckiana' Damm. & Spreng ex Regel. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 10 March 1997, and then last changed on 1 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. It is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to south Lebanon and northern Israel. =Range= Iris bismarckiana on Mount Yona, Nazareth, Israel It is found in Israel, (including in the provinces of Upper and Lower Galilee, on Mount Hermon, on Mt. Yona, and on Mount Tabor,) Lebanon, (on Mount Lebanon, and in Wadi Rajib, near Adjloon,) Syria, and Jordan, (on the Gilead Mountains). =Habitat= It grows on the rocky and stony mountain-sides, at the edges of woodlands, or in scrub land. It can be found on heavy, limestone clays, basalt (rocks), or terra rossa and soft chalky rocks. They can be found at an altitude of up to above sea level. Conservation thumb It is a very rare iris, and was under risk of extinction, from threats of urbanization, animal grazing and forestry (creating plantations) with in Israel. In Lebanon, it was threatened by housing and road construction on its habitats. It was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as Endangered when last assessed on 2 May 2016. Within Israel, the species is protected by law, and it is grown in several nature reserves, including the Giv'at Ha-More Nature Reserve and in some of the smaller Reserves on Naphtali hill. Although, it is still declining in populations in the reserves. In Upper Nazareth, Israel, a residential neighbourhood was planned, but it clashed with hundreds of irises. So a section of land was turned into a nature reserve to protect them. It is further threatened with the reserves, by an invasive weed, Sarcopoterium spinosum (or Prickly burnet), a common dwarf shrub which competes with the iris for space. Although, it was found if the weed was burned in patches the iris grew stronger. It is also threatened by caterpillars (who feed on the iris flower-buds). Cultivation It is hardy to European Zone H4, meaning hardy to ‚àí5 to ‚àí10 ¬∞C (or 23 to 14 ¬∞F). It was cultivated in Naples, in 1888, but soon its growth suffered, due to the environmental conditions. It is considered rather difficult to cultivate, due to it needing high temperatures and dryness. It is thought to be best planted in October, by William Rickatson Dykes. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. =Hybrids and cultivars= Known I. bismarkiana cultivars include 'Benjaminii', 'Nazarena' and 'Nazarena Thompsoni'. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Uses It is normally used as a garden ornamental plant, but they have also been planted in cemeteries, including in Rajib. The iris rhizome has been used in a perfume called 'Iris Nazarena', by Aedes de Venustas, a New York-based fragrance boutique. Culture One source states that the iris was chosen, as the logo of The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, but it is in fact Iris haynei (the Gilboa Iris).Alon Tal The 'Nazareth Iris' is known as the symbol of the city of Nof HaGalil.

The owners of this shipping company in later years were Messrs. W. Lund and Sons. The Blue Anchor Line was founded in London by Wilhelm Lund (b. Denmark 1837, d. Kent, 1928) in 1869. His two sons were Albert Edward Lund and Friedrich Wilhelm Lund, who was also called Frederick Lund, and is also recorded as F.W. Lund Jr. (because his grandfather, also a ship-owner, was also called Friedrich Wilhelm Lund). An \\"H. Lund\\" also appears in relation to the business. Originally sailing ships were used. Between 1880 and 1890, sailing ships were replaced by steamers. Ships operated by this company include Waratah, Commonwealth, Bungaree, Geelong, Wilcannia, Narrung, and Wakool. The disappearance of the Waratah near Durban in 1909 resulted in the commercial failure of the company. Its ships were sold to P&O;, and it was wound up in 1910. An inquiry was held in London to investigate the disappearance of the Waratah, and F.W.Lund Jr., who gave evidence at the inquiry on behalf of the owners, was described in some newspaper reports as the chairman of directors of the company, although it appears to have actually been a partnership, in which Wilhelm Lund was still the senior partner. The wreck of the Waratah has never been found, and the cause of its loss remains inconclusive and still attracts controversy. Despite this setback, Wilhelm Lund and F.W. Lund continued to be respectable businessmen.

After the war, in 1946, he was implicated in an attempted coup d'√©tat against the Luxembourg state. Biography =Before 1940= Albert Wingert was a teacher by profession. From 1922 to 1933 he was married to the co-teacher and author Maria Rodenbour who he had met while working in Perl√©. In 1923 he was appointed head of the school run by the League of Nations in the Saar and lived with his wife in V√∂lklingen. He became involved in various freethinking and pro-democracy political movements. After the Nazis came to power in Germany, he decided to return to Luxembourg. From 1934 he lived in Schifflange. =German occupation= After the occupation of Luxembourg by Nazi Germany, Wingert was arrested in October 1940 and sentenced to three months in solitary confinement after the Gestapo found weapons in his possession. In June 1941 he was a founding member of the Alweraje resistance group. According to information provided later by Wingert group had up to 400 members and helpers. From June to December 1941 Albert Wingert worked on the motorway being built from Wittlich to Trier, but returned as often as possible after walking Sch√´ffl√©ng back to organize the resistance. He was later transferred to D√ºsseldorf, where he was arrested on 5 August by the Gestapo. At the same time including almost all members of the inner circle of around 100 Alweraje resisters were arrested in Luxembourg. On 17 August 1942, Wingert arrived in Hinzert concentration camp. On the same day, there was an incident with SS-Mann Georg Schaaf, known as \\"Ivan the Terrible\\". Schaaf struck Wingert with a fist whereupon he struck back. Wingert was beaten by several guards with shovels and pickaxes until a superior intervened, preventing his death. From Hinzert from Wingert was deported to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp from where he unsuccessfully tried to escape. =After 1945= In 1945, Wingert stood as a candidate for the Social Democratic Party but without success. He became a strong critic of what he perceived as the clientelist politics of Luxembourg and the lack of appreciation for the role of the wartime resistance. In August 1946 he was arrested and accused of plotting a coup d'√©tat against the government of Pierre Dupong. After nine days in prison he was released without charge but his reputation was destroyed.

It was published in January 2000, while Trump was considering running for president in that year's election on the Reform Party's ticket. The book lists and details a set of policy proposals Trump intended to implement should he ever become president. Positions and proposals In the book, Trump expressed anti-illegal-immigration views similar to those that he espoused when he ran for president successfully in 2016. For example, he wrote, \\"A liberal policy of immigration may seem to reflect confidence and generosity. But our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.\\" However, Trump also endorsed some proposals he would abandon by 2016. For example, Trump proposed a 14.25% tax on individuals and trusts valued at more than $10 million. Trump also wrote in the book that we need to have a universal health care system. https://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/America_We_Deserve_Health_Care.htm Expectations of terrorism During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump frequently cited the book on the campaign trail as proof that he predicted the September 11 attacks. This is because he mentioned Osama Bin Laden in the book; however, Trump did not predict that Bin Laden would commit a terrorist attack against the United States in the book. Trump also incorrectly claimed (for instance, in a 2015 interview with Alex Jones) that Bin Laden was not very well known in 2000, and that in the book, Trump personally called for someone to \\"take him out\\". Trump did, however, correctly predict that a major terror attack (not mentioning Bin Laden or anyone else as a perpetrator) would soon occur in the U.S., writing, \\"I really am convinced we're in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the [1993] bombing of the [World] Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers.\\" Less than two years after its publication, a major terrorist attack occurred on September 11, 2001, involving another attack on the World Trade Center, this time destroying the buildings, as well as an attack on the Pentagon. Reviews In the February 2000 issue of The American Spectator, Shiflett wrote that the book \\"will appeal to the established Trump constituency, but also hopes to show the author as worthy of wider support.\\" See also * Bibliography of Donald Trump *Time to Get Tough References 2000 non-fiction books Books by Donald Trump Literary collaborations ","title":"The America We Deserve"},{"id":"51121765","text":"The Way to the Top: The Best Business Advice I Ever Received is a business book compiled by Donald Trump.

American Character Dolls went bankrupt in 1968, with their assets acquired by the Ideal Toy Company. History = Corporate history = Dressing and packing dolls at Paragon Manufacturing Company in Easthampton, Massachusetts (1937) The American Doll and Toy Corporation was established in 1919 by Russian Jewish immigrant brothers Jacob and Max Brock, and their partner Ed Schaefaer, with many of the Brock relatives occupying key positions at the company. The company used the trade names \\"Aceedeecee\\" and \\"ACDC\\".

Accessed Dec. 26, 2014. = Product history = I Love Lucy baby doll, introduced in 1952 American Character dolls were thought to be well-made, with good quality costumes. Early dolls were made of composition; one of their first lines of mother and character dolls were introduced in 1923 and called \\"Petite;\\" they remained popular into the 1930s. The Puggy and Sally Campbell Kids children dolls were introduced in 1928; they were based on the cartoon characters designed by Grace Drayton. American Character released a limited number of celebrity dolls over the years, beginning with \\"Lucky Aviation Kid\\" in 1927, a Charles Lindbergh doll wearing a brown aviator suit and flight cap, with a Spirit of St. Louis model plane ribbon, white socks and brown shoes. In the 1930s, the company released the celebrity doll \\"Carol Ann Beery,\\" based on the child actress of the same name. The Kathryn Grayson autographed celebrity doll was produced in the late 1940s. American Character switched their formula from composition to their branded \\"Paratex\\" in the mid-1930s. Celebrity dolls released in the 1950s included Alice In Wonderland (1952), \\"Annie Oakley\\" (1954), \\"Eloise,\\" and a series of I Love Lucy dolls (1952), the most popular of which was the baby doll later known as \\"Little Ricky.\\" The 14\\" vinyl doll came dressed in a flannel gown and cried \\"real tears.\\" (In 1952 stars Lucille Ball and husband Desi Arnaz were expecting a child.)\\"Advertising & Merchandising News,\\" New York Times (November 15, 1952), p. 24. American Character's most popular doll was Tiny Tears, introduced in 1950 and remaining in production through the rest of the company's existence. The baby doll's distinguishing feature was her ability to shed tears from two tiny holes on either side of her nose when her stomach was pressed after being filled with water from her baby bottle. Tiny Tears became one of the most popular dolls of the 1950s, due in part to television ads featuring a young Patty Duke that aired on popular children's shows such as the highly influential Ding Dong School with Frances Horwich.Waggoner, Susan. Under the Tree: the Toys and Treats That Made Christmas Special, 1930-1970. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 2007. \\"Sweet Sue,\\" introduced in 1951, was popular through the decade into the early 1960s. A pre-teen plastic doll, she came in a variety of sizes. In 1957, American Character marketed \\"Sweet Sue Sophisticate,\\" a 14\\" or 20\\" fashion doll. The \\"Toodles\\" multi-jointed plastic doll ‚Äî able to \\"kneel, sit, play and assume 1,000 different positions\\" ‚Äî was introduced in 1955 and became a big seller for American Character, including its associated products like \\"Toodles Toddler\\" (1955-1959), \\"Teeny Toodles\\" (1959-1960), and \\"Tommy Toodles\\" (1959-1960). \\"Toni,\\" released in 1958, was a fashion doll for Toni hair products, sold by Gillette. Toni, also marketed as \\"Cha Cha\\" or \\"High Society,\\" was popular into the 1960s. Tressy, introduced in 1963, was a fashion doll with a feature to adjust the length of its hair. The doll was invented and patented by modern furniture designer Jesse Dean and his wife, Diana. It was first sold as an 11¬Ω\\" fashion doll similar to Mattel's Barbie. Tressy featured a long swatch of hair that could be pulled out of the top of the doll's head by pushing a button on the doll's midriff; that mechanism allowed children the ability to comb the hair in a variety of styles. American Character clearly intended that Tressy's \\"growing\\" hair feature would give the doll a marketing edge over its blockbuster competitor, Barbie. Tressy was popular from the outset, selling into its retirement in 1965. Unlike Mattel, which maintained sole manufacturing and global distribution rights on its bestselling Barbie doll, American Character allowed the Regal Toy Company of Canada to manufacture and sell its own version of Tressy, which had heavier eye and facial makeup. There was also a Palitoy Tressy sold in the United Kingdom and a Bella Tressy made and marketed by Societe Bella in France. \\"Cricket\\" was marketed by the American Character Doll Co. in 1964 as Tressy's cousin. American Character focused on talking dolls in the early 1960s, with such models as \\"Little Miss Echo\\" (1962-1964), \\"Baby Babbles\\" (1963), and \\"Baby Says,\\" (1963). The only celebrity dolls American Character released in the 1960s were the Cartwright Family (1966), based on Bonanza. The company's final big product launches were \\"Whimsies\\" (1960‚Äì1961), a line of dolls with names like Bashful Bride, Dixie the Pixie, Fanny (an angel), Hedda Get Bedda (a multi-face doll, with three faces), Hilda the Hillbilly, Lena the Cleaner, Miss Take, Monk, Polly the Lady Raggie, Simon, Strong Man, Suzie the Snoozie, Tillie the Talker, Wheeler Dealer, Zack the Sack, and Zero the Hero (a football player); and \\"Tiny Whimsies\\" (1966), a line of 7-1/2\\" dolls with names like Lites Out (nightgown), I'm Yours (bride), Fly with Me (witch), Swing It (dancer), Love Me (red pantsuit), and I'm Hooked (groom); and a line of 6\\" dolls with names like Pixie, Swinger, Granny, Lites out, Minnie Mod, Jump'n, and Go-Go.

It included the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station and the newly created Itingu√ßu and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge. The state parks and sustainable development reserves were carved out of the ecological station, and an area of banana plantations in the municipality of Miracatu, north of the station, was also dropped from the station.

The church was built in 1897 as a stave church imitation and has 95 seats. St. Olaf's Church is notable as the inspiration for the chapel in Elsa's coronation scene in the 2013 Disney film Frozen.The Frozen church has an incredible love story behind it www.kviknes.com  History  Knut Kvikne and Margaret Sophia Green Balestrand was a popular site for British tourists in the latter half of the 19th century. One of these was the English clergyman's daughter and climbing pioneer, Margaret Sophia Green. She got along very well with the Norwegians and loved the Norwegian mountains. In 1890, Margaret married Knut Kvikne, whose family owned the Kviknes Hotel in Balestrand. Shortly after her marriage, Margaret was diagnosed with tuberculosis; she died in 1894. Before she died, she told her husband that she had a dream of building an English church in Balestrand. As a legacy to his wife, Knut Kvikne separated a plot from the Kviknes Hotel's large plots, and with the help of generous donations from two American women, he began to build. The church was consecrated just three years after Margaret's death.  Ornaments  The church looks from the outside like a stave church and has horizontal paneling. It has two spiers, one of the choir, and a bell tower over the ridge turret in the middle of the nave. The ridge turret is decorated with two dragon heads, as on the ancient stave churches. Just inside the front door hangs a painted portrait of Margaret Sophia Green Kvikne, her name after she married. There is a memorial brass plate. The inscription is The Mountains shall bring Peace. This is taken from Psalm 72, and was a very important Bible verse for the climbing Margaret. The altarpiece, painted by Emma Pastor Normann is from 1897 and shows The Risen Christ. The church has a banner, showing Saint Olaf, probably made in 1897. The church room is also decorated with wood carvings. = Stained glass = In the choir there are nine stained glass windows with saints as a theme. Of these saints there are three Norwegian saints; St. Olaf, St. Hallvard and St. Sunniva. The others are Mary, mother of Jesus, St. Columba, St. Clement, St. Bride, St. Swithun and St. George.

There are also services in weekdays and weekends when priests are available. At other times of the year there are worship services when it is agreed. The church is run economically on donations from tourists, and the priests who serve in the church are English speakers who work for free. The owners of the Kvicknes Hotel provide the visiting priests free room and board, as they have since the church was consecrated. Janitorial and supervision services for the church building are carried out by the hotel. The church has over the years been a popular location for weddings, especially by Norwegian-British bridal couples.

Stocker has been credited with revolutionizing the treatment of sick or injured wild animals in Britain through the practice of wildlife rehabilitation, which is now commonplace across the country. He received numerous honors for his work at Tiggywinkles, including the Rolex Awards for Enterprise in 1990, an appointment as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to wildlife in 1991, and recognition as an honorary associate of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 2002. Stocker was born on 31 January 1943 in Battersea to Rose (n√©e Weaving) Stocker, a civil servant, and Rob Stocker, a site manager. He attended Emanuel School in Battersea and became an accountant, and also had a spell running a company specializing in electrical engineering. He married his wife, the former Sue Gee, in 1964 and moved to Buckinghamshire. Les Stocker began his work in wildlife rehabilitation by rescuing and treating animals in the shed of his Buckinghamshire home. In 1983, he established the Wildlife Hospital Trust, the country's first wildlife hospital. A drought in 1984 brought a large number of distressed hedgehogs to the hospital as patients. In 1985, in response, Stocker set up a ward solely to treat the numerous hedgehogs. He named the ward St Tiggywinkles after the fictional hedgehog character created by Beatrix Potter. The entire Wildlife Hospital Trust hospital gradually came to be known simply as \\"Tiggywinkles\\". In 1991, Stocker moved Tiggywinkles to its present location in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. Under Stocker, Tiggywinkles pioneered new treatments for wild animals, ranging from birds of prey, like kestrels, to toads and badgers. Notably, it is estimated that 30% of the approximately 10,000 animals treated at Tiggywinkles each year are hedgehogs. Stocker and his staff developed new medical treatments specifically for hedgehogs, which are now utilized at rehabilitation centers throughout Britain. Les Stocker even established a museum devoted to hedgehogs, Hedgehog World, showcasing related artifacts from ancient Egypt to the present day, on the Tiggywinkles grounds. He published a memoir, Something in a Cardboard Box (1989), in which he encouraged others to give back and make a difference. Rolex honored Stocker with its Rolex Award for Enterprise in 1990 and he was appointed an MBE in 1991 for his service to wildlife. In 2002, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons recognized Stocker, who had no formal veterinary training, as an honorary associate. Les Stocker died unexpectedly on 16 July 2016 at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife, Sue, whom he married in 1964, their son, Colin, who currently manages the Wildlife Hospital Trust, and his granddaughters, Amelia and Alexia.

It made clear that postnuptial agreements in the Isle of Man cannot be varied by a court other than for sufficient policy reasons. Although technically only applying to Manx postnuptial agreements, the judgment is treated with authority in the United Kingdom.Herring, J, Family Law (6th edn, Pearson, 2013), 267 Facts The husband and wife were both from the United States and married in Florida. The husband was older and far wealthier than the wife. They moved to the Isle of Man in 1995. Before marrying, each party declared their resources and agreed that, in the event of their separation, they would each be entitled to that which they put into the marriage. At the time, the husband's wealth was approximately US$10.3 million. There were additional provisions for monthly allowances and lump payments to be paid by the husband to the wife. Such agreements were perfectly valid and binding in the state of Florida at the time.Posner v Posner 233 So 2d 381 (Fla 1970) In 2002, another agreement was struck which made significant alterations to the original agreement, although it made clear that the parties still intended to be bound by the 1995 agreement as amended. Proceedings The parties made application for divorce, and proceedings for ancillary relief began in 2005. The wife claimed that the agreements should be disregarded, and claimed for 30% of the husband's wealth at marriage, as well as 50% of any increase to it during the marriage. The husband claimed for the first agreement to be upheld. The Deputy Deemster considered the case at first instance and largely came down on the side of the husband, citing Edgar v Edgar for his decision. A relevant passage from that case reads: > \\"Men and women of full age education and understanding, acting with > competent advice available to them, must be assumed to know and appreciate > what they are doing and their actual respective bargaining strengths will in > fact depend in every case upon a subjective evaluation of their motives for > doing it.\\"Edgar v Edgar [1980] EWCA Civ 2, per Oliver LJ The Deemster did, however, find that the wife was entitled to ¬£2,525,000 to purchase a suitable home for her and the children. Both parties appealed: the wife repeated her claim for the 'full' amount, and the husband repeated his that she should be held to the terms of the original agreement. The Staff of Government Division rejected both parties' appeals. The husband then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The sole issue was to determine whether the housing needs of the wife should be accommodated by a lump sum (as ordered by the judge) or under the terms of a trust (as argued by the husband under the original agreement). Legal background In delivering her judgment on behalf of the whole court, Baroness Hale of Richmond began with the old common law principle that a husband and wife had a duty to live together, and that agreements to live apart were void on grounds of public policy. Over time, courts began to enforce such agreements as the influence of the Ecclesiastical Court waned. By 1929, the courts considered separation agreements to be contracts like any other. > \\"Agreements for separation are formed, construed and dissolved and to be > enforced on precisely the same principles as any respectable commercial > agreements, of whose nature indeed they sometimes partake. As in other > contracts stipulations will not be enforced which are illegal either as > being opposed to positive law or public policy. But this is a common > attribute of all contracts, though we may recognize that the subject-matter > of separation agreements may bring them more than others into relation with > questions of public policy.\\"Hyman v Hyman [1929] AC 601, per Lord Atkin In that case, the court held that a spouse cannot surrender their right to claim for ancillary relief in court in some out-of-court settlement, the continuing maintenance of a divorced spouse being a matter of public concern. The Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce considered the issue between 1951 and 1955. It recommended that a wife be bound by her promise not to apply for relief unless a material change in circumstances takes place.Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce 1951 ‚Äì 1955, Report, 1956, Cmd 9678, at pp 192 ‚Äì 195 Through the Matrimonial Property and Proceedings Act 1970 and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, Parliament essentially upheld the decision in Hyman v Hyman, held that the agreement of a spouse not to apply for relief can amount to consideration to a separation contract, and provided the court with a power of variation. The equivalent Manx statute is the Matrimonial Proceedings Act 2003. Her Ladyship then turned to Edgar v Edgar, which considered the validity of a separation agreement made once the marriage had already broken down. In that case, Ormrod LJ held, > \\"It is not necessary in this connection to think in formal legal terms, such > as misrepresentation or estoppel; all the circumstances as they affect each > of two human beings must be considered in the complex relationship of > marriage. So, the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement are > relevant.\\"Edgar v Edgar [1980] EWCA Civ 2, per Ormord LJ These circumstances, listed in part in that judgment, have come to be used in all court-sanctioned compromises to ancillary relief proceedings,Xydhias v Xydhias [1999] 2 All ER 386 including postnuptial agreements.NA v MA [2006] EWHC 2900 (Fam) At the time of the Macleod judgment, Radmacher v Granatino was yet to be decided, and so prenuptial agreements were treated as less binding on courts than at the time of writing. Counsel for the husband relied on the obiter words of Hoffman LJ in Pounds v Pounds: > \\"The agreement may be held to be binding, but whether it will be can be > determined only after litigation and may involve, as in this case, examining > the quality of the advice which was given to the party who wishes to resile. > It is then understandably a matter for surprise and resentment on the part > of the other party that one should be able to repudiate an agreement on > account of the inadequacy of one‚Äôs own legal advisers, over whom the other > party had no control and of whose advice he had no knowledge.\\"Pounds v > Pounds [1994] 1 WLR 1535, 1550-1551, per Hoffman LJ He argued that all separation agreements should be binding, whether they are made before a marriage, after it, or once the marriage has already deteriorated. He argued that the case for recognising prenuptial agreements has strengthened since it has come to be accepted that both parties to a marriage are to be treated equally. Judgment Baroness Hale, who delivered the judgment on behalf of the whole court, would go on to deliver a dissenting judgment on prenuptial agreements in Radmacher v Granatino two years later. Lady Hale held that equality in marriage does not necessarily make the case for enforceable prenuptial agreements on the basis that it is far fairer for both parties to determine what is fair in the event of their separation than for them to guess at what might be fair in advance. She also found that there was no evidence to suggest that a lack of enforceable prenuptial agreements depresses the rates of marriage in countries compared to those which allow them. She noted that the enforceability of prenuptial agreements was more appropriate for Parliament to make provision for than the courts. She distinguished prenuptial agreements from postnuptial agreements, however. Once the parties are already married, the postnuptial agreement is no longer in exchange for one party's willingness to marry. The only remaining public policy ground on which a postnuptial agreement might have been void was that it would induce the parties no longer to live together, a rule of common law which no longer applies.H v W [1857] 3 K & J 382 On this basis, postnuptial agreements can be considered valid subject to the following considerations: * The parties intended to be bound legally by their arrangement;Balfour v Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571 * There were no circumstances which would render void any other contract, such as undue influence or fraud;Edgar v Edgar [1980] EWCA Civ 2 * There had been no substantial change in circumstances between the making of the postnuptial agreement and the parties coming to court which would make the terms of agreement 'manifestly unjust';Macleod v Macleod [2008] UKPC 64, [41] and * The agreement did not fail to provide for a dependent child. To conclude, she held, > \\"We must assume that each party to a properly negotiated agreement is a > grown up and able to look after him- or herself. At the same time we must be > alive to the risk of unfair exploitation of superior strength. But the mere > fact that the agreement is not what a court would have done cannot be enough > to have it set aside.\\"Macleod v Macleod [2008] UKPC 64, [42] See also * Postnuptial agreement * Prenuptial agreement * Judicial Committee of the Privy Council * Judiciary of the Isle of Man References 2008 in case law ","title":"Macleod v Macleod"},{"id":"51122228","text":"Carlos Alberto Preciado Ben√≠tez (born 30 March 1985) is a Colombian professional soccer player who currently plays as a forward for FC Carlos Stein.

Biography  Allicocke's origins are uncertain. Some records say that he was the son of an Antiguan, likely Captain Syer Allicocke, though in later life he himself claimed to hail from Ireland. Most interesting is the record of Capt. John Montresor who, in his journals from the 1760s, noted Allicocke to be 'son of a mulatto woman'. It remains unclear whether this was an unfounded rumor being repeated by Montresor, his own spurious assumption - perhaps based on Allicocke's Antiguan origins - or in fact true and simple common knowledge no one else felt worth writing down. Likely being born in Antigua, he was sent from there to Philadelphia for schooling, and certainly, he was living and working in New York City as a clerk and merchant by the early 1760s, where he became involved with the New York Liberty Boys in 1765, and quickly rose to a leadership position alongside John Lamb and Isaac Sears. There, he participated in negotiations with the New Haven Sons of Liberty. With the success of the protests and the overturning of the Stamp Act in 1766, Allicocke was honored with a 21 gun salute and the honorific titling of \\"general of the Sons of Liberty.\\" In 1774, he accepted the position of Secretary for the New York Committee of Correspondence, but voluntarily resigned from the position soon after. He continued to do business with British military agents through 1775 which caused charges to be brought against him. Although acquitted, the Congress finding that \\"[h]e had supplied such Provisions inadvertently, and without any design to injure the Country\\", he nevertheless was briefly forced to flee the city to Antigua in early 1776. A year later however, he had returned to now British occupied New York City where he served as with the Chamber of Commerce and as Secretary of the United Whaling Co., and identified as a Loyalist. The reasons for Allicocke's Loyalist allegiance remain shrouded. Donald A. Grinde, Jr., in his work on Allicocke, believed Montresor's description of partial African ancestry to be genuine, and thus sees the possibility that Allicocke's choice was in part driven by racial views, and the belief that the British offered a better future for him as a black man. J.S. Tiedmann, however, more cautious about accepting Montresor's claim as fact, points to Allicocke's increasing social standing through the 1760s, and connections with the powerful De Lancey family which may have helped distance him from the politics of his Liberty Boy days. Regardless of the true cause, by the time of the British evacuation of New York City on November 25, 1783, Allicocke had left the city. = Later years = Following his flight from the newly created United States, Allicocke headed for England, setting himself up as a wine merchant in London by 1785.USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2013.

Her sister Catherine had previously married John Lamb, later one of Allicocke's co-leaders in the Sons of Liberty, in 1755. They had a large family of ten children, which Allicocke would describe as \\"expensive\\". His son Charles John served as a lieutenant of cavalry with the South Carolina Royalists during the war.

It appears in comic book form published by So What? Press and as a serialized newspaper strip in the Park Slope Reader. The series revolves around a young woman named Nora, her roommate Charlie, and their co- worker Serena, who live in Brooklyn and get caught up in an onslaught of supernatural occurrences around New York City. It began in 2011. The series features the work of several artists, including Eisner Award-winners Molly Ostertag and Simon Fraser and Emmy Award-winner Dean Haspiel and has received multiple Ringo Award nominations: Best Single Issue or Story for \\"The Steam Banshee\\" in 2020; Best Cover Artist for Simon Fraser's work on the series in 2018; and a win for Best Anthology for Mine!, in which a short story from the series appeared, also in 2018. The main characters work at Think Coffee's Union Square, Manhattan location and live in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg, both of which are prominent fixtures. Publication history =The \\"Gothic Logo\\" Era (2011-2019)= The so-called \\"gothic logo\\" era is made up of eight numbered issues and four one-shots which include several storylines. It follows the life of Nora Cashin, professional barista and amateur writer, and her roommate, Charlie Maxwell, who happens to be possessed, in the nicest way possible, by a spectral detective who calls himself the Night Watchman. Their co-worker, Serena Filby, is a casual grifter who lives in a tent on a Brooklyn rooftop. In the first issue, she gets caught stealing a man's wallet by the Night Watchman. As a form of punishment, he forces her to get a job at the coffee shop. Serena's trouble-making tendencies are the impetus for many of the stories. The Long Fall The first story arc of the main series was called \\"The Long Fall\\" and ran in Issues One-Six. It was written by Dave Kelly and illustrated by Lara Antal unless otherwise noted. It centers around the redevelopment of the Williamsburg waterfront by a corrupt city councilman named Dan Deane. His plan was to build a high rise apartment building, banked on a scheme to offer low-rent housing to area residents. He came into possession of something called \\"the fragment\\", thanks to an arcane witch named Mama Shadow, which promised to give him greater political advantage. However, it also unleashed a far greater evil into the world that tied directly to the Night Watchman's past. Things come to a head the night a hurricane made landfall on the city (called Hurricane Idra in the story, it was inspired by Kelly & Antal's experiences during Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy). Staycation \\"Staycation\\" is an eight-page prologue one-shot that involves Nora and her friend Trish taking a trip to the beach. Over s'mores and an open fire, Trish reveals that she brought some ecstasy for them to take. Nora is upset that she brought an illegal substance with them in the car and chides Trish. This fractures their relationship and keeps Trish from telling Nora about her affair with Dan Deane, which ultimately gets her killed. The Dwellers of Big Bogie Issues Four and Five featured a backup story entitled \\"The Dwellers of Big Bogie.\\" One night, Serena is coming home from the grocery store and is mugged by a subway-dwelling girl. She tells Nora about this who, shortly thereafter, encounters the same girl. Chasing her into the tunnels below Brooklyn, she is captured by the dwellers, an underground race of mutated youths, and prepped for sacrifice to their ruler, Big Bogie. However, Nora is not one to go down easily and defeats the giant creature with the help of renegades within the group. Both parts were illustrated by Amanda Scurti. The Poison Garden & Coda Issues Five and Six featured backup stories drawn by Victoria Lau: \\"The Poison Garden\\" and \\"Coda.\\" \\"The Poison Garden\\" is a slice of life story that shows the tragic events leading up to Jenny and Trish's deaths at the hands of Jack the Gripper, the killer in \\"The Long Fall\\". \\"Coda\\" is more supernatural in nature, concerning Nora's trauma from Trish's death. She sees Trish in several visions, which may have been the result of exposure to a mysterious chemical in \\"The Dwellers of Big Bogie,\\" but allows her to find some form of closure when Charlie and she discover an abandoned nightclub that Trish frequented with Dan Deane. \\"Coda\\" was lettered by DC Hopkins. =The Monster Movie Trilogy and Sequels (2013-2019)= There were three one-shots published during the \\"Gothic Logo\\" era that tell stories outside of \\"The Long Fall\\" story arc. They take place in various parts of the city and are also homages to some of Dave Kelly's favorite golden age horror films. They all take place between Issues Two and Three of the main series with the exception of the two sequels, which were numbered in sequence with the main series. The Mad Mind of Anton Sebaum After Nora discovers that counterfeit twenty-dollar bills are passing through the coffee shop's register, she makes Charlie and Serena check every single one used in transactions. Serena finds one and confronts the customer trying to spend it, who flees. She chases after him and is captured by the minions of a decades- old counterfeiting operation in Chinatown. The Night Watchman infiltrates their warehouse in an effort to have save her but not before he confronts their leader, Anton Sebaum. This issue was illustrated by Jude Vigants (credited as \\"J. Vigants\\"). It Came from the Gowanus Canal & It Came from the Gowanus Canal...Again! Serena fills up the coffee shop's office computer with articles about urban legends around the city. In particular, the Gowanus Golem, a toxic sludge monster that takes revenge on those who have slighted it. The creature has resurfaced after an extended dormancy and is quite real, especially to the Night Watchman. The story is set in Brooklyn's infamous Gowanus Canal, a real-life EPA superfund site. It was illustrated by Molly Ostertag. In 2017, the Gowanus Golem returned. In this follow up to one of the series' most popular tales, Brooklyn's most toxic monster is after a couple of thugs responsible for the death of a young boy. There's only one problem: To stop him, the Night Watchman must protect one of the killers. This story is also a Christmas special and involves a subplot with Serena and a Christmas tree that Charlie brings into the apartment. It was illustrated by Brett Hobson, colored by Clare DeZutti, with a cover by industry veteran Tim Hamilton. It was numbered \\"Issue Seven\\" in sequence with \\"The Long Fall\\" issues. The Night Collector & Sanctuary After a young woman is mysteriously killed, the Night Watchman learns that a coven of vampires has taken over the bat exhibit at the Bronx Zoo, and they may have a sympathizer in the form of an odd zookeeper fascinated by bats. \\"The Night Collector\\" was illustrated by Molly Ostertag. The sequel, \\"Sanctuary\\" tells the story of what happens to the lady vampires after Silverback is killed. They flee the Bronx and take shelter in a dark sky sanctuary in Upstate New York. But all is not well. They banish Carissa for arguing that Scooter is the rightful successor to their leader, that the legacy of leadership should remain with a male Night Collector. The other vampires disagree, and it leads to a divisive showdown after their fellow clanswoman, Valeria, befriends a group of mysterious sisters who also live in the forest. It was numbered \\"Issue Seven\\" in sequence with \\"The Long Fall\\" issues and was written by Alyssa Varner, drawn by Victoria Lau, colored by Vicky Leta, with a cover by Robin Ha. =The \\"Giallo-Pulp Logo\\" Era (2019-Present)= The Final Kill & The Untold Legend of Luna In April 2019, So What? Press became an imprint of fellow Brooklyn publisher It's Alive!, until that time known mostly for its reprints of Silver Age war comics. Under this arrangement, It's Alive! began to distribute Tales of the Night Watchman through Diamond Comic Distributors from Fall 2019 onward beginning with the two-part mini-series \\"The Final Kill\\" and a one-shot crossover with Dean Haspiel's WEBTOON / Image Comics property, The Red Hook, entitled \\"The Untold Legend of Luna.\\" The art team on all three issues was Brett Hobson (artist), Sonia Liao (colorist), and DC Hopkins (letterer), with covers by Tim Hamilton, Emily Pearson, Simon Fraser, and Haspiel. A notable change to these books was a revamped logo, an homage to both American pulp fiction and Italian gialli. \\"The Final Kill\\" was written by Kelly while the crossover was co-written with Haspiel. It was also announced that former Marvel Comics editor Rachel Pinnelas would join the series. =Park Slope Reader (2018-Present)= The Ghost Train A comic strip version of the series has run in local Brooklyn newspaper the Park Slope Reader since 2018. The first serial, \\"The Ghost Train\\", was about the elevated train involved in the infamous Malbone Street Wreck returning to terrorize the city on the centenary of its accident. The story debuted in the paper's Spring 2018 edition, number 64. It was written by Dave Kelly, drawn by Simon Fraser, and colored by Gary Caldwell, Fraser's frequent collaborator. The artist and colorist began work as soon as they wrapped up Mark Millar's Kingsman comic book sequel, \\"The Red Circle\\", for Image Comics. The Steam Banshee In the Summer of 2019, the second serial began, entitled \\"The Steam Banshee\\", about something sinister lurking in the steam heat system in a Park Slope apartment building. It was drawn by series regular Brett Hobson, colored by Clare DeZutti, lettered by DC Hopkins, and co-written by Dave Kelly & Katrina Lord, a friend of Kelly's whom he often refers to as his \\"bestie.\\" The Big Howl Over Bushwick The third serial, \\"The Big Howl Over Bushwick\\", saw its first chapter released in the Spring 2020 issue. As with \\"The Steam Banshee\\", it was drawn by Brett Hobson, colored by Clare DeZutti, and lettered by DC Hopkins, but written solely by Dave Kelly. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the newspaper went on hiatus with plans to return in the fall. =Other publications= A Comic Guide to Brewing Published in 2012, A Comic Guide to Brewing is a non-Tales of the Night Watchman book by Lara Antal wherein Nora appears as the narrator. The book is an instruction manual on how to get a better cup of coffee either at home or at your favorite caf√©. It was inspired by Antal's time as a barista. As of 2019, it remains So What? Press' best-selling book. It was nominated for Best Publication Design at the 2013 Stumptown Comic Arts Awards at the now-defunct Stumptowm Comics Festival in Portland, OR. It lost to Grandville (comics) by Bryan Talbot. It was also nominated for the S.P.A.C.E. Prize for Mini Comic / Short Story at the 2013 Small Press and Alternative Comics Expo in Columbus, OH. Mine! In 2017, Dave Kelly and Lara Antal contributed a six-page origin story for Serena to ComicMix's Mine! anthology to benefit Planned Parenthood. Other contributors to the book include Neil Gaiman and Mystery Science Theater 3000 star Frank Conniff. In 2018, Mine! received an Eisner Award nomination in the best short story category for ‚ÄúEthel Byrne‚Äù by Cecil Castellucci and Scott Chantler, but lost to \\"A Life in Comics: The Graphic Adventures of Karen Green\\" by Nick Sousanis at that year's San Diego Comic-Con. However, that same year, the book was nominated for best anthology by the Ringo Awards, presented at Baltimore Comic-Con, and won, making Kelly and Antal de facto winners of the award for their contribution. Between the Covers In 2018, Dave Kelly and New York Times bestselling cartoonist Robin Ha contributed a four-page story to Between the Covers: A Bookstore Erotica Anthology, published by Chicago's Volumes Bookcaf√© as a fundraiser to keep the store open. It features a sexual encounter between Nora and an attractive male customer. It was the only comic contributed to a book that otherwise focused on erotic poetry and prose. The book was co-edited and arranged by Rebecca Makkai. Main characters =Protagonists= *Nora CashinNora is an aspiring writer, but her real job is managing a coffee shop. Charlie and Serena are her employees. She desires to do something bigger in the world but finds herself stymied by her day job. That said, she often accompanies the Night Watchman on his missions and has proven herself able to fight evil alone, as seen in \\"The Dwellers of Big Bogie\\". *Charlie Maxwell/The Night WatchmanCharlie's real identity is unknown. He showed up one night in Nora's apartment and what happened thereafter is a mystery. What is known is that he was allowed to stay in her guestroom and work at the coffee shop. He is also the Night Watchman, a spectral detective from the 1940s who has been thrust into the present for reasons not yet fully understood. He has taken it upon himself to police the city's supernatural happenings. He took both his secret identity and his nom de guerre from an old movie serial he likes to watch, coincidentally titled Tales of the Night Watchman. *Serena FilbySerena is a mischievous street urchin who lives in a tent on a Brooklyn rooftop. She has a penchant for thievery and hucksterism but has also found herself at home working the straight life at the coffee shop. The Night Watchman keeps an eye on her, much to her chagrin. He will show up on her rooftop to hang out, usually after work, when she would rather be eating dinner or watching T.V. (via binoculars aimed at her neighbors' windows). =Antagonists= *Dan Deane/Jack the GripperA power-mad politician and the villain of \\"The Long Fall\\" story arc. He is given a mysterious crystal referred to only as \\"the fragment\\" by Mama Shadow. Purportedly a good luck charm that bequeaths absolute political power to its holder, it in turn drives him mad and transforms him into Jack the Gripper, a hideous monster responsible for the murders of several wayward young women in Brooklyn, including Nora's friend Trish and Trish's friend, Jenny. Merrick, a being from the Night Watchman's past, is ultimately responsible for the possession. *MerrickA demigod who was responsible for Night Watchman's death in his past life and plays an ominous role in his current life, appearing in dreams and otherworldly encounters. *Mama ShadowA Chilean witch who plays a key role in manipulating Dan Deane and bringing Merrick back the night of Hurricane Idra. Her relationship to Merrick is clandestine. *The Gowanus GolemA toxic sludge monster made up of the souls of people who either died in the canal or whose bodies were disposed there. *Anton SebaumA mad scientist who ran an underground counterfeiting operation in Chinatown. His headquarters is somewhere near the Queens/Nassau County border in an abandoned aquarium. While he posed as a human during his first encounter with the Night Watchman, his primary form is that of a giant brain. Reception =Critical response= The series has received favorable reviews over the years. Indie comics reviewer Rob Clough praised the series for its \\"sincerity and belief in [its] characters\\", calling it \\"solid and well-told comics.\\" Alex Widen at Bam! Smack! Pow! called it a \\"simple, yet effective, modern day pulp tale\\", noting: \\"It mixes mystery, horror, and comedy in a totally unique way. It's a series that wears its Brooklyn pride on its sleeve, and there is an inherent genuineness to the trio of characters and their exploits.‚Äù It has also been lauded for its social themes. Jorge Solis of Villain Media noted, \\"[The series] captures New York with such diversity...[Kelly's] social commentary strikes as the Night Watchman protects the helpless middle class and the unwanted underdogs.\\" Jenna Hale at GeeksOUT pointed out, ‚ÄúThe problems the characters face, aside from the supernatural, are the same ones most people face in their daily lives‚Äîresponsibility, loneliness, low income, unfulfilled goals, and the growing disconnect from friends and family as our busy lives consume us.‚Äù Andrea Ayres at Comics Beat noted that the series was \\"about being human and overcoming horrors and hardships, be they personal or paranormal\\" and that \\"the small moments shared between the characters are where the series really shines.\\" The series has also been featured in Rue Morgue (magazine) and the book Blood in Four Colours: A Graphic History of Horror Comics by Pedro Cabezuelo. =Accolades= 2020 Ringo Awards Best Single Issue or Story - \\"The Steam Banshee\\" 2018 Ringo Awards Simon Faser - Best Cover Artist (nominated) Mine! - Best Anthology (winner) References External links *So What?

He worked both as an algebraist and a number theorist and later worked as cryptanalyst at Pers Z S, the German Foreign Office cipher bureau, during World War II. He was latterly known as the person who broke the American diplomatic O-2 cypher, a variant of the M-138-A strip cipher during 1943. Rohrbach wrote a report on the breaking of the strip cypher when he was captured by TICOM, the allied effort to roundup and seize captured German intelligence people and material. Personal life Hans Rohrbach was a son of journalist Paul Rohrbach and his wife Clara (n√©e M√ºller), who were married in Berlin in 1897. There was always confusion around Rohrbachs' name; one source gives his full name as Hans Joachim Albert Rohrbach, while the mathematician Bernhard Neumann believed this full name to be Hans Wolfgang Rohrbach, and was sure his middle initial was a 'W'. Rohrbach entered the Gymnasium (school) at Berlin-Friedenau in the Autumn of 1909 and studied there until Autumn 1917. He then entered the Fichte Gymnasium in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. After having successfully passed the school leaving exam in 1921, he entered the Friedrich- Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy for two years. In 1923, as a head of the Berlin student organization Mathematisch-Physikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft (Mathematics and Physics Working Group), he went with his father to the United States. The visit, which Rohrbach called his propaganda visit, was a tour of American universities to raise money for impoverished Berlin students. Germany's economy, which was undergoing a period of hyperinflation, was making life extremely difficult for students, who had to take employment to supplement their income. In the autumn of 1924 Rohrbach resumed his studies at the University of Berlin and studied there until 1929. In the late 1920s he started work on his PhD thesis, titled Die Charaktere der bin√§ren Kongruenzgruppen mod p2 (The characters of the binary congruence groups mod p2), advised by Issai Schur. He submitted it and was awarded his doctorate on 25 July 1932. While studying at Berlin University, Rohrbach met fellow student Rose Gadebusch (born 1905), who studied mathematics starting in 1925. Gadebusch took a major role in the Mathematisch-Physikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft. After graduation she took a position at the Women's Gymnasium. Rohrbach married her sometime around 1932. In 1936, Rohrbach was appointed senior assistant at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1937, he undertook his habilitation there with a paper titled Ein Beitrag zur additiven Zahlentheorie nebst einer Anwendung auf eine Gruppentheoretische Frage (English: A contribution to additive number theory together with an application on a group theoretical question). On 1 April 1938 he was appointed as a senior assistant at the Mathematical Institute of the German University of Prague. In 1941 he was promoted to extraordinary professor and in 1942 he became an ordinary professor. He also served as Director of the Mathematical Institute there. Rohrbach was a member of the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (the party's original paramilitary wing, later superseded by the SS), but was considered not fully reliable due to his friendship with Jewish colleagues. After the war ended, Rohrbach was not allowed to teach for a number of reasons. However, he held an appointment as Visiting Professor in the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Science at the University of Mainz, 1946‚Äì1951. From 1951 to 1957 he was Extraordinary Professor in the Faculty of Science at Mainz, and was later dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1954‚Äì1958. He was then Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics between 1957 and 1969. While undertaking all these roles, he was appointed Director of the Department of Mathematics at Mainz, a position he held from 1958 until 1970. Between 24 November 1966 and 1967 he was Rector of the University of Mainz. Between July 1967 ‚Äì 1977, he was a director of advisory center for student life issues at the University of Mainz. He was also an editor of Crelle's Journal, 1952‚Äì1977, assisting Helmut Hasse. He held this chair until he retired as professor emeritus in 1977. Work Hans Rohrbachs time was split between work with an academic focus, and work involving the military. During his time of doctorate in the very early 1930s, he published several solutions to mathematical problems that were set by the Jahresbericht (Annual Report) of the German Mathematical Society. In 1931, he published a solution to Problem 66, in 1932 a solution followed to Problem 84 and Problem 89 was also solved in 1932. In 1937, Rohrbach introduced a mathematical puzzle, which was a variation of James Joseph Sylvester's stamp puzzle: :I have a large number of stamps to the value of 5d and 17d only. What is the largest denomination which I cannot make up with a combination of these two different values. In 1937, he formulated in his paper Ein Beitrag zur additiven Zahlentheorie (A contribution to the additive number theory) a related problem, which he considered much more difficult: :An envelope may carry no more than h stamps, and one has available k integer-valued stamp denominations. Given h and k, find the maximal integer n = n(h, k) such that all integer postage values from 1 to n can be made up. In addition, find all sets of k stamp denominations satisfying this condition. The problem statement is usually modified by augmenting the solution sets with a stamp of value zero, and requiring that a letter carry exactly h stamps. Here are some examples from Mactutor, which have been copied verbatim to ensure mathematical accuracy: :*n(2, 3) = 8 with the unique solution set {0, 1, 3, 4}. :*n(2, 6) = 20 with five solution sets {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10}, {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11}, {0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, 16}, {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14}, and {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}. :*n(3, 4) = 24 with one solution set being {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}. Within the paper, Rohrbach find asymptotic bounds for n with h fixed and k large. This is a problem many mathematicians have looked at but have not been solved yet. It was while Rohrbach was at the Mathematical Institute of the German University of Prague, starting in 1933 as a senior assistant. In 1944, he wrote a report, of which this is an exert: :I am taking the move of the Mathematical Institute into the recently completed new rooms as an opportunity to give a short report on the development of the Institute in the last year. Up to the end of 1943 no research work was carried out in the Institute. The two established professors had been assigned to war work but, in addition, continued to carry out their teaching duties. The assistant had been drafted into the army, and no additional mathematicians were available. However, since I arrived here, I have made efforts to have the Institute itself to be involved in war related research. To achieve this I required more space and more collaborators. Once my requests to enlarge the Institute were granted in a satisfactory way by the curator, the work of setting up began a year ago. The work undertaken by Rohrbach was related to the computational problems associated with the manufacture and flight of V-weapons. The research and prototyping experimental work was undertaken at the village of Peenem√ºnde. The scientists detailed in Rohrbach report above were Dr Gerhard Gentzen, Dr Franz Krammer and Dr Paul Armsen. The other major area that Hans Rohrbach contributed to the German war effort was as working as Cryptanalyst (Cryptography) in the Mathematical and Cryptological Section of the special section of unit Z (The cryptanalysts) in the Reich Foreign Office () (Pers Z S). He was awarded the War Service Cross 2nd Class (KVK II) in September 1944, for his work on the solution of the U.S. Diplomatic Strip System O-2. Rohrbach had originally broken the cipher in 1943 after working on it for more than a year. The cipher was used by the US state department for diplomatic traffic, and the US Navy from 1940 to 1944. Rohrbach and his team used Hollerith punched card machinery and also built a special decoding machine called Automaton to aid cryptanalysis of the cipher. The Americans who made up the TICOM Team that investigated Pers Z S, ordered Rohrbach to write a report on 6 August 1945, in the form of homework to describe the process. The report was formulated as TICOM document I-89.Ticom I-89 This is the introduction to the report: :In this report we are dealing with a field of applied mathematics which has been foreign to most mathematicians and on which practically nothing has been published up to now. Methods and results have generally been left in secrecy, existing largely in the minds of the people involved. For these reasons we must go into the basic concepts and principles of this field rather thoroughly. Further, we cannot expect this report, as a first approach, to be exhaustive. The written materials needed for a foundation, including in particular the only publication to my knowledge of the character of a scientific journal (Scientific papers of the Dahlem Special Service, published by the Foreign Office, Berlin, 1940‚Äì45), either have been destroyed or have been retained by the Allies; the workers concerned are known to me only in small part or cannot be contacted. Accordingly, I can bring only scattered examples to the best of my memory. They come largely from the work of the Foreign Office, the Department of Defense (OKW), and the Department of the Army (OKH). By agreement with those workers that I have been able to contact, I will not give any names ‚Äì it's a chance selection at best. Naturally much more work in this field has been done in Germany than I am able to take into consideration here, for the reasons already given. It seems to me at least, as will be brought out sufficiently in the material that follows, that mathematical cryptology is a very attractive field of applied mathematics. With good reason have all larger nations selected mathematicians for special use, particularly for use in cryptanalysis. Here is how Hans Rohrbach split his work between academia and the military: :I had concluded my activity there [Prague] for the winter semester 1944‚Äì45 [at the end of February] and was in Berlin, where during the war I was busy full time at the Foreign Office. I looked after the work in Prague for only two days in the week during the semester, traveling there at night in a sleeper coach, two night later back in a sleeper coach, thus working four days a week in Berlin, two days in Prague. During the vacations I was busy only in Berlin. I intended to return to Prague for the summer semester 1945 [at the end of April]. I had as always left everything personal behind in the Institute, in particular books, lecture manuscripts, etc. But at the beginning of April 1945 I was already in the store of the Foreign Office in Thuringia. Missionary concerns While working at the Mathematical Institute Rohrbach managed to have several mathematicians join his group in Prague, to undertake and assist in war work. Friedrich Bauer wrote about Hans RohrbachE Menzler-Trott, Logic‚Äôs lost genius: The life of Gerhard Gentzen (Amer. Math. Soc and London Math. Soc, Providence, RI, 2007). :I do not know what Rohrbach's group in Prague calculated. ... In my estimation of Rohrbach's character, the activity of the computing group could have been a [facade] for the rescue of human lives. ... I have treasured Rohrbach's human traits greatly, even if his missionary concerns got on my nerves One of the people that Rohrbach saved was the mathematician Ernst Max Mohr from execution. On 12 May 1944 Mohr was arrested by the Gestapo along with his wife, at the B√©ranek Hotel in Prague. On 24 October 1944, his case was heard before the People's Court, the accusation was to listen to enemy foes, to denigrate Hitler and for expressing defeatism. He is said to have described the war as already lost, the destruction of the Jews as a mistake. His work was important for the war, especially the Luftwaffe. He was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death, but intervention by Rohrbach and Alexander Nikuradse resulted in his death sentence being suspended for six months; he was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, later on 18 December 1944 to the Pl√∂tzensee Prison where he continued to undertake Mathematical calculations for the V-weapon programs. He survived the war. Rohrbach's assistants Franz Krammer and Paul Armsen were also rescued by Rohrbach. Krammer had been rescued in May 1944 in, he wrote, :for me a wonderful action [by Rohrbach], from the disintegrating eastern front. Armsen was appointed by Rohrbach first as his assistant, later as a special lecturer. =After the War= Rohrback's grave site in the city of Mainz Rohrbach and his wife became missionary Christians after the war. Rohrbach became president of the Studentenmission in Deutschland an organization setup to spread Christian values in schools and universities. He published a number of books which espoused his Christian values. These included: * Science, world view, faith (German:Naturwissenschaft, Weltbild, Glaube) (1967) * Live with the Invisible: Invisible Powers and the Power of Jesus (German:Mit dem Unsichtbaren leben: Unsichtbare M√§chte und die Macht Jesu) (1976) * Invisible Powers and the Power of Jesus: For Pastoral Care of Weary People (German:Unsichtbare M√§chte und die Macht Jesu: Zur Seelsorge an belasteten Menschen) (1985) * The offensive creed: a natural scientist for the Christian creed (German:Das anst√∂ssige Glaubensbekenntnis: Ein Naturwissenschaftler zum christlichen Glaubensbekenntnis) (1987) * The fascination of the supernatural (German:Die Faszination des √úbersinnlichen) (1988) * Creation - myth or truth?

Education Kate Wallach was a Jewish woman born to Ludwig Wallach and Berta Wallach (n√©e Sch√∂nbeck) on May 17, 1905 in Krefeld, Germany. Her father was a partner in a silk wholesale firm, but lost his position following the rise of the Nazis. Wallach attended a girls' high school in Krefeld, and attended a Lyzeum in Dahlem after moving to Berlin. Unsatisfied with the level of education, she then continued to attend classes established by Helene Lange. She passed her Abitur (a final examination taken at the conclusion of secondary education) in September 1924. Wallach studied law at Berlin, Freiburg, W√ºrzberg, and Bonn Universities and passed her First State Examination in January 1930 at Cologne University. She then passed her Second State Examination in 1933, but was not allowed to work as a lawyer or assessor following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, twhichhat targeted Jews in civil service. In 1938, Wallach enrolled at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she graduated with an LL.B in just two years. She was also admitted to the Order of the Coif, was an honorary editor of the Wisconsin Law Review, and was in the Kappa Beta Phi sorority. In 1942 Wallach received a B.A. In library science. She passed the bar exam in 1942 and was admitted at court. Career In 1935, Wallach obtained a temporary visa to emigrate to the United States, and worked as a secretary and taught German. After being rejected from studying law, she worked without pay for a patent lawyer to learn about the American legal system. She moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1937 to work as a secretary for Harry Shulman at Yale University. After completing law school, Wallach worked as a cataloger at the law library at the University of Michigan. She became a US citizen in 1942. She worked as a lawyer in Washington D.C. with the Office of Price Administration and then the National Labor Relations Board. She was also a member of the Wisconsin State Bar Association. After World War II, Wallach was an advisor on international legal aspects of war crimes. In 1947, she returned to librarianship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1949 Wallach moved to Baton Rouge to be an assistant professor for the Louisiana State University law school. Also a member of the library at the law school, she increased the number of books from 75,000 to 205,464 by her retirement. She also conducted academic research, and published Bibliographical History of Louisiana Civil Law Sources, her most important work, in 1955, along with Research in Louisiana Law in 1958, and Union List of Basic Latin American Legal Materials in 1971. She became a chair of the library in 1964, and received a JD in 1966. She resigned from administrative work with the library in 1970. Wallach was a member of the Soroptimists, and became director in 1951 and president in 1954. Personal life Wallach's younger brother Ernst came to the US in 1937. In the process of getting their parents out of Germany, they lost their father in 1941 to a heart attack, their grandmother in 1942 after she was sent to Theresienstadt, and their mother in 1944, who was sent to Auschwitz.

After 1960, he filled the position of first mayor (also honorary). He gained a good reputation with the town residents because he succeeded in preventing the town's incorporation. He was also a deputy in the Miltenberg council.  Prosecution  On 7 March 1956, Heinrichsohn was sentenced to death by a French court in absentia. A formal prosecution (and conviction) by the Allies prevented any like proceedings in the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1976, an initiative of the French historian and Holocaust survivor Serge Klarsfeld made public his involvement in the Holocaust. Heinrichsohn responded with a sworn statement to the council, stating that he was not the Gestapo agent known as \\"Heinrichson\\". This affidavit was accepted not only in the community but also by the board of the CSU, whose Secretary General Edmund Stoiber did not want to interfere or prejudice a pending investigation.

Heinrichsohn organized the railway transports of Jews from the Drancy internment camp: French lawyers detained in Drancy, 1941 In 1979, Heinrichsohn along with Lischka and Herbert Hagen was indicted for \\"having knowingly aided the intentional, unlawful, cruel, insidious, and basely motivated killing of human beings\\".Bill of indictment, quoted in Bernhard Brunner: Der Frankreich-Komplex, p. 339. The indictment was partially based on an assessment authored by Wolfgang Scheffler. Heinz R√∂thke had already died in 1965 without ever having been apprehended, although he also had been sentenced to death in France. On behalf of the plaintiffs, Serge Klarsfeld had put together a collection of documents from those found in Paris Gestapo files, which among other things showed Heinrichsohn's involvement in the deportation of Greek Jews and of Jewish children.Serge Klarsfeld, Vichy ‚Äì Auschwitz, S. 212. Heinrichsohn's lawyer Richard HuthRichard Huth bei Singelmann und Bach had stated in court that Klarsfeld (who was a Jew of Romanian birth) had no agency to represent French Jews. Heinrichsohn had declared in court that he fely no sense of guilt because he had only been apprised of the Jews' murder after the war had ended, and that he merely selected Jews for work assignments. However, Heinrichsohn was identified by witnesses; it was demonstrated that he had had small children and the sick deported. The historian and Holocaust survivor was able to relate particulars about Heinrichsohn by quoting from a document describing the conditions in Drancy during Heinrichsohn's tenure, which he had already penned in 1946.Bernhard Brunner: Der Frankreich-Komplex, p. 346. On 11 February 11 1980, the Circuit Court of Cologne sentenced Heinrichsohn to six years in prison, Lischka to ten, and Hagen to twelve years. The residents of B√ºrgstadt had rallied around their mayor during the trial, and took up a collection to provide 200 DM in bail to allow him to move freely during the appeal.Die B√ºrgschaft in: Die Zeit, 7. However, he was arrested in March 1980 because of an alleged flight risk. The Federal Court upheld the verdicts on 16 July 1981. On 3 June 3 1982, he was released early by decision of the Oberlandesgericht Bamberg, after the Landgericht Bayreuth rejected his release in March 1982 because he had not yet served two thirds of his sentence. The remainder of his sentence was remitted in 1987. Heinrichsohn professed no guilt and was even charged with a further count of perjury in the aftermath, due to having testified at the trial of that he had been completely unaware of the murder of Jews.Bernhard Brunner: Der Frankreich-Komplex, p 369. He eventually lived with his new wife in a town close to B√ºrgstadt.Bernhard Brunner: Der Frankreich-Komplex, p. 358. The opening of the trial in Cologne had been a late vindication of the efforts of Serge Klarsfeld and his wife, Beate Klarsfeld, to bring German and French Holocaust perpetrators to justice. The relatively heavy prison sentences for the defendants was a novelty in the case-law of the Federal Republic of Germany. B√ºrgstadt's residents remained convinced that Heinrichsohn was innocent, as journalist Lea Rosh documented in several television features for .Judith Wei√ühaar: Lea Rosh erinnert sich an B√ºrgstadt, in: Anne Klein (Hrsg.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows on October 20, 2014, and later for the iPad and Android on June 24, 2015 and September 4, 2015 respectively. A sequel - Door Kickers 2 ‚Äì Task Force North - is planned. The player controls an elite squad of SWAT operatives who are pitted against several varieties of criminals and terrorists.  Gameplay  = Squad = Door Kickers allows the player to create a squad of up to ten playable characters, each of which is able customized with classes, weapons, armor, utilities, and gear. Every class has a unique variety of weapons, each of which caters to particular situations and playstyles. As the team completes missions they will level up, both as a squad and individually. The five choosable classes are Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth, and Shield. Pointmen are equipped with just pistols and no primary weapon, but have the highest mobility out of all five. Assaulters can choose between submachine guns and rifles, and Breachers are allowed to have shotguns. The Stealth class allows players to silently dispatch enemies with suppressed weaponry, and the Shield is equipped with a riot shield and a sidearm, with no other gear. As the team levels up, the player will earn Doctrine points which can be allocated to improve the squad with abilities and perks. Leveling up a character individually will also improve their experience in the field: marksmanship, assault shooting, and field skills will all be upgraded upon leveling up. = Campaigns and single missions = The game has six main campaigns, each with a different amount of missions. As a player completes a level they will be rewarded with up to three 'stars' depending on their performance during that mission‚Äîstars are used to purchase weapons and equipment for the operatives. Single missions are missions not tied to a campaign and are able completed at one's own leisure without having to worry about permanent squad casualties. Door Kickers also features mapping and modding support. Missions can be of eight varieties: Clear Hostiles, Hostage Rescue, Bomb Defusal, Stop Execution, Protect the VIP, Arrest Warrant, Dope Raid, and Robbery in Progress. = Game mechanics = The player views the game from a top-down view. Areas not in view of the squad are marked with a blue or black fog-of-war. In some missions there are multiple points at which one is allowed to deploy operatives, allowing for strategical collaboration between the group. Hence the name, Door Kickers relies heavily on breaching rooms. The game gives players several options in doing so, however. Breaching charges can be used to kill enemies on the other side of the door with relative ease while simultaneously stunning others in the room, or if a more stealthy approach is desired, one can use a spycam to peer underneath the door and see into the room, allowing the player to make a plan. Flashbangs and less-than-lethal Stinger grenades are able to be thrown along with a door kick, stunning or killing any enemies inside. Lockpick Machines to open locked doors and Tazers to subdue terrorists are at the disposal of the squad as well. 'Go codes' can be used to coordinate attacks between operatives. The team also has the ability to handcuff enemies with arrest warrants, rescue hostages, defuse bombs, and escort and control a VIP. In some missions, off- map sniper support is offered.  Reception  = Reviews = Door Kickers was positively received by critics. Rock, Paper, Shotgun stated \\"Door Kickers is a smashing top-down tactical masterclass, with enough missions to shake a nightstick at, randomised enemy placements to add further variety, and a bundled level editor allows devious designers to create their own maps and missions‚Ä¶Door Kickers is a complete package of planning, panicking and policing.\\" Indie Statik proclaimed that \\"...It‚Äôs a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It‚Äôs probably the best man-shootery game I‚Äôve played in years.\\" In a Giant Bomb Quick Look, Matt Rorie praised it and said he liked the game quite a bit. = Awards = Rock, Paper, Shotgun: Best Tactics of 2014  Sequels and spin-offs  =Door Kickers 2 ‚Äì Task Force North= A sequel, Door Kickers 2 ‚Äì Task Force North, was announced on January 17, 2016 and was set to release Q4 2016. However, it was delayed until 2017, then again to 2019, without any news about the game's release. On February 4, 2020, an official trailer was released for the game, and it was announced that the game would launch in Q2 2020 as a Steam Early Access title. The game is to be set in the Middle East and will include improved weapons, equipment, AI, and various new gameplay features in a 3D environment. An improved stealth system was also teased, something that was criticized in Door Kickers. =Door Kickers: Action Squad= Door Kickers: Action Squad is a spin-off created on behalf of KillHouse Games and another studio, pixelshard. The game was first teased on August 1, 2017 in a comic on the KHG website. A day later, an official trailer was released. The game strays from the series' traditional top-down gameplay in favor of a side-scrolling action game.

The film centers on a Boston homicide detective, Doyle (Eric Dane) who searches for clues about a serial killer that murdered both his sister and his partner (Rebecca Gayheart). His search leads him to Nantucket where he uncovers secrets about his family's past. Plot Boston homicide detective, James Doyle, and his partner/girlfriend, Maggie Wynn are called by their commander and alerted of a 911 call made by a woman claiming to be stalked by a man addressing her as Deirdre (the name of Doyle's sister who was murdered weeks earlier) Doyle and Wynn rush to the scene and discover it is a trap. Wynn is stabbed by the woman who called and they are both shot by an unknown man. Doyle survives and Wynn is killed. Weeks later, Doyle is on leave and is taking the boat to Nantucket. During the voyage he meets two women, Eli, and the Duchess. Upon arrival, he is greeted by a local officer Detective Johnson who directs him to his hotel. After checking in, he meets the police chief Preston MacGuire. who tells him that time on the island will help him emotionally recuperate. Doyle and Johnson later attend an outdoor barbecue and concert where Doyle encounters the two women he saw on the boat. Later, the Duchess is found dead. Doyle surmises she was murdered by the same parties that killed his partner and sister due to similar wounds on their backs carved with a knife. Doyle then recalls that his aunt Lola used to live on the island and he makes an attempt to locate her. During a flashback Doyle recollects that Maggie whispered \\"The Rose, The Crown\\" in his ear while she was dying. He then goes to the Rose and Crown restaurant thinking it may be a clue. The local bartender does not recognize his aunt by name, but Doyle notices a photo on the wall of 3 people, one of which he has a hunch might be his aunt. The bartender tells him one of the other people in the picture, Tony used to work there and she sends him to his home. When he is there, he shows Tony the photo, and they walk inside. The woman in the photo, Angela tells Doyle his aunt died the previous year. He leaves his business card at the house and leaves. Upon leaving it is revealed that Eli and another man were spying on him Back at his hotel, Doyle attends an art gallery opening the Duchess had invited him to. While there, he purchases a painting which reminds him of Maggie. The artist, Melissa Reynolds introduces herself. Eli is also in the gallery and spills wine on another painting. The artist, Clara asks to be treated to a couple of pints of beer at the gallery's after-party as compensation. After dinner, the woman, Eli becomes ill and her companion takes her home. She is very upset and the man injects her with a sedative. They then look at pictures of the murder victims on their phone and it is revealed that they are the killers. The next morning, Doyle, Melissa, Clara and another artist from the party, Billy MacLeod, are scalloping on the beach. Melissa and Doyle are dropped off at her dockside studio after she has a panic attack and Doyle is picked up by Johnson. Eli and her companion show up at the house where Angela lives and take Tony hostage and torture him for information, and cut off one of his fingers. Doyle shows up unexpectedly and Eli keeps Tony quiet. Tony's friend Junior shows up as Doyle is leaving. Junior seeing a stranger in the house, runs over to his home to retrieve a shotgun. In a subsequent shootout, Eli shoots at Angela, whom she addresses as Lola. Junior is wounded and Eli and her companion flee. Doyle later has a late night meal with Melissa and he explains to her what is going on. That morning, Eli's companion has a massage appointment with Clara whom he murders. When her body is found on the beach, a wound is found carved on her back. Fearing Melissa might be in danger he calls her and tells her to go to his hotel. Eli shows up and tells Melissa that Clara was found murdered. She has another panic attack and a friend drives her to the hospital. Eli picks her up and introduces her companion as her brother Perry. While Doyle is at the house where Clara was attacked, he examines photos of the wounds and realizes that the carvings are actually letters and that the killers are spelling his last name. Doyle's phone rings and a local priest tells him that a woman is there who wants to speak with him at the church. When he arrives he sees Angela who is really his aunt Lola. Lola reveals that the killers are his cousins who falsely believe that Doyle's father Frank killed their father Tim. Lola reveals that she stabbed her husband because he attacked her in a fit of drunken rage while finding her in bed with his brother Frank. Tony shows up and wants in on capturing Eli and Perry as revenge for cutting off his finger. As Doyle is leaving, Lola implores that he not kill Perry and whispers something in his ear. Back at the hotel, Doyle calls Melissa's phone and hears it ring in the hotel. Eli is there and tells Doyle that Melissa dropped it before going to the hospital and that she is with Perry. She draws a map to where they are staying. Doyle, knowing that Melissa is being held hostage alerts Tony who meets up with Doyle at the house. Doyle and Tony attempt to get Perry to surrender. Perry is wounded in the leg by a shot from Tony's crossbow and hides in a garage. Melissa is rescued and told to hide. Hearing a siren, she rushes towards it only to find Eli driving a stolen police car and shooting at her. She hides under a canoe and Eli fails to locate her. Doyle is chasing Perry but is stopped by Eli saying she will kill Melissa if he does not let them escape. Doyle drops his gun. Melissa shows up and fires a shot. Eli attempts to shoot Melissa but is fatally shot by Doyle instead. Perry then tells Doyle to kill him too, but he refuses, saying that Lola revealed that Perry is actually his half-brother from Lola's relationship with Frank. The following morning, a crowd gathers on the beach for a memorial service for Clara, Lola gives Doyle his father's old movie camera. The following morning, Perry is in custody and being escorted back to the mainland by the state police. Doyle is on the boat's upper deck and reminisces about happier times with his family Production Production commenced in April 2014, with four weeks of filming on Nantucket followed by one week in Boston.

The painting may be the second in a triptych narrating the passage of a racing car through a landscape, beginning with Abstract Speed (Velocit√† + paesaggio) (1913) and ending with Abstract Speed‚ÄîThe Car Has Passed (1913). The three paintings share indications of a single landscape, and each painting is continued onto its frame. Balla chose the automobile as a symbol of speed, reflecting the statement of Futurist founder Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's 1909 first manifesto: \\"The world's splendor has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed... A roaring automobile...that seems to run on shrapnel, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.\\" The painting evokes the sensation of the passing of an automobile, with crisscrossing lines representing sound. The painting is said to have captured the ideals of Italian Futurism. It was featured on the 1980 British television series 100 Great Paintings, which presented five paintings from each of 20 thematic groups.

Krabat is a character in Sorbian folklore, also dubbed the \\"Wendish Faust\\". First recorded in 1837, Joachim Leopold Haupt, Von einem b√∂sen Herrn in Gro√ü-S√§rchen (1837) the character developed from an evil sorcerer into a folk hero and beneficial trickster in the course of the 19th century. Origins The historical nucleus of the folk tale is Johannes Schadowitz (1624-1704), a Croat (Crabat) cavalry commander, who was granted an estate in Gro√ü S√§rchen (now part of Lohsa) near Hoyerswerda in 1691 by John George III, Elector of Saxony. Analysis The tale of Krabat's apprenticeship to an evil sorcerer with malefic powers can be classified, in folkloristic studies, as Aarne-Thompson-Uther ATU 325, \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\". Distribution The folk tale is centered around the area of Lusatia, most notably the settlement of ƒåorny Cho≈Çmc, which today is a district of the city of Hoyerswerda, where Krabat is said to have learned his sorcerous powers.* pp. 323-348. Adaptations The Krabat story has been adapted into several novels, notably: * Mi≈°ter Krabat (Master Krabat) (1954) by Mƒõrƒáin Nowak-Njechor≈Ñski. * ƒåorny m≈Çyn (The Black Mill) (1968) by Jurij Brƒõzan, on which the film Die Schwarze M√ºhle was based. * Krabat (1971) by Otfried Preu√üler, which inspired The East German TV Movie Die schwarze M√ºhle (1975), the Czech film ƒåarodƒõj≈Øv uƒçe≈à (1977) and the German film Krabat (2008). The Krabat album by German Goth band ASP is also inspired by this version of the legend. References Bibliography *Jurij Pilk, Adolf Anders, \\"Der wendische Faust\\", S√§chsischer Erz√§hler.

It was originally established in 1928, and subsequently purchased in 1948 by Sid Kotlick and Len Toll. It serves smoked and fried fish, shrimp, and clams. The restaurant is often featured on TV shows and web series', such as Eater's Dining on a Dime and Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. The building is a one-room shack with a counter and no seating. Patrons can take their food to go, or (more commonly) sit in their parked cars along 95th Street to eat.  Smoking process  The restaurant uses a natural-wood smokehouse, which has been in use since establishment. The smoking process involves brining the fish overnight, before large fish (such as salmon, sturgeon, or sablefish) are usually cut into \\"steaks\\", threaded with string, and hung from a smoking rack. Some salmon are smoked whole. Wood fires are built in the bottom of the smokehouse and the fish are cooked with the doors open; when complete, the doors are closed and the fish are smoked. Shrimp, clam strips, and smaller fish such as lake chub are smoked by tacking to a plank.  History  Smoked fish were popular in the 1940s and 1950s, when shipping and fishing boat traffic were heavy on Chicago's waterways. The business began a slow decline over the decades, as the neighborhood and economy changed, and fried seafood was introduced to generate more sales. Due to declining demand, the owners had considered ending smoking and focusing on frying, until they were featured on No Reservations; a few days after the episode aired, patrons were lined up out the door and down the street, and sales continue to increase. Awards and honors Calumet Fisheries was named by CNN as one of America's 10 best historic restaurants. In 2010, it received a James Beard Foundation Award.

Instrumental in the Holocaust in France, Zeitschel, as the desk officer for Jewish affair (Judenreferent) at the German Embassy in Paris, was one of the organizers of the deportations of Jews from occupied France. Early life and education He was the son of pharmacy owner, Franz Zeitschel, and his wife, Ella van Hees. From 1911, he studied medicine at the University of Freiburg and from 1914 to 1917, during World War I, served as an assistant doctor in the rear area military hospital of Freiburg. He graduated in 1918. Interwar period At the end of World War I Zeitscel was discharged from military service. From 1919 to 1920, he was a member of the Freikorps Reinhard in Berlin, working at the same time as medical assistant at Klinikum im Friedrichshain, the oldest hospital in Berlin. Later, as a full-fledged doctor, he served at various sanatoria in the Black Forest. Zeitschel, a staunch anti-Semite, joined the Nazi party in very early times (1923). For a decade (1925-35) he found employment as a naval surgeon. In 1935 he came to be employed at Section II ‚Äì Propaganda and Section VII - British India and the Far East in the Propaganda Ministry; he served also in the colonial policy department at the Nazi party headquarter. Towards the end of 1937 he moved to the Foreign Ministry (Ausw√§rtiges Amt or AA), , even before Hitler's reshuffle of the Government with the appointment of Joachim von Ribbentrop as foreign minister on 4 February 1938. There he served as legation councillor in the political department. For a brief period in June 1939 he was the German consul in the British colony of Nigeria. He was a member of the SS holding the rank of major while in Paris (1940),. More precisely, Ray states that he was operating in the military Secret Field Police. World War II When the Germans invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Zeitschel was commanded to Warsaw where he dealt in looting politically valuable documents and art treasures from diplomatic missions of enemy as well neutral states. He was then a member of the ', the special unit controlled by the Foreign Office and in particular by the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop which systematically pillaged cultural and art treasures and any other item of political interest from the territories occupied by Germany. In 1940 Zeitschel followed the ‚Äò‚ÄôSonderkommando K√ºnsberg‚Äô‚Äô in its move to the western front. In June, with Ribbentrop's authorization, Zeitschel was brought to the German Embassy in Paris by the ambassador Otto Abetz. First he worked in the Foreign Office liaison desk to the military commander of France. He was then tasked by ambassador Abetz in looting and then closing the foreign missions in Paris, as well as in plundering Jewish art collections and galleries, and ferrying the booty \\"to the custody of the German embassy\\". Zeitschel and Dannecker organized the traveling exhibition, Le Juif et la France (\\"Jews and France\\") in the occupied part of France in 1941 =Desk officer for Jewish Affairs= From September 1940, he was promoted as commissioner for Jewish affairs and Masonic affairs liaison with the commander of the state police and the SD (Security Office) and was parallel to his career in the diplomatic service for Sturmbannf√ºhrer. On 5 September 1941, he and Dannecker led the opening in Paris of the exhibition Le Juif et la France (The Jew and France). As Judenreferent, he was one of the forces behind of the Final Solution in France, the deportation and murder of Jews. The participation of the German Ambassador in the Jewish measures was necessary, both in unoccupied France with the Vichy government as well as in occupied France. In a document submitted in the Eichmann trial, the close cooperation between the German intelligence service (Sicherheitsdienst, or SD) in France, with the German embassy comes up with the BdS Helmut Knochen, and Theodor Dannecker as its representative in Paris on the one hand, and on the other hand expressed (Ernst Achenbach, later FDP foreign policy and almost German-EEC Commissioner, takes part here): > In August 1941, Zeitschel put pressure on Abetz, so this is \\"personally\\" the > commitment caught by Heinrich Himmler, \\"that the Jews present in the > concentration camp can be deported to the East, once this permit > transport\\"Dokument VEJ 5/285 and then put the pressure on Dannecker. Zeitschel was informed in top secret processes and knew about the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942. He applied the minutes of the proceedings from junior state secretary Ernst Woermann to the deportation of French Jews. In the Nuremberg trials a letter by Zeitschel from 5 February 1946 was read: > The Independent Commission of Historians - Foreign Office presented in the > book Das Amt 2010, in response to the book clear that the role of the > Embassy in Paris and the Foreign Office has been underestimated in driving > the Holocaust in France so far.

H. their becoming rare by these measures.Aufzeichnung, 21. In Berlin, Abetz met this Memorandum with Ribbentrop and Hitler, immediately before Hitler's decision to deport Jews from Germany. In Tunis Zeitschel and Rudolf Rahn arrived almost simultaneously at the Tunis bridgehead on . Rahn was a representative of the Federal Foreign Office of the Afrika Korps from to . He left the bridgehead after Rommel's defeat and the Axis surrender in the Tunisian Campaign in . In Tunisia the Einsatzkommando of Walter Rauff began on 24 November 1942. On 6 December 1942, Rauff agreed in a meeting with the General Walther Nehring and Rahn, on the use of Jewish forced laborers and instituted a system of labor camps, organized by Theo Saevecke.Klaus-Michael Mallmann, Martin C√ºppers: Halbmond und Hakenkreuz. Vichy France, Italy and the leadership of the Afrika Korps, between which the \\"zbV envoy\\"Paul Seabury: Die Wilhelmstrasse. had to convey to Rahn, that the demands of the SS men were rejected in his own words, because otherwise it would have affected Tunisia and Italian Jews.Rudolf Rahn: Ruheloses Leben: Aufzeichnungen und Erinnerungen. =Paris Embassy= Until July 1944 Zeitschel was back at the German Embassy in Paris. He also worked out a project for the reorganization of the Paris police in the service of the occupier. After the dissolution of the Embassy in Paris, he was on 1 August 1944, at the headquarters of the SS Oberabschnitts Spree, whose director was Obergruppenf√ºhrer August Heissmeyer. Death and posthumous sentencing Zeitschel was allegedly killed in 1945 in a bomb attack in Berlin. The French judiciary sentenced him in 1954 in absentia for his crimes to lifelong forced labor. During the trial of Abetz, and in the much later judicial proceedings concerning the Jews deported from France, Zeitschel's name was mentioned repeatedly by the defendants and their witnesses to make a main culprit responsible.

The music combines many disparate elements, including modal playing, free jazz- inspired improvisation, precise forms, tone clusters, aleatoric structures and avant-garde use of timbre and articulation, while imbuing them with individual expression and a sense of dramatic lyricism that's been compared to late Romantic music.Original liner notes by Adam S≈Çawi≈Ñski  Reception and legacy  Richard Cook and Brian Morton name it as \\"one of the finest jazz albums ever made in Europe\\" and include it among the 1001 best jazz records in their book The Penguin Guide to Jazz. Critic Stuart Nicholson wrote that it \\"has become a bellwether for European jazz, with critics pointing to how this album marked a shift away from the dominant American approach with the emergence of a specific European aesthetic\\". Similarly, Jazzwise magazine stated that it \\"is one of the most important contributions to the shaping of a European aesthetic in jazz composition\\", placing it at number 85 in the list The 100 Jazz Albums That Shook the World. Manfred Eicher, the founder of ECM Records, described Astigmatic as a milestone in the history of jazz. It was voted the best album of all time by readers of the Polish Jazz Forum magazine. Writing about the 2016 reissue, FACT Magazine author Mikey IQ Jones stated that \\"Komeda's compositions and arrangements are beautiful and complex, and it's the rare epochal album whose power is still potent from the first listen through to its thousandth\\". The compositions from Astigmatic have been repeatedly reinterpreted by Polish jazz musicians, including Urszula Dudziak, Micha≈Ç Urbaniak and Tomasz Sta≈Ñko. The title of the album Asthmatic by Polish free jazz band Mi≈Ço≈õƒá is an ironic reference to Astigmatic.  Track listing  All tracks composed by Krzysztof Komeda.

Supposedly founded in 2005 as a \\"relay\\" project passed between artists every five years, the group has given few interviews, leaving music journalists and the media in doubt as to the exact nature of the project. Background, style and career The group's work encompasses widely experimental music releases marked by a lo-fi sound, including their 2011 album One Nation on Hippos in Tanks, and distinctive video pieces, including the defunct YouTube channel pollyjacobsen, which featured a bizarrely cryptic range of content. Their work has drawn irreverently on popular culture and incorporated opaque imagery and contexts, as well as an idiosyncratic online presence. In 2011 they were signed to Hyperdub. The group's lineup has remained obscure, although Blunt's artistic style has been heard within newer releases, and a variety of other names have also been invoked as members. A mysterious representative named Denna Frances Glass has alternately been posited as either the manager of the project or a fake identity created by Blunt and Copeland. In 2016, Glass announced that Blunt and Copeland were no longer part of the project, which would be continuing with other members.

It is chronologically the third in the series (the events of The Fortress of the Pearl occur between Elric of Melnibon√© and Sailor on the Seas of Fate). Plot The book is divided into three parts. Sailing to the Future The story begins with Elric lost somewhere in the Young Kingdoms and near the sea. A mysterious ship appears and he is welcomed aboard by its captain and introduced to three other powerful warriors. The captain informs the adventurers that they are traveling across time and between realities. They have been found because they alone have the power to stop alien sorcerers from destroying their worlds. They come to understand that they (Elric, Erekos√´, Dorian Hawkmoon, and Corum Jhaelen Irsei) are Eternal Champions and are actually four different iterations of the same being. The Champions are instructed that they must slay the evil beings and destroy their building by fire. Upon finding the dwelling place of the creatures they face many dangers within. The champion finds a sentient pool in a well that seems to be trying to communicate to its partner. The four champions assimilate into one eight armed being, and destroy the creature in the pool only to discover, the 'building' they have invaded is the body of the other creature. They destroy it and go their separate ways, with the memory of what happened fading like a dream. Sailing to the Present Elric encounters himself on another shore without the memory of his last adventure. He meets a sailor named Count Smiorgan Baldhead who accompanies Elric as they are followed by a mysterious riderless horse. Elric and Smiorgan find that they are in another world, one inhabited by a Melnibon√©an nobleman named Saxif D‚Äôan. Saxif recognizes Elric but does not honor his sovereignty in this realm. Saxif is the subject of an old Melnibonean tale. In the legend, Saxif loved a half-human woman but she loved another; Prince Carolak. In the legend, Saxif kills the woman rather than see her with another, only to learn with her dying breath that she still loved him. Saxif is now obsessed with a woman, Vassliss, who resembles his dead love and Prince Carolak reveals himself on a horse and defeats Saxif.

It is one of the 'procedures' for working with text as characterized by Strauss (1987) and Strauss and Corbin (1990). Open coding aims at developing substantial codes describing, naming or classifying the phenomenon under consideration. Open coding is achieved by segmenting data into meaningful expressions and describing them in single word to short sequence of words. Further, relevant annotations and concepts are then attached to these expressions. Open coding may be applied in varying degrees of detail. The codes can be linked to a line, a sentence, a paragraph or wholesome text (protocol, case, etc.). The application of the alternatives depends on the research question, on the relevant data, personal style of analyst and the stage of research. However, while coding, the main aim of coding should be in sight i.e. to break down and understand the text and develop categories to be put in order in the course of time. The result of open coding should be a list characterising codes and categories attached to the text and supported by code notes that were produced to explain the content of codes. These notes could be striking observations and thoughts that are relevant to the development of theory. Although codes are exclusive to the research material and the style of the analyst, it is suggested researchers should address the text with the following questions: # What? - Identify the underlying issue and the phenomenon # Who? - Identify the actors involved and the roles they play. # How? - Identifying the aspects of phenomenon # When? How long? Where? - Time, course and location # How much?

Madad Ahl al-Sham has also been accused of financing the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, the al-Nusra Front. In 2013, al-Bakr was one of two Qatari citizens arrested for submitting a ‚Äúthreatening letter‚Äù to the French Embassy in Qatar. He died in September 2018 at 45 years old by car acceidient.

One of Muhammad's brothers, Ibrahim ‚ÄòIsa Hajji Muhammad al-Bakr, was labeled a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2014 for providing financial support to al-Qaeda and the Taliban and playing \\"a key role in a terrorist cell that was plotting to attack U.S. military bases and personnel in Qatar.\\" Issa Haji Mohammed al-Bakr died in November 2011 at 90 years old. Following his father's death, Muhammad Isa al-Bakr was in the al-Kheesa region of Doha, Qatar, but would later travel to Turkey. Madad Ahl al-Sham Madad Ahl al-Sham was an online Qatar-based fundraising campaign purportedly created to provide humanitarian supplies to Syrian citizens in need. In an online flyer attributed to the campaign and distributed primarily through social media, the Madad Ahl al-Sham campaign requests donations from Qatari citizens to provide medicine, food, and clothes to Syrian civilians. In 2013, it was reported that as many as 31 tons of food and household medical items were transferred to Syrian citizens and refugees through the Turkish border in the sixth, seventh, and eighth installments of an assistance program funded by the donations collected by Madad Ahl al-Sham. A member of Madad Ahl al-Sham, Mohammed Helwan al-Seqatri, told the Qatari newspaper al-Watan that over 50 young Qataris were volunteering for the campaign by collecting donations to be sent to Syria through the Turkish and Jordanian borders. According to the U.S. Department of State‚Äôs Bureau of Counterterrorism, the Madad Ahl al-Sham online fundraising campaign was shut down by Qatari authorities in 2014. Muhammad Isa al-Bakr was a promoter and coordinator of donations for Madad Ahl al-Sham. In early 2014, al-Bakr featured in a video promoting Madad Ahl al-Sham and describing its mission and activities. Al-Bakr also promoted the campaign, distributed its fliers, and showcased its aid collections and deliveries through his personal Twitter account. In 2014, a video surfaced online showing the delivery of food and toys to Syrian citizens in packages boxes. The boxes in the video are labeled as having been delivered under the supervision of Muhammad Isa al-Bakr. Q-Tel Group It is believed that Muhammad Isa al-Bakr works for the Qatar-based telecommunications company Q-Tel Group. Connections to terrorism =Madad Ahl al-Sham= Muhammad Isa al-Bakr was involved in the operations of the online fundraising campaign Madad Ahl al- Sham. Since its emergence, Madad Ahl al-Sham was identified as a fundraising source for violent extremists including the al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda‚Äôs Syrian branch. In August 2012, the al-Nusra Front cited Madad Ahl al-Sham as ‚Äúone of the preferred conduits for donations.‚Äù Before being shut down in 2014, Madad Ahl al-Sham operated under the Qatar Centre for Voluntary Work, a government organization founded in 2001. In 2014, the U.S. Department of State described Madad Ahl al-Sham as an ‚Äúonline fundraising campaign that was suspected of sending funds to violent extremist elements in Syria.‚Äù Sa‚Äôd bin Sa‚Äôd Muhammad Shariyan al-Kabi is a U.S. Treasury Specially Designated Global Terrorist for his role in setting up donation campaigns in Qatar for the al-Nusra Front and acting as an intermediary to collect and facilitate the payment of a ransom for a hostage held by a militant group. Al-Kabi also worked as a coordinator and fundraiser of Madad Ahl al-Sham. Al-Kabi‚Äôs name and phone number appeared on several Madad Ahl al-Sham fliers as a primary point of contact for those donating to the campaign. In 2014, CNN reported that al-Kabi‚Äôs WhatsApp Messenger profile included a Madad Ahl al-Sham flyer calling for donations ‚Äúequal to $1,500 to prepare a fighter by arming, feeding, and treating.‚Äù In a 2013 Twitter post, al-Kabi claims that Madad Ahl al-sham raised the equivalent of $1.4 million from its Qatari donors. Abd al-Latif Bin Abdallah Salih Muhammad al-Kawari was also a prominent fundraiser for Madad Ahl al-Sham and a U.S. Treasury Specially Designated Global Terrorist for collecting financial support for al-Qaeda, serving as an al-Qaeda security official, and ‚Äúfacilitating the international travel of a courier who was carrying tens of thousands of dollars earmarked for al-Qaeda.‚Äù Al-Kawari worked alongside SDGT Ibrahim Isa al-Bakr, the brother of Muhammad Isa al-Bakr, and Hassan Ghul, Osama bin Laden‚Äôs former envoy to Iraq-based jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in order to fund al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Supporters of Madad Ahl al-Sham described al-Kawari as a point of contact for the campaign and as an assistant to al- Kabi. According to The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF), Al-Kawari directly coordinated Madad Ahl al-Sham from January 2013 to mid-2014. Both al- Kabi and al-Kawari continue to live freely in Qatar. Arrest On March 22, 2013, Muhammad Isa al-Bakr and Mansour bin Rashed al-Matroushi were arrested by plain-clothes officers while returning from a family trip to Mesaieed in the Southeast of Qatar. The two men were taken to the police headquarters in Doha and their families were notified that al-Bakr and al-Matroushi were being detained, but they did not receive a reason for their detainment. On March 23, 2013 both men were interrogated at the offices of the State Security Prosecutor reportedly without being informed of any charges or an arrest warrant. Qatari authorities, however, claimed that arrest warrants were issued. On March 23 both men were placed in solitary confinement until March 27 when they were granted regular use of the prison phone line and were allowed a visit from family members and members of the Qatari National Human Rights Committee. While in detention, al-Bakr and al-Matroushi were re- questioned about the letter to the French embassy. Reports also emerged that the two men had begun a hunger strike on the morning of April 8. By April 11 al-Baker had allegedly become too ill to speak on the phone or walk. Al-Bakr and al-Matroushi were released on April 18, 2013 after having been detained for 28 days but were banned from leaving Qatar upon their release. It is believed that the arrest of al-Bakr and al-Matroushi was prompted by their delivery of a letter dated March 3, 2013 to the French embassy in Qatar. Although the French embassy declined to comment on the letter, the embassy contacted Qatari authorities on March 7 who claimed the letter made clear threats to the embassy and France. According to a Doha News translation, the letter demands that the French government immediately ceases its military campaign in Mali ‚Äúor else you (the French) will be exposing yourselves to the wrath of people who love death as much as you love life.‚Äù References Living people Qatari activists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Muhammad Isa al-Bakr"},{"id":"51123480","text":"The Pledging Conference in Support of Iraq took place in Washington, D.C. on July 20, 2016 and was co-hosted by the United States, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, and Kuwait.

When Jomni was six his father took a job in London and the family moved with him. Jomni spent the next five years undergoing medical rehabilitation for his injuries, including spinal fixation. Athletics career At the age of 23, Jomni was inspired by watching the 2012 Summer Paralympics on his television. He contacted UK Athletics who placed him in touch with the Weir Archer academy, who took him on as a potential athlete. By 2013 Jomni was classified as a T53 track athlete and began competing at a national level, mainly in sprint events. The following year Jomni entered his first major international competition when he was selected for the Great Britain team at the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea. There he entered two events, the T53 400 metre and 800 metre races. His time of 1:53.30 in the 800m was good enough to secure a bronze medal in the 800m. He followed this with his first international gold medal when in the 400m, in a limited field, he finished in a time of 52.78 ahead of France's Nicolas Brignone.

She spent summers with relatives in Virginia's Hampton Roads area, and after she graduated from elementary school in Brooklyn, came to Newport News, Virginia to live with her grandmother and aunts in the all-black Southeast or East End Community, a low income and high crime area of Newport News. Flora Davis attended and graduated from the former Huntington High School in East End, Newport News (the only all-black high school in the area until George Washington Carver High School was built in 1949) in 1941, then attended Virginia State University, receiving a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1945 (although she had wanted to study mathematics at Spellman College in Atlanta). She pledged with the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, but her class and work schedule were too heavy to permit full involvement, although she later joined the graduate chapter. For 65 years she was married to Raymond Celester (\\"Coach\\") Crittenden Jr. (1926-2010), born in Richmond and also an athlete at and graduate of Virginia State University. For fifty years Coach Crittenden also worked as teacher, athletic coach and administrator in the Newport News public schools. Coach died in 2010 after a long illness. They had three surviving children, Raymond III, Thursa, and Alonzo, \\"Lonnie\\" who played briefly in the WFL (Wiffle)football league, a short-lived league that folded midway through its second season. His son, her grandson, Alonzo ll died after a tragic, short illness in 2016. Career Upon receiving her bachelor's degree, Crittenden then taught physical education, English and social studies at the new Carver High School in Warwick (which would later be incorporated into Newport News) for seven years. She found its principal Homer L. Hines supported his teachers as well as the community. In 1956, she and her husband moved their young family to Indiana where they experienced racial segregation while she earned a Master of Science degree in physical education, health sciences and counseling from Indiana University. Both Crittendens received their graduate degrees from that university in 1959. In 1971 Flora Crittenden studied Advanced Guidance Theory at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, which helped her to establish a career counseling program at Carver High School.Flora Crittenden Oral History, available at http://dc.lib.odu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/dove/id/99 Crittenden worked in the Newport News public schools for 32 years‚Äîas a teacher and department head for 15 years, and as a guidance counselor and guidance director for another 17 years. Newport News schools did not fully integrate until 1971. She was also long active in the NAACP (including as the chapter president in 1981) as well as Trinity Baptist Church, although she did not fully accept the Christian doctrine of Heaven and Hell. In her later years, Crittenden was strickened with alzheimer's and currently resides in a senior retirement community in Suffolk, Virginia. Political career Her political career began in 1986, when Flora Crittenden won election to a four-year term on the Newport News City Council, and she served there until 1990. Prior to the election, Flora was Campaign Manager for Bobby Scott working with a formidable volunteer staff each day. This staff included Richard Jones (assistant Campaign Manager), Lillie Estes, and Shelby Watson to name a few. When delegate Bobby Scott ran for (and won election to) the Virginia Senate from Newport News, his position was taken by Rev. W. Henry Maxwell. When Scott ran for the U.S. Congress, Maxwell ran for (and was elected to) the Virginia Senate seat. Thus, the Virginia delegate position representing Newport News came open, and Crittenden ran and won election as a delegate in the Virginia General Assembly in January 1993. She won re-election in 1995, ran unopposed in 1997 and 1999, and again won easily in 2001. She declined to seek reelection in 2003 and was succeeded by fellow Democrat Mamye BaCote. Since 2000, she has been chairperson of the board of Christopher Newport University, the first black woman to hold that post. The former George Washington Carver High School in Newport News was renamed the Flora D. Crittenden Middle School in 1995, and now serves as a magnet school for science and mathematics, although there were many alumni that opposed the name change desiring to preserve the African American inventor's name. A new high school was built and honors former Carver High principal Homer L. Hines. The Daily Press, a small town local newspaper named her one of the top ten most influential Blackwomen for that part of the Peninsula.{{cite web References 1924 births Living people Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Politicians from Newport News, Virginia African-American state legislators in Virginia Women state legislators in Virginia Virginia Democrats Virginia State University alumni Indiana University alumni 20th-century American politicians 20th-century American women politicians 21st-century American politicians 21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Flora D.

III, p. 980 (\\"Tarquitia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Tarquitius is thought to be another orthography of Tarquinius, the Latin form of the Etruscan gentilicium Tarchna. The Tarquitii would therefore be of Etruscan origin, perhaps from the city of Tarquinii. Branches and cognomina The only cognomen associated with the Tarquitii of the Republic is Flaccus, a common surname originally describing someone flabby, or with floppy ears.Chase, p. 109. The other Tarquitii of the Republic bore no surname, but a variety of cognomina are found in imperial times, including Priscus, old or elder, and Catulus, a whelp.Chase, pp. 111, 112.

Whist markers generally come in pairs, one for each couple. Whist markers can be broadly divided into three groups: * Short whist markers * Long whist markers * Long and short whist markers. Short whist markers A short whist marker with the flaps closed A short whist marker with the flaps open A short whist marker displays the number of points gained so far in the game, and the number of games gained in the rubber. Short whist overtook long whist in popularity around the middle of the nineteenth century. Five points win a game and three games win a rubber. The points are for each trick over the book (the first six tricks) in a given deal, and in some games for \\"honours\\" (see whist for a fuller explanation). Thus a wooden whist marker such as the one on the right has five broad flaps, for the points, and three narrow flaps for the number of games won so far. Long whist markers Long whist markers are similar, but the number of points in a game is ten, or in some cases a lesser number, greater than five. Long and short whist markers These devices are designed to allow scoring for either the long or short game, using the same marker (or pair of markers).

Between 1811 and 1813 she served in the West Africa Squadron, which was attempting to suppress the slave trade. During this service she captured several slave traders and an American privateer. She made one voyage to the East Indies. Thais was sold in 1818. She then became a merchantman. She was last listed in 1826. Design John Henslow designed the Thais class as 18-gun fireships, with a design close to that of the Tisiphone class of sloops. The Royal Navy used the class as sloops and re-rated them as such in March 1808. In early 1811 most of the class, including Thais, were re- rated as post ships. Naval career Commander Isaac Ferrieres commissioned Thais in June 1807 as a fireship. Thais was among the naval vessels at Plymouth on 27 and 28 August 1807 and so shared in the proceeds arising from the detention of the Danish vessels Elizabeth, Tiesco, and Aurora, in the run- up to the Gunboat War with Denmark. Ferrieres sailed Thais on 9 September for the West Indies. There she participated in the capture of the Danish West Indies during December. By February 1808 Thais was back at Plymouth and undergoing refitting as a sloop, a process that took into April. On 21 January 1809 Thais was at Cape Town. There Admiral Bertie, admiral in charge of the Cape of Good Hope Station, sent her out to look for Diana, which had been reported damaged, and for the East Indiamen Experiment, Glory, and Lord Nelson, which were overdue.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4339. It turned out that the three East Indiamen had foundered without a trace. Later in 1809 Thais served in the North Sea. In August Thais was part of a squadron under the command of Sir Home Riggs Popham in the Scheldt during the Walcheren Campaign. On 23 May 1810 she escorted a convoy to the Mediterranean. In November 1810 Commander Edward Scobell assumed command. On 14 December Thais left Gibraltar as an escort to a convoy for Britain.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4529. =Service with the West Africa Squadron= Thais was re-rated as a sixth rate in 1811, and on 3 April Scobell received promotion to post captain.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.351. Thais and Scobell then sailed for the West Coast of Africa. On 28 July 1811 Thais captured the brig Havannah. The capture took place off \\"Trade Town\\". Havannah was suspected to be a British vessel sailing under a foreign flag. She had 100 slaves aboard, of whom 98 survived to be landed at Freetown, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her. On 30 August, Thais captured the Portuguese brig Venus off Badagry. She too was condemned at Freetown, and 21 slaves were landed there. Three days later, Thais captured another Portuguese brig, Calypso, off Lagos. She landed 13 slaves at Freetown, but the court returned her to her owners. On 24 June 1812 Thais captured the American schooner Dolphin south of Gor√©e. She landed 79 slaves at Freetown, where the court condemned her. Then on 14 August Thais captured the Spanish brig Carlotta at Loango Bay. She had no slaves aboard. On 29 August, Thais captured the Portuguese brig Flor d'America, also at Loango, that was carrying 364 slaves. The court at Freetown condemned both vessels. On 5 September Thais captured the Portuguese schooner Orizonte at Mayumba Bay. She landed 18 slaves at Freetown, where the court condemned her. On 31 March 1813 Thais captured the U.S. brig Rambler. Rambler, of 160 tons (bm), was armed with twelve 9 & 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 88 men. She had sailed from Rhode Island on 28 January and had not made any captures. The capture took place off Cape Mount.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4791. Then on 28 May 1813 Thais was involved in apprehending Juan a ship sailing near the Rio Pongo, which was then taken to Sierra Leone. She was an American sloop carrying no slaves; British records indicate that the capture took place off Cape Sierra Leone. The court at Freetown condemned her. Thais assisted the privateer Kitty after she captured two slave traders, San Jose Triumfo and Phoenix, on 4 June.Grindal (2016), Appendix A: \\"Suspected Slave Vessels Detained 1807-39 by Royal Navy Cruisers, Colonial Vessels and Letters of Marque Vessels\\". On 27 June Thais and the colonial armed schooner Princess Charlotte captured three small craft off Cape Mesurado. In January 1814 Captain Henry Weir replaced Scobell, who had resigned his commission. =Subsequent service= In late March 1814 Thais was at Hellevoetsluis to transport French coins that Nathan Rothschild had collected. Rothschild had a contract to deliver ¬£600,000 to the south of France by 14 March. By the time Thais and were able to deliver to Bordeaux the ¬£450,000 that Rothschild had gathered Napoleon had abdicated.Kaplan (2005), p.89. From Bordeaux Thais carried General Henry Bayly and his staff to Plymouth.Great Britain. Parliamentary Papers: 1780-1849, Vol. 12, p.73. Between October and December 1814 Thais was at Plymouth being cut down, losing her spar deck, and having her armament being reduced to 16 guns. In 1815 she sailed to the East Indies, escorting East Indiamen. On 6 April Thais took Mercury, Browsse, master, into Madeira. She had been sailing from Bordeaux to Martinique when Thais intercepted her. Thais then sent Mercury to England.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4969. Mercure, Brouessett, master, reached Lisbon. There she was released to resume her voyage to Martinique.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4980. On 10 September Thais left Penang for China.The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and Its Dependencies (1816), Vol. 1, p.596. Between 6 and 11 April 1816, Weir was president of a court-martial that took place on in Madras roads. The board found that Captain Robert O'Brien, captain of Cornwallis, had exceeded his authority in appointing himself a Commodore and dismissed him from the service.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, pp.881-884.In 1817 O'Brien was reinstated in the Navy. He contested the court-martial with one of his grounds being that every member of the board was junior to him. Weir then assumed command of Cornwallis.Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany, Vol. 2, p.416. Weir returned to Thais. Under his command she arrived at St Helena on 28 September from India, and sailed two days later for England.Watson (1912), p.249. Disposal By 1817 Thais was in ordinary at Plymouth. The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" offered \\"Thais, of 22 guns and 431 tons\\", lying at Plymouth, for sale on 13 August 1818. She sold on that day for ¬£1,400.Winfield (2008), p.381.

Bertelli was born in Genoa, Italy on 23 March 1890. In 1894 the family emigrated and settled in Cardiff, South Wales where after leaving school he was taken on as an apprentice at a local steel works. He studied in the evenings at University College to gain technical qualifications and gained also a lifetime interest in rugby. He returned to Italy and got a job in the development department of FIAT in Turin and while there met racing driver Felice Nazzaro and was taken on as a riding mechanic winning the 1908 Targa Bologna. Just before the outbreak of World War I he returned to the United Kingdom and studied aeronautical engineering and got a job in the design office of Grahame-White in Hendon, North London where he remained until 1918. After the war he was called in as a consultant to overcome problems at Enfield-Allday where their first car was suffering design and cost problems and was soon employed there full time as Works Manager but was unable to save the company which collapsed in 1923. Enfield-Alldays had made a few racing cars based on their 10/20 model which Bertelli had driven with some success. Even before Enfield-Alldays had failed Bertelli was working as a consultant assisting such companies as Armstrong Siddeley, Coventry Simplex and Rover. During this time he met Woolf Barnato and built at his Lingfield, Surrey house three cars based on Enfiled-Alldays chassis. While working at Armstrong Siddeley he had met William Renwick, an engineer who had inherited a great deal of money, and the two formed a company Renwick & Bertelli Ltd in Birmingham in 1924. The product of this partnership was a car called the R & B but known informally as \\"Buzzbox\\". This used a four cylinder 1.5 Litre overhead camshaft again mounted in an Enfield-Alldays chassis. The pair came to the notice of the Hon. John Benson whose mother Lady Charnwood had recently bought Bamford and Martin and in 1926 Bertelli and Renwick both joined the board of what became Aston Martin Motors Ltd. Buzzbox would become the basis of a new range of cars. Aston Martin went through a succession of owners and in 1928 was purchased by Sidney Whitehouse who also bought Renwick & Bertelli and merged the companies. In 1931 Renwick left the company and moved to the United States. Bertelli remained with Aston Martin until 1938, when following differences with R. Gordon Sutherland, son of the owner Sir Arthur Munro Sutherland, he resigned and returned to his previous occupation as an engineering consultant. He was then approached by Wallace Devereux of High Duty Alloys, a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley, and asked to design a car but World War II broke out before a prototype was completed and work stopped. He continued however to work for High Duty Alloys until he retired in 1955. In 1940 the family had moved to a 150 acre farm at Wargrave, Berkshire where they raised pigs. Private life Gus Bertelli married Vera ShawVera Beatrice M Shaw, birth registered Paddington 1895, FreeBMD accessed 18 September 2016 in 1920 and the couple had three children, two daughters and a son.

These tractors were used in military service as they were widely available and capable of towing heavy guns. Description This 11 tonne tractor features a large 4 cylinder diesel engine in a prominent rectangular housing. The operator‚Äôs station was either open or enclosed and was designed for up to two crew. There were two common enclosures. One, made of wood was very rectangular while the second is an adapted cabin from a ZIS truck. The engine produced 65 horsepower and it had a top speed of 7 km/h. It is estimated it had an endurance/range of about 80 km. Development In 1932, the Chelyabinsk tractor factory commenced operations and its first product was the S-60 tractor. The follow on product, the S-65, featured the M-17 diesel engine generating 49-56 kW (60-72 hp). From 1937 until 1941 approximately 37600 S-65s were produced. Operational Notes The Stalinets-60 and 65 tractors were typically assigned to heavy division and corps level weapons such as the 152mm ML-20 and even the much heavier 203mm B-4 howitzer. These tractors were also commonly used by tank recovery teams to extract damaged tanks and by engineer units to tow special equipment. Unfortunately the slow speed of these tractors (3‚Äì5 km/h when towing) meant that many were captured by the rapid moving Germans in the early part of the war.

Description Restorations of Waharoa ruwhenua Boessenecker and Fordyce (2015) characterize the species as follows: \\"Waharoa ruwhenua shares Tohoraata and Tokarahia dorsoventrally shallow and wide occipital condyles, a triangular anterior process and well- developed incisural flange of the periotic; with Tohoraata and Tokarahia a concave anterodorsal margin of the anterior process of the periotic and a smooth and transversely convex posterior bullar facet; with Tohoraata a distinct lateral tubercle on the anterior process; and with Eomysticetus and Micromysticetus a short posterior process\\".Boessenecker RW, Fordyce RE. (2015) Anatomy, feeding ecology, and ontogeny of a transitional baleen whale: a new genus and species of Eomysticetidae (Mammalia: Cetacea) from the Oligocene of New Zealand. PeerJ 3:e1129 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1129 Waharoa ruwhenua had a rostrum that was less flexible than those of modern edentulous mysticetes, yet much more flexible than the rostra of toothed mysticetes. This intermediate flexibility suggests that W. ruwhenua harbored the most primitive form of a kinetic rostrum in the Mysticeti. Paleobiology Waharoa ruwhenua had sulci and palatal foramina localized to the posterior half of the palate and lacked these features anteriorly, suggesting that baleen was only present in the posterior palatal regions. The posterior localization of baleen along with a delicate temporomandibular joint with a probable synovial capsule, an anteroposteriorly expanding palate, a non-laterally deflected coronoid process, and a shortage of characteristics indicative of lunge feeding indicate that W. ruwhenua could have utilized skim filter-feeding like modern Balaenidae to feed for zooplankton. The hypothesis that W. rewhenua was a skim feeder suggests that skim filter-feeding may have been the earliest form of feeding in the edentulous Chaeomysticeti clade. Based on the enlarged temporal fossae and enlarged mandibular canal, Waharoa was probably incapable of lunge- feeding, although it remains unclear whether it could skim-feed or filter prey in the benthic zone. Waharoa shared its habitat with the odontocetes Awamokoa, Austrosqualodon, Otekaikea, and Waipatia, and the mysticetes Horopeta, Matapanui, Mauicetus, Tohoraata, Tokarahia, and Whakakai.

Trained in Fine Art, Calligraphy and Woodblock printing she initially achieved recognition during the 1970s for her pioneering work in appliqu√© and tapestry for the fashion and interior design industries. In the 1980s this recognition led to commissions for commercial applications over a range of consumer products, most notably pottery, textile and paper. Since the 1990s, Delevoryas returned to painting and continued to exhibit and promote her work. She lived in the UK since the early 1970s and was married to the writer and poet Robin Amis. Early life, education and early career Delevoryas was born in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts on January 3, 1932 to Greek immigrant parents. She studied at the Pratt Institute and the Cooper Union in New York, where she gained her B.A. (Hons) in Fine Art. After graduation she spent some time in Japan, where she studied calligraphy and wood block printing with Toshi Yoshida and Tomi Tokuriki (Tomikichir≈ç Tokuriki). She also studied in France before settling in New York. Here, she created her earliest major works ‚Äì the New York Studio Series ‚Äì an exploration of structure and of light, both real and reflected. These early works explored naturistic and intimist art combining various influences including Matisse and Picasso, revealing a love of colour and the strong graphic sense which informed her work ever since.Arts Magazine September 1964 and February 1965 Fabric applique and tapestry In the late 1960s, she turned from painting to textile art, and, at the suggestion of Kaffe Fassett and Judy Brittain of Vogue, she came to London, where she was commissioned to design tapestries for private homes and costumes for celebrities and pop stars.Chicago Times, July 26, 1971 http://www.chipublib.org/chicago-newspapers-on-microfilm/London Fashion News, Autumn/Winter 1971/2 Her work in fabric appliqu√© was featured widely, including in Vogue.UK Vogue, Jan 1971 http://sighswhispers.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/journey-to-us.html In 1972, she married writer Robin Amis. The wedding dress she created was featured in Vogue magazine and latterly exhibited in the 2014 \\"Here Comes the Brides\\" Exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is now in the Museum's permanent collection as an example of the spirit of the times. She and her husband moved to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, where they founded the Weatherall Workshops, creating tapestry and needlepoint pieces. The work produced from their designs and stitched into tapestries won many awards and were exhibited widely, including the V & A Queens Jubilee exhibition, the Royal College of Art and ‚ÄòThreads of History‚Äô at The Courtauld Institute of Art.Illustrated London News Feb 1975Needlepoint News March 1977 Watercolour and design Her time at Weatherall marked the beginning of her love affair with the English garden, whose profusion of colour reinforced her already strong love of pattern. The floral watercolours produced during this period quickly translated into designs.New York Times, October 13, 1994 ‚ÄòA Decorator‚Äôs Vision of the Handmade‚Äô This design work which covered a variety of applications were featured by Divertimenti, Burleigh Pottery and Habitat; she also created fabric designs for Designers Guild and stationery products for Elgin Court. Later years In the 90s, she returned to her native Massachusetts, and during that period produced a series of landscapes inspired by the marshlands and tidal estuaries of the coastline. From the mid-90s onwards she was increasingly influenced by the landscape and religious art of Greece as a result of her husband's frequent visits to Mount Athos. She was particularly interested in icons of the Eastern Church and subsequently devoted herself to learning the techniques of iconography.Icon in the World.

He used pseudonyms during call- in interviews throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Donald Trump, an American businessman, politician, and 45th president of the United States, has used several pseudonyms, including \\"John Barron\\" (or \\"John Baron\\"), \\"John Miller\\" and \\"David Dennison\\". His practice of sometimes speaking to the media under the guise of a spokesperson has been described as \\"an open secret\\" at the Trump Organization and in New York media circles. Some New York editors recalled that \\"calls from Barron were at points so common that they became a recurring joke on the city desk.\\" A writer for Fortune reported that Trump's father, Fred Trump, had used the pseudonym Mr. Green in business dealings. \\"John Barron\\" (1980s) Trump used the pseudonym \\"John Barron\\" (sometimes \\"John Baron\\") throughout the 1980s, with its earliest known usage in 1980 and its last acknowledgment in 1990. According to The Washington Post, the name was a \\"go-to alias when [Trump] was under scrutiny, in need of a tough front man or otherwise wanting to convey a message without attaching his own name to it.\\" Barron would be introduced as a spokesperson for Trump. The pseudonym first appeared within a June 6, 1980 New York Times article about Trump's decision to destroy two controversial sculptures from the Bonwit Teller flagship store (now the site of Trump Tower) that he had promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \\"Barron\\", describing himself as \\"a Trump Organization vice president\\", acted as the spokesperson for Trump for three days in that case. Trump continued to pose as \\"Barron\\" on occasion for the rest of the decade. In 1983 \\"Barron\\" told the press that Trump had decided not to purchase the Cleveland Indians. In May 1984, \\"Barron\\" lied to then-Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg about Trump's wealth and assets to get Trump on the Forbes 400 list. \\"Barron\\" stated to Greenberg that \\"[m]ost of the assets [of Donald's father Fred Trump] have been consolidated to Mr. [Donald] Trump.\\" In April 2018, Greenberg retrieved and made public the original audio recordings of his exchange with \\"Barron\\", and stated that \\"Trump, through this [Barron] sockpuppet, was telling me he owned 'in excess of 90 percent'\\" of Fred Trump's assets. Ultimately, Greenberg included Trump at the end of the Forbes 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which \\"Barron\\" was claiming as Donald Trump's net worth. According to Greenberg, Donald Trump was only ever worth just under $5 million, which was 5% of the net worth which was attributed to him by Forbes at the time and only 1% of what \\"Barron\\" was claiming. Greenberg has corrected the record by stating that, as revealed in court documents in proceedings years later, Donald Trump never owned any of Fred Trump's assets until 1999 after Fred's death, and even then, inheriting only his share of Fred's deceased estate, with Donald Trump's three siblings and some grandchildren beneficiaries inheriting their corresponding shares. Also in 1984, \\"Barron\\" gave the press a positive spin on the 1984 collapse of a plan to build Trump Castle in New York. In 1985, \\"Barron\\" urged fellow United States Football League team owners to partially reimburse Trump for a high-priced player. In April 1985, \\"John Baron, a vice president in the Trump Organization,\\" announced to the press that the Trump Organization had signed an agreement to buy an unopened Hilton Hotel in Atlantic City. Trump stopped using the pseudonym after he was compelled to testify in court proceedings that ‚ÄúJohn Barron‚Äù was one of his pseudonyms. The Washington Post suggested that Trump might have used the pseudonym longer if not for the ‚Äúlawsuit in which he testified, under oath in 1990, that 'I believe on occasion I used that name.'\\" \\"John Miller\\" (1991) In 1991, a reporter for People attempted to interview Trump about the end of his marriage to Ivana Trump and his rumored association with other women. She was called back by a publicist who gave his name as \\"John Miller\\", who gave her a long interview about Trump's marital affairs (\\"He's a good guy, and he's not going to hurt anybody. ... He treated his wife well and ... he will treat Marla well.\\"), his attractiveness to women, and his wealth. The reporter thought at the time that \\"Miller\\" sounded remarkably like Trump, and played the tape to several people who knew Trump and agreed it was Trump. She says Trump later told her it was a \\"joke gone awry\\". Trump denied that he posed as John Miller to tell People, \\"[Madonna] called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you.\\" In 2016, The Washington Post obtained a copy of the tape and reported that it was Trump using a pseudonym. Trump denied it, saying, \\"It was not me on the phone.\\" Later, when a reporter asked Trump if he had ever employed a spokesperson named John Miller, he hung up. \\"Carolin Gallego\\" (1992) A 1992 letter to New York Magazine signed by \\"Carolin Gallego\\" replied to an article by Julie Baumgold. The letter asserted that \\"as his secretary\\" she knew Trump to treat women with respect. This letter resurfaced in a 2017 article in the Washingtonian which highlighted similarities between patterns of repetition in Trump's speech and the final line in the letter, which read: \\"I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him. The most beautiful women, the most successful women‚Äîall women love Donald Trump.\\" The Washingtonian was unable to find any record of a Carolin Gallego as secretary to Trump. \\"David Dennison\\" (2016) The name \\"David Dennison\\" was used as a pseudonym for Trump by his personal lawyer Michael Cohen in a 2016 pre-election non-disclosure agreement with pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels (born Stephanie Gregory Clifford and identified in the document as Peggy Peterson) regarding her allegation that she and Trump had an extramarital affair in 2006. Keith Davidson acted as Stormy Daniels‚Äô legal representative in that agreement. A later legal representative of Daniels, Michael Avenatti, later claimed that Davidson was a double agent all along working for Trump and Cohen. The same pseudonyms were also later used in a similar 2016 pre-election agreement involving payment for the silence of Playboy Playmate model Shera Bechard about an alleged extramarital affair, with a consequent pregnancy and subsequent abortion, between \\"Dennison\\" and \\"Peterson\\". That agreement was also drafted by Trump's personal lawyer Cohen, while Bechard was also represented by the same Keith Davidson who had negotiated Stormy Daniels‚Äô agreement with Trump. In Bechard's case, sources identified \\"Dennison\\" as Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy, who then acknowledged in an ambiguously worded statement that he had a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù (the nature of which was not specified) and that he made the $1.6 million payment to her after being made aware of her pregnancy. The phrasing of his statement also omitted any assertion that he was in fact the father of the unborn child. Some legal scholars and columnists have since speculated that Donald Trump was really the person who had the affair with Bechard. In popular culture Cartoonist Ruben Bolling occasionally satirizes Trump's use of John Barron in comics titled Donald and John: A Boy and His Imaginary Publicist. It is drawn as a homage to the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, about a boy with a rich fantasy life. In season 3, episode 5 of The Good Fight that airs on CBS All Access a character places a fake call to The Wall Street Journal using the name John Barron. This is followed by a musical interlude written by Jonathan Coulton and animated by Steve Angel explaining Trump‚Äôs use of the alias. the animated explanation of John Barron.

He is credited with having his band improve a trail from southeastern Kansas to the Great Salt Plains in present-day Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, to be used in seasonal migrations to summer hunting grounds. He is believed to have been given this name after fighting well as a young man against the Comanche. Manka-Chonka married and had one son (1827-1910). He was also called Black Dog and became a chief among the Osage in 1870. Chief Black Dog painted by George Catlin ca. 1843. Early life Black Dog I was born in 1780 near the Mississippi River and the site of the present-day city of St. Louis, Missouri. His birth name was Zhin-gawa-ca (or Shinka-Wah-Sa), meant Dark Eagle or Sacred Little One. About 1802 his people migrated and settled in the northeastern part of the present state of Oklahoma. His band set up a village they named Pasuga (Big Cedar), located on an ancient earthwork mound built by an earlier indigenous culture. After fighting well as a young warrior against the raiding Comanche in that region, Zhin-gawa-ca was given a new name, Manka-Chonka, meaning Black Dog. It was customary for the Osage to be given new names to reflect such major passages in life.Self, Burl E. \\"Black Dog (ca. 1780 - 1848),\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed July 20, 2016. Chief Black Dog was a contemporary of, and shared power in the tribe with, two other noted chiefs: Clermont (Claremore) and Pawhuska. Osage men were typically described as very tall and physically well-built. Black Dog was apparently even more imposing than most, since he was described as nearly tall and weighing at least . He was reportedly blind in his left eye. He is believed to have led one of the larger bands. His men completed what became known as the Black Dog Trail by 1803. It started from their winter territory east of Baxter Springs in Kansas and extended southwest to their summer hunting grounds at the Great Salt Plains in present-day Alfalfa County, Oklahoma.Burl E. Self, \\"Black Dog\\" , Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 5 Nov 2009 The Osage regularly stopped at the springs for healing on their way to summer hunting grounds. They made the trail by clearing it of brush and large rocks, and constructing earthen ramps to the fords. Wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast, the trail was the first improved road in Kansas and Oklahoma.Louis F. Burns, \\"Osage\\" , Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 5 Nov 2009 The band had a village known as Pasuga, \\"Big Cedar\\", built on an earthwork mound near what later developed as Claremore, Oklahoma. Osage tradition credits Black Dog I with having constructed a cave near his village on Claremore Mound. The cave was large enough to conceal the nearly 500 members of his band and they stocked it with enough food to survive for a year. The cave later provided a hiding place for the remaining residents of Pasuga to escape being massacred by during the so-called Battle of Claremore Mound in 1817.Tracy Phillips, \\"Chief Black Dog ‚Äì The Builder\\", Kansas Mediocrity blog, 31 July 2011; Accessed July 24, 2016.

The Macina Liberation Front, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the ethnic Fula (or Fulani; ) militant group 'National Alliance for the Protection of Fulani Identity and the Restoration of Justice' (ANSIPRJ) claimed joint responsibility.  Background  Following the 2011 Libyan Civil War, Tuaregs fighting in the Libyan Arab Republic's Libyan Army fled to northern Mali with large stockpiles of heavy weapons. The ensuing insurgency quickly led to the Azawadi declaration of independence and consequent armed Islamist insurgency by MOJWA and Ansar Dine against the secular MNLA. This led to Operation Serval being launched by France in January 2013, followed by Operation Barkhane in 2014 once major fighting was over. The country remained in a fragile state even after the French intervention, with militants attacking staging attacks in the capital Bamako as well as in Kidal during March 2015. In November of that same year a co-ordinated attack against the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako resulted in more than 20 casualties, most of them hostages. A week later militants attacked a MINUSMA base in Kidal, killing 3 and injuring dozens. Attacks continued at a steady pace during 2016. Militants attacked and briefly captured a MINUSMA police base in Timbuktu on February 5, killing a high- ranking Malian commander, while suffering four casualties themselves. On February 11 suspected Islamist militants attacked a customs post in the town of Mopti, central Mali, killing two civilians and a customs officer. A truck bombing at a MINUSMA base in Kidal killed at least 5 UN peacekeepers and injured more than 30 others on February 12. Gunmen attacked a military checkpoint in L√©r√© on February 24, killing at least three soldiers and wounding two others. On April 12 three French soldiers were killed and another was wounded when a bomb exploded under their vehicle near Tessalit. MINUSMA suffered two major attacks during May - five Chadian peacekeepers were killed and three others wounded in an ambush near Aguelhok on the 18th, while five Togolese soldiers were killed and another was injured in a similar attack near S√©var√© on the 29th. On June 1 four UN mission staff were killed in two separate mortar attacks near Gao, including a Chinese peacekeeper, as well as a French expert and two local security guards. Two Malian soldiers were killed in an attack near Dinangourou on July 10, while the deputy mayor of the Ouro Modi commune was shot on the following day in Mopti.  Attack  Islamist fighters in northern Mali The attack took place in the early hours of July 19, 2016, at a Malian Army camp near the town of Nimpala, in the rural commune of Nampalari near the border with Mauritania, about 500 km northeast of the capital Bamako. A group of heavily armed men reportedly overran the base, and set parts of it on fire, as Malian troops retreated to nearby Diabaly in order to regroup, according to Army spokesman Souleymane Maiga. The attackers also partially burned and looted the nearby town of Nampala, before fleeing. A group called the Macina Liberation Front, reportedly linked to Ansar Dine, initially claimed responsibility for the attack on social media. The same group had previously claimed several attacks on the army during 2015. Later a representative of ANSIPRJ contacted The Associated Press and claimed they had carried out the attack in response to attacks by government forces against Fula civilians. The group's spokesman Oumar Aldjana claimed they had gained possession of several trucks and stockpiles of ammunition, and that only three of the militants had been wounded during the assault. Malian Army spokesman Maiga later confirmed that three groups had staged the co-ordinated attack, with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb attacking from the north, the Macina Liberation Front waited in ambush outside town, and the ethnic Fula group joining from the southeast.  Reactions  Malian Ministry of Defense spokesman, Colonel Abdoulaye Sidib√©, briefs the press on a report about the attack. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta called a security meeting together with the country's Prime Minister Modibo Keita and the commanders of the Armed Forces. Defence Minister Ti√®man Hubert Coulibaly later appeared on state television to confirm the death toll, saying that the armed forces will \\"make sure that this coordinated terrorist attack ... is met with an appropriate response\\". On July 20 the government declared a three-day period of mourning for the 17 soldiers killed and extended a state of emergency for 10 days across the entire country.

Burton.E. Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia (1940-1960) pp. 587, 907 A member of the Byrd Organization, Stone was a member of the Boatwright Committee which investigated the NAACP as part of the Massive Resistance to racial integration vowed by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Early and family life Stone was borne in Stoneville, Rockingham County, North Carolina to Robert Tyler Stone (1865 - 1944) and his wife Mary Starling Hamlin Stone (1877 - 1965). He had at least four brothers who survived into the 1960s. William Stone received a LLB degree from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia in 1933. He received an LLM degree from the Atlanta Law School in Georgia in 1936. He married M. Ivey Courtney. During World War II, Stone served in the U.S. Navy, earning the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Upon returning home, he was active in his Presbyterian church, the Kiwanis, and the Virginia Bar, being elected its vice president in 1953 and serving on its board of law examiners beginning in 1955. Political career Stone served as Martinsville's city attorney from 1957 until 1958. He was also a director of the Piedmont Trust Bank. In 1954 he and William F. Carter won election as the two delegates from Henry and Patrick Counties and Martinsville; Willey R. Broaddus Jr. had previously represented Henry County and Martinsville. Stone was re-elected in 1955. When state senator Frank P. Burton died in 1957, Stone ran for the seat, and was elected, thus representing the district which included Danville, Martinsville as well as Henry, Patrick and Pittsylvania Counties along with incumbent Landon R. Wyatt. In the same 1957 general election, Robert Lybrook Clark and Henry County Commonwealth attorney Albert L. Philpott won election as the two delegates representing Henry and Patrick Counties and Martinsville. As part of Massive Resistance, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Stanley Plan in September 1956. Among the various laws were seven expanding the common law legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, as well as the statutory violation of unauthorized practice of law. The legislature then appointed two committees to investigate the NAACP, which was pursuing the legal cases to desegregate Virginia schools. The Speaker of the House of Delegates appointed John B. Boatwright to chair the new Committee on Offenses against the Administration of Justice, with Stone and J. J. Williams Jr. as members; the President of the Virginia Senate appointed two additional members, E. Almer Ames Jr. of Onancock and Earl A. Fitzpatrick of Roanoke (who became Vice-Chairman). Shortly after the January 1957 began, the committee issued letters requesting information from the NAACP as well as the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties and other segregationist organizations, and during the next month began subpoenaing NAACP membership lists. These activities prompted litigation (NAACP motions to quash the subpoenas) in Richmond and several Virginia counties. In March, the Boatwright Committee opined that various segregationist organizations did not commit the newly expanded legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, nor the unauthorized practice of law. However, the commission's report issued November 13, 1957 recommended enforcement of those laws against the various named NAACP lawyers.Report of the Committee on offenses against the administration of Justice, pp. 19, 20 The subpoenas and other activities soon reduced NAACP membership in Virginia by half, but two years later (with Stone remaining on the committee after his elevation to the senate) the committee issued another report and Boatwright complained that the Virginia State Bar was not punishing those lawyers but instead spending $5000 on a Jamestown commemoration and $6350 on a new continuing legal education program.Robert A.

After the 1942 season (also with Tokyo), Aota left professional baseball to serve in the Japanese military through 1945. He returned to the JBL in 1946 with the Hankyu Braves, for whom he played through the 1947 season. Upon joining the Yomiuri Giants (the renamed Tokyo Kyojin) in 1948, Aota became one of the league's top home run hitters. He was a Best Nine Award winner in 1948, winning the batting crown and the home run championship. He was again a Best Nine Award-winner in 1950, and in 1951 he led the Central League in home runs (32), RBI (105), and runs (101). He hit a home run in the 1951 Japan Series, when the Giants defeated the Nankai Hawks, 4 games to 2 for their first NPB championship. Aota joined the Taiyo-Shochiku Robins in 1953, and led the Central League in home runs in 1954 and 1956, and tied for the league lead in 1957. Aota retired in 1959 at age 34 as the Japanese professional baseball career leader with 265 career homers (he was surpassed in 1963 by Kazuhiro Yamauchi, the first Japanese professional baseball player to hit 300 home runs).\\"Yamauchi, NPB's 1st 300-HR man, dies at 76,\\" Yomiuri Shimbun (Feb. 6, 2009).

It was discovered in 2007 in samples of human respiratory secretions, originally from a child patient in Australia who presented with clinical signs of pneumonia and in whom other common respiratory viruses were not detected. Follow-up studies identified the presence of WU virus in respiratory secretion samples from patients in Australia and the United States, suggesting that, like other human polyomaviruses, WU virus is widely distributed. Discovery WU virus was discovered by shotgun sequencing of the nucleic acids found in the respiratory secretions of a young patient diagnosed with pneumonia in whom other known respiratory viruses had not been detected. Sequence homology was detected among the sequences found in the clinical sample and the known genomes of other human polyomaviruses. WU virus was one of two new human polyomaviruses discovered in 2007; the other was KI virus. Genome Genome structure of the WU virus. The complete genome of the WU virus has been sequenced and found to be a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 5229 base pairs containing genetic material characteristic of polyomaviruses, encoding five viral proteins: three capsid components, major capsid protein VP1, VP2, and VP3; and two additional proteins involved in replication, the large tumor antigen and small tumor antigen. Prevalence Although WU virus has been detected in a variety of locations around the world, indicating a global distribution, estimates of its prevalence vary. In the first report describing the virus, its DNA was detected in 0.7% of respiratory secretion samples in a population in St. Louis, Missouri and 3.0% of samples in Brisbane, Australia. Similar prevalence rates under 5% have been reported in various locations and populations, with some indication of age-dependence. By contrast, one 2009 study placed seroprevalence - that is, prevalence of antibodies against the virus (in this case the VP1 coat protein) - as high as 69% among a population of American adults and 54% among a population of American children. Another 2009 study found around 80% seroprevalence for adults, with age patterns indicating that infants may inherit maternal antibodies against both WU and KI. A 2016 study of polyomavirus seroprevalence found WU virus in 97.4% of samples from another American population. Primary infection is generally believed to occur in childhood. Disease association WU virus was originally discovered in respiratory secretions from a patient diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin. However, the overall rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses is high, and it is not clear that WU virus itself causes disease. WU virus has not been detected in urine, although many polyomaviruses infect the kidneys and urinary tract and one human polyomavirus, BK virus, is associated with nephropathy in renal transplant patients. Some polyomaviruses are well known as carcinogenic, including the human polyomavirus Merkel cell polyomavirus, but WU virus has also not been associated with cancer. While no clear association with clinical symptoms has been identified, there is weak indication that WU and KI viruses may have pathogenic potential in immunocompromised patients. Nomenclature and classification WU virus got its name from Washington University, the institutional affiliation of the researchers who discovered and reported the virus. As originally described, WU virus was most similar to KI virus and somewhat divergent from the other human polyomaviruses known at the time, JC virus and BK virus. A 2010 proposed classification recommended the division of the polyomaviruses into three genera, containing one genus of avian viruses and two of mammalian viruses; one of the latter was designated Wukipolyomavirus to indicate its two founding members. In an updated classification system for the polyomavirus family proposed in 2016, WU virus is classified as a member of the genus Betapolyomavirus along with BK, JC, and KI.

It is a small shrub with short upper branches, narrow leaves and yellow, feathery flowers, often with a star- like red centre. Description Verticordia rutilastra is an irregularly branched shrub with short upper branches, which grows to a height of and wide. Its leaves are linear in shape, long and more or less triangular in cross- section with a rounded end with a point. The flowers are arranged in corymb- like groups on the ends of the branches, each flower on an erect stalk long. The floral cup is about long, rough and glabrous. The sepals are about long, spreading, yellow at first, turning red with age with 8 to 10 feathery lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the petals but change colour earlier, so that the red appears to spread from the centre of the flower. The petals are about long, spreading, with long, pointed, finger-like lobes. The style is very short and straight. Flowering time is from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia rutilastra was first formally described by Alex George in 1991, and the description was published in Nuytsia. George gave the specific epithet \\"from the Latin rutilus (red with a metallic lustre) and aster (a star), in reference to the appearance of the flower as it ages and turns red; the petals change first and together appear \\"star-like\\". George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Unguiculata, along with V. nobilis and V. grandiflora. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sand, often with loam, clay, or gravel in heath, often with other verticordia species on rocky hills. It occurs in an area between the Lesueur National Park, Alexander Morrison National Park, and Moora in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia rutilastra is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture Verticordia rutilastra is usually propagated from cuttings and although slow to establish has been grown in deep white sand with added gravel.

A. J. Bidwell, was an English-born architect noted for his colonial era buildings in Singapore. His best-known works include the Raffles Hotel and the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall in Singapore, and Sultan Abdul Samad Building in Kuala Lumpur. Early life Regent Alfred John Bidwell was born in 1869. He received his architectural training with Lockyer, Son, & Cox, of London, and he became a member of the Architectural Association, and was placed on the honours list of this institution for design. Career Sultan Abdul Samad Building, first major work by Bidwell Bidwell started work as an assistant to a succession of architects: Crikmay & Son, W. H. Woodroffe of London, and the superintending architect of the London County Council. In 1893 Bidwell left England to go to Malaya after he was nominated for appointment by Sir Charles Gregory to work for the Public Works Department (PWD) of Selangor. Bidwell was involved in the design of Kuala Lumpur's public buildings and other works, the most important of which is the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. The building was originally designed by A.C. Norman who drew the ground plan with Bidwell designing the elevation in a Classic Renaissance style. However, the State Engineer of Selangor PWD Charles Edwin Spooner disliked the design, and he instructed Bidwell to rework the building in an Indo-Saracenic or Neo-Mughal on Norman's ground plan. Although the building is formally credited to A.C. Norman (and only his name appears on the foundation stone as the architect), the actual appearance of the building is largely the work of R. A. J. Bidwell with contributions from A. B. Hubback who also worked on the building after Bidwell left. =Work in Singapore= Raffles Hotel In April 1895, Bidwell resigned from the Selangor PWD to join Swan and Maclaren in Singapore. He became a partner of the firm in 1899, and Bidwell designed most of the buildings by Swan and Maclaren during his time at the firm. In 1903 he was elected a fellow of the Surveyors' Institute. Bidwell designed some of the most significant colonial-era buildings of Singapore such as the Raffles Hotel. He also helped developed a style of building termed Black and White House which is an adaptation of the traditional English homes that show influences from the Tudorbethan style and Arts and Crafts movement to suit a tropical environment. His design for W. Patchitt House at Cluny Road in 1903 started a trend for building such houses. Bidwell ceased to be a partner of Swan and Maclaren by 1915, but continued to practice for a few more years. He died on 6 April 1918 in Tanjong Katong after a period of illness.

On December 4, 1995, Zamora and her ex-fianc√©, David Graham, murdered Adrianne Jessica Jones, who Zamora believed was a romantic rival for Graham; he had claimed that he had given her a ride home and had sex with her one-month earlier. Enraged, Zamora demanded that Graham kill Jones. In the early morning of December 4, Graham picked up Jones in Zamora's car, while she hid in the hatchback. They went to a remote location and got into a struggle. Zamora hit Jones over the head with weights, and Graham shot her twice after she broke away from them. Following the murder, Graham was at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, while Zamora was at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Zamora confessed the crime to her roommates, which ultimately led to notification of the local police in Texas. Both Zamora and Graham were arrested on September 6, 1996. There were separate trials, which resulted in guilty verdicts. Zamora and Graham are serving life sentences for the murder. Zamora's attorney filed an appeal in 2005, stating that prosecution withheld the information that Graham did not give Jones a ride after the meet, and probably did not have sex with Jones. Murder of Adrianne Jones = Background = Diane Zamora and David Graham met at a Civil Air Patrol meeting at Spinks Airport, near Crowley, Texas, when they were 14-year-olds. Zamora said she wanted to be an astronaut and Graham wanted to be a pilot. They began dating about four years later in August 1995, when they were both high school honor students. Zamora was a student at Crowley High School, and Graham was a student at Mansfield High School. About a month after they began dating, Zamora and Graham announced their engagement to their families. They planned to marry after their college graduations. Graham went to school with Adrianne Jones, who was on the cross- country track team with him. Jones, whose nickname was A.J., was also an honor student. She had plans to attend Texas A&M; University and was interested in becoming a behavioral analyst. Her family included her mother Linda; her father Bill and two brothers. Graham claimed that on November 4 he had given Jones a ride home from a regional meet and that during the ride he stopped the car and they had sex. During her confession to police, Zamora said that she believed it was this night when Graham came over to her house, carrying a stuffed animal and having \\"this look in his eyes that was horrible, he looked so scared.\\" In Zamora's confession, she said that about a month later she questioned Graham about other girls, including Jones. They got into a fight when he pressed her to study for the SAT. Graham then said that he had not had sex only with her, but also had sex with Jones. Zamora began screaming and hitting her head against the floor, shouting, \\"Kill her, kill her.\\" She said that beginning December 2, they tried to get in touch with Jones and Graham continually tried to calm Zamora down. Graham said in 2008 that Zamora told him that she would kill herself or leave him if he did not kill Jones. Although they were goal-driven and intelligent, Zamora and Graham each had issues \\"beneath the surface\\" that were reflected at times in their behavior. Court TV said that, \\"from a surface view, no one would have expected that Diane and David would become a lethal combination. Although they both continued to advance in the military, their single-minded quests for recognition covered up deep-rooted problems leading to obsession and murder.\\" = The crime = Joe Pool Lake, Dallas, Tarrant and Ellis Counties, Texas According to Graham, he and Zamora planned to kill Jones and put her in a lake with weights tied to her body. He called Jones on the night of December 3, 1995, and arranged to drive her to Joe Pool Lake while Zamora hid in the hatchback of her car. Zamora said in her confession that they arrived at a spot by the lake after 12:30 a.m. on December 4. She said that when Graham stopped the car she came out from the hatchback and asked Jones if she had sex with Graham. She claimed Jones said that she had, but hadn't enjoyed it because she felt guilty. Zamora became enraged. Zamora and Graham both said in their confessions that they got into a struggle, Zamora hit Jones on the head with the weights, and Jones fought back. She got out of the car and ran into a field. Graham shot her twice with a 9mm handgun after she fell down. According to Zamora's confession, when he returned to the car, Graham said, \\"I love you, baby, do you believe me now?\\" Shortly thereafter, Zamora asked what they had just done, to which David answered, \\"I don't know. I can't believe we just did that.\\" They cleaned up and/or disposed of their bloody clothes and went home. Zamora and Graham each said that she then cleaned her car that had blood in it, and that at that time Graham was vomiting. She wrote in her calendar for the day, \\"Adrianne 1:38 a.m.\\" = The investigation and arrest= Jones' body was found in an open field on Seeton Road, near Joe Pool Lake, on December 4. She was brought in to the medical examiner as a Jane Doe. It did not appear that she had been sexually assaulted, but it was clear that she had been shot and had \\"blunt traumatic head injury\\". The shooter had stood within a few feet of Jones when pulling the trigger. The second bullet was fired when the killer stood right over her, hitting her right between the eyes. Her body was positively identified to be the missing Adrianne Jones when the medical examiner received a photograph of Jones. After the murder Graham went to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and Zamora went to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. While there she confessed to the murder to her two roommates, who contacted the authorities at the academy. The Grand Prairie police were then contacted, and Zamora and Graham were arrested for capital murder on September 6, 1996. They were held in the Tarrant County Jail. Graham was interrogated for 30 hours, during which he confessed to killing Jones. Zamora also confessed to the murder during her interrogation by the police. The key details of the event were similar; each said that Jones was killed because Graham had sex with her, she was taken to a remote lake, and she was hit over the head by Zamora and shot twice by Graham. Both later recanted their confessions. Graham said that he was not guilty of killing Jones, but helped cover up the murder, which he claimed Zamora committed by herself. Zamora claimed that Graham committed the murder by himself. A 9mm handgun, alleged to be the murder weapon, was found in the attic, which could be reached through David Graham's bedroom. The police had investigated the case for nine months. Law enforcement officials associated with the case have stated that the sexual encounter between Graham and Jones did not happen, but was invented by Graham. Sgt. Alan Patton of the Grand Prairie Police Department stated: \\"For those who don't remember, this was a totally brutal, unnecessary murder. David had lied to Diane about an alleged sexual tryst that never happened with Adrianne Jones. If he had said, 'I was just kidding, I was just trying to make you jealous', Adrianne Jones would still be alive today.\\" However, Graham has since admitted that his original confession was accurate and the only reason he lied about the sexual encounter not happening was because of his defense lawyer's advice. = The trial = Zamora's two-week trial began in February 1998 in Fort Worth with Judge Joe Drago presiding. Linda Jones, Adrianne's mother, asked that the death penalty be removed as a sentencing option from both trials. During the trial, Zamora admitted to being at the scene of the crime, but denied participating in the killing of Jones. The Naval Academy Midshipmen to whom Zamora confessed and another witness stated that she showed no remorse over Jones' death. The case received national media attention, providing Court TV with some of its highest ratings ever in its film coverage of the trial. Some of the interest centered on whether Zamora was the submissive victim or the jealous driving force behind the murder. Under Texas law, murder is the intentional killing of another human being, while capital murder includes murder with an underlying felony of kidnapping, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, or obstruction. In this case, the prosecutor believed that Jones was deceptively lured from her home by Graham asking her for a bogus date, or she would not have been in the car. Moreover, the couple committed obstruction when Zamora allegedly ordered Graham to stalk Jones into the field and to shoot her so that she could not tell the authorities. The jury was asked to deliberate on the charges of capital murder or the lesser charges of assault, kidnapping, or false imprisonment. On February 17, 1998, after more than six hours of deliberations over two days, the jury found Zamora guilty of capital murder in the death of Adrianne Jones. Because of the Jones family's request that prosecutors not seek the death penalty against her, Zamora received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and would be eligible for parole after 40 years. On July 24, 1998, after a separate trial, a jury found Graham guilty of capital murder. During the trial, Wendy Bartlett, also on the track team, and Coach Lee Ann Burke stated that Bartlett was the one who drove Jones home after the meet on November 4, and that Graham had left earlier, leaving Jones and Bartlett to put away equipment from the meet. Graham did not drive Jones home on the night he claimed to have had sex with her, lending credence to his later recantation. However, he ultimately repudiated his recantation, saying his lawyer had pressured him to lie, and again claimed to have had sex with Jones. Adding that to Zamora's story about Jones admitting to having had sex with Graham when Zamora asked her about it just before the murder, it might be that Graham and Jones had sex at some other time. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. David Richards, Zamora's attorney, used the testimony from Bartlett and Burke as the basis of an appeal for Zamora. The petition, made in 2005, stated that the prosecution withheld this information during Zamora's trial. \\"From these witnesses, the state knew, and should have known, that the testimony it sponsored in support of a sexual encounter between Jones and Graham was probably false.\\" Due to the prominence of the case, in 2015 Tarrant County, authorities chose to keep the paper court documents of the case as historical documents even though they have been digitized. = Incarceration = Mountain View Unit, Gatesville, Texas, where Zamora was imprisoned Zamora was transferred from a jail in Fort Worth, Texas to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She was initially held in a state prison diagnostic unit in Gatesville, Texas in February 1998, then held at the Murray Unit, also in Gatesville. At one point she was held in protective custody at Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, but she was later moved to the general prison population in the William P. Hobby Unit near Marlin. she is back in protective custody in Mountain View. Zamora, opposed to her placement, filed a civil rights complaint with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the complaint was dismissed.  The Allred Unit is actually in the city limits of Wichita Falls. Graham was held at the Ellis Unit near Huntsville after the trial. In 2016 he was held at the Darrington Unit near Rosharon. he is held at the Allred Unit in Wichita Falls. He is currently enrolled at the Southwest Baptist Theological Seminary's inmate seminary in order to become a pastor behind bars. In 2008, Graham said that his confession to the police was correct and expressed remorse for killing Jones. He also said that if he had it to do over again he would have pleaded guilty to murder.  Marriage  Zamora got to know Steven Mora, a fellow Texas inmate, through the mail. He had committed auto theft and burglary and was in prison for threatening someone related to one of his cases. Although they never met in person, the two decided to get married and petitioned Bexar County for a marriage license in 2003. A wedding ceremony was performed on June 17, 2003. Zamora's mother and a male friend stood in for the imprisoned couple in the county's first proxy marriage, which was performed by a judge in San Antonio. They were divorced in or around 2008.  2007 interview  Zamora was interviewed by Stone Phillips on Dateline in a show broadcast in April 2007. Her appeals were exhausted, and with her lawyer's permission she took a polygraph test administered by Dateline. Her new story was that Graham and she had been breaking up, and that Graham was using the murder to \\"tie her to him\\". She noted that she obstructed justice by cleaning the car afterwards and was an accessory after the fact; however, Zamora pointed out that the jury had convicted her of intending to kill Jones, which she denied. When she took the polygraph, the administrator repeatedly told her to stop her exaggerated breathing, a counter-measure for such tests. He said that he believed he had enough to actually say that Zamora had failed the crucial question on whether she had intended to kill Jones. Two other independent polygraph administrators, who were not at the test, were contacted by Dateline and asked to review the results; they said that they could offer no opinion due to counter-measures. Zamora responded to Phillips that she was nervous and hyperventilating despite being told all the questions in advance and reviewing them with the administrator before the test.  Popular culture  * In 1996, Ellise Pierce of the Dallas Observer wrote that the crime \\"has become part of Mansfield teen folklore; kids obsess about the details of the crime as if they were unraveling a plot from The X-Files.\\" * Before Zamora's trial began, the case was the subject of a 1997 made-for-television movie called Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder. Zamora was played by Holly Marie Combs. * Two books were written about the case. :* :The Cold Case first-season episode \\"Love Conquers Al\\" is based on this murder.

The prime objective of the organization is to make Kizhakkambalam Grama Panchayat the best Grama Panchayat in India by the year 2020. This organization won the unique distinction of winning the elections in the local body elections in 2015 and made Kizhakkambalam the first corporate ruled town of Kerala state. History Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam is promoted by the Kitex Group, a garment manufacturing company local to the area. The interference in many charity activities by competing political parties forced Twenty20 to contest elections. This organization won 17 out of 19 seats and secured the administration of the town. According to Sabu M Jacob, the Managing Director of Kitex Garments, the victory was because of the failure of the political system. Kitex is a garment exporting company founded by the Anna-Kitex group in 1960. The company exports to the tune of 750 Crore Indian rupees. They supply clothes to American and European countries and the company is listed as one of the best Asian companies by Forbes. Controversy The acquisition of the town by Kitex is seen as a threat to democracy. P. Rajeev, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) says, \\"It‚Äôs a corporate takeover of the panchayat; it‚Äôs a threat to democracy, the Kitex company now pays monthly salaries to the panchayat president and the council members, by accepting the salaries, the elected representatives of the village have reduced themselves to be the company‚Äôs employees.\\" According to Sebastian Paul MP, the company is into charity to evade serious charges of environmental pollution. According to environmental activist C. R. Neelakantan, the company's motive behind the social service was suspicious because the company has violated many environmental safeguards. But the company promises that, if they can run a company worth millions, then they can install advanced technologies to treat the waste water. Criticism from corporations According to some Indian management experts, industrialists have no business directly running a village. They fear that it will start an unhealthy trend. Development activities Twenty20 has taken lead in providing drinking water to the people of Kizhakkambalam. They have also taken interest in making toilets; repairing houses; sponsoring surgeries and wedding; building places of worship and donating seeds and agricultural implements. The organization runs a grocery shop in Kizhakkambalam supplying vegetables and groceries at half the market price. 7,000 families are visiting the market regularly to buy provisions.  Anti alcohol movement  Twenty20 promised to make Kizhakkambalam an alcohol free village. This was the main offer of the organization during the election campaign in November, 2015. And they kept their word by closing down the only beverage outlet available in this area.  Multi specialty hospital  Twenty20 has promised the people that by year 2020 Kizhakkambalam will have a multi specialty hospital in the heart of the town, which people could afford at cheap rates.

He is the current chairman of the Sheung Shui Rural Committee, ex officio executive committee member of the Heung Yee Kuk and ex officio member of the North District Council. Family and early life Hau is born in Ho Sheung Heung, Sheung Shui, New Territories in Hong Kong into the Hau clan, one of the five great clans in the New Territories in 1956. His father was a sailor and his mother was a farmer. He was the eldest of seven siblings. Hau got a job as a dockworker when he was just 13 and was convicted of theft when he was 18. Hau travelled around Britain, the Netherlands and the United States for 10 years. He opened a Chinese restaurant in Chicago when he was 20 and later made his fortune by buying and selling restaurants. He returned to Hong Kong in the 1980s and started a business exporting goldfish and bloodworms which brought him HK$1 million per month. He later turned into property. Political career Hau had been the indigenous inhabitant representative of Ho Sheung Heung from 1999 until 2011, when he ran as a resident representative of the same village in the village representative election. As a village representative, Hau sat on the Sheung Shui Rural Committee and became chairman of the rural committee since 2007. As the chairman of the rural committee, he has also been ex officio member of the North District Council. In 2011, he defeated horse trainer Brian Kan by 44 to 16 votes to retain his post as chairman. Kan was later found out engaging in corrupt conduct during an election. It was revealed in the court that Hau had recorded some of Kan's meetings in which the bribery was taken place and even had a video recording. Hau is a vociferous supporter of the government's controversial plans to establish a new town in northeast New Territories. His clan owns 93 hectares of land in Kwu Tung North, and would receive more than HK$5 billion in compensation for development. He had also declared repeatedly that even the Hau clan's ancestral hall could be sold for the right price. Hau dismisses farmers who refuse to vacate the land as unscrupulous squatters. He was sued by an 85-year-old farmer Lau Oi-kiu in 2015 of dumping waste on her farmland in Ho Sheung Heung to drive her off in 2009. Hau was branded \\"contemptuous of the law\\" and had to pay Lau HK$1.41 million in compensation. As the chairman of the Sheung Shui Rural Committee, Hau is an ex officio executive committee member of the Heung Yee Kuk, a powerful organ which oversees 600 villages and 1,500 village chiefs and represents the rural interests. He fiercely attacks calls for the government to end its Small House Policy, which allows male descendants of indigenous residents to apply to build a village house of up to three-storeys, on a site of no more than 700 square feet, without paying a premium for conversion of land use. He also once called middle-aged professionals who have yet to own property as \\"useless basketcases\\" which caused public uproar. In 2015, Hau planned to form a new political party with other like-minded rural leaders independent from the Kuk for the 2016 Legislative Council election, due to his dissatisfaction over the Kuk's handling of the case of 11 Sha Tin villagers selling their own land rights under the Small House Policy for profit. He also dissatisfied with the pro- Beijing allies which he argued that they had not always spoken up for the villagers' interests. However, his plan was opposed by other faction in the Kuk. The inauguration ceremony of the New Progressive Alliance was cancelled in the last minute. He later quit the Liberal Party and ran as an independent in the election.

Originally founded by the 9/11 nonprofit MyGoodDeed (d.b.a. 9/11 Day), the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance later became federally recognized and authorized as a Day of Service passage of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which was adopted on a bipartisan basis by the U.S. Congress in 2009. Later that year, President Barack Obama amended the Patriot Day Presidential Proclamation, first established by President George W. Bush, officially designating September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. Surveys conducted by MyGoodDeed claim that approximately 35 million Americans observe 9/11 Day by engaging in some form of charitable service, making 9/11 Day the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States. The September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, are the only Days of Service officially recognized and established under federal law and Presidential Proclamation. Purpose According to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, the purpose of the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance is to transform the anniversary of 9/11 from a day of tragedy into a day of doing good. \\"We wanted to make sure the terrorists didn;t have the last word in forever defining for generations to how America would remember and observe 9/11,\\" said 9/11 Day and MyGoodDeed co-founder David Paine. \\"We wanted instead to honor the victims and those who rose in service by keeping alive the spirit of unity and service that arose in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\\" History The idea of turning September 11 into an annual day of service was originally conceived in early 2002 by David Paine, at that time a public relations executive who had grown up in New York City. Later that year, David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk to form the nonprofit group One Day's Pay. Jay's younger brother Glenn J. Winuk, at attorney at Holland & Knight LLP, and a volunteer firefighter affiliated with the Jericho Fire Department, had been killed in the line of duty while participating in the rescue efforts. He was killed when the World Trade Center South Tower Collapsed. Glenn's remains were found approximately six months later, in what remained of the South Tower Lobby area, alongside other first responders, with a medic kit he had borrowed on the scene. In 2007, the name of the organization was changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2011, in observance of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed joined with other national service organizations in helping to organize what was then considered to be the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 30 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage over 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.About Us, 911day.org, published by MyGoodDeed, accessed July 20, 201611th National Day of Service and Remembrance, Serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016Day of Service and Remembrance 2011, Pointsoflight.org, published by the Points of Light Foundation, accessed July 20, 2016 Activities Activities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance have traditionally happened largely on a grassroots level across the nation, through service projects organized by local nonprofits, employers, and faith groups and others. Many people share their plans and messages through social media on 9/11 using the hashtag #911Day. Additionally many schools and students now engage in service-related activities as part of lessons about the history of 9/11 Day. Beginning in 2016, MyGoodDeed started organizing its own, large-scale service projects in major cities. These events are known as 9/11 Day Meal Packs, where volunteers from local organizations and companies spend time during the day on 9/11 assembling non-perishable meals for people who are food insecure. MyGoodDeed typically partners with local volunteer service organizations and Feeding America-affiliated food banks to put on these events. In 2019, approximately 10,000 volunteers participated at eight 9/11 Day Meal Packs, assembling 3.1 million meals that were then donated to people in need. MyGoodDeed has said it plans to establish 9/11 Meal Packs in as many as 20 cities in time for the 20th Anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in 2021.

The film presents a futuristic fictional scenario in which Kurdish asylum seekers are attacked with biological weapons in a Glasgow suburb and details the results on the community affected, the council team supporting them, the local authorities and emergency services involved in the crisis, the greater public impact and the medical staff that struggle to cope with the influx of victims. The film attracted much controversy, with Glasgow Council considering a ban on the broadcasting of the film, but won three awards for its screenplay, including the British Independent Film Awards.  Plot  On a pig farm in Scotland, a recording is made of the livestock present at the farm, of which a large number are dead or dying from an unknown illness. Nationwide, Britain is experiencing an intense period of racial tension, with extremist groups clashing with police forces across the country and rioting taking place in major cities, the most severe being in Glasgow. Some Scottish politicians attribute the deteriorating relations to a recent influx of Kurdish asylum seekers in Glasgow, supported by local authorities and handled by the Asylum Seeker Resettlement Project, which they claim is unwanted by the British public and has resulted in a backlash by disaffected citizens. One such asylum seeker, Sherko Hussein (Sherko Zen- Aloush) struggles to make a living with his illegally underpaid job, having moved from Iraq with his daughter Resa (Benae Hussein) to northern Glasgow. While in a shopping centre with Resa, he notices that Resa has developed a bad cough and is unwell. He asks ASRP worker Robina Dhoody (Robina Qureshi), assigned to the Husseins, to watch his daughter while he goes out to work, to which she reluctantly agrees. Noticing the poor conditions in which they are living, Robina becomes concerned about Resa's health, and convinces Sherko to take her to Broomyhill Infirmary. Doctor Annie Millbrook (Morag Calder) diagnoses Resa with acute influenza and prescribes antibiotics to her and admits Resa to the ward. Robina notices that the hospital is inundated with large numbers of other asylum seekers from the same block of flats that the Husseins live in, all presenting with similar flu-like symptoms. However, she is met with a cool response when she encourages Sherko to complain to the authorities, who is fearful he will be discriminated against because of his migrant status and deported back to Iraq, and he implies that Robina does not care or understand their plight, which offends her. Glasgow Central Police receive an anonymous email with imagery of dead livestock and other threatening media. The force ignores the email. Meanwhile, a neighbour of the Husseins, Hamaz Mohammed, suddenly deteriorates and despite attempts to revive him, dies from his illness. This concerns the Kurdish community, who worry a similar fate awaits their affected members, and confuses the medical staff treating the asylum seekers, who order a postmortem and hold a meeting with the families of the asylum seekers to reassure them. Robina becomes suspicious about the circumstances of Hamaz's death and becomes convinced that the conditions in which the asylum seekers live is attributable to Hamaz's death. However, she is warned by her superior Bill Grigson (Laurie Ventry) to fall in with the official angle and that investigating her \\"wildcat\\" theories will be both fruitless and unhelpful to the situation. Despite this, she becomes determined to act when at the public meeting, Millbrook and other officials accidentally reveal that Hamaz died of an unknown infection and that it could be a serious viral pathogen such as TB, exacerbated by Robina mentioning TB which is picked up by the interpreter and disseminated to the community. Robina is convinced that the asylum seekers contracted TB by way of infectious animal ash being blown from an incinerator north of the high-rise flats the Kurdish live in. She attempts to break into the compound discreetly, but is caught by the security firm guarding the facility and removed. Grigson asks her to focus on her job of integrating asylum seekers and to allow the medical staff to treat the contagion without her interference, warning that the council will not tolerate repeated maverick actions. However, Robina ignores this and immediately returns to Broomyhill to interrogate Millbrook. Overnight, police and racial groups and protesters clash in heavy riots across the UK, particularly in the Glasgow area, and emergency services struggle to maintain order as the social unrest escalates. At Broomyhill, patients begin to make decisive recoveries and Millbrook begins to discharge the asylum seekers. However, she remains concerned at the unusual pathology and the death of Hamaz. While waiting for the postmortem results, she investigates possible causes of the illness experienced by the Kurdish. She eventually reaches an alarming conclusion; it is possible that Hamaz has been killed by anthrax bacteria. This is confirmed by the postmortem of Hamaz. Grigson learns of Robina's illegal activity in investigating the illness and warns that further scaremongering regarding the epidemic will result in her being sacked. More emails are sent to Glasgow Central, which fails to act despite the threats communicated to them in the email. An emergency outbreak control team is assembled consisting of personnel from all of the relevant departments; however, the NHS chief executive is adamant that the mounting threat of an anthrax attack be censored from the press, worrying at the public panic and the resulting collapse of the already overstretched infrastructure, and the team are ineffectual in responding to the threat of the illness, treating the potential outbreak as an isolated case and investigating nearby agricultural facilities for sources of anthrax outbreaks, believing that Hamaz may have contracted the virus from moonlighting cheap farm labour. However, this is leaked to the media, which begins to make a connection between the Kurdish epidemic and the illness References 2001 films 2001 drama films Films set in Glasgow Biological weapons in popular culture ","title":"Gas Attack"},{"id":"51125279","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 2098 was adopted in 2013.

Both churches hold the Holy Leaven to be one of their seven sacraments. There are two rituals associated with the Holy Leaven: its addition to sacramental bread before it is baked, and the annual renewal of the Holy Leaven itself. The origin of the Holy Leaven supposedly goes back to the Last Supper. According to various traditions, John the Apostle kept a piece of bread given to him by Jesus and later mixed it with Jesus' blood after his death. This substance was divided between the apostles to be used in preparing sacramental bread ever since and successfully brought to the Christians of the East. The earliest historical mention of the Holy Leaven is from c. 900, and tradition that connects it with the Last Supper is fairly new, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries. It is likely that the Holy Leaven is a symbol instituted to unify congregations by the Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon during vast missionary expansion of the Church of the East. Preparation and use The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East use leavened bread for the Eucharist, like most churches of Eastern Christianity, but they are the only Churches to include the additional ingredient of Holy Leaven. Holy Leaven is a powder added to sacramental bread before it is baked. Despite the name, Holy Leaven does not actually contain a leavening agent. Instead, khmira, fermented dough from previously used sacramental bread, is added and acts as leaven. What the Holy Leaven does contain is remainder from the original Holy Leaven, renewed annually by mixing it with common ingredients. The original Holy Leaven is said to contain residue from the original bread used at the Last Supper, mixed with the blood of Jesus. The Church believes that this Holy Leaven was handed down to believers by Thomas the Apostle (Mar Thoma), Thaddeus of Edessa (Mar Addai) and Saint Mari (Mar Mari), traditionally regarded as its founders. There are two rituals associated with the Holy Leaven: its addition to sacramental bread being baked for the day's Eucharist, and the annual renewal of the Holy Leaven itself. When sacramental bread is baked for the Eucharist, in the morning of a Holy Communion, the priest takes some of the Holy Leaven and says: \\"This dough is signed and hallowed with the old and holy leaven of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Thoma the Apostles, who made disciples of this eastern region: in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost ... This broken portion is signed and hallowed with this Holy Leaven in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\\" Holy Leaven is added to the dough before it is baked. The Holy Leaven is renewed annually on Passover Thursday by a bishop or parish priest by mixing some of the old Holy Leaven with a new mix. The mix consists of fine wheaten flour, salt, olive oil, and water. There are many prayers associated with the renewal of the Holy Leaven. History Extent of Church of the East in the Middle Ages. Vast missionary activities of the church called for symbols of unity, and Holy Leaven might have emerged as one. Nestorius portrayed as a heretic. According to one legend, Nestorius took all the Holy Leaven with him and that is the real reason for his condemnation by Western Christianity. The historical origins of the Holy Leaven are unknown, as is the time the rituals were first performed. Nonetheless, different versions of tradition about its origins exist. In any case, the traditions are fairly young, dating to 13th and 14th centuries, the time of the Church of the East, the predecessor of the Ancient Church of the East and the modern Assyrian Church of the East. One account is from the 13th century by Shlemon of Basra. According to it, John the Apostle had hidden a part of the portion of bread he had received from Jesus during the Last Supper. Then, after Jesus' resurrection during the Gospel account of Doubting Thomas, when Thomas the Apostle put his finger into one of the wounds of Jesus inflicted by the spear, blood dripped out. John then dipped the bread in the blood, and that mix became the Holy Leaven. According to this version, the Holy Leaven was taken to the Christians of the East by Thaddeus of Edessa and Saint Mari, but the other Seventy disciples of Jesus refused it, saying: \\"We will consecrate for ourselves whenever we wish.\\" Another account is from the 14th century and is written by Johannan Bar Zobi, based on an account supposedly originating from Peter the Apostle. According to it, John the Baptist collected some of the water that was dripping from Jesus after his baptism. Before John died, he passed the water on to John the Apostle. Then, during the Last Supper Jesus gave John two pieces of bread, asking him to eat one and keep the other. After Jesus had died and was taken down from the cross and pierced with the spear, the tradition holds that John witnessed both blood and water running from the wound unmixed. John then mixed the blood with the piece of bread he had kept and the water with the baptismal water he had preserved. After resurrection, Jesus told his disciples to use these two substances as \\"leaven\\": the water to be used in baptisms and the mix of blood and bread to be used in preparing Eucharistic bread, the Holy Leaven. The Holy Leaven was crushed into powder, mixed with flour and salt and divided among the apostles. According to 14th century writer Abdisho bar Berika, the Holy Leaven was brought to the East by Apostles Thomas and Bartholomew as well as Thaddeus of Edessa and Saint Mari of the Seventy disciples. Abdisho bar Berika also posits a challenge to Western Christians who do not observe the sacrament of the Holy Leaven. According to him, it is necessarily either the case that the apostles disagreed in their view of the Eucharist, or that either the Church of the East or the Western Christians have abandoned the practice promoted by all of the apostles. The Church's position is that they have followed the example of the apostles and have changed nothing even in the face of persecution. The Church presents as evidence for their view the fact that Western Christians have not maintained a united tradition: some Western Churches celebrate the Eucharist with leavened bread while others use unleavened bread (azymites). According to the Assyrian Church of the East, the Holy Leaven was taken to the Christians of the East by Thaddeus of Edessa. Apart from tradition that suggests continuity from the time of the ministry of Jesus, the earliest contemporary textual references to Holy Leaven are in two patriarchal canons of Yohanan bar Abgareh (died 905), one of which states: \\"A priest is obligated to prepare the Eucharistic bread for the Holy Qurbana and to mix the Holy Leaven with it, in addition to the simple leaven.\\" The missionary activities of the Church of the East, that reached as far as India, China, and Mongolia, provide a possible background. Such far and wide activities would have called for symbols that reminded them of the unity with the Church of the East. Thus it is possible that the Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon instituted the rite of the Holy Leaven to serve as one. According to a legend, Western Christianity antagonizes Nestorius because he took all the Holy Leaven with him upon leaving Constantinople, leaving them with none. Significance The Holy Leaven is a sacrament in both the Ancient Church of the East and the Assyrian Church of the East and no other Church recognizes it as a sacrament. With the Holy Leaven and the sacrament of the Sign of the cross, also unique to the Ancient Church of the East and the Assyrian Church, its number of sacraments total seven. Canon law of the Church says that Holy Leaven must be added to sacramental bread for it to be consecrated. A Eucharist without the Holy Leaven is invalid. The anaphora, or Eucharistic prayer, of the Assyrian Church of the East ‚Äì included in its Liturgy of Addai and Mari ‚Äì does not contain the Words of Institution that recount Jesus' words at the Last Supper. The Holy Leaven thus serves as a physical link with the Last Supper in lieu of a verbal one. Historically, Holy Leaven could have functioned much the same way as the Catholic fermentum, a practice that may have persisted until the end of the 7th century. Although specifics about the fermentum are not known for certain, it was probably pieces of Eucharistic bread carried from one Roman Rite diocese to another and added to the sacramental wine. This materially connected Eucharistic services in one area with the one presided over by the Pope, which was the only one where bread was consecrated. In a similar fashion, the addition of the Holy Leaven materially connects each Eucharist celebrated in the Assyrian Church of the East to the original Last Supper. Likewise, the Holy Leaven is similar to Holy anointing oil, which is renewed from the oil of the horn, that the Church believes is inherited from John the Baptist. In 2001, the Roman Catholic Church decided that Chaldean Catholics, who are in full communion with Rome, and Assyrian Church of the East Christians, who are independent of Rome, may, if necessary, celebrate the Eucharist together at either church. In arguing for the validity of the Eucharist in the Liturgy of Addai and Mari, the Catholic Church viewed the sacrament of Holy Leaven as a sign of continuity of tradition going back to the Last Supper.

Members of the patrol decided to execute the immigrants on pretense of fleeing military service, even though they had willingly surrendered and were accompanying the patrol back to base to sort out the nature of their travel. Their remains were looted and left naked and un- buried, leading many to believe they had been murdered by the roving patrol for their belongings. Some of the soldiers with the 25-strong contingent that apprehended the immigrants rode for base when they learned over night camp that their comrades planned to change plans and hang the captives, while the remaining soldiers and commanding officer were seen the next day passing back through Bandera wearing the immigrants' clothing and leading their horses. $900 known to have been carried by one of the immigrants for the purchase of livestock was never found, along with a teenage boy who had accompanied them.

Long after Texas enacted laws banning the act, two African-American teenagers named Bennie Mitchell, Jr. and Ernest Collins were lynched from this tree in 1935, after being forcibly taken from the Sheriff's protective custody by a masked mob who surrounded his car as he transported the young men to court. The teens had confessed to raping and murdering a local 19-year old high school valedictorian named Geraldine Kollman, but were too young to face any severe penalty under the law. The two teens had also implicated a third older man, who had earlier been questioned and released, but he could not be found again. The tree still stands on the outskirts of Columbus, Texas, not far from where Miss Kollman had been murdered near her family's home. * Goliad Hanging Tree: Large oak tree in Goliad, Texas.

He is considered a pioneer and worldwide expert in obesity and metabolism. He has given more than 500 lectures nationally and internationally on these critical topics. His research has resulted in more than 800 publications in Medline, including more than 150 publications under the collaborative Look Ahead Research Group, more than 200 chapters and reviews and has received more than 93,000 citations with an h-index=127 (Google Scholar) as well as prestigious awards at national and international meetings.  Personal  Christos S. Mantzoros was born in Nafplio, Greece and graduated with MD and received a DSc from the University of Athens Medical School. He completed a residency in Internal Medicine at Wayne State University and a fellowship in Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Joslin Diabetes Center program of Harvard Medical School. He also received master's degrees in Clinical Epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health and Clinical Investigation from Harvard Medical School. He is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and in Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes as well as in Clinical Nutrition. He went rapidly through the academic hierarchy steps from Instructor to Full Professor of Internal Medicine at Harvard University within twelve years.  Research  His work spans the entire spectrum from animal physiology and molecular biology, through observational, epidemiology studies, to physiology and pharmacokinetic interventional proof-of-concept clinical trials on new therapeutic agents important in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases in humans. Dr. Christos Mantzoros is known for his groundbreaking work on leptin (see Leptin below) and adiponectin and the relationship between IGF-1 and cancer (see Epidemiology of Cancer below). Recent major contributions of his research group include the elucidation of the physiological role and potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility of several adipokines and myokines, leptin, adiponectin, in human physiology and pathophysiology. Leptin has been approved by the Food and Drugs Administration for lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance accompanied by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. His work has resulted in patents for diagnostic and therapeutic applications and has directly contributed to the development of new pharmaceuticals by major pharmaceutical companies. Currently, he and his team are utilizing various interventions (physiological, pharmacological and dietary) and tools (hormonal, neurocognitive and neuroimaging, functional MRI) to investigate the role of the human brain in regulating energy homeostasis, obesity and metabolism (See Neuroimaging Studies below). In 2018, Dr. Mantzoros gave a Harvard Medical School Mini Med lecture to teach medical concepts to a lay audience. The lecture was attended by close to 100,000 people from all over the world through live-streaming.  Leptin  In the area of leptin, Mantzoros pioneered physiology studies, conducted clinical trials in humans, and discovered its therapeutic potential. He was the first to investigate the normal physiology of leptin in humans, including circadian rhythms and the role of leptin in fasting and with relation to body weight. His team has published the only three studies on leptin pharmacokinetics determining leptin doses to be used in humans. Indeed, his research broadened the understanding of the neuroendocrine function of leptin on body weight, energy homeostasis, gender differentiation, immunology and the interaction with other hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone and sex steroids. Observing that hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and lipodystrophy were conditions of hypoleptinemia, he piloted clinical trials to test the efficacy of leptin to treat these conditions, showing that leptin replacement in patients with HA and lipodystrophy resulted in complete normalization of hormone axes and bone density in HA as well as insulin resistance and metabolic regulation in lipodystrophy. Additionally, he observed that functional changes in how the brain views food occur in subjects with hypoleptinemia and that these can be corrected with leptin replacement. Dr. Mantzoros and his team observed that short-term metreleptin treatment enhanced activity in areas detecting the salience and rewarding value of food during fasting, while long-term treatment decreased attention to and the rewarding value of food after feeding. Furthermore, hypothalamic activity is modulated by metreleptin treatment and leptin decreases functional connectivity of the hypothalamus to key feeding-related areas in these hypoleptinemic subjects. These findings expanded the role of leptin into systemic neuroendocrine regulation.  Epidemiology of cancer  Observing that the incidence of certain cancers increases with the rate of obesity (e.g. cancers which have been linked with obesity such as endometrial, esophageal, breast, etc.), Dr. Mantzoros hypothesized that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) which is also found at higher levels in obesity and a growth factor might be related to the development of cancer. Indeed, he first confirmed in a case-control study that IGF-1 was linked with prostate cancer. Later, he confirmed a similar link between IGF-1 and other types of cancers, including thyroid, breast, and others both in case control and prospective epidemiology studies. This work opened the way for efforts to develop molecules blocking IGF-1 signaling as possible treatments for cancer, currently being tested. Additionally, observing the links between insulin resistance, inflammation, and sex steroids with central obesity and obesity-related cancers, Dr. Mantzoros expanded this research to the molecule adiponectin, hypothesizing that abnormalities in this molecule, caused by abnormal fat deposition in the abdomen, were upstream of all other hormonal and inflammatory abnormalities above. First performing physiology studies in rodents and later in human case- control and prospective cohort studies, his team demonstrated the link between adiponectin and several types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, thyroid, prostate, and others. This work opened the way for efforts to develop molecules blocking IGF-1 signaling as possible treatments for cancer, currently being tested. The Mantzoros group also demonstrated a direct effect of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors on endometrial cancer in humans and started mapping the molecular pathways downstream of adiponectin in malignancies. This suggests that adiponectin regulation may be at the root of obesity-related cancers. Due in large part to this research, adiponectin receptor agonists and/or medications that increase circulating levels of adiponectin are currently being tested as a treatment for cancers related to insulin resistance and central obesity.  Mediterranean Diet  Dr. Mantzoros also demonstrated that following a Mediterranean Diet, which is high in whole- grain cereals and low-fat dairy products and low consumption of refined cereals, leads to improved levels of adipokines like adiponectin, which decreases insulin resistance, and inflammatory factors like c-reactive protein, and thus leads in the long-term to lower incidence of death from cardiovascular disease and stroke.  Neuroimaging studies  Most recently, Dr. Mantzoros has been working on the interplay of hormones and environmental factors to influence the function of brain centers important in energy homeostasis and metabolism and how these may be altered with pharmaceuticals to treat obesity. Focusing on the human brain, he studies the control of eating behaviors as they are affected in obesity in the human cortex. Most significantly, he determined the role of GLP-1 in the human brain. When Dr. Mantzoros and his team examined the GLP-1 analog liraglutide in diabetic adults and found that liraglutide was decreasing activation in the brain's cortex, the area that increases control and makes individuals more attentive to what they are eating. This suggests that individuals on liraglutide find highly desirable foods less appealing and that the medication might prove an effective weight loss therapy for people who tend to eat foods as a reward, such as when they are stressed. Most recently, Dr. Mantzoros and colleagues examined the serotonin 2c receptor agonist lorcaserin in obese adults and discovered that lorcaserin was decreasing activation in the attention-related parietal and visual cortices in response to highly palatable food cues at 1 week in the fasting state and in the parietal cortex in response to any food cues at 4 weeks in the fed state. Decreases in emotion and salience-related limbic activity, including the insula and amygdala, were attenuated at 4 weeks. In a secondary analysis, they observed that decreases in caloric intake, weight, and BMI correlated with activations in amygdala, parietal and visual cortices at baseline, suggesting that lorcaserin would be of particular benefit to emotional eaters. These studies have important implications for obesity and future therapeutics.  Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental  Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental is a biomedical journal published by Elsevier related to all aspects of metabolism. Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental publishes studies in humans, animal and cellular models. The journal, one with a long history in the field of metabolism, was in decline for several years until 2010. Dr. Mantzoros assumed the position of Editor-in- Chief for the journal Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental in 2010. Under his leadership, the journal has experienced an approximately 20% growth annually in all metrics. The journal's impact factor in 2018 was 6.513 putting it in the top 6% of endocrinology journals (average JIF percentile 94%).http://www.metabolismjournal.com/ Its cited half-life was 9.4 in 2018 placing the journal in the top 5% of its category. The impact factor has been continuously increasing over the past eight years that he has been serving at the helm, from 2 to 6.5 (2018), placing the journal amongst the top 6% of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism journals as indexed in Journal Citation Reports. Similarly, cited half-life, or the duration an average paper continues receiving citations, has also increased significantly and in 2018 rose to be in the top 5% of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism.  Translation of science into tangible clinical benefits  Dr. Mantzoros consults for several companies as the head of the Mantzoros Consulting, LLC. In 2005, he co-founded Intekrin, Inc. which was later acquired by and merged with Coherus, Inc. These companies are developing a number of biosimilars at several stages of clinical development in humans (one approaching FDA approval) in addition to small molecules for diseases related to insulin resistance (e.g. Diabetes, NAFLD). CHRS-131, just successfully completed Phase II trials in humans for multiple sclerosis. More recently, Dr. Mantzoros has co-founded Pangea, Inc.  Teaching and Mentoring  Dr. Mantzoros currently serves as the Chief of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Director of the Human Nutrition Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He teaches at Harvard Medical School and Boston University School of Medicine. He has closely mentored more than 165 scientists, many of whom are now Full Professors, 1 is now a CEO of a pharmaceutical company, 2 are Chief Medical or Scientific Officers, 1 a Vice President biotechnology companies and several others are currently Assistant and Associate Professors, Executive Directors at pharmaceutical companies or clinicians. Dr. Mantzoros, an active member of the orthodox church, has served in many roles, including teaching pro bono biomedical ethics at the Hellenic College and Holy Cross School of Theology and serving as a member of the Archdiocesan Advisory Council on Bioethics. He has also served as a board member on the Hellenic College Holy Cross (HCHC) Board of Trustees.  Awards  Christos S. Mantzoros has received several awards. Recently, he received the 2017 Obesity Society TOPS Award, the 2018 Endocrine Society's Outstanding Clinical Investigator Award, the 2018 European Society of Endocrinology highest distinction, i.e. the Geoffrey Harris Award and the 2018 American Society for Nutrition Robert H.

The group was founded in 2015 by two college students, Ryan Fournier and John Lambert. In July 2019, Charlie Kirk, CEO of Turning Point USA, became chairman of Students for Trump.  History  Charlie Kirk, the group's chairman since July 2019 Students for Trump was founded in 2015 by Ryan Fournier and John Lambert, students at Campbell University in North Carolina, United States, who started tweeting positive information about Donald Trump. The Houston Chronicle reported that George Lombardi, a New York City real estate developer and friend of Donald Trump who‚Äîamong hundreds of Trump-supporting Facebook groups‚Äîhad set up a \\"Students for Trump\\" Facebook group, acted as an advisor. On August 6, 2015, Fournier and Lambert were impressed by then high schooler Alexander Chalgren, who appeared as a questioner on the first Fox News Republican primary debate. Alexander asked a question of the candidates concerning ISIL, which was cited as the \\"most important\\" question of the evening. The question sparred an intense debate between then Mr. Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz. Students for Trump founders reached out to Mr. Chalgren via Instagram inquiring as to his political affiliation, and found him to be an early supporter of Donald Trump. After a brief interview and screening process, Chalgren was offered an integral early position within the organization as South Carolina Director, but eventually rose to the post of National Director. Mr. Chalgren is South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster's adopted cousin. Alexander made his second debut onto the national scene in his This American Life interview with Zoe Chace in 2016. According to the New York Times, Chalgren was the most famous young Trump supporter in America. Fournier's first television appearance for the organization was on TBS. Students for Trump activities were highlighted in a BBC documentary, \\"Trump's Unlikely Superfans,\\" and an NBC News exclusive titled \\"Students for Trump: Meet the Millennials Who Want Him to Win.\\" In 2016, the organization switched from a traditional campaign model with Regional, State, and Chapter coordinators, to a model with Campus Ambassadors that perform roles similar to that of a campaign field intern. In August 2016, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the organization \\"had nearly 300 campus chapters and a bevy of social-media followers ‚Äî 29,000 on Twitter, 59,000 on Instagram, thousands more on Facebook.\\" James Allsup on air The campaign however, had numerous problems before and after the election. In April 2016, a Students for Trump Florida chapter placed a \\"Make America Great Again\\" ball cap on a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. just days after the anniversary of his death, prompting widespread outrage. Salon magazine reported that Ryan Fournier worked with white nationalists when he was head of Students for Trump. Media Matters said that Fournier hired white nationalist James Allsup as director of the Campus Ambassador Program. Allsup was a member of the American Identity Movement and marched at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. By March 2017, The College Fix reported that the organization's chapters had \\"largely disbanded or halted meetings.\\" In February 2018, The Daily Beast reported that Students for Trump had never correctly complied with making reports to the Federal Election Commission as a political action committee. However, founder Ryan Fournier was invited to the White House in July 2019 to discuss liberal bias in social media. By February 2018, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) had written nine letters to Students for Trump requesting information about donors, but the organization declined to respond. However, the FEC has taken no action other than to warn the political action committee. On July 2, 2019, Charlie Kirk reported that Turning Point Action had acquired Students for Trump along with \\"all associated media assets.\\" Kirk is the founder and CEO of Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action, and the creator of the Professor Watchlist. Turning Point Action is a political action committee created in May 2019 to target Democrats, including Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Right Wing Watch has alleged that Turning Point USA used staff and resources for political action against Omar that would be considered a violation of US tax codes; this was not the first time that Turning Point USA, a 501(c)(3) organization, was accused of tax code violations. TPUSA has also been accused of using illegal means to influence student body elections. On June 23, 2020, Students for Trump held their Arizona Convention at the Dream City church in Phoenix with featured speaker President Donald J. Trump. The event occurred during a spike in the COVID-19 pandemic and, according to Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallegos, masks were not required. Officials of the Dream City church, however, said that participants would be protected by ionizing technology.  Co-founders Fournier and Lambert  =Ryan Fournier= alt= The organization's co- founder, Ryan Fournier, is from Long Branch, NJ. Fournier became politically active following his volunteer work for the Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign. Prior to launching Students for Trump, Fournier was involved in various local and state political campaigns within North Carolina. Along with being the Co-Chairman of Students for Trump, Fournier also serves as the President of OpenPoll and xStrategies. In 2015, Fournier and John Lambert launched Students for Trump as a Twitter account while they were studying at Campbell University in Buies Creek, NC. Fournier graduated from Campbell University in May 2019 with a degree in Political Science. He is also a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity, Zeta Psi chapter. Fournier was awarded Newsmax's 30 Under 30 Award in 2017 and 2018. He is also a recipient of the Red Alert Politics 30 Under 30 Award. In July 2018, Fournier launched a boycott against Walmart for selling shirts labeled \\"Impeach 45,\\" which resulted in the hashtag #BoycottWalmart trending on Twitter. Walmart pulled the items from its online store, issuing the following statement: \\"These items were sold by third-party sellers on our open marketplace, and were not offered directly by Walmart. We‚Äôre removing these types of items pending review of our marketplace policies.\\" =John Lambert= Lambert, a Tennessee native, was arrested in Tennessee in April 2019 on federal charges of wire fraud for posing online as a corporate and patent lawyer from 2016 to 2018, swindling consumers and businesses out of more than $46,000. He pleaded guilty in 2019 and signed a plea deal in 2019 whereby he will forfeit $46,654 and not appeal any sentence of up to 21 months of imprisonment.

The event, led by UW College Republicans president Jessie Gamble, UW Students for Trump president Chevy Swanson, and S4T senior advisor James Allsup, lasted for an approximately an hour and a half, and was met with ten Trump supporters and over 100 protestors. The wall was painted with a brick design, with \\"Trump Wall\\" written on it. At one point, a student attempted to scale the wall. Shortly after this, the organizers were asked by the University Police to take the wall down, which they did. Portland State University Students for Trump, a group unaffiliated with the S4T national organization, hosted a similar event on June 10, 2016.

In the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), it was a trebuchet and its name is translated into English as Crouching Tiger Trebuchet; in the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), the name was given to a type of bombard and it is known in English as Crouching Tiger Cannon. Trebuchet According to the Song dynasty military compendium Wujing Zongyao (published 1044), the hu dun pao is depicted as a traction trebuchet with a triangular frame. It is operated by a dedicated corps of 70 haulers, who took turns pulling the ropes attached to the trebutchet arm to send the projectile, a stone or bomb, into flight. It has a range of . The Annales ianuenses, the official history of Genoa, carries drawings of trabuchium, a counterweighted trebuchet with triangular supporting trusses, that Sinologist Joseph Needham considers to be derived from or related to the Chinese \\"Crouching Tiger Trebuchet\\". Similar triangular-framed trebutchets are found in Byzantine sources as labdarea (lambda-shaped machines) and as \\"Turkish trebuchets\\" (manjanƒ´q turkƒ´) by Mardi ibn Ali al-Tarsusi and the Templar of Tyre. Mao Yuanyi (ËåÖÂÖÉÂÑÄ; 1594‚Äì1640), the compiler of the Ming dynasty military treatise Wubei Zhi, considered the \\"Crouching Tiger Trebuchet\\" as an ancestor to the cannon along with other bomb-throwing trebuchets. Cannon By the publication of the 1350 edition Huolongjing during the Ming dynasty, the meaning of the character pao Á†≤ changed from \\"trebuchet\\" to \\"cannon\\", mirroring the development of gunpowder artillery in China. Likewise, \\"hu dun pao\\" came to refer to an early Chinese iron cannon in the same text. The Hulongjing describes the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" as thus: According to this description and the illustration in the Huolongjing, the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" was a small cannon that was propped up at the muzzle end and pinned to the ground to deaden the recoil. This setup supposedly resembles a crouching tiger, giving the cannon its name like its trebuchet predecessor. The barrel holding 100 bullets could mean the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" fired pellets, or that the bullets could have been placed in a bag as grapeshot. Of special note are the iron bands acting as reinforcements around the cannon‚Äîthey indicated that the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" was a built-up cast-iron gun, preceding the Armstrong Gun by five centuries. The iron bands were shrunk onto the barrel while red hot, and the consistently fitting bands show that the Ming Chinese foundrymen had mastered quenching in mass-production conditions. The grounding pins were cast separately. According to Qi Jiguang's Treatise on Military Training (Á∑¥ÂÖµÂØ¶Á¥Ä, Lianbing Shiji) of 1568, the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" was placed at various points on the Chinese frontier since the beginning of the Ming dynasty. They were still used during the Imjin War of 1592‚Äì98, where their deployment was crucial in the retaking of Pyongyang (1593) from the Japanese invaders. Following the Imjin War, a typical Fujianese war junk (Á¶èËàπ, fuchuan), the standard ship of the Ming navy, would carry the \\"Crouching Tiger Cannon\\" alongside heavy cannons, breech-loading cannons, falconets, and fire lances.

Established in 1928, Allis State Park was the second state park to be created in Vermont. It is named for Wallace Allis, who willed his Bear Mountain Farm to the State of Vermont to be developed as a campground and recreational area. The park was developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) beginning in 1932, which built the access roads, constructed a picnic shelter, picnic grounds and a campground. There is a fire/lookout tower on Bear Hill. Limited trash service, hot showers and running water are available. There are picnic tables, grills and fireplaces. Location and features Allis State Park encompasses of uplands in the watershed of Vermont's White River in western Brookfield, occupying part of a ridge bounded on the east by Bear Hill Road/Vermont Route 65 and on the west by Vermont Route 12. The park itself is accessed from Bear Hill Road/VT 65, which is one of the last remaining Vermont state highways that is still maintained as a gravel road. The park's principal feature is the summit of Bear Hill, which is accessed via the park road from Bear Hill Road. The park road rises to the west before bending south, after which it reaches the entrance gate and then subsequently splits. The right-hand road loops around the campground, while the left-hand road serves the day-use area, which includes the picnic area, picnic pavilion, and fire/lookout tower. The campground loop has 18 tent sites, along with 8 lean-to sites, for a total of 26 campsites. Water is available from faucets throughout the campground, and there is a comfort station with restrooms near the middle of the camping loop where showers are available. There is also a campsite for group camping that is set apart from the rest of the campsites. The day-use area connects to the campground via a short, marked trail. The Bear Hill Nature Trail is a 3/4 mile hiking loop that connects to the day-use/picnic area at both ends. A horseshoe pit is also located at the picnic area. The fire/lookout tower, at the center of the picnic area, provides 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains of Vermont. The picnic pavilion has handicap-accessible restrooms that serve the day-use area. As of the 2019 season, Allis State Park has no day-use fee. The standard Vermont State Park camping fees apply to the campsites. History The park was created in 1928 by the gift of his farm to the people of Vermont by Wallace Allis. Prior to making the gift, Allis had allowed area residents to the upper areas of his farm, which provide spectactular views of the surrounding countryside. The park facilities were developed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, which constructed the access road, camping loop, and picnic pavilion. The park facilities were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Peter Peterson and Angelo Bianchi, World Scientific Publishing Company, 1999. His research and professional successes in the areas of plant breeding and genetics, agbiotechnology, intellectual property, business management, and seed industry development were carried out in executive capacities in several companies in the United States, Belgium, and Germany. After the divestment of a group of four seed companies that Sehgal founded and ran with his wife, Edda Sehgal, the couple created two nonprofit organizations to promote rural development in Suri's country of origin: Sehgal (Family) Foundation in 1998 in the US, and S M Sehgal Foundation in India. The foundations‚Äô work focuses on water security, food security, and social justice with particular emphasis on women's empowerment. A proponent of corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability, Sehgal has also provided support individually and through the foundations for projects related to agriculture research, the preservation of biodiversity and the conservation of natural resources.  Early life and education  Suri Sehgal was born 16 May 1934 in the town of Guliana in the Punjab Province of India to an inter- caste family. He was the second son, and one of eight children, of a Hindu father, Faqirchand ‚ÄúShahji‚Äù Sehgal, and a Sikh mother, Shushil Kaur Sehgal. Shahji Sehgal was an associate of Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian National Congress, and the family home was a center for community organizing for India's independence from British rule. Suri was thirteen when independence brought about the Partition of India in August 1947. The Sehgal family home, in the region of the Punjab that became part of Pakistan, was along the route of the mass migration of people who were displaced amidst the violence that followed Partition‚ÄîHindus and Sikhs to India and Muslims from India to Pakistan. Suri ended up homeless for a time on the streets of Delhi and a witness to horrific violence and bloodshed before being reunited with his family in a refugee camp in Amritsar, India. Suri achieved a bachelor of science with honors and a master of science with honors in botany at Punjab University, where he received silver medal, merit certificates, and scholarships for academic achievement in 1955 and 1957. He came to the United States in 1959 to study plant genetics and work with Paul C. Mangelsdorf at Harvard University. He received the Anna C. Ames Memorial Scholarship in 1961. He attained his PhD in plant genetics from Harvard in 1963. He later (1982) completed the Harvard International Senior Management Program in Mont-Pelerin, Switzerland.  Professional achievements  Suri Sehgal's professional career began in 1963 at a (then) regional seed company in Des Moines, Iowa, founded by plant breeder and future vice president of the United States, Henry A. Wallace, called Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Company (named Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., in 1970, and Dupont Pioneer in 2012). Sehgal's tenure at Pioneer lasted 24 years. He was mentored and befriended by Pioneer executive Bill Brown (William L. Brown). *Sehgal served as Pioneer's corn breeder for the tropics and subtropics stationed in Jamaica for six years before being appointed manager of the International Department. He organized and established research and development centers, production facilities, and branch offices throughout Latin America and the Caribbean with responsibility for hiring and training management teams. He was appointed president of Pioneer's Overseas Division in 1973, president of Pioneer Overseas Corporation in 1981, and corporate vice-president of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., in 1984. *Until 1988, Sehgal traveled extensively through Russia, Ukraine, Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, China, and India for the development, management, and administration of international research and business ventures. His East-West business strategy in Europe was the first of its kind in the seed industry, resulting in unprecedented profits for Pioneer. Sehgal introduced high-technology/high-profit concepts in Brazil, a global sourcing concept in Europe, and innovative ideas in the company's worldwide operations. *Sehgal left Pioneer in 1988 and launched a seed company in India with Edda Sehgal called Proagro Seed Company Ltd. which became a leading private seed company on the Indian subcontinent over the next ten years. *During the same period, Sehgal served as chairman and CEO of Global Technologies, Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, providing agribusiness consulting and advisory services globally; for seven years as chief operating officer at Plant Genetic Systems, Belgium, (in 2002 became Bayer CropScience); for seven years as senior advisor at KWS Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht Ag (KWS Saat), Einbeck, Germany; and until 1997 on the Board of Directors for Great Lakes Hybrids, Ovid, Michigan, USA. *Sehgal spent three years as senior advisor at Hoechst Schering AgrEvo GmbH (named Aventis CropScience in 1999, and Bayer CropScience in 2002), Frankfurt, Germany, where he helped develop the forward integration of Plant Genetic Systems technology into AgrEvo seed businesses. *He served on the Board of Trustees for International Institute of Tropical agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria, and on the Board of Directors for Diversity, A News Journal for the International Genetic Resources Community, USA. *Suri and Edda Sehgal divested Proagro Seed Company Ltd. in 1998 and used the bulk of the profits to create the philanthropic foundations in the United States and in India. That same year, the Sehgals established Global Investors LLLP, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, as an investment company. The only shareholders are Suri, Edda, and their four children. The Sehgal (Family) Foundation is based in Des Moines, Iowa, as a private donor foundation with the primary intent of making a positive contribution to the development of India, but also providing support to philanthropic ventures in the United States and elsewhere. Suri serves as chairman. Edda and the couple's four children serve as trustees. The recipients of their funding support include individuals and organizations making a difference in health, education, and conservation.Cornell, Marly. (2014) Seeds for Change: The Lives and Work of Suri and Edda Sehgal, Sehgal Foundation, Des Moines, Iowa. p. 267  Personal life  Suri Sehgal met Edda Gudrun Jeglinsky (born December 25, 1941, in Breslau, Silesia) a few weeks after she first came to the United States from Germany in 1962 to live as an au pair in the home of Henry Kissinger, a professor at Harvard at the time. Suri and Edda shared a refugee past as children. Edda's family had been forced to flee from their country of origin, German Silesia, near the end of WWII. The Jeglinskys escaped to Bavaria in 1945 and later settled in G√∂ppingen, Germany. When Suri completed his PhD at Harvard, he moved to Des Moines, Iowa, to work with Bill Brown at Pioneer Hi- Bred Corn Company. After the completion of her two-year commitment to the Kissingers, Edda moved to Des Moines, Iowa. Suri and Edda were married in the home of Bill and Alice Brown in 1964. The Sehgals raised four children, helped raise two nephews, and opened their home to other relatives who emigrated from India to the United States. The creation of their foundations and the Sehgals‚Äô ongoing commitment to philanthropy was rooted in the violence and loss they each experienced during their childhoods as fleeing refugees from their countries of origin. Both are proud Americans who want to share their good fortune.  Current work  Suri Sehgal is chairman and trustee of Sehgal Foundation and S M Sehgal Foundation. Edda Sehgal is a trustee. The S M Sehgal Foundation mission is to strengthen community-led development initiatives to achieve positive social, economic, and environmental change across rural India. The headquarters building in Gurgaon, now called Gurugram, in the state of Haryana, received platinum-level certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) from the US Green Building Council (USGBC). Sehgal is chairman of two seed companies. Misr Hytech Seed International S.A.E. in Cairo (which he helped establish with other shareholders), is a leading seed company in Egypt, breeding and developing high-yielding corn, sorghum, and squash. The other seed company, Hytech India, which Sehgal founded in 2004, develops high-yielding hybrid seeds in Hyderabad, India. Sehgal is a Trustee Emeritus of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, having helped to establish the William L. Brown Center of Economic Botany at the Missouri Botanical Garden in 2001. Sehgal has served as a trustee or board member of several other nonprofit organizations including the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) and the Trust for Advancement of Agricultural Sciences (TAAS).  Honors, awards and international recognition  *Suri Sehgal received the Pride of India Gold Award in 2007 from NRI Institute, Washington, D.C. Chapter and the Bharat Samman Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to the development of India in 2009, also from the NRI Institute for promoting cultural, academic, and socioeconomic interests of Indian diasporas.http://www.nriinstitute.org/award.html *For Sehgal's contributions to water management in semiarid regions, Suri Sehgal Lake was named by ICRISAT Patancheru in 2009. *Sehgal received the Leadership in Philanthropy Award in 2011 from the American India Foundation. *He was presented with the Global Indian Karmaveer Puraskaar Lifetime Achievement Award for Social Justice and Citizen Action in 2013 from the Indian Confederation of NGOs (iCONGO). *A history of S M Sehgal Foundation's first fifteen years, published in 2016, called Together We Empower: Rekindling Hope in Rural India, documented the progress and successes as well as the missteps and learnings of the work done in partnership with communities. The foundation has received multiple awards for achievements and inventions in water management, agriculture development, good rural governance, community radio, and book publishing. *Sehgal received the 2016 American Bazaar Philanthropy Award for committing the bulk of his wealth to the development and empowerment of rural India. *A biography titled \\"Seeds for change: The Lives and work of Suri and Edda Sehgal\\", authored by Marly Cornell, was published in 2014.

On 5 May the Admiralty ordered Morgiana, then at Portsmouth, prepared and provisioned for foreign service, believed to be the West Indies, and to sail immediately to Plymouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.419. Later in the year she sailed for the Mediterranean. Between 1 and 3 August, Juno and Morgiana captured three vessels: Santissima Trinita, Parthenope, and Famosa. Then on the 21st, Juno and Morgiana captured San Giorgio. Morgiana captured Margueritta on 12 October. While chasing two vessels off Cape Spartivento, the southernmost point of Sardinia, on 15 October 1803, Morgiana found herself being chased by a lateen-rigged vessel flying English colours that swept out from the coast. When the pursuer came within gunshot she discovered that she was attacking a warship. After Morgiana fired several shots, the vessel hoisted French colours and anchored. Raynsford sent in Morgianas boats. Although they came under grape and musket fire, the crews were able to board their objective and capture her. She was the French privateer Marguerite, armed with two 6-pounders and two 4-pounders. Of her crew of 40, at the end only three remained on board, the others having swum ashore. Morgianas sole casualty was one seaman mortally wounded. On 16 January 1804 Morgiana captured Intrepide. The capture took place at the island of Milo (probably Milos, in the Aegean Sea). Captain Schomberg, of , at Malta, sent Morgiana into the Adriatic with the \\"Fish Ships\\".Fish ships were British merchant vessels carrying fish, perhaps cod from Newfoundland or herring from the North Sea. Admiral Nelson, when informed of the instructions, concurred in them, adding only that he trusted that Schomberg had instructed Raynsford to bring [back] with him the merchant vessels going to Malta or England. On 1 December 1805 Morgiana detained the Sicilian ship Divine Providence. Divine Providence was sailing from Palermo to Genoa with a varied cargo. She had a crew of 9 men and was of 50 tons (bm). By November 1806 Morgiana was under the command of Captain Thomas Landless.O'Byrne (1849), vo1. 1, p.463. While off Cadiz, Raynsford had been promoted to post captain and command of Madras.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 16, p.353. In January 1807 Morgiana was under the command of Captain James Slade, off Cadiz. However, Captain Landless appears to have remained in command until August. Late on 21 May 1807, Commander William Raitt of sent his boats and those of Morgiana in pursuit of several vessels spotted sailing past Cape Trafalgar with the aim of clearing the Straits under cover of darkness. The boats succeeded in capturing the privateer San Francisco Settaro (or Francisco Solano, or Determinada).United service magazine (1807), p.422. The privateer fired heavily on the boats before they captured her, killing one seaman from Scout, and wounding another. San Francisco Settaro was armed with one 18-pounder gun in her bow and two other carriage guns, together with swivels and small arms, and had a crew of 29 men. Raitt described his prize \\"a large Vessel, about Three Months old, and in my Opinion well calculated for the Gun Boat Service at Gibraltar.\\" Three days later, Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Commander in Chief for the Mediterranean, wrote in a letter to William Marsden that Scout, Morgiana, and had been employed \\"scouring the Gut of the Enemy\\". Furthermore, \\"within this Fortnight past they have taken and destroyed Eighteen of the Enemy's Vessels\\". Morgiana returned to Chatham later in the year. She was laid up in ordinary at Chatham in August 1807. Fate The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Morgiana Sloop, of 283 Tons\\" for sale at Chatham on 21 February 1811. She did not sell immediately but was broken up in August.

The film contends that the extent of the Holocaust in Croatia and the World War II-era genocide of the country's Serb population was exaggerated through post-war communist propaganda. It focuses primarily on Jasenovac, a concentration camp run by Croatia's wartime fascist Usta≈°e government where an estimated 100,000 are believed to have perished, and suggests that the actual death toll never exceeded 18,000. The film also argues that Jasenovac continued being used as a concentration camp by Yugoslavia's communist authorities well after World War II, and that more inmates perished when it was run by the communists than when it was run by the Usta≈°e. It premiered in Tel Aviv in February 2016 and in Zagreb two months later. Its Croatian premiere was attended by Minister of Culture Zlatko Hasanbegoviƒá, who is alleged to have made a number of pro- fascist statements in the past, as well as by the Israeli ambassador to Croatia. The film was panned by scholars, journalists and politicians from the Croatian left, who accused the filmmakers of minimizing and relativizing Usta≈°e atrocities. It was also alleged that the filmmakers had fabricated or misrepresented a number of photographs, correspondences and newspaper reports seen in the film, as well as that they had manipulated videotaped survivor testimony through selective editing. The Israeli ambassador strongly criticized the film and accused the filmmakers of historical negationism, as did representatives of the Croatian Serb and Croatian Jewish communities. The film has been shown as an educational feature in a number of Croatian schools, causing further controversy. Sedlar has said that he intends to screen the film at Holocaust museums and Jewish community centres, and indicated that copies will be donated to university libraries in Europe and North America. In July 2016, a non-governmental organization called the Anti-Fascist League of Croatia filed a lawsuit against Sedlar alleging the film incited ethnic intolerance and promoted Holocaust denial. Production During World War II, Croats were divided between the communist Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, and the fascist Usta≈°e, led by Ante Paveliƒá. Paveliƒá came to power following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, declared independence from Yugoslavia, and ruled the fascist puppet state of Croatia as a dictator until 1945, when the Usta≈°e were defeated and the country was reintegrated into Yugoslavia, which fell under communist rule at the war's end. While in power, the Usta≈°e had pursued a campaign of extermination against Croatia's minorities, particularly Serbs, Jews and Roma (Gypsies). Between 1941 and 1945, they set up a number of concentration camps, the largest of which was Jasenovac, which survivors dubbed the \\"Auschwitz of the Balkans\\". An estimated 100,000 prisoners perished at the camp, which was only liberated following Paveliƒá's defeat in April 1945. Wartime events continue to influence 21st- century Croatian politics. \\"For many Croats,\\" The Economist reports, \\"voting has less to do with left- or right-leaning ideological beliefs than with whose side one's family was on during the Second World War.\\" The film was directed and produced by Jakov Sedlar, written by novelist Hrvoje Hitrec, and narrated by Croatian actors Dragan Despot and Sanja Marin. Sedlar was the Croatian Government's \\"official propagandist\\" during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, according to the historian Vjekoslav Perica. Sedlar became known for films such as Gospa (Madonna) and ƒåetverored (Four by Four), which portray the events of World War II and the Cold War from a Croatian nationalist perspective. He also made a number of documentaries glorifying wartime President Franjo Tuƒëman and his party, the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska zajednica; HDZ). In an apparent bid to increase their credibility abroad, several were filmed in the English language, with actor Martin Sheen narrating. Hitrec was another close associate of Tuƒëman, as well as one of the founding members of the HDZ. In 1990, he was appointed director of Croatia's state broadcaster, Croatian Radiotelevision. Between March and July 1991, he served as Croatia's Minister of Information. The film was produced through the donations of Croatian Canadian businessman Anton Kika≈° and retired Croatian Australian footballer Josip ≈†imuniƒá. Kika≈° was a prominent √©migr√© fundraiser supporting Croatian nationalist causes during the 1980s and 1990s. On 30 August 1991, at the height of the Croatian War of Independence, he was arrested at the Zagreb Airport for attempting to smuggle a large cache of weapons to the Croatian National Guard, after the European Community and United Nations had imposed an arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. Three months later, he was released in a prisoner exchange. In 2013, ≈†imuniƒá earned a ten-match suspension for chanting the Usta≈°e-era slogan Za dom spremni (For the homeland ready) following a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match, forcing him to miss the tournament. Summary The train that carried prisoners to Jasenovac The film opens by stating that the number of inmates who perished at Jasenovac has never been accurately ascertained, with estimates ranging from 49,000 to 700,000 dead. It brings up a document from 1946 in which the president of the State Commission on Ascertaining Crimes Committed by Occupying Powers and Their Helpers reports that 15,792 inmates were killed at Jasenovac. The film then offers a glimpse at the 1945 British documentary A Painful Reminder: Evidence for All Mankind, in which it is stated that 20,000 perished at the camp. After World War I, the film asserts, Croatia was occupied by Greater Serbian expansionists and royalist guerrillas known as Chetniks, who relegated Croats to the status of second- class citizens. It highlights a number of alleged murders of Croats in interwar Yugoslavia committed by Chetniks. In Jasenovac, the film claims, a Serb merchant named Lazar Baƒçiƒá led a band that killed five Croats and terrorized countless others between 1918 and 1941. During this period, King Alexander's government implemented discriminatory laws targeting Croats, used the Royal Yugoslav Army to crush a number of peasant revolts and organized the killing of Croatian Peasant Party leader Stjepan Radiƒá, after which Alexander declared himself royal dictator. Yugoslav jails became filled with Croatian patriots, the film explains, and the name Croatia was erased from all maps. In response to this oppression, a Croat lawyer named Ante Paveliƒá founded the Usta≈°e, a patriotic movement whose aim was to defend Croatian national interests in \\"all the lands that Croats have historically inhabited\\". Paveliƒá was soon exiled to Italy, where he continued plotting against the \\"Belgrade regime\\". In 1934, the Usta≈°e helped organize King Alexander's assassination in Marseille. His funeral was attended by Philippe P√©tain and Hermann G√∂ring. This fact, the film maintains, was deliberately omitted from Yugoslav historiography. In April 1941, amid the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and in response to a Serbian militia's massacre of dozens of defenseless Croats near Bjelovar, the Usta≈°e proclaimed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia. Serbian nationalists, unwilling to live in an independent Croatian state, revolted against the Usta≈°e and initiated a campaign of genocide against the Croatian population. Following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, a large number of these nationalists joined the Partisans in terrorizing Croat population centres. Paveliƒá, meanwhile, was misled into implementing German-style anti-Jewish laws, similar to those that Yugoslavia had implemented even before the invasion. Baƒçiƒá and his son fled Jasenovac and sought refuge in Serbia, it is said, where they offered their services to the collaborationist leader Milan Nediƒá. Baƒçiƒá's property, which housed a brick factory prior to the invasion, was transformed into a \\"concentration and labour\\" camp and resumed production. At its height, the camp's brick factory employed 180 inmates. Hundreds of workers died from disease, exhaustion, or by drowning in a nearby marsh. The camp was used to detain all opponents of Paveliƒá's regime regardless of ethnicity, the film asserts, and it is claimed that most inmates were Croats. Thousands of Jews are said to have sought refuge in Croatia before 1941, enticed by the Croats' historical Judeophilia. Hundreds converted to Roman Catholicism at the urging of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, thereby saving their own lives. Paveliƒá's wife, the film claims, was Jewish herself, as were many senior Usta≈°e officials. The viewer is shown a letter allegedly authored by Paveliƒá, asking government minister Mile Budak to spare the lives of Jews who had not committed any crimes against the state. The film claims that hundreds of Jasenovac inmates were killed in Allied bombing raids in 1944‚Äì45. Between 1941 and 1945, inmates were allowed to stage concerts, book readings and play football, the film maintains, and conditions were more humane than those in German camps. The narrator states that post-war communist propaganda inflated the number of people killed at Jasenovac, from an estimated 18,000 to 600,000‚Äì700,000. The viewer is shown a headline from the Partisan newspaper Vjesnik, said to be dated from April 1945, which says that corpses tossed into the Sava River at Jasenovac had reached Zagreb. The narrator questions the veracity of this claim, explaining that the Sava flows away from Zagreb and not towards it. The film expresses doubts about the incomplete list of over 83,000 victims compiled by the Jasenovac Research Institute, which supposedly includes the names of individuals who had been killed elsewhere by the Germans and Chetniks. It then claims that the Partisans used Jasenovac as a concentration camp of their own between 1945 and 1951, and that more inmates lost their lives while it was run by the communists than when it was run by the Usta≈°e. The narrator concedes, however, that there is no documentary evidence proving this hypothesis. Over several months in the summer of 1945, the film contends, the Partisans massacred hundreds of thousands of Croats along the Austrian border, thereby committing one of the worst genocides in European history. Many of those who participated in the killings, it claims, were former Chetniks who had only recently changed allegiance and joined the Partisans. The narrator warns viewers against believing mainstream historical accounts of Croatia's wartime history and states that a number of prominent Croatian citizens, including former presidents Stjepan Mesiƒá and Ivo Josipoviƒá, as well as a number of left- leaning historians and journalists, are conspiring against the country by perpetuating left-wing historical narratives. The film ends with the narrator calling the aforementioned individuals \\"liberal fascists\\". Release and reception The film premiered at The Arab-Hebrew Theater in Tel Aviv on 28 February 2016. Afterwards, it was shown in several Croatian cultural centers in Germany. It had its Croatian premiere at Zagreb's Kino Europa on 4 April 2016, opening to a sold out crowd. The screening was attended by Minister of Culture Zlatko Hasanbegoviƒá and the Israeli ambassador to Croatia, Zina Kalay Kleitman. A controversial figure in his own right, Hasanbegoviƒá once described the Usta≈°e as \\"heroes, martyrs and shahids\\" in a column he wrote for a pro- fascist magazine during the 1990s. Around the same time he was writing for the magazine, Hasanbegoviƒá was also photographed wearing an Usta≈°e-style hat with fascist insignia. His attendance at the premiere thus attracted further controversy. Hasanbegoviƒá spoke positively of the documentary. \\"Such films are useful because they speak about a number of taboo topics,\\" he said. \\"This is the best way to finally shed light on a number of controversial points in Croatian history.\\" Kalay Kleitman objected to the film's premise, calling it offensive to the victims of the Holocaust and their families. She went on to accuse the filmmakers of historical revisionism and downplaying the extent and severity of Usta≈°e crimes. Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, believes the film's premiere was held in Tel Aviv to help deflect accusations of antisemitism On 6 April, the film was shown at the seminary of the Archdiocese of Split-Makarska. The screening was organized by the Croatian Benedictine society, and attended by the Deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Ante Sanader. Its DVD release was accompanied by a shorter documentary, also directed by Sedlar, titled Holokaust u Srbiji, 1941‚Äì1945 (The Holocaust in Serbia, 1941‚Äì1945). Jasenovac was poorly received by the Croatian left. It was also criticized by members of Croatia's Jewish community. The scholar Slavko Goldstein, himself a Holocaust survivor, said the film promotes the idea that \\"Jasenovac was not a death camp, but merely a labour camp or a prisoner camp. A punitive camp, with no mass executions.\\" He further described the film as being \\"full of half-truths, lies and fabrications\\". Croatian Serb leader Milorad Pupovac condemned the film as \\"anti-Serb and anti-Semitic\\". The documentary was also roundly criticized abroad. Political analyst Paul Hockenos describes it as a \\"pro-Ustasha film\\". Journalist Tim Judah, who covered the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, noted that Jasenovac ‚Äì istina is one of several politically charged films that were released in the Balkans in 2016, and muses as to why this is: Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, believes the film's premiere was held in Israel to help deflect accusations of antisemitism. Serbian journalist Mladen Popoviƒá criticizes Sedlar's decision to name his production company Tesla Film, calling it a deliberate provocation and accusing the filmmakers of appropriating the eponymous inventor, thus further denigrating Jasenovac's Serb victims. Controversy =Forged newspaper headline= In April 2016, Lovro Krniƒá, a Croatian journalist writing for the website Lupiga.com, proved that one of the newspaper headlines seen in the film was doctored. The headline in question was said to be from a May 1945 issue of the Croatian Unitary National Liberation Front newspaper Vjesnik and claimed that corpses tossed into the Sava were reaching Zagreb from the direction of Jasenovac. The purpose of its inclusion in the film was to demonstrate that the Partisans were spreading lies about Jasenovac as early as May 1945, given that the Sava flows eastwards away from Zagreb and not towards it. Shortly after the premiere, Krniƒá went through the Zagreb state archives and examined all the May 1945 issues of Vjesnik, the newspaper in question. He found that no such headline exists. Upon closer inspection, Krniƒá discovered that the headline seen in the film had been crudely doctored, likely using Photoshop, since the article seen below the doctored headline matches with another news story unrelated to Jasenovac. By comparing other articles present on the front page, Krniƒá concluded that the original issue of Vjesnik used for the forgery was published on 15 May 1945, and that nothing except the main headline was changed for the film, except the publication date itself, which was obscured in Sedlar's film by a faked damage effect. Sedlar denied forging the headline and maintained that it was authentic. In an interview for N1, a regional news channel, Sedlar said he paid an unnamed private collector in Belgrade to film his copy of the Vjesnik issue, adding that the people who own it are \\"thieves\\" who probably \\"stole it somewhere\\". He added that he does not own a copy himself. =Other alleged misrepresentations and errors= Journalists and scholars uncovered further inaccuracies and misrepresentations in the weeks following the film's release. Journalist Nikola Bajto found that a photograph purporting to show interwar Chetniks in the vicinity of Jasenovac actually depicted World War II-era Slovene Home Guards, as evidenced by the Slovene language slogan Svoboda ali Smrt (\\"Freedom or Death\\") on the banner they are seen holding, which would have been written in Serbian had the depicted individuals actually been Chetniks. A photograph purporting to show a football team made up of camp inmates, supposedly proving that inmates were allowed to partake in recreational activities, was also found to have been misrepresented by the filmmakers. The photograph was taken in the 1970s and shows players from a local lower-league team called NK Balkan Jasenovac. At one point in the film, the narrator refers to late Croatian demographer Vladimir ≈Ωerjaviƒá (who authored a number of scholarly studies on wartime deaths in Yugoslavia) by the traditionally Serb given name of Dragutin, calling him \\"Dragutin ≈Ωerjaviƒá\\". The intention, according to Croatian journalist Vladimir Matijaniƒá, was to discredit ≈Ωerjaviƒá's findings by implying that he was an ethnic Serb. Bajto also criticized the portion of the film where a photograph of P√©tain and G√∂ring at King Alexander's 1934 funeral is shown, with the narrator claiming that any mention of their attendance was omitted from official Yugoslav historiography. Bajto explained that P√©tain and G√∂ring had been among hundreds of European dignitaries at the funeral, and that their presence was not indicative of any pro-fascist sympathies on the part of the Yugoslav monarchy. He notes that their attendance there was not only never concealed, but that the very book from which the filmmakers obtained the photograph had been published in Serbia in the 1950s. The Anti- Fascist League of Croatia, a local non-governmental organization, alleges that the purported Paveliƒá‚ÄìBudak correspondence shown in the film is not authentic, and suggests the letters shown were written on a model of typewriter that was not produced until after the war. Goldstein stated that he had never come across the papers before. Sedlar claims he bought them off the black market. It was also alleged that the filmmakers manipulated videotaped survivor testimony through selective editing in order to portray the Usta≈°e in a more favourable light. \\"The film even includes two alleged guards from the period of the alleged Communist camp: Slovenians identified only by initials and with their faces blurred,\\" the Croatian journalist Sven Milekiƒá writes. \\"While they cannot be identified, they do not look as if they are over 80, as they would have to be if they were guards in 1950.\\" Historians also criticized the filmmakers for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of Usta≈°e prisoners were executed by the Partisans after the war, saying there is no evidence to substantiate such a figure. The filmmakers were also criticized for claiming that the Zagreb Synagogue was the only surviving synagogue in a wartime European capital; it was destroyed along with more than twenty other Croatian synagogues during the war. Photographs of the various stages of the months- long destruction of the Zagreb Synagogue were even taken and exhibited publicly at the Antisemitic Exhibition in Zagreb by Usta≈°e themselves in May 1942. \\"The filmmakers are portraying the Jewish experience in wartime Croatia in the best possible light,\\" Matijaniƒá wrote. \\"There is no mention of the deportation of Zagreb's chief rabbi to Auschwitz, where he was killed.\\" \\"The irony,\\" Bajto notes, \\"is that Sedlar and Hitrec lied and manipulated while accusing the Partisans of doing just that.\\" He goes on to call the entire film \\"a lie\\". =Inclusion in educational institutions= In April 2016, the film was played as part of the religious studies curriculum at a high school in Sisak. The incident caused an uproar among Croatia's anti-fascist left. The Croatian daily Jutarnji list called the incident \\"scandalous\\". The school's principal rejected criticism that it was irresponsible to show the film to high schoolers, arguing that any film could be shown in the classroom as long as it was not banned outright. The Croatian journalist Tomislav ≈†o≈°tariƒá, writing for Al Jazeera Balkans, attributes such incidents to the resurgence of far-right sentiment in Croatia following the HDZ's return to power in the November 2015 parliamentary elections. A number of the country's high schools have since screened the film in their classrooms, according to the Anti- Fascist League of Croatia. Sedlar has stated that he intended to screen the film at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., as well as a Jewish community centre in New York City. He has also stated that the film would be translated into a number of languages and that copies would be donated to dozens of university libraries across Europe and North America. Yad Vashem was among the recipients of the film. In April 2017, Zuroff criticized the organization for having the film as part of its media repertoire. \\"The fact that an item is in the collection is in no way an endorsement of its content, but only reflects that it is about our subject of interest,\\" said Robert Rozett, Yad Vashem's libraries director. He noted that the library collection contains more than 161,000 printed items and some 7,000 films, including those that deny the Holocaust. =Lawsuit and award controversy= In July 2016, the Anti-Fascist League of Croatia filed a lawsuit against Sedlar alleging that the film incited ethnic intolerance and promoted Holocaust denial. They allege that Sedlar misrepresented the extent and severity of the crimes committed at Jasenovac, trying to portray it as \\"a communist myth\\". Sedlar was also accused of deliberately neglecting to discuss the involvement of Usta≈°e units in war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The lawsuit points to the doctored newspaper headline as evidence, and alleges that the correspondence between Paveliƒá and Budak that is seen in the film was doctored as well. \\"By creating untruths,\\" the League asserts, \\"[Sedlar] says something extremely negative regarding the Serb minority in the film, creating an atmosphere of hatred and intolerance and demonizing certain groups and their members in a typical process of creating the preconditions for promoting animosity and hatred among the public.\\" In April 2017, Sedlar wrote an open letter to the Zagreb Assembly in response to the allegations. \\"Never, not in a single film or public appearance of mine, have I ever incited hatred or tried to deny any crime; never in any thoughts did I say anything positive about fascism. Fascism, like communism, is an evil that only a sick man can support and promote.\\" Sedlar was subsequently accused of falsely attributing a quote to Winston Churchill in another part of the letter. In April 2017, the Zagreb Assembly received a motion to honour Sedlar from the Committee for Public Recognition, headed by Mayor Milan Bandiƒá. The proposal was criticized by the Croatian Jewish community, as well as by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. Zuroff wrote a letter to the Assembly requesting that the motion be dismissed. \\"We urge you to unequivocally reject any proposal to honour Sedlar, whose work belongs in the dustbin of Croatian history and is not worthy of any approval or recognition,\\" Zuroff wrote. On 19 April 2017, the Assembly announced that it had accepted Sedlar's nomination, and bestowed upon him the Award of the City of Zagreb, along with ‚Ç¨4,000 in prize money. Rival groups of protesters stood outside the Zagreb Assembly while the announcement was being made, with anti-fascist and left-wing groups demonstrating against Sedlar and Croatian veterans of the Yugoslav Wars expressing their support.

The clubs first played against each other in 1913, and was for many decades considered the biggest encounter in Minas Gerais. With the fallback suffered by Am√©rica due to initially refusing to become a professional club and the rise of Cruzeiro, it lost its status as the most important derby in the state, but the rivalry between Am√©rica and Atl√©tico continued.  History  Atl√©tico Mineiro was founded in 1908 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais; Am√©rica emerged four years later. The first match between the two clubs happened on 13 November 1913, and finished 1‚Äì1. The two clubs, together with Yale, took part in the Ta√ßa Bueno Brand√£o in 1914. It was the first competition organised in the state, and was won by Atl√©tico. In 1915, Atl√©tico also won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais. The competition was then organised by the Liga Mineira de Sports Athl√©ticos, which would later become the Federa√ß√£o Mineira de Futebol. Despite Atl√©tico's initial success, Am√©rica was the dominant force in the first decades of the encounter. It won the following ten editions of the Campeonato Mineiro, and Atl√©tico only won the state league again in 1926. The matches between the two clubs were known in their early days as the Cl√°ssico das Multid√µes (\\"Derby of the Masses\\") as they were the most popular clubs in the state. Atl√©tico Mineiro was founded by liberal, upper-class students, but from an early age it opened its doors to players from every social class, nationality or ethnicity, which earned it a \\"people's club\\" status in Belo Horizonte and in the state. Am√©rica, meanwhile, had a reputation as an elitist club. In the 1930s, Atl√©tico pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas Am√©rica resisted against it. Am√©rica suffered a setback as a result of its internal disagreements regarding professionalism. A controversial Campeonato Mineiro final happened in 1948, when Am√©rica won 3‚Äì1 with what was known as the \\"gol do guarda\\" (\\"guard goal\\"). The match was disputed at Am√©rica's Est√°dio da Alamaeda, and Atl√©tico could draw to be crowned champion. When Am√©rica was winning 2‚Äì1, forward Murilinho kicked the ball, after which it bounced on a municipal officer and entered the goal. The goal was confirmed by English referee John Barrick, and Am√©rica was champion of the competition.

It was owned and operated by the Jacobson family for 127 years. One generation overlapped the next, which led to a gradual evolution of changes instead of sudden changes. with This evolution is exemplified in the house and barn, which have been altered over the years to accommodate changing needs but contain some of their original construction. The original portions of the buildings shows a mastery of Norwegian log construction. The later additions were also built according to the Norwegian tradition as independent units, but using framing techniques that adapted from American builders. There is also a substantial amount of written documentation in the form of letters, diaries, tax receipts, and photographs that help to precisely document the history of the farm. Another historical aspect of the farm is its association with Abraham Jacobson, who was the second generation owner/operator. He had made a connection with Robert Todd Lincoln, the son of Abraham Lincoln, when he studied theology in Springfield, Illinois in the 1850s. The two remained in contact over the years. Jacobson served the Lutheran Church until he left the ministry in 1887 to take over the farm's operations.

And the boy, thinking no evil, drew the cork out of the bottle.\\" The episode starts as Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) gets her memories of Nick (David Giuntoli) back. This is revealed to be Nick's dream, to his disappointment. A father, William (Josh Stewart) and his daughter, April (Jade Pettyjohn) arrive at a gas station where William's cards are rejected. Later, the cashier in the stop is killed. As the police discover their truck's plates, William and April are forced to hitchhike. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) continues to be in charge of the spice shop and receives instructions from Rosalee (Bree Turner) to deliver a recipe for a man with hearing problems. Monroe makes the recipe, but during the preparation he places an incorrect ingredient. This causes the man to cut all his things maniacally and Monroe forced to call Rosalee for help in an antidote. Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) raid William's house to find his wife, Lilly (October Moore) bleeding. In the station, they deduce William kidnapped April. Juliette visits the station and while greeting everyone, feels a tension when she meets Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz). Renard gets a call from Adalind (Claire Coffee) to ask for her mother's murder. He refuses to talk about the murder and asks her what she did to Juliette. Adalind taunts him as Renard realizes he typed Juliette's name in the computer. Wu (Reggie Lee) discovers that William may have been ordering things for an underground construction. While looking for clues in the trailer, Hank is told by Nick that Monroe was the one who saved his life from Stark and acknowledges that he owes him his life. The police discover April and take her while William visits his wife in the hospital. Nick and Hank ambush him in the hospital but discover that April was in fact the one who killed the cashier and attacked Lilly as she is going through an \\"early change\\". April is accidentally placed with a foster family and attacks the father as Nick and Hank find her. A friend of Monroe takes April to the juvie while Nick joins Juliette for dinner.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Judging by overall plot structure, 'The Bottle Imp' isn't just a formulaic episode of Grimm, but a relentlessly predictable hour that offers very little to viewers looking for something more than a show that can easily fade into the background while the rest of the country watches baseball.\\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \\"Oh, Grimm, how cruel you are! Or maybe I should be saying the sandman is a very, very cruel creature. In any case, Nick's dream of Juliette remembering him and giving him a big smooch is just about the last kind of dream Nick would want to be tricked into believing is real.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"One of Grimms best assets is the ability to show someone‚Äôs true colors. What is just below the exterior of a character? 'The Bottle Imp' did just that, and in a way that made both the procedural story and the continuing character arcs richer.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"In the world of Grimm, you never know what people are capable of. The show has continually hit on the idea that what we present to the public are merely facades, what we want them to see rather than who we actually are. We're all hiding something that we'd rather not share with anyone that we know, let alone the strangers that we encounter on a daily basis. Unfortunately for some, they have to hide an entire identity for fear of the reaction that other people would have to who they truly are.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"I think much of this is due to the semi-serialized, semi-episodic nature of the show. More than just a mythology-episodes-versus-monster-of-the-week series, Grimm straddles the line between television where what happened the week before doesn't matter, and an epic, over-arching story where everything matters. The show has been able to be both this season by throwing dashes of greater mythology into every episode, so here's hoping 'The Bottle Imp' is a bump in an otherwise smoother Season 2 road.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Bottle Imp (Grimm)"},{"id":"51126031","text":"CAMPA Act or Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act is an Indian legislation that seeks to provide an appropriate institutional mechanism, both at the Centre and in each State and Union Territory, to ensure expeditious utilization in efficient and transparent manner of amounts released in lieu of forest land diverted for non-forest purpose which would mitigate impact of diversion of such forest land. History The ministry of environment and forest, New Delhi issued a notification on 23 April 2004 describing the constitution, management and functions of the CAMPA committee. The act was sent for examination under a standing committee. It was passed by Rajya Sabha on 28 July 2016. Compensatory Afforestation Fund This is money paid by developers who have razed forest land for their construction projects, and the idea is that such land destroyed needs to be made good by regenerating forest elsewhere on non-forest land. Purpose The legislation established the Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) and the Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF). The proposed legislation will also ensure expeditious utilization of accumulated unspent amounts available with the ad hoc Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), which presently is of the order of Rs. 39,000 crore, and fresh accrual of compensatory levies and interest on accumulated unspent balance, which will be of the order of approximately Rs. 6,000 crore per annum, in an efficient and transparent manner.

Only a few members of this gens are known, and the Tarpeii vanish from history after the early Republic. The Tarpeian Rock, a promontory on the Capitoline Hill, from which those condemned for treason were thrown to their deaths, is said to have been named after Tarpeia, the archetype of all Roman traitors.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III. p. 976 (\\"Tarpeia\\", \\"Tarpeia Gens\\"). There seems to have been a senatorial family of this name in imperial times. Origin The nomen Tarpeius belongs to a common class of gentilicia formed using the suffix -eius. Such names are typical of Sabine gentes, perhaps explaining the association of the Tarpeii with the war of Romulus against the Sabines at the beginning of Roman history.Chase, pp. 120, 121. Branches and cognomina The only cognomina associated with the Tarpeii of the Republic are Montanus and Capitolinus, both of which belong to a class of surnames derived from the names of places, in this case both probably referring to the original residence of the Tarpeii, on the Capitoline Hill.Chase, p. 114. The Tarpeii of imperial times bore common surnames such as Valens, powerful, and Faustus, fortunate.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. valens.Chase, p. 111.

He first appeared as a supporting character in the first season (set in 2006‚Äì2007), played by Keith Carradine, and then as a main character in season two (set in 1979), played by Patrick Wilson. Character summary =Season 1= Solverson has a minor role in season one. In 2006, he is a retired police officer, and is the owner of Lou's Coffee Shop. A widower, he appears as a wise mentor to his daughter, Molly Solverson who is investigating the crimes of Lorne Malvo and Lester Nygaard. He makes several references to his career, in particular the events of 1979, most notably when he describes the Sioux Falls incident to Malvo. Lou Solverson in season one =Season 2= In 1979, Lou Solverson is a state trooper with the Minnesota State Police and based out of Luverne, Minnesota. He often works alongside his father-in-law, Rock County sheriff Hank Larsson. One night, the two are assigned to investigate a triple murder at the Waffle Hut on the outskirts of Luverne. He notes the strangeness of the shooter (Rye Gerhardt -- youngest son of the Gerhardt crime family) apparently fleeing the scene in a different vehicle after parking his own car outside the diner, with another car belonging to a Judge based out of Fargo, North Dakota. Unbeknownst to Lou and Hank, Rye was hit by beautician Peggy Blumquist's car after he had run into the road after seeing a UFO. Peggy, not knowing what to do, returns home with Rye stuck through her windshield, where he is later killed by her husband, local butcher Ed Blumquist, in self- defense. At home, Lou is dealing with the worsening cancer of his wife Betsy while also raising their 6-year-old daughter, Molly. Later, while driving his family into town, Lou stops by the crime scene where Betsy finds Rye's gun in some weeds. Later that night, Lou sees a light on inside the closed butcher shop and finds Ed working late. Lou asks to buy some bacon for Molly, while Ed does his best to distract Lou from noticing a severed finger that had rolled under a door; he stayed late to dispose of Rye's body in a meat grinder. Lou eventually leaves unaware of what was really happening, and Ed finishes grinding Rye's body as strange flashing lights illuminate the exterior of the butcher shop. The fingerprints on the gun are later found out to be Rye's, which leads to a wider manhunt for him. After identifying his suspect, Lou travels to Fargo and meets Detective Ben Schmidt to collaborate on the investigation. They encounter a local typewriter salesman named Skip Sprang, who had enlisted Rye to talk Judge Mundt into un-freezing an account, acting suspiciously outside of her office. They ask him some questions but decide to let him go. They then visit the Gerhardt farm and have a tense encounter with the family (Floyd, the matriarch in charge after her husband Otto suffered a stroke -- Bear, the quieter, level-headed middle child -- and Dodd, the hot- tempered elder son vying for control of the family), who also know Schmidt along with his mother. Lou then visits Skip's typewriter store on his own, only to encounter Mike Milligan and the Kitchen brothers (Kansas City associates whom Hank had detained the day before in Luverne) searching the place. After a tense Mexican standoff, Lou quickly leaves the shop. When he returns home, he learns that Betsy's cancer is spreading, but learns that Betsy can take part in an experimental drug trial for a drug called Xanadu, but there is a 50/50 chance that Betsy would receive a placebo. Lou hesitates for Betsy to participate in the trial, but Betsy accepts anyway. After escorting presidential nominee Ronald Reagan's campaign bus to the state line, Lou links the Blumquists to Rye's death after Ed and Peggy stage a wreck to cover up the damage and take the car to local mechanic Sonny Greer, and Sonny catches Gerhardt enforcer Hanzee Dent inspecting the car. Growing suspicious of the Blumquists' role in Rye's death, he visits their house to question them. They refuse to talk to him and ask him to leave. Peggy takes Lou's warning about the Gerhardts' reputation for violence very seriously and plans to leave town, but Ed insists on staying. The next night, the Gerhardts send hitman Virgil Bauer, accompanied by Bear Gerhardt's son Charlie, to kill Ed in the shop. After Charlie hesitates to finish the job, Ed kills Virgil in self- defense, Charlie is wounded and arrested, and the shop burns to the ground. While Lou is interrogating Ed at the sheriff's office, Bear leads a lynch mob that lays siege to the station in an attempt to take Charlie back. To avoid anyone from getting hurt, Lou sends out Ed's new lawyer, family friend Karl Weathers, to tell Bear and his men that he is now acting as Charlie's lawyer and that he will be given a reduced sentence due to him being a minor and not actually hurting anyone. After Bear accepts that it would be worse for Charlie to be a wanted fugitive for the rest of his life, he and his men leave. Meanwhile, Lou sneaks out the back with Ed without being seen or hurt, but Ed eventually escapes with Hanzee in close pursuit as Lou is picked up by Hank. While Ed and Lou are escaping the Luverne police station, Dodd and two of his men enter the Blumquist home hunting for Peggy after Hank (who stayed behind with Peggy) was knocked out by Hanzee earlier. She hides in the basement and manages to bludgeon one man to death. After Dodd accidentally kills the other man, she sneaks up and electrocutes him with his own cattle prod before tying him up. Ed arrives and they flee in Dodd's car after placing him in the trunk. Lou and Schmidt arrive at the Gerhardt family farm after a funeral for Rye and Otto (who was killed in an ambush on the farm by Milligan), and take Floyd in for questioning at the Fargo police headquarters. She accepts a deal that will give her family amnesty for previous crimes they have committed in exchange for information about how the Kansas City syndicate runs their drug operation. Ed, Peggy and a captive Dodd arrive at a cabin in the woods outside Sioux Falls that once belonged to Ed's uncle in order to figure out their next move. After repeated attempts to call and make a deal with the Gerhardts for the safe return of Dodd in exchange for their own safety fall flat, Ed calls Milligan offering Dodd in exchange for protection from the Gerhardts, to which Milligan agrees. Ed informs him to meet at the Motor Motel the next day. Hanzee eventually tracks them down, but kills Dodd instead after a lifetime of being treated like his dog. Hanzee asks Peggy for a haircut, but just as she's about to start, Lou and Hank arrive. Hanzee fires at them before Peggy stabs him in the shoulder with her scissors. He manages to escape, but Ed and Peggy are captured. Due to them not being in their own jurisdiction, Lou and Hank call in the South Dakota State Police. When Ed reveals his upcoming rendezvous with Mike Milligan to hand over the now-dead Dodd Gerhardt, State Police Captain Cheney hatches a dangerous scheme for Ed and Peggy to wear a wire for the meeting, hoping to implicate Milligan and the Kansas City mob. When Lou strongly opposes this idea knowing that Milligan would see right through the ruse, Cheney has him escorted out of state, though Hank elects to stay behind. After Ed and Peggy agree to the plan in exchange for lesser criminal charges, the police set up an ambush at the motel meeting spot, only for Hanzee to observe their actions from a distance. Hanzee later uses this to betray the Gerhardts, informing them that Kansas City is holding Dodd captive. Meanwhile, Lou, who has discovered that Hanzee killed a gas station attendant, goes back to warn the other police that Hanzee likely knows of their plan. At the same time, Lou is unaware that Betsy has fallen seriously ill back home. Lou arrives at the motel too late as the Gerhardts have ambushed Cheney and the other officers before realizing they're actually cops. He fires at Bear, who is unfazed. He begins to wrestle with and strangle Lou before the same UFO that Rye encountered appears above them, distracting nearly everyone left alive. Lou uses the opportunity to shoot a distracted Bear in the head, while Peggy uses a pot of boiling coffee to wound Hanzee in order to escape with Ed. Hanzee fires at them, causing the UFO to leave. Lou begins firing at Hanzee, but misses and he escapes. With the entire Gerhardt family and all of the South Dakota cops now dead except for a wounded Hank and Schmidt, Lou continues his pursuit of both the Blumquists and Hanzee. Hanzee chases Ed and Peggy, with Lou not far behind attempting to bring an end to the madness. Hanzee kills a passing motorist whom Ed and Peggy flag down before wounding Ed as he and Peggy flee down an alley. The pair take shelter in a supermarket, hiding in the meat locker. While holed up inside, Ed confides to Peggy that he does not think they will make it as a couple, upsetting her. He then succumbs to blood loss, causing Peggy to break down mentally and hallucinate that Hanzee has lit the supermarket on fire in an attempt to smoke them out, when in actuality, Hanzee has fled the scene. Lou, now aided by Schmidt, arrives and subdues Peggy. While driving her back to Minnesota to be prosecuted, the two converse about life and death, with Peggy finally accepting her fate. Meanwhile, Betsy has recuperated from the side-effects of the experimental cancer drug she was taking. When Lou returns home, he, Betsy, and Hank gather around as the three ponder what the future holds for each of them and for their family. Production Patrick Wilson was Noah Hawley's initial pick for the role of a younger Lou Solverson in season two. Wilson, along with the rest of the cast, worked with a dialect coach prior to the filming of the series. Hawley purposely tried to distinguish the younger version of Lou and the older version of Lou, saying that \\"Patrick Wilson has a confidence and he‚Äôs comfortable, but he‚Äôs not Keith Carradine yet. This journey will get him to a place where he can finally settle into his life and really be back from the war.\\" Reception Wilson received critical acclaim for his performance. Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture compared Wilson's performance to Robert De Niro's Academy Award winning performance as a young Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II, writing: \\"It‚Äôs a remarkable feat of acting continuity, in that it syncs up perfectly with Carradine‚Äôs performance in season one, yet it never feels like Wilson is doing an impression. He‚Äôs a young man, and he‚Äôs in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn‚Äôt fully acknowledged because he‚Äôs not ready yet. You get a sense of a personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving. It deserves to be likened to Robert DeNiro‚Äôs work as the young Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II. I don‚Äôt make that comparison lightly. He‚Äôs that good.\\" Alan Sepinwall of Hitfix, wrote that \\"there's still that irrepressible sense of upper Midwestern politeness, even in the face of horror and madness, and given spectacular voice by Wilson. He doesn't much resemble the young Keith Carradine, but the role's otherwise a perfect fit for the contrast between his bland, square-jawed demeanor and the obvious intelligence that's always flashing underneath. Watching Lou slowly but surely untangle the mess he's been handed gives you a fine idea of where Molly got her investigative gifts.\\" =Accolades= For his performance in season 2, Wilson was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Movie/Miniseries and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Miniseries or Television Film.

The operation was carried out as part of the American-led intervention in Syria. Reports of the death toll varied, ranging from 56 to 212 civilians being killed with \\"entire families\\" pulverized. Background The American-led intervention in Syria has been ongoing since 22 September 2014, after the United States intervened in the Syrian Civil War against the Islamic State. From May 31 to August 27 2016 the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of anti-ISIL militias led by the YPG, successfully campaigned to capture the city of Manbij and its outskirts in Aleppo governorate. US air support played a key role in this offensive, with US airstrikes hitting Islamic State militants in and around the city. AirWars director Chris Wood said of civilian casualties prior to the massacre, \\"Since the siege began it‚Äôs our view that at least 190 civilians have been killed by coalition airstrikes, mostly US. We are concerned that the US-led alliance appears to have relaxed some of their rules concerning civilian casualties\\". Since the beginning of the American-led intervention in Syria, independent monitoring group Airwars estimate 1,422 civilians have been killed in airstrikes carried out by the US Air Force, though the overall total could be as high as between 3,181 and 4,267 civilian non-combatant fatalities from 493 separate reported incidents. Attack On Tuesday 19 July 2016, American warplanes attacked the Syrian village of Tokhar, which was housing civilians displaced by the fighting between the Islamic State and the Syrian Democratic Forces. ‚ÄúThis is likely the worst reported civilian toll of any coalition attack since the bombing campaign against ISIS began nearly two years ago,‚Äù said AirWars director Chris Wood. Investigation On 27 July 2016, Colonel Chris Garver, spokesman for the coalition fighting Islamic State, said the United States military has found enough credible information to begin a formal investigation. Garver said a credibility assessment had been completed and the formal investigation had been initiated. Reactions ;From subnational bodies: *': UNICEF's Syria representative, Hanaa Singer, condemned the bombings, calling \\"such horrific incidents confront parties to this conflict with their shared responsibility to respect international humanitarian laws that protect children in war\\". ;From states: *': Colonel Chris Garver, spokesman for CJTF-OIR, the U.S. led coalition launching airstrikes in Syria, announced that the latter was investigating reports of civilian deaths. * ': The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Iran Bahram Ghasemi condemned the airstrikes saying ‚ÄúKilling of innocent people particularly women and children, no matter what is the aim and under any pretext, is doomed and considered unacceptable and against the international law‚Äù. *': The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sharply criticized U.S. airstrikes in Syria, accusing the United States of not taking steps to warn civilians ahead of strikes, as well as accusing them of killing hundreds of civilians and wounding thousands in airstrikes. ;From other regional actors: *': Anas Al-Abdah, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, condemned the airstrikes and asked for a thorough investigation of the incident as well as changes in the coalition's operating rules. *': The SDF-led Manbij Military Council denied coalition responsibility for the massacre and instead blamed ISIL forces for the deaths. The SDF also condemned the SNC's proposal for the coalition to cease airstrikes in the area saying it would cause an increase in SDF casualties and slow the fight against ISIL. * Ahrar al-Sham: In an online statement, Ahrar al-Sham condemned coalition airstrikes in Manbij and called for the Coalition to take full responsibility for the bombings which enabled SDF gains, whom Ahrar al-Sham labels as PKK terrorists. Aftermath On 28 July 2016, US airstrikes killed at least 28 civilians, mostly women and including seven children, in the nearby village of Ghandoura.

The three-storey hotel was designed by George Charles Inskip (1840-1931) and built by Jordine and Ruthven for James Herbert Junior (1841-1893). Herbert was the proprietor of the Rockingham Arms and the Freemasons Hotel. Inskip was a Melbourne based architect, who came to Western Australia in 1879 to superintend work on Edmund Blacket‚Äôs design for St George's Cathedral, Perth. Inskip subsequently was commissioned to design a new Union Bank in Albany in 1884. Inskip also designed the Union Bank buildings in Perth, Fremantle, Roebourne and Geraldton. At the time it was built, the Federal was described in the press as being ‚Äúfar in advance of anything so far erected in Western Australia and equal to the best in the sister colonies‚Äù. In August 1888 Herbert filed for bankruptcy and the receivers subsequently arranged for the property to be transferred to Alexander Forrest and Sir John Forrest. In 1904, local architect, Joseph Herbert Eales (1864-1957) was responsible for extensive additions to the Federal Hotel, including the front verandahs and the western wing, which extends towards the rear of the premises. On 8 February 1927 the hotel was the scene of a double murder, when Lillian Josephine Martin and her four-year-old son Daniel Charles were found dead in an upstairs bedroom of the building. Martin, her son and Jack Thomas had booked into the hotel under the name of Mr and Mrs Martin on 7 February. Thomas left the hotel at 7:30am the following day and the bodies of Martin and her son were discovered at 11:00am by a house maid. Martin had been strangled and her son's throat had been cut. An extensive search was then undertaken by the police for Thomas, whose body was later found near the Mends Street Jetty in South Perth on 13 February. The coroner subsequently concluded that Thomas had committed both murders and then committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver. In 1989 the hotel was renamed to Rosie O'Grady's, an Irish themed pub. In 1995 the building underwent internal alterations, reconstruction of the two-storey front verandah and repainting of the front fa√ßade, with the works being carried out by Maxwell Cox Architects. Further internal changes were made in 2001. In January 2016 Rosie O'Grady's closed for business and the hotel was re-opened as the Federal Hotel. Heritage listings On 21 October 1980 the building was included on the Register of the National Estate and 1 August 1983 it was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA). The City of Fremantle included it on their Municipal Inventory on 18 September 2000 and on their Heritage List on 8 March 2007.

The film had its world premiere on 5 August 2015 at the Fantasy Film Festival and centers on a young Australian family who are terrorized by a pack of wild dogs. Despite the title, the film is not a remake of the 1977 film of the same name. Plot The film opens with a sitter hearing sounds and going out to her barn to investigate. A short time later, his friend awakens from her easy chair by the fireplace to see his cigarette burning in the ashtray, but he is not in the house. She goes to find him and hears a noise in the barn. As she enters the barn, she is killed by an unknown creature. The next morning a neighboring sitter, Abi, finds several of her sheep dead after having their throats ripped out by a creature in the night. Meanwhile, her friend Carla is working in her veterinary clinic and hears the report of the dead sitters on the radio. She snaps off the radio and sends her son Henry out to play. The daughter Sophie is on the roof of the vet clinic, laying in a lounger and talking to her friend on the radio. Carla sits at her desk, picks up the overdue $435 radio bill and angrily calls her daughter, who ignores her. Sophie storms into the clinic and argues with her about school life being solitary confinement and how they should move into the city; Carla counters this by suggesting she help out around the house or get a job to help pay the radio bill. Carla sends the children in the house and calls for her friend over the walkie talkie. The bank manager arrives and, during the course of the conversation, it is revealed that their payments are in arrears and the house is being foreclosed, despite Carla's clinic being a new source of income. The snide and sarcastic bank manager tells them they can take the reduced amount of $200,000 for their barn or be forced out in 48 hours, but Adam refuses to sell, as the only reason they are unprofitable is because the sheep keep being attacked and stating that they will never have to leave. The manager drives off and stops on the side of the road to urinate, but before he can return to his car, he is promptly attacked by a pack of wild dogs that viciously tear his flesh and drag him down the hill. Later that night, the family is having a quiet evening. Sophie, who is in the shower, does not notice the shadow of a dog in the hall. When Carla and Henry go into the basement to change a fuse, she jump-scares him and teases him about being afraid. Adam goes outside to start the generator, when he realizes the family dog is missing. Calling for it, he walks to the edge of the forest and sees a few sets of yellow eyes staring back at him. He backs away from the forest as howling begins and large shadows start to pursue him, and rushes back into the house just ahead of the dogs who try to get into the house. When he goes to get his rifle, he notices that there are only two bullets and questions Carla about it, who tells them that they have been going missing, although it was revealed earlier in the film to be Henry who is taking them, Carla calls the police and tells them there is a break-in, while Adam trains his rifle on the door and shoots through it, hitting the dog. He opens the door to see if it is dead and is attacked by it, and accidentally fires off his other round before dropping his rifle, which skids out the door. Carla grabs a weapon and begins to beat the dog. A police officer arrives at the house to investigate and attempts to radio in to the police precinct. He gets out of his vehicle and as he approaches the house, the pack viciously attacks him before dragging his body into the woods. Adam goes out to his pick-up truck and lets the family know it is safe to come out so they can escape in the truck. Just then, a dog leaps through his window, breaking the glass and biting him. He hits the gas and the truck leaps forward, plowing into the police car and totaling both vehicles. Carla hides Sophie and Henry in the pantry, while an injured Adam goes out to the vet clinic to get additional ammo. Adam gets into the clinic and finds there are only a few shells left. He hears a noise in the other room and creeps over to find a wild dog eating the animals in cages. Sophie begins calling him over the walkie talkie, which alerts the dog to his presence and it attacks him; he fights it off with the rifle. Meanwhile, another wild dog is trying to get into the closet and attack the children, but Carla stabs it with a kitchen knife and it runs off. They make an alternate plan to climb up onto the roof of the vet clinic. Adam goes first to snipe the dogs, while the children stealthily go through the interior dog run. Henry stops to spread some liquid to distract wolves and to collect some unused rifle shells he has hidden there. Carla has been making firebombs from flammable liquid she had in the house to throw at the dogs, while the children run across the last patch of lawn to the ladder. The leader of the pack sees Carla and runs toward her. As she runs back for the house, she sees it closing in on her. She goes to the pick-up truck instead and climbs through the back window to get the tire iron and beat it. She fights it off long enough to get the truck door open. As it leaps through the window, she slams the door, closing the dog inside. She hides under the truck, but is soon dragged out by the dog. As she sits at the side of the truck with the crowbar still in hand, the lead dog approaches her slowly, snarling and showing his teeth. As he is about to attack, Adam appears on the back of the truck, and shoots the dog in the head, killing him instantly. As day breaks, the dogs flee off into the woods and the bloodied exhausted parents lead the children back to the house and the family dog comes bounding out of nowhere to join them. The camera pans above the house and through the forest before a close-up of a dark cave entrance. A pair of yellow eyes, like the ones from earlier in the film, peer out from the darkness before the end credits begin.

He was the first black school board member in Fort Worth and served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985. He was the author of numerous books about the history of African Americans in North Texas.  Biography  = Early life and education = Reby Cary was born September 9, 1920 in Fort Worth, Texas. His father was the Reverend Smith Cary (d. 1969), founder of the Rising Star Baptist Church and native of Jacksonville, Texas. Cary grew up in a strict, religious household and credited his mother with his success, explaining that, \\"When my friends were out playing marbles, my mother would say, ‚ÄòGet back in the house and study.‚Äô If she saw me with my head outside of a book, my behind would soon be on fire. It never changed.‚Äù As a child during the Depression, Cary mowed yards to earn money. He graduated from Fort Worth's renowned I.M. Terrell High School in 1937. In 1941, he earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from historically black Prairie View A&M; University. When Cary was drafted into military service in 1942, he had completed coursework toward a master's degree at Prairie View. Cary received his draft notice in 1942 and enlisted in the United States Coast Guard. He was one of the first African Americans to graduate from the Coast Guard's radioman school in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Cary was assigned to the USS Cambria and served the Pacific Theater of World War II, including the invasions of Saipan and Okinawa. Cary completed his master's degree in history and political science at Prairie View after his discharge and later undertook postgraduate coursework at North Texas State University and Texas Christian University. = Career = Reby Cary in the 68th Texas legislature Returning from the war and unable to find radio work as a black man in Jim Crow-era Texas, Cary began a long career in the field of education. When local black men were refused the educational opportunities offered to returning white GIs, Cary and two colleagues established the McDonald College of Industrial Arts (later named the Southwestern College of Industrial Arts) in Fort Worth's Riverside neighborhood. Cary held the position of personnel director there until he returned to graduate school in 1948. After completing his master's degree, Cary taught history in local public schools and in higher education. He taught history at Fort Worth's Dunbar High School until 1967, when he became the first black instructor at Tarrant County Junior College. In 1969, he became the first black professor at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). From 1969 to 1974, he was an assistant professor and associate dean of student life; from 1974 to 1978, he was the director of minority of affairs. In the early 1970s, he led a successful crusade to remove Confederate symbols from the UTA campus and was instrumental in establishing a Minorities Cultural Center, focusing on books and materials about black history and the Chicano movement. In 1974, Cary launched his political career as the first black school board member elected to the Fort Worth ISD school board. He then served three terms in the Texas House of Representatives, where he was a member of the county affairs, energy, rules and resolutions, budget and oversight, and government organization committees. Though Cary served as a Democrat during his time as a Texas legislator, he became an outspoken supporter of Republican Texas politicians Bill Clements and Phil Gramm. He switched to the Republican Party, citing the white-dominated Democratic Party's poor history with slavery and civil rights. Cary cited local African-American banker and Republican politician William \\"Gooseneck\\" McDonald as a major influence. Cary held leadership positions in the Texas Council of Black Republicans and founded the Frederick Douglass Republicans of Tarrant County in 1985 after his final term in the Texas House. = Personal life = Cary married Nadine Lois Spencer (1921-2003) on May 19, 1945, before the end of World War II. They had one child, Faith Cary in 1963.Ancestry.com. U.S. City Directories, 1822-1995 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011.

The expedition was intended to continue the work of the previous British Arctic Air Route Expedition (BAARE) that had mapped unexplored sections of Greenland in 1930‚Äì1931. Expedition This expedition was to be a one-year venture financed by Pan American Airways as part of a project of eventually building an air base in the Arctic. The members of this expedition were only four: Gino Watkins as leader, John Rymill (surveyor), Freddie Spencer Chapman (ornithologist and photographer) and Quintin Riley (meteorologist). Their aim was to follow up their work of the previous summer's British Arctic Air Route Expedition as well as undertaking meteorological observations for Pan Am. The expedition began in July 1932. However, on 20 August Watkins died while hunting for seals in Tuttilik (Tugtilik Fjord). His empty kayak was found floating upside down by his companions. His body was never found. Rymill assumed leadership of the expedition and he, Spencer Chapman and Riley decided to continue the expedition but were forced to limit its scope. They wintered in Greenland and surveyed area of about collecting flora and fauna specimens in the process. Chapman and his companions went through many hardships during the winter, braving rough weather conditions. In the spring Chapman spent a month among Ammassalik Inuit studying local birds, meanwhile Rymill and Riley surveyed the coast in order to improve on the maps of the area. The expedition concluded at the end of the 1933 summer season. The three members reached Reykjavik on 24 September, catching a steamer to Hull and returning finally to the United Kingdom in the fall of 1933.

Muslin, a cotton fabric of plain weave, was hand woven in the region around Dhaka, Bengal (now Bangladesh), and exported to Europe, the Middle East, and other markets, for much of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Origins  Bengal has manufactured textiles for many centuries, as recorded in ancient hand-written and printed documents. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions Arab and Greek merchants trading between India and the Red Sea port of Aduli (in present-day Eritrea), Egypt and Ethiopia in the second century CE. Cloths including muslin were exchanged for ivory, tortoiseshell and rhinoceros-horn at that time. Muslin was traded from Barygaza ‚Äì an ancient port of India located in Gujarat ‚Äì to different parts of Indian subcontinent before European merchants came to India. The Romans prized muslin highly, using bullion and gold coins to buy the material from Deccan and South India. They introduced muslin into Europe, and eventually it became very popular. A Chinese voyager, Ma Huan, wrote about five or six varieties of fine cloths after visiting Bengal in the early fifteenth century; he mentions that Bengal muslin was highly priced in China at that time. Mughal era Mughal princes wearing muslin robes in 1665 Under Mughal rule, Bengal was a center of the worldwide muslin, silk and pearl trades.Lawrence B. Lesser. \\"Historical Perspective\\".

This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.About the Country Studies / Area Handbooks Program: Country Studies - Federal Research Division, Library of Congress During the Mughal era, the most important center of cotton production was Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being called \\"daka\\" in distant markets such as Central Asia.Richard Maxwell Eaton (1996), The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760, page 202, University of California Press Bengal also exported cotton and silk textiles to markets such as Europe, Indonesia and Japan.John F. Richards (1995), The Mughal Empire, page 202, Cambridge University Press Bengal produced more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia, for example.Om Prakash, \\"Empire, Mughal\\", History of World Trade Since 1450, edited by John J. McCusker, vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2006, pp. 237-240, World History in Context. Retrieved 3 August 2017 =Sixteenth century= In the early sixteenth century, a Portuguese apothecary named Tomes Pires mentioned that Bengal muslins were traded to Thailand and China. Bengali muslin was also traded throughout the Muslim world, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. By 1580, some Portuguese traders settled at Dhaka and Sripur, from where they started exporting muslin, cotton and silk goods to Europe and Southeast Asia. During Ottoman rule from the sixteenth century onwards, large quantities of muslin was exported to the Middle East. Muslin turbans were favoured by the Ottomans. In the sixteenth century, Portuguese started trading textiles from the Indian subcontinent through the Persian Gulf including high quality of muslins. In the seventeenth century, the Portuguese trade declined. =Seventeenth century= In the early seventeenth century, British and Dutch merchants arrived at the Indian Subcontinent sailing via the Red Sea. At the same time, Armenian merchants from Iran came to the Indian subcontinent travelling on land through Qandahar and Isfahan. They traded textile goods including muslin from Bengal to Aleppo of Syria. In an official inventory of Istanbul market dated from 1640, 20 types of muslins were found and the highest value found there is 1600 silver pence. As the business expanded, European companies became interested in founding their own factories in Dhaka. The Dutch made their factory in Dhaka in 1663, the British in 1669 and the French in 1682. =Eighteenth century= The Ostend Company came to Bengal at the beginning of the eighteenth century. They purchased textiles through agents and their own officials. When they found the business very profitable, they also made settlements in Dhaka. Available statistics show that in 1747 the trade of Dhaka cotton goods (primarily Muslin), including local trade valued twenty-eight and a half lakh rupees. Decline Bengal was conquered by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the British Bengal Presidency was founded in 1765. British colonization forced open the Bengali market to British goods, while at the same time Britain implemented protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs that restricted Bengali imports to Britain. Raw cotton was also imported without taxes or tariffs to British factories, which used them to manufacture textiles, many of which were exported back to Bengal. British economic policies led to deindustrialization in Bengal.Junie T. Tong (2016), Finance and Society in 21st Century China: Chinese Culture Versus Western Markets, page 151, CRC Press British colonization was also followed by the Great Bengal famine of 1770, which killed a third of the Bengali population. From 1787 to 1788, Dhaka suffered from severe natural calamities - especially heavy rainfall - and famine broke out. After the disaster, more emphasis was given on agriculture to reduce the effects of the famine. Tax was revoked on the exportation of grains. So, people became more interested in agricultural works than weaving as the wages of labourers and other people working in agriculture suddenly rose. From 1782 to 1787 the industrial revolution began in Britain, and fine cotton was produced locally. During British colonial rule, the muslin industry declined due to various colonial policies, which supported imports of industrially manufactured textiles from Britain. A heavy duty of 75 percent was imposed on export of cotton from Bengal. These measures ultimately lead to the decline of muslin trade in Bengal. In 1811, Bengal was still a major exporter of cotton cloth to the Americas and the Indian Ocean. However, Bengali exports declined over the course of the early 19th century, as British imports to Bengal increased, from 25% in 1811 to 93% in 1840.

(July 2011) USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715) BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PS-15) is the lead ship of her class of offshore patrol vessels of the Philippine Navy. She is the second ship to be named after Gregorio del Pilar, a Filipino revolutionary general known for his role at the Battle of Tirad Pass. She was originally designated as \\"PF-15\\" from 2012 to mid-2016. Then the Navy adopted a new code designation system and she was redesignated as \\"FF-15\\". In February 2019, the Navy downgraded the status of the entire class from frigate to patrol ship and redesignated her to \\"PS-15\\". From 1967‚Äì2011, the ship was a high endurance cutter of the United States Coast Guard, known as USCGC Hamilton. The U.S. decommissioned the cutter on 28 March 2011, and the Philippines acquired it under the Excess Defense Articles and the Foreign Assistance Act. It is one of three ex-US Coast Guard Hamilton-class cutters to serve the Philippine Navy. Construction and design The ship now known as BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PS-15) was launched on December 18, 1965, at Avondale Shipyards near New Orleans, Louisiana, as USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715) and was named for Alexander Hamilton the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and founder of the United States Revenue Cutter Service. Hamilton was commissioned March 18, 1967. The ship is designed with a high level of habitability and provides fairly comfortable accommodations, including air conditioning. Gregorio del Pilar is the first Philippine military vessel to employ the now common shipboard application of aircraft gas turbine jet engines with the use of controllable pitch propellers and is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines that can propel the ship at speeds up to . Gregorio del Pilar also has two Fairbanks-Morse diesel engines, capable of driving the ship economically at for up to without refuelling. A retractable/rotatable bow propulsion unit provides manoeuvrability in tight situations. =Armament= The ship was armed with a Mk.75 Oto Melara 76 mm Compact main gun, two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain gun at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft. The CIWS and chain guns were removed by the US Coast Guard prior to its turn- over to the Philippine Navy. Only the Mk.75 gun remains. Plans to install additional weapons were made, which includes one Mk. 38 Mod 1 25 mm chain gun aft, two Mk.16 20 mm autocannons midships, and six 12.7 mm machine guns. These were installed during its scheduled dock works before the commissioning ceremonies. Photos during the commissioning ceremonies confirmed the presence of such weapons. The Philippines reportedly ordered at least four new Mk.38 Mod 3 25mm naval guns, and are expected to be installed on all Gregorio del Pilar class ships. It was also reported that the Philippine Navy will be getting sophisticated radar system capable of detecting and tracking surface threats, a Harpoon anti-ship missile system, and torpedo decoy systems. This would be purchased from the United States possibly under a government-to- government deal. =Flight support= The ship has a flight deck and hangar capable of handling helicopters. A BO-105 light surveillance helicopter was initially assigned to the ship, and was replaced by the AgustaWestland AW109 Power, which made its first official shipboard deployment on May 21, 2014. =Modernization= The Philippine Navy plans to modernize the entire ship of the class, with an initial program to upgrade the ship's sensors, and another program to improve its weapon systems. Several systems were acquired through US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which includes the BAE Systems Mk. 38 Mod. 2 machine gun system, the SAAB AN/SPS-77 Sea Giraffe AMB 3D air/surface search radar, and the FLIR Systems SeaFLIR 230 Electro-Optical/Infra-Red Camera. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy will launch a program to acquire, install and integrate several other sensors into the ship, as part of the Horizon 2 phase of the Revised AFP Modernization Program. Among those to be acquired are new Combat Management System (CMS), Hull Mounted Sonar (HMS), and a Radar Electronic Support Measures (R-ESM). Future upgrades are planned to install defensive and offensive missile systems and torpedo launchers, although funding is still being secured and might only be included in the next phase of the Navy's modernization program. Service history =United States Coast Guard (1967‚Äì2011)= In 1988, Hamilton completed a three-year fleet renovation and modernization that provided the ship with modern weapons and electronics systems. All spaces and machinery were also completely overhauled and refurbished. The new technology enables Hamilton to operate seamlessly with the United States Navy. Hamilton has served a variety of missions with distinction. During a 1969‚Äì70 deployment to Vietnam, Hamilton interdicted weapons smugglers and fired more than 4,600 rounds of gunfire in support of U.S. and Vietnamese troops ashore. From 1965‚Äì1975, Hamilton served on Atlantic Ocean Stations, collecting valuable oceanographic data and conducting frequent search and rescue missions. Hamilton also directed the interdictions of over 21,000 Haitian migrants throughout the Caribbean during Operation Able Manner. In 1994, Hamilton received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for rescuing 135 Haitians from the sea after their sailboat capsized and sank. In 1996, Hamilton transited the Panama Canal and served as the command and control platform for Operation Frontier Shield, a multi-agency effort to curtail the influx of narcotics into the United States. Hamilton intercepted 14 drug-laden vessels carrying more than 115 tons of contraband worth 200 million dollars. In 1999, Hamilton seized over of cocaine bound for the U.S. in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Hamilton frequently patrolled the Bering Sea off the Alaskan coast at the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) which separates the Russian and the United States Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Hamiltons presence on the MBL deters foreign fishing vessels from fishing in the U.S. EEZ. In March 2007, Hamilton assisted in the largest recorded maritime drug bust in history. The two vessels intercepted the Panamanian- flagged fishing vessel Gatun in international waters and were able to recover 20 metric tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $600 million retail. The seizure was the largest drug bust in US history and the largest interdiction at sea. =Philippine Navy (2011‚Äìpresent)= Proposal to decommission USCGC Hamilton from the US Coast Guard was made for fiscal year 2011 budget, and the Philippines sent a formal letter of interest for its purchase. USCGC Hamilton was decommissioned on March 28, 2011, and transferred to the Philippine Navy as an excess defense article under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Philippines sent a team to conduct a thorough inspection of the ship in November 2010. The US Coast Guard removed some of the ship's equipment before its transfer to the Philippine Navy and plans to use those equipment as spare parts for the other US Coast Guard ships. Among those that were removed are the AN/SPS-40 air surface search radar, Phalanx CIWS, and two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25 mm chain guns. In return, the US Coast Guard began procuring and installing the safe-to-sail navigation equipment, radar systems and additional electronics that the Philippines requested as part of its transfer support case. The Philippine Navy installed a 25 mm chain gun, two 20 mm guns, and six mounted 50-caliber guns as replacement for the equipment removed. The ship's transfer cost was pegged at Php450 million, while operation costs for two years was estimated at Php120 million. Funding came from Philippines' Department of Energy, considering that the vessel is projected to be deployed to secure oil platform and exploration activities in the Western and Southern Philippines. Training for the crew started in January 2011, when the US Coast Guard provided 10 weeks of combined dockside and underway training on for the ship's prospective commanding officer, executive officer and crew. Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15) was formally transferred to the Philippines on May 13, 2011, at the transfer ceremony on Coast Guard Island. Captain Alberto A. Cruz became its first commanding officer. Its maiden voyage included a port visit to Hawaii and docking at Alameda, California to finish the remaining work, with around 13 separate contracting actions. Gregorio del Pilar conducted a test at the coast of California to measure the crew's capabilities and the ship's seaworthiness. Gregorio del Pilar made a port visit at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam which was the first time that a Philippine vessel docked at Pearl Harbor. She arrived on the Philippines on August 17, 2011 after port visit in Guam. Gregorio del Pilar arrived in Manila on August 21, 2011. The arrival ceremony was held on August 23, 2011, and minor improvements were done the following days. BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15) was formally commissioned by the Philippine Navy on December 14, 2011, at Pier 13, Manila South Harbor. President Benigno Aquino III's elder sister, Ballsy Cruz, was the principal sponsor of the ship. President Aquino hoped that this, his first major military acquisition, would be a symbol of his administration's intention to strengthen and modernize the Philippine Navy and the Armed Forces, and to defend its territory and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. BRP Gregorio del Pilar was involved in a standoff in 2012 at the Scarborough Shoal when it tried to apprehend eight Chinese fishing vessels in the island.Barbara Mae Dacanay, \\"Philippines, China agree to resolve standoff\\", gulfnews.com, April 14, 2012 accessed April 13, 2012James Hookway, \\"Philippines Warns China in Naval Crisis\\", Wall Street Journal, April 11, 2012, accessed April 13, 2012Roy C.

U.S. President Barack Obama aboard the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, November 17, 2015 On November 17, 2015, United States President Barack Obama visited and toured the ship on the sidelines of the APEC Summit to highlight the United States' commitment to assist East Asian countries in maritime security, amidst the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. After touring the ship, he announced that a third Hamilton- class cutter similar to Gregorio del Pilar (USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)) and the research vessel will be turned over to the Philippine Navy. Around mid-2016, the Philippine Navy started calling the ship in its new code designation FF-15, together with its sister ship BRP Ramon Alcaraz which was re-designated as FF-16, and the new BRP Andres Bonifacio designated as FF-17.USCG Boutwell to be formally transferred to PN, to be renamed BRP Andres Bonifacio On August 29, 2018, she ran aground at Hasa Hasa Shoal in the West Philippine Sea off Palawan. She was eventually removed from the shoal on September 3, 2018, and towed to Subic Bay for repairs. Notable operational deployments =Port calls= On July 27, 2011, Gregorio del Pilar arrived at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for a scheduled port visit. She took on supplies and fuel, and held a reception hosted by the Philippine Consulate in Honolulu and the Philippine Celebrations Coordinating Committee of Hawaii. The crew also visited the USS Arizona Memorial. It also marks the first time a Philippine naval vessel pulled into Pearl Harbor. =Search and rescue= BRP Gregorio del Pilar steams along during Operation Damayan after Typhoon Haiyan. BRP Gregorio Del Pilar was assigned to Naval Forces Western to help in a joint multinational disaster relief and response operations dubbed Operation Damayan after the Visayan Islands were struck by Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. On 2014, the ship has been deployed in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. =Exercises= On July 30, 2011, Gregorio del Pilar and conducted a Passing Exercise (PASSEX) off the coast of Hawaii. On August 22, 2011, the United States Embassy in Manila posted on their Facebook account photos indicating that BRP Gregorio del Pilar had an in-stride training with on their transit to Guam, which may have started around August 4, 2011. On August 14‚Äì16, 2012, the Naval Forces Northern Luzon (NFNL) conducted a small- scale Naval Exercise code-named SAGEX 02‚Äì12 at the waters of South China Sea. BRP Gregorio del Pilar together with and participated under Naval Task Force (NTF) 11. The exercise includes patrol, simulated tracking of targets and interdiction and capped by live firing exercises. Gregorio del Pilar, together with BRP Rajah Humabon participated in the sea phase exercises with the US Navy during the Balikatan 2013 from April 5 to 17, 2013. The ship conducted an offshore visit at Lingayen, Pangasinan during the city's \\"Pistay Dayat 2013\\" (\\"Feast of the Sea 2013\\"), with an open house tour and rescue exhibition exercises performed by the crew. From June 27 to July 2, 2013, Gregorio del Pilar participated in joint naval maneuvers during Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training 2013 Philippines (CARAT 2013 Philippines) with other Philippine and United States naval and coast guard ships.

History =US Coast Guard service and transfer to the Philippine Navy= The ship was first launched in 1968 and served for decades as the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Dallas (WHEC-716) before being given to the Philippines. The ship was scheduled to be transferred to the Philippines as an excess defense article through the Foreign Assistance Act via a \\"hot transfer\\" in May 2012. The Dallas was formally decommissioned on 30 March 2012, and the US Coast Guard removed the ship's guns and other equipment. On 6 May 2012 during the 70th commemoration of the Fall of Bataan, President Benigno Aquino III announced the naming of the ex-USCGC Dallas to BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PF-16) in honor of the World War II hero and officer of the Philippine Navy. Commodore Ramon \\"Monching\\" Alcaraz commanded one of the Philippine Offshore Patrol's Q-boat Q-112 Abra during World War II which shot down 3 Japanese aircraft. The ex-Dallas was formally transferred to the Philippine government on 22 May 2012 during a ceremony at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Pier Papa in North Charleston, South Carolina. The ship was turned over to its Filipino crew, with Capt. Ernesto Baldovino as its first commanding officer. The ship's crew had been in the US for several weeks prior to the transfer for training aboard other Hamilton-class ships operated by the US Coast Guard. Ramon Alcaraz was scheduled to be refitted at the expense of the Philippine Navy prior to sailing to the Philippines. The ship's transfer cost was pegged at Php 450 million (around US$10 million as of 2012), while operation costs will be similar to its sister ship, . An additional US$5 million was allocated for installation of additional equipment, different from her sister ship Gregorio del Pilar. The ship will have better fire control and weapons systems than Gregorio del Pilar. The ship was originally expected to leave Charleston, South Carolina for the Philippines in January 2013 but it was delayed. The ship finally departed Charleston harbor at 10:00 AM on 10 June 2013. She reached the Atlantic-side entrance of the Panama Canal and crossed its entire stretch on 17 June. Ramon Alcaraz continued her journey across the Pacific Ocean and was scheduled for port visits at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, and at Guam. before reaching Manila by 3 August 2013. On August 1, 2013, Ramon Alcaraz entered Philippine waters. Her official arrival ceremony was held Subic Bay on August 6. On November 22, 2013, she was commissioned as BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PF-16) at Pier 15 in Manila's South Harbor. After commissioning, she sailed to Tacloban City to transport about 200 tons of relief goods, water purification systems, and navy personnel who helped with relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan. Around mid-2016, the Philippine Navy started calling the ship in its new code designation FF-16, together with its sister ship BRP Gregorio del Pilar which was re-designated as FF-15, and the upcoming BRP Andres Bonifacio designated as FF-17.USCG Boutwell to be formally transferred to PN, to be renamed BRP Andres Bonifacio In March 2017, the Philippine Navy sent the Ramon Alcaraz to patrol the Benham Rise, which is part of Philippine territorial waters, after a Chinese survey ship was sighted in the area for several days. =Middle East and Indian Ocean deployment= In January 2020, the Ramon Alcaraz along with the strategic sealift vessel were deployed to the Middle East to repatriate overseas Filipino workers there during the 2019-2020 Persian Gulf crisis between the United States and Iran. The two naval ships arrived in Muscat, Oman on February 6 after a layover in Sri Lanka, but tensions in the Gulf region have already eased by that date and were told by Philippine Navy officials to stay put. They left Oman on April 21 bound for Cochin, India to pick up some 200,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPEs) donated to the Philippines by an Indian private company as well as pick up Filipinos stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic. They arrived in Cochin on May 6. A fire broke out in the engine room of the Ramon Alcaraz shortly after it left the port of Cochin on the evening of May 7. The fire, which lasted for 10 minutes, was quickly extinguished by naval personnel. Two enlisted men, Fireman Second Class Engineman Alvin Aldecoa and Fireman Second Class Machinery Repairman Joemari Bag-o, suffered superficial and second- degree burns respectively, and had to be airlifted to a naval hospital in Cochin for extensive medical attention. The patrol ship stayed in Cochin for an additional 21 days to assess and repair the damage to the ship's propulsion system with the help of the US Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command.

In 1974, Jaffe also began teaching photography at the university level as professor of photography at Chapman College ‚Äì World Campus Afloat, aboard a ship travelling to South America, Africa and Europe. In 1977, Jaffe signed a contract with Elson Alexandre where over the next two decades he photographed more than 37,000 formal and casual portraits of corporate executives, doctors, attorneys, judges as well as family photos of the company‚Äôs clients. During this period Jaffe also shot many celebrity portraits on an independent contractor basis capturing unique images of cowboy stars from Dale Robertson, and Gene Autry to Chuck Connors, Indian Iron Eyes Cody and Roy Rogers. For the last 20 years Jaffe has shot over 500 episodes of high-profile television shows such as Cold Case, CSI Miami, CSI New York, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Mad Men, Rules of Engagement, Suddenly Susan, The West Wing, and Without a Trace, and current shows including Castle, CSI Crime Scene Investigation, Hit the Floor, Jane the Virgin, NCIS, NCIS: LA and Scorpion. His work on episodic crime dramas involve not only shooting the show during taping, but all props, photos used in the storyline and all crime scene photos showing the circumstances of crime scene investigation for evidence. In essence, Jaffe actually becomes the forensic photographer of episodic dramas. In all, Jaffe has shot programs that have aired or are currently airing on the ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, AMC, VH1, MTV, A&E;, The CW, and CMT networks. Because of his work on these shows Jaffe has been nominated twice for the Publicists Guild of America‚Äôs Excellence in Stills Photography Award.

Commercial casino-style gaming is prohibited. Cardrooms Licensed cardrooms may offer approved card games in which players vie against each other (rather than against the house), such as poker. As of 2019, there were 66 cardrooms operating in the state (and another 21 licensed but not operating). Since 1995, there has been a moratorium on new cardrooms. The industry generated $850 million in revenue after payouts in 2018. Non-banked card games such as poker have always been legal in the state. The California Penal Code, enacted in 1872, prohibited several casino games by name, as well as all house-banked games, but did not outlaw poker. Cardrooms also operate non-banked versions of card games such as Pai Gow Poker, where players can take turns playing the dealer hand against the other players.Cal. Penal Code Sec. 330.11; Bell Gardens v. City of Los Angeles, 231 Cal. App .3d 1563, 1568 (1991); California Gambling Law Resources Statewide cardroom regulations were enacted in 1984. In 1997, the Gambling Control Act was adopted, which created the California Gambling Control Commission to regulate California cardrooms. Charitable gaming Eligible nonprofit organizations may operate bingo games, raffles, and poker nights. Organizations are limited to one poker night per year. State voters in 1976 approved a constitutional amendment allowing counties and cities to legalize charitable bingo. An amendment to allow charitable raffles passed in 2000, and enabling legislation went into effect in 2001. Legislation allowing poker night fundraisers took effect in 2007. Parimutuel wagering Parimutuel wagering on horse racing is permitted at racetracks and satellite wagering facilities, and online through advance-deposit wagering providers. Extended racing meets are held throughout the year at five tracks: Cal Expo, Del Mar, Golden Gate Fields, Los Alamitos, and Santa Anita. Four other fairgrounds tracks hold brief meets in the summer and early fall. There are 27 satellite wagering facilities throughout the state, most of them found at county fairgrounds, cardrooms, and tribal casinos. Racing and wagering is regulated by the California Horse Racing Board. As of 2018, the annual amount wagered on California races was $3.2 billion, with $662 million retained after payouts. Horse race wagering was legalized by voter referendum in 1933. Satellite wagering was first legalized at fairgrounds in 1985, and was expanded to private facilities in 2008. Advance-deposit wagering became legal in 2002. Indian gaming Federally recognized tribes can operate casinos under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. As of 2019, there were 63 casinos operated by 61 different tribes. The industry generates approximately $8 billion in annual revenue after payouts. Pursuant to tribal-state compacts negotiated with the state, tribes with larger casinos share a portion of their revenues with non-gaming or limited gaming tribes (those with fewer than 350 slot machines). Lottery The California State Lottery offers scratchcards and draw games, including the multi-state Powerball and Mega Millions games. The Lottery was approved by voter referendum in 1984 and sold its first tickets in 1985.

In the doorways of the choir gate stand the other two former husbands of Saint Anne, the fathers of the other two Marias who are positioned behind St. Elisabeth.

It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master.Catalog entry in museum website Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting.

Location, description  On the island of La Palma, Cueva del Agua is a village 1.5 km east of the LP-114 road that links Santo Domingo (3 km north) to Las Tricias (9 km south, near Fagundo and the Pino de la Virgen). It stands between the districts of El Castillo village to the south and the town of Santo Domingo to the north. The north-west coast of the island is 1,600 m away (on a straight line). The district is of mountainous type: small roads with sharp turns and deep narrow valleys, with the Atajo river and its steep ravine (barranco de Atajo) to the south of the village, and to the north that of the (barranco de Fernando Oporto or barranco Oropesa, also called barranco de los Hombres). At its heart one finds the Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows and the old school.  Name of the district  The name of the village (Cueva del Agua or Cueva de Agua, in English \\"Cave of Water\\") comes from the existence of a natural cave inside which flows a spring. This cave, called the Spring cave (cueva de la Fuente), is found nearby the GR 130Hiking trail GR 130, section Garafia-Tijarafe on senderosdelapalma.es.  Population  Its population has fallen considerably since the 1950s and currently counts about 120 inhabitants.  History and archaeology  = Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows = It is a small building of only one vessel and a gable roof covered with curved ceramic tiles. The facade includes a triangular pediment, crowned with a bell wall and a cross above it. The access door is made out of Canarian pine wood and its top is arch-shaped.  Lady of Sorrows  It is a devotional image with eyes made out of crystal. It differs from the usual representations of the Virgin Mary generally encountered in the Canaries. But as everywhere else in the nation, from the 16th century a grandeur was given to the particular type of Lady of the Seven Sorrows, where Mary remains alone after the crucifixion of her Son and handed over to pain. = Archaeological remains of El Callejoncito = This site of cave engravings is on a rocky outcrop located on the top shore of the right bank of the ravine of the Atajo. Le site includes six panels in their original position. The patterns are geometric and put the accent on spirals, fretwork and meanders. They were made by punching the stone, making marks of variable widths and lengths. Its state of conservation is worsening due to the wear by erosive agents. These were made public in 1970 by Dr. Mauro Hern√°ndez Perez in his dissertation. Hern√°ndez P√©rez, M.S. Carta Arqueol√≥gica de La Palma (\\"Archaeological map of La Palma\\") (Canarias). In Anuario de Estudios Atl√°nticos, XVIII. (Madrid-Las Palmas), 1972. Pp. 537-641. See p. 618 for the Calvary site. Later they were studied during the Second phase (1988) of the Corpus of Cave Engravings of La Palma.Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez, E.; Navarro Mederos, J. F.; and Pais Pais, F. J.: El Corpus de Grabados Rupestres de La Palma como base para la interpretaci√≥n y conservaci√≥n de estos yacimientos (\\"Corpus of Cave Engravings of La Palma as a basis for the interpretation and preservation of those remains\\"). In Investigaciones arqueol√≥gicas en Canarias, II. (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), 1990. Pp. 157-185. See p. 174 for the Calvary site. The site stands nearby an old settlement of prehistoric origin. The troglodyte village occupies the middle area of the right bank of the ravine of Atajo (barranco del Atajo). In general, the caves present good conditions for habitability in regard of their size, brightness, exposure and protection against inclement weather. The caves have been intensely used in the historical epoch and some of them have been pillaged. Fragments of ceramics were found in this archaeological site, that belonged to jars from phases III and IV. The lithic technology is includes stone chips, dikes, cores, a.s.o., of grey basalt and glassy basalt. Ovine and caprine bony fragments have also been crushed as well as numerous limpet shells. Petroglyphs are quite common on the territory of Cueva del Agua, and indeed on that of Garafia. Many have disappeared, notably during the construction of the roads, but a number of petroglyphs remain scattered. For example, near Cueva del Agua's windmill, at a place called The Calvary (El Calvario) are 17 engraved panels; their dominant motive is based on circles and spirals. This locally well-known place with easy access is often visited. Another petroglyph was found in 1997 among the stones used to build a wall. = El Callejoncito beach = At the mouth of the Atajo river is a small beach of black sand framed by tall cliffs, stretching over about 100 m. It is made of black volcanic sand dragged by the tides. A quiet beach in the winter months, it is a zone with great currents and precautions are strongly recommended for bathing. It is reached from the LP-114 road at km 9 (starting from the south end of the LP-114, where it reaches the LP-1 near Las Tricias and Fagundo). The lane is tarmacked up to the parking place for the vehicles. From that point onward, there is a walk of approximately 1 km up to the beach.Video of the Callejoncito showing the small beach (6'05 foll.) = Spring Cave = This cave, called Cueva de la Fuente in Spanish, is on the north face of the ravine that opens into Callejoncito. Its mouth is under a rocky arch. It is a large cave, used a park for goats - and therefore fenced in. There are some cement- and brickworks in connection with the spring. The cave, of volcanic origin, runs parallel to the coastline - and not perpendicularly to it. Photos and description of the cueva de la Fuente, Oct 10, 2007.  Feasts  The village's feast is celebrated in September, dedicated to the patron saint of Cueva de Agua, Our Lady of Sorrows. A popular street party and various cultural acts are carried out.

He was the eldest of his parents' four children. He attended school locally, obtaining a grounding in Graeco-Latin humanities at the St Aloysius College in Ninove and Our Lady's College, Dendermonde before abandoning an earlier ambition to become a lawyer and entering the seminary of Ghent in 1950: he was ordained into the priesthood on 26 August 1956.

Biography  Luce Lancival made brilliant studies at the Louis-le-Grand college and was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of Navarre aged just 22 years (1786). The following year, under the influence of a disappointment in love, he left teaching and took orders. He was noted for his preaching talents. At the French Revolution, he broke his vows and turned to theater. Around 1797, he was in charge of French literature at the French Prytan√©e, former Louis-le- Grand college. He remained professor of rhetoric at the Imperial High School at the time of the reorganization of the University. He was then called to the Latin poetry chair at the Sorbonne. In 1805, he gave his poem in six songs Achille √† Scyros, his best known work. Imitated from the Achilleid by Statius, it is a book written with care, which includes interesting and ingenious features descriptions, even if the whole lacks of movement and relieves some boredom. In theater, Luce Lancival won his greatest success shortly before his death, with his tragedy Hector, shown in 1809 at the Com√©die fran√ßaise. On a topic drawn from the Iliad, the play caused a sensation with a character judged by the very contemporary faithful to the spirit of ancient Greece. Napoleon rewarded the author by giving him a pension of 6,000 French francs. His love of life, pushed to debauchery, was famous in his time. He was to lose a leg in an accident and used a wooden substitute. Despite this weakness and failing health, he committed himself with great dedication to the teaching of literature and was an outstanding educator.
