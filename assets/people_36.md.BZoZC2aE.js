Noreen studied at Uppsala University and focused on Swedish dialectology in his earlier works, later shifting to the wider field of historical linguistics. He was a Neogrammarian and supported spelling reform. Biography Noreen was born in V√§rmland. He became a student at Uppsala University in 1871 and went on to complete his doctorate there in 1877; he became a lecturer at the university in the same year. Noreen spent most of 1879 at the University of Leipzig, the home of the Neogrammarian school of linguistics - a school to which Noreen belonged for his entire literary life. Whilst in Leipzig, Noreen was taught Lithuanian by August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound laws. Much of Noreen's early output was focused on Swedish dialectology, primarily in his home province of V√§rmland and the neighbouring province of Dalarna. His work, which was the first in Sweden to utilise the findings of the Neogrammarians, remained influential in the field well into the 20th century. Noreen's academic focus in the 1880s shifted to the field of historical linguistics, primarily centred on the Germanic languages. His grammars of Old West Norse and Old Swedish remain in use by scholars to the present day. In 1887 Noreen was named as the third Professor of Scandinavian languages at Uppsala University. Noreen devoted the last twenty years of his life to writing V√•rt spr√•k (Our Language), an ultimately unfinished work in which he outlines his view of the Swedish language, its grammar, phonology and morphology. Noreen was elected to Seat 12 of the Swedish Academy in 1919, following the death of Gustaf Retzius. Noreen was an advocate of spelling reform. He proposed consistently spelling the sj-sound, voiced palatal approximant, voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative, and (all of which continue to have several realisations in Swedish orthography) as \\"sj\\", \\"j\\", \\"tj\\", and \\"ks\\", respectively. He also considered \\"B√∂rjer Jarl\\" to be an acceptable alternative spelling of Birger Jarl. Noreen is buried at Uppsala gamla kyrkog√•rd.

She was later transferred to the French Navy as Libellule (A730). She was sunk as a target near Brest in 1983.  Career  Rosewood (YN-26) was laid down 18 October 1940 by the American Ship Building Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched 1 March 1941; and placed in service 13 September 1941, Lt. D. Nicoli, Jr., USNR, in command. Following transit of the St. Lawrence River, Rosewood moved down the U.S. East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, and through the next spring operated as a net tender in the 5th Naval District. Commissioned 18 June 1942, she was ordered to Service Squadron 6 for duty in the Pacific Ocean. She departed Norfolk 26 July, arrived at Espiritu Santo 19 October, and for over a year tended nets and performed escort duties in the New Hebrides area. During that time, on 20 January 1944, she was redesignated AN-31. Detached a year later, Rosewood departed Espiritu Santo on 17 January 1945. At Manus at the end of the month, she continued on to the Western Caroline Islands in February, and into June served at Ulithi. Two months duty at Eniwetok followed and on 6 August she sailed for California. From 1 September to 6 December Rosewood served in the San Pedro, California, area. She then headed north and on 24 December reported for duty in the 13th Naval District. On 17 April 1946 she reported to the Commander, 19th Fleet for inactivation. Decommissioned 10 June 1946, she remained in the Reserve Fleet for 16 years. In September 1962 she was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay-up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. On 28 October 1968, however, she was returned to the Navy for sale, under the terms of the Military Assistance Program, to France. Delivered to the French Navy in January 1969, she served as Libellule until 21 April 1981 and was sunk as a target, near Brest in 1983.

It was introduced in Japan by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in 2001 for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute cases of bipolar mania. Medical uses Its primary uses are in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. =Schizophrenia= In a clinical trial that compared it to haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control. In another clinical trial perospirone was compared with mosapramine and produced a similar reduction in total PANSS score, except with respect to the blunted affect part of the PANSS negative score, in which perospirone produced a significantly greater improvement. In an open-label clinical trial comparing aripiprazole with perospirone there was no significant difference between the two treatments discovered in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. In 2009 a clinical trial found that perospirone produced a similar reduction of PANSS score than risperidone and the extrapyramidal side effects was similar in both frequency and severity between groups. A meta-analysis published in 2013 found that it is statistically significantly less efficacious than other second-generation antipsychotics. Adverse effects Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics. A trend was observed in a clinical trial comparing mosapramine with perospirone that favoured perospirone for producing less prominent extrapyramidal side effects than mosapramine although statistical significant was not reached. It may produce less QT interval prolongation than zotepine, as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval. It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached). =Discontinuation= The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a felling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum ( ).\\"hydrargyrum\\" . Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature. Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide. Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is also used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short- wave ultraviolet light, which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light. Mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury. Properties=Physical properties= pound coin (density ~7.6 g/cm3) floats in mercury due to the combination of the buoyant force and surface tension. Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white liquid metal. Compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.Hammond, C. R The Elements in It has a freezing point of ‚àí38.83 ¬∞C and a boiling point of 356.73 ¬∞C, both the lowest of any stable metal, although preliminary experiments on copernicium and flerovium have indicated that they have even lower boiling points (copernicium being the element below mercury in the periodic table, following the trend of decreasing boiling points down group 12). Upon freezing, the volume of mercury decreases by 3.59% and its density changes from 13.69 g/cm3 when liquid to 14.184 g/cm3 when solid. The coefficient of volume expansion is 181.59 √ó 10‚àí6 at 0 ¬∞C, 181.71 √ó 10‚àí6 at 20 ¬∞C and 182.50 √ó 10‚àí6 at 100 ¬∞C (per ¬∞C). Solid mercury is malleable and ductile and can be cut with a knife. A complete explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves deep into the realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. =Chemical properties= Mercury does not react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, although oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc). Amalgams Mercury- discharge spectral calibration lamp Mercury dissolves many metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are also resistant in forming amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft. Mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement. =Isotopes= There are seven stable isotopes of mercury, with being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived radioisotopes are with a half-life of 444 years, and with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day. and are the most often studied NMR-active nuclei, having spins of and respectively. Etymology Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from hydrargyrum, a Latinized form of the Greek word ·ΩëŒ¥œÅŒ¨œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒøœÇ (hydrargyros), which is a compound word meaning \\"water-silver\\" (from ·ΩëŒ¥œÅ- hydr-, the root of ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ, \\"water,\\" and ·ºÑœÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒøœÇ argyros \\"silver\\") ‚Äì since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for his speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is Rasa≈õƒÅstra. Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name. History the planet Mercury (‚òø) has been used since ancient times to represent the element Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that date from 1500 BC. In China and Tibet, mercury use was thought to prolong life, heal fractures, and maintain generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Q√≠n Sh«ê Hu√°ng D√¨‚Äîallegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on a model of the land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China‚Äîwas killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, mercury poisoning, and brain death) who intended to give him eternal life. Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun, the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt (r. 884‚Äì896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with mercury, on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep. In November 2014 \\"large quantities\\" of mercury were discovered in a chamber 60 feet below the 1800-year-old pyramid known as the \\"Temple of the Feathered Serpent,\\" \\"the third largest pyramid of Teotihuacan,\\" Mexico along with \\"jade statues, jaguar remains, a box filled with carved shells and rubber balls.\\" The ancient Greeks used cinnabar (mercury sulfide) in ointments; the ancient Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics. In Lamanai, once a major city of the Maya civilization, a pool of mercury was found under a marker in a Mesoamerican ballcourt. By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams (Medieval Latin amalgama, \\"alloy of mercury\\") with other metals. Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed. They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists. The mines in Almad√©n (Spain), Monte Amiata (Italy), and Idrija (now Slovenia) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almad√©n 2500 years ago, until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century. Occurrence Mercury is an extremely rare element in Earth's crust, having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million (ppm). Because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar, metacinnabar, corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore. Mercury ores often in hot springs or other volcanic regions. Beginning in 1558, with the invention of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almad√©n in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century. Native mercury with cinnabar, Socrates mine, Sonoma County, California. Cinnabar sometimes alters to native mercury in the oxidized zone of mercury deposits. Former mines in Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once produced a large proportion of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almad√©n), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46 kg) flask. Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is :HgS + O2 ‚Üí Hg + SO2 In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.About the Mercury Rule . Act.credoaction.com (21 December 2011). Retrieved on 30 December 2012. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk. The European Union directive calling for compact fluorescent bulbs to be made mandatory by 2012 has encouraged China to re-open cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for CFL bulb manufacture. Environmental dangers have been a concern, particularly in the southern cities of Foshan and Guangzhou, and in Guizhou province in the southwest. Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine and created a county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property. Chemistry Mercury exists in two oxidation states, I and II. Despite claims otherwise, Hg(III) and Hg(IV) compounds remain unknown. =Compounds of mercury(I)= Unlike its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic and feature the dimeric cation, Hg. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to and elemental mercury. Mercury(I) chloride, a colorless solid also known as calomel, is really the compound with the formula Hg2Cl2, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. Mercury(I) hydride, a colorless gas, has the formula HgH, containing no Hg-Hg bond. Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself, mercury forms mercury polycations, which consist of linear chains of mercury centers, capped with a positive charge. One example is . =Compounds of mercury(II)= Mercury(II) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well. All four mercuric halides are known. They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry, somewhat like Ag+ does. Best known is mercury(II) chloride, an easily sublimating white solid. HgCl2 forms coordination complexes that are typically tetrahedral, e.g. . Mercury(II) oxide, the main oxide of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400 ¬∞C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver. Being a soft metal, mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. The latter sometimes occurs naturally as metacinnabar. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials. Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia. These include Millon's base (Hg2N+), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of )), and \\"fusible white precipitate\\" or [Hg(NH3)2]Cl2. Known as Nessler's reagent, potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) () is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base. Mercury fulminate is a detonator widely used in explosives. =Organomercury compounds= Organic mercury compounds are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by a process known as biomethylation. Applications The bulb of a mercury-in-glass thermometer Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy. =Medicine= Amalgam filling Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. The first edition of the Merck's Manual featured many mercuric compounds such as: * Mercauro * Mercuro-iodo-hemol. * Mercury-ammonium chloride * Mercury Benzoate * Mercuric * Mercury Bichloride (Corrosive Mercuric Chloride, U.S.P.) * Mercury Chloride * Mild Mercury Cyanide * Mercury Succinimide * Mercury Iodide * Red Mercury Biniodide * Mercury Iodide * Yellow Mercury Proto-iodide * Black (Hahnemann), Soluble Mercury Oxide * Red Mercury Oxide * Yellow Mercury Oxide * Mercury Salicylate * Mercury Succinimide * Mercury Imido-succinate * Mercury Sulphate * Basic Mercury Subsulphate; Turpeth Mineral * Mercury Tannate * Mercury-Ammonium Chloride Mercury is an ingredient in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Erratum: . Nevertheless, thiomersal has been removed from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 years of age and under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Another mercury compound, merbromin (Mercurochrome), is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes that is still in use in some countries. Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various traditional medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear. Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non-prescription mercury thermometers. In 2003, Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices. Mercury compounds are found in some over-the-counter drugs, including topical antiseptics, stimulant laxatives, diaper-rash ointment, eye drops, and nasal sprays. The FDA has \\"inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness\\" of the mercury ingredients in these products. Mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses. =Production of chlorine and caustic soda= Chlorine is produced from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis to separate the metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner- Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that were built in the United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine. =Laboratory uses= Some medical thermometers, especially those for high temperatures, are filled with mercury; they are gradually disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003. Some transit telescopes use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference. Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such liquid-mirror telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up. Liquid mercury is a part of popular secondary reference electrode (called the calomel electrode) in electrochemistry as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode. The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells. Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, ‚àí38.8344 ¬∞C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90). In polarography both the dropping mercury electrode and the hanging mercury drop electrode use elemental mercury. This use allows a new uncontaminated electrode to be available for each measurement or each new experiment. Mercury-containing compounds are also of use in the field of structural biology. Mercuric compounds such as mercury(II) chloride or potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) can be added to protein crystals in an effort to create heavy atom derivatives that can be used to solve the phase problem in X-ray crystallography via isomorphous replacement or anomalous scattering methods. =Niche uses= Gaseous mercury is used in mercury-vapor lamps and some \\"neon sign\\" type advertising signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low- pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice. Gaseous mercury is also found in some electron tubes, including ignitrons, thyratrons, and mercury arc rectifiers. It is also used in specialist medical care lamps for skin tanning and disinfection. Gaseous mercury is added to cold cathode argon- filled lamps to increase the ionization and electrical conductivity. An argon- filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly. Lighting containing mercury can be bombarded/oven pumped only once. When added to neon filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent red/blue spots until the initial burning-in process is completed; eventually it will light a consistent dull off-blue color.

File:Deep Space Atomic Clock-DSAC.jpgThe miniaturized Deep Space Atomic Clock is a linear ion-trap-based mercury ion clock, designed for precise and real-time radio navigation in deep space. The Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) under development by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory utilises mercury in a linear ion-trap-based clock. The novel use of mercury allows very compact atomic clocks, with low energy requirements, and is therefore ideal for space probes and Mars missions. Cosmetics Mercury, as thiomersal, is widely used in the manufacture of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government. A study in geometric mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents. Population-based biomonitoring also showed that mercury concentration levels are higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals. =Firearms= Mercury(II) fulminate is a primary explosive which is mainly used as a primer of a cartridge in firearms. =Historic uses= A Single-Pole, Single-Throw (SPST) mercury switch. Mercury manometer to measure pressure Many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury, especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal: * Quantities of liquid mercury ranging from have been recovered from elite Maya tombs (100-700AD) or ritual caches at six sites. This mercury may have been used in bowls as mirrors for divinatory purposes. Five of these date to the Classic Period of Maya civilization (c. 250‚Äì900) but one example predated this. * In Islamic Spain, it was used for filling decorative pools. Later, the American artist Alexander Calder built a mercury fountain for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. The fountain is now on display at the Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥ in Barcelona. * Mercury was used inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred. * The Fresnel lenses of old lighthouses used to float and rotate in a bath of mercury which acted like a bearing. * Mercury sphygmomanometers (blood pressure meter), barometers, diffusion pumps, coulometers, and many other laboratory instruments. As an opaque liquid with a high density and a nearly linear thermal expansion, it is ideal for this role. * As an electrically conductive liquid, it was used in mercury switches (including home mercury light switches installed prior to 1970), tilt switches used in old fire detectors, and tilt switches in some home thermostats. * Owing to its acoustic properties, mercury was used as the propagation medium in delay line memory devices used in early digital computers of the mid-20th century. * Experimental mercury vapor turbines were installed to increase the efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its working fluid, in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, for a number of years starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years. * Similarly, liquid mercury was used as a coolant for some nuclear reactors; however, sodium is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal, because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant. * Mercury was a propellant for early ion engines in electric space propulsion systems. Advantages were mercury's high molecular weight, low ionization energy, low dual-ionization energy, high liquid density and liquid storability at room temperature. Disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in long-duration operations. The first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury-fueled ion thruster developed by NASA Lewis and flown on the Space Electric Rocket Test \\"SERT-1\\" spacecraft launched by NASA at its Wallops Flight Facility in 1964. The SERT-1 flight was followed up by the SERT-2 flight in 1970. Mercury and caesium were preferred propellants for ion engines until Hughes Research Laboratory performed studies finding xenon gas to be a suitable replacement. Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight, little or no reactivity due to its noble gas nature, and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage. Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury: * The mercury battery is a non-rechargeable electrochemical battery, a primary cell, that was common in the middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills. * Mercury was used for preserving wood, developing daguerreotypes, silvering mirrors, anti-fouling paints (discontinued in 1990), herbicides (discontinued in 1995), handheld maze games, cleaning, and road leveling devices in cars. Mercury compounds have been used in antiseptics, laxatives, antidepressants, and in antisyphilitics. * It was allegedly used by allied spies to sabotage Luftwaffe planes: a mercury paste was applied to bare aluminium, causing the metal to rapidly corrode; this would cause structural failures. * Chloralkali process: The largest industrial use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine was used for bleaching paper (hence the location of many of these plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells. * As electrodes in some types of electrolysis, batteries (mercury cells), sodium hydroxide and chlorine production, handheld games, catalysts, insecticides. * Mercury was once used as a gun barrel bore cleaner. * From the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, a process called \\"carroting\\" was used in the making of felt hats. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution (the term \\"carroting\\" arose from this color) of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate, Hg(NO3)2¬∑2H2O. This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. The United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\". Lewis Carroll's \\"Mad Hatter\\" in his book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a play on words based on the older phrase, but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning. * Gold and silver mining. Historically, mercury was used extensively in hydraulic gold mining in order to help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining. Historic medicinal uses Mercury(I) chloride (also known as calomel or mercurous chloride) has been used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S. Toxicity and safety Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill. Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled, so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, should be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to minimize exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds, such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury. Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning. =Releases in the environment= Amount of atmospheric mercury deposited at Wyoming's Upper Fremont Glacier over the last 270 years Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4 ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4‚Äì6 times. Natural sources, such as volcanoes, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The human-generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages: * 65% from stationary combustion, of which coal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source (40% of U.S. mercury emissions in 1999). This includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed. Emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion, depending on the country. * 11% from gold production. The three largest point sources for mercury emissions in the U.S. are the three largest gold mines. Hydrogeochemical release of mercury from gold-mine tailings has been accounted as a significant source of atmospheric mercury in eastern Canada. * 6.8% from non-ferrous metal production, typically smelters. * 6.4% from cement production. * 3.0% from waste disposal, including municipal and hazardous waste, crematoria, and sewage sludge incineration. * 3.0% from caustic soda production. * 1.4% from pig iron and steel production. * 1.1% from mercury production, mainly for batteries. * 2.0% from other sources. The above percentages are estimates of the global human-caused mercury emissions in 2000, excluding biomass burning, an important source in some regions. Recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at 0.01‚Äì0.02 ¬µg/m3. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent a cross-section of building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, at a range of 0.0065 ‚Äì 0.523 Œºg/m3. The average was 0.069 Œºg/m3. Artificial lakes may be contaminated with mercury due to the absorption by the water of mercury from submerged trees and soil. For example, Williston Lake in northern British Columbia, created by the damming of the Peace River in 1968, is still sufficiently contaminated with mercury that it is inadvisable to consume fish from the lake.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/west-moberly- first-nations-concerned-about-mercury-contamination-in-fish-1.3070702 West Moberly First Nations concerned about mercury contamination in fishhttp://a100.gov.bc.ca/appsdata/acat/documents/r54457/CO94394_FinalReport- FIsh_Mercury_Investigation-Az_1531852633378_1851380586.pdf Williston-Dinosaur Watershed Fish Mercury Investigation: 2017 Report Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.IMERC Fact Sheet ‚Äì Mercury Use in Thermostats January 2010 Most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury, and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range. Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a lithium isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for. A serious industrial disaster was the dumping of mercury compounds into Minamata Bay, Japan. It is estimated that over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as Minamata disease. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as mercury from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking. While mercury is a constituent of tobacco smoke, studies have largely failed to discover a significant correlation between smoking and Hg uptake by humans compared to sources such as occupational exposure, fish consumption, and amalgam tooth fillings. =Sediment contamination= Sediments within large urban-industrial estuaries act as an important sink for point source and diffuse mercury pollution within catchments. A 2015 study of foreshore sediments from the Thames estuary measured total mercury at 0.01 to 12.07 mg/kg with mean of 2.10 mg/kg and median of 0.85 mg/kg (n=351). The highest mercury concentrations were shown to occur in and around the city of London in association with fine grain muds and high total organic carbon content. The strong affinity of mercury for carbon rich sediments has also been observed in salt marsh sediments of the River Mersey mean of 2 mg/kg up to 5 mg/kg. These concentrations are far higher than those shown in salt marsh river creek sediments of New Jersey and mangroves of Southern China which exhibit low mercury concentrations of about 0.2 mg/kg. =Occupational exposure= EPA workers clean up residential mercury spill in 2004 Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The World Health Organization, OSHA, and NIOSH all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. =Fish= Fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. Because mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. Mercury presence in fish muscles can be studied using non-lethal muscle biopsies. Mercury present in prey fish accumulates in the predator that consumes them. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, methylmercury concentrations in the fish tissue increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease. =Cosmetics= Some facial creams contain dangerous levels of mercury. Most contain comparatively non- toxic inorganic mercury, but products containing highly toxic organic mercury have been encountered.https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/12/the-horrifying- case-of-organic-mercury-poisoning-from-tainted-skin-cream/ Woman had 524x the normal level of mercury in her blood from skin cream usehttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6850a4.htm Notes from the Field: Methylmercury Toxicity from a Skin Lightening Cream Obtained from Mexico ‚Äî California, 2019 =Effects and symptoms of mercury poisoning= Toxic effects include damage to the brain, kidneys and lungs. Mercury poisoning can result in several diseases, including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and Minamata disease. Symptoms typically include sensory impairment (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation and a lack of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case‚Äìcontrol studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7‚Äì42 Œºg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4‚Äì8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44 mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression. =Treatment= Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP. Regulations=International= 140 countries agreed in the Minamata Convention on Mercury by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to prevent emissions. The convention was signed on 10 October 2013. =United States= In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995. The United States Clean Air Act, passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact. The EPA announced new rules for coal-fired power plants on 22 December 2011. Cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are held to a looser standard than are standard hazardous waste incinerators in the United States, and as a result are a disproportionate source of mercury pollution. =European Union= In the European Union, the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. Article 4 Paragraph 1. e.g. \\"Member States shall ensure that, from July 1, 2006, new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market does not contain lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE).\\" There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers. =Norway= Norway enacted a total ban on the use of mercury in the manufacturing and import/export of mercury products, effective 1 January 2008. In 2002, several lakes in Norway were found to have a poor state of mercury pollution, with an excess of 1 ¬µg/g of mercury in their sediment. In 2008, Norway's Minister of Environment Development Erik Solheim said: \\"Mercury is among the most dangerous environmental toxins. Satisfactory alternatives to Hg in products are available, and it is therefore fitting to induce a ban.\\"Edlich, Richard F.; Rhoads, Samantha K.; Cantrell, Holly S.; Azavedo, Sabrina M. and Newkirk, Anthony T. Banning Mercury Amalgam . US FDA =Sweden= Products containing mercury were banned in Sweden in 2009. =Denmark= In 2008, Denmark also banned dental mercury amalgam, except for molar masticating surface fillings in permanent (adult) teeth.

It authorized the Federal Housing Administration to guarantee up to $300 billion in new 30-year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders wrote down principal loan balances to 90 percent of current appraisal value. It was intended to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into the two large U.S. suppliers of mortgage funding. States are authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds. Enactment of the Act led to the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Legislative history  The Act was passed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 and signed by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008. = Subsequent amendments = Some provisions of the law were modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009.  Federal Housing Finance Agency  The Act also established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) out of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). Through the powers granted to FHFA, created by the Act, on September 7, 2008, FHFA director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The action is \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\\".  Subtitles of the Act = Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 = Included a first-time home buyer refundable tax credit for purchases on or after April 9, 2008 and before July 1, 2009 equal to 10 percent of the purchase price of a principal residence, up to $7,500. *Phased out the credit for taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). *Required taxpayers receiving the credit to repay it over 15 years in equal installments by imposing a surcharge on the taxpayers‚Äô annual income tax. The Act provided emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. = FHA Modernization Act of 2008 = An FHA loan is a mortgage loan whose repayment is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Act: *Increased the FHA loan limit from 95 percent to 110 percent of area median home price up to 150 percent of the GSE conforming loan limit, or $625,000), effective January 1, 2009. *Required a down payment of at least 3.5 percent for any FHA loan. Limited of regulation can Placed a 12-month moratorium second U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development implementation of risk- based premiums. *Prohibited seller-funded down payments. = Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 = This statute established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) as an independent federal agency. = HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008 = *Authorized the FHA to insure up to $300 billion of 30-year fixed rate refinance loans up to 90% of appraised value for distressed borrowers. Covered mortgage commitments made on or before January 1, 2008. *Required existing mortgage holders to accept the proceeds of the insured loan as payment in full for all pre-existing indebtedness. *Lender participation in this program was not required but voluntary to cover financial. As of February 2009, only 451 applications had been received and 25 loans finalized, far short of the estimated 400,000 homeowners who were expected to participate. This was attributed to high fees, high interest rates, the need for a reduction in principal on the part of the lender, and the requirement that the federal government receive 50% of any appreciation in value of the house. Congress began hearings on the program in February. = Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008  Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 = \\"Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act\\" (12 United States Code, Section 5100, et seq.), passed by Congress and signed by President G.W. Bush in 2008, required all states to implement a Mortgage Loan Originator (hereafter: \\"MLO\\") licensing and registration system by August 1, 2009 (August 1, 2010 for legislatures that meet biennially). States can operate their own systems, subject to stringent federal standards, or they can participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (hereafter: \\"the Registry\\"), a service operated jointly by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (CSBS/AARMR). If the state's licensing and registration program does not meet minimum standards at any time, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is empowered to step in and impose a compliant system upon the state. The SAFE Act was intended to provide uniform licensing standards nationwide, as these licensing standards had been non-uniform from state to state for the past 20+ years. It was also designed to create a comprehensive licensing database so that all relevant information on MLOs will be centralized and publicly available. This should allow consumers to perform research, obtain unbiased professional information, and help them choose professionals with whom to deal. Especially, it will aid them in identifying and avoiding bad actors. Eventually, it is hoped, widespread consumer use of the Registry will drive dishonest and incompetent MLOs out of the mortgage loan origination business entirely. Upon registration, MLOs are provided with a Unique Identifier number. All MLOs and their employers are required to provide this unique identifier to anyone who requests it, and the federally chartered mortgage institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, require that it be placed on all loan documents for loans that they purchase. Consumers will be able to use this number to obtain basic information on any registered MLO. This information includes name and aliases, employment history, current employment and contact information, negative civil judgments or settlements, and disciplinary and criminal history. The Act and the implementing regulations, which were issued jointly by the federal banking agencies in 2010 (12 Code of Federal Regulations III,section 365.101, et seq.), define a \\"mortgage loan originator\\" as any individual who both takes residential loan applications and \\"offers or negotiates\\" residential mortgage loan terms. Additionally, the individual must undertake these activities for economic gain (i.e., get paid for it). Persons who perform merely clerical or administrative tasks in connection with loan origination are not considered MLOs. The terms, \\"taking a mortgage loan application\\" and \\"offering or negotiating terms\\" are defined very broadly so that just about any person in the underwriting process who has more than cursory contact with a potential borrower is an MLO. Mortgage loans include financing and refinancing transactions, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and just about any other credit transaction secured by a first or junior lien on a dwelling. Not all persons who qualify as MLOs are required to become licensed or to register with the newly renamed Nationwide Mortgage and Licensing System and Registry (\\"the Registry\\"). Licensed Realtors and MLOs who work for federally regulated financial institutions, for example, are not required to be licensed as MLOs, although they are required to register. Those who would otherwise be required to register are exempted if they have (1) never been registered before and (2) perform five or fewer mortgage loan originations in any rolling twelve-month period. Registration must be renewed annually, and registrants must submit fingerprints for a criminal background check along with their first registration application.

It is an inhibitor of the protein kallikrein and a 60-amino acid polypeptide which was developed from a Kunitz domain through phage display to mimic antibodies inhibiting kallikrein. Medical uses=Angioedema= On November 27, 2009, ecallantide was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema for persons over 16 years of age. A single dose requires three separate injections, which are given under the skin. Ecallantide does not appear to be efficacious for the treatment of angioedema due to ACE inhibitors. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects are headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. Less common, but observed in more than 5% of patients in clinical trials, are respiratory tract infections, fever, vomiting, itching and upper abdominal pain. Up to 4% of patients showed anaphylaxis, which led to a black box warning in the US.  Interactions  , no interaction studies have been conducted. Mechanism of action HAE is caused by a mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene. Defective or missing C1-inhibitor permits activation of kallikrein, a protease that is responsible for liberating bradykinin from its precursor kininogen. An excess of bradykinin leads to fluid leakage from blood vessels, causing swelling of tissues typical of HAE. Ecallantide suppresses this pathogenetic mechanism by selectively and reversibly inhibiting the activity of plasma kallikrein. Ecallantide's inhibitory constant (Ki) for kallikrein is 25 picoMolar, indicating high affinity.

They were given the same boiler as the Class 50s which were developed in parallel and, like them, the newly developed 2'2' T 26 tender with its front wall that protected train crews during reverse running. In 1941 the two prototypes were built and delivered. The procurement of 800 locomotives had been planned, however the constraints of the Second World War meant that they never entered full production. After the war the two locomotives, with operating numbers 23 001 and 23 002, went to the DR in East Germany and were variously stabled in Berlin, Brandenburg an der Havel, J√ºterbog and Halle. In 1961, number 23 001 was given a Reko boiler with combustion chamber, developed for the Class 50. In 1970 the locomotive was given EDP number 35 2001‚Äì2. Number 23 002 was to be reconstructed, but was retired however in 1967 due to damage to the frame and scrapped.

It was built early in 1916 for trial by the Royal Flying Corps, with the features of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) Avro 504G but with a much more powerful engine; it did not reach production. Design and development The RNAS Avro 504G was a Gnome rotary-engined version of the Avro 504B with forward-firing Vickers guns and a Scarff ring-mounted Lewis gun in the rear cockpit. The Avro 527 was an equivalent two-seat fighter reconnaissance derivative version of the 504 intended for the RFC with the much more powerful, Sunbeam Nubian water-cooled engine. It used standard 504K wings and a central skid, single-axle undercarriage. Naval 504s had mostly been fitted with a vertical tail with a generous fixed fin, in contrast to RFC machines with the all-moving, comma-shaped rudder, and the 527 retained the fin as used by RNAS 504s. The engine installation was very different from other 504s, with two tall, almost vertical exhaust pipes, one from each bank of the upright V-eight Nubian, discharging just above the upper wing. Its radiator was mounted edge on (longitudinally) between the wings. The 527 first flew sometime in 1916. A version with wings of 6 ft (1.83 m) span was considered, the 527A, but there is no record of it flying. Operational history When trialled by the RFC, pilots found that it did not climb well and that their view was obscured by the large engine, its radiator and exhausts. As a result, production was not pursued and only one aircraft was ever built.

In 1779 Hippisley travelled to Italy where he became the British government's man in Rome. He married his first wife Margaret Stuart in Rome in February 1780. Margaret was the second daughter of Sir John Stuart, third Baronet of Allanbank. They had four children together ‚Äì Margaret Frances, born 1780; Windhamina Barbara (probably named after Hippisley's friend William Windham), born 1787; John Stuart, born 1790, and Louisa Anne. In 1781 Hippisley secured an appointment with the East India Company and moved to Madras, eventually becoming paymaster in Tanjore. He resigned from the Company in 1787 and returned to England in 1789. In the following year he was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sudbury. At the general elections of 1796 and 1801 he was not returned to Parliament, but he was successful in 1802 and retained his seat until 1818 when he retired from the House of Commons. In 1792 Hippisley returned to Italy and remained there until 1795, during which time he served as a semi-official representative of the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger at the Court of Pope Pius VI. Upon returning to England he was called upon to negotiate the marriage between Prince Frederick of W√ºrttemberg (later Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg) to Charlotte, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of George III. After bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion, Hippisley finally received his long-sought baronetcy on 10 May 1796 In 1799 the plight of Henry Benedict Stuart, the last representative in the male line of the Royal House of Stuart, was brought to Hippisley's attention by Dr. Stefano Borgia. Cardinal York was living in France, ill and penniless, and Hippisley persuaded George III to award him an annual pension of ¬£4,000. Second marriage and later years Portrait by Pompeo Battoni of a woman, traditionally identified as Margaret Stuart, Lady Hippisley (1785) Hippisley's first wife Margaret died on 24 September 1799 in Brompton, London. In 1800 he served as High Sheriff of Berkshire, where he owned Warfield Grove, a red-brick Georgian mansion which he had bought from Admiral Sir George Bowyer. Hippisley sold the house to the Earl of Mountnorris in the early 19th century. In February 1801 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Anne Coxe (n√©e Horner), the widow of Henry Hippisley Coxe (1748-1795) of Ston Easton Park, Somerset, MP for Somerset (1792-5). Despite the similarity of their names, John was not closely related to the Hippisleys of Ston Easton, if at all. He may have changed the spelling of his name around this time to further legitimise his position at Ston Easton. Hippisley was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a vice-president and supporter of the Literary Fund Society, a benefactor of Downside Abbey, one of the principal promoters of the literary institutions of Bath and Bristol, a member of the government committee of the Turkey Company, vice-president of the West of England Agricultural Society and a member of the Society of Antiquarians. He was however not a popular man with all his contemporaries. The Rev. John Skinner referred to him as 'that great orator' and a 'great ass' in his diary, published as The Journal of a Somerset Rector, while in 1810 the wit and politician Joseph Jekyll described how during a speech by Hippisley in parliament 'the house coughed him down five times in vain, and the catarrh lasted two hours'. Hippisley had no children with Elizabeth. He retired from political life in 1818 and died on 3 May 1825 in Grosvenor Street, London. He was buried in the Inner Temple vault on 12 May 1825. His widow Elizabeth died on 25 March 1843 in Grosvenor Square, London, whereupon the Ston Easton estate was inherited by her grandnephew, John Hippisley. Sir John was succeeded as baronet by John Stuart Hippisley, his son by his first wife, but he died unmarried in Mells, Somerset on 20 March 1867, whereupon the baronetcy became extinct.

Yves Manglou (born 20 August 1943 in Bras-Panon, R√©union) is a R√©unionese writer who writes in both French and R√©union Creole. Biography Yves Manglou grew up on the French island of R√©union at a time when traditional storytelling was still very popular. R√©union was still a French colony and the abolition of slavery had occurred less than a century before. Brought up as one of nine children under the watchful eye of his school teacher father and stay-at-home mother, Manglou enjoyed much freedom exploring the banks of the Saint-Jean river, often going barefoot and shirtless. From the end of 1960 to 1975, Manglou successively held the position of Director of Social & Cultural Institutions in Sainte-Suzanne, Soisy-sous-Montmorency and Boulogne-Billancourt. In 1971 he devoted a year of advanced study at the French National Institute of Popular Education at Marly- le-Roi to the study of the development of inter-disciplinary scholarship in rural areas. Manglou's study culminated \\"Animation and Development,\\"http://telemaque.injep.fr/Record.htm?idlist=1&record;=118112493639 INJEP a dissertation that was written in collaboration with Jean Sch√ºler and is considered authoritative in the field. In 1974‚Äì1975, as Director of the Youth Center of Boulogne-Billancourt, Manglou began to coordinate various volunteer organizations in a city of 120,000. The exhibition \\"Associations in the City\\", unique for its time, received 10,000 visitors. During this same period Manglou also obtained a ma√Ætrise in Human Sciences at the University of Paris, Val-de-Marne ‚Äì a foreshadowing of experienced-based learning, which was later formalized in France as Validation des Acquis de l'Experience.

The park consists of rich woodland and grassland habitat and is home to an assortment of wildlife. Two thirds of the site was once the Philips family estate, and the remainder, known as Waterdale, is Irwell Valley land reclaimed following the demolition of two bleach and dye works. The park is a local nature reserve. The park is also home to the Barn Countryside Centre. The visitor centre hosts many events for all ages, including willow weaving and pottery workshops, pond dipping and woodland management training courses. History Image of Philips Park taken around 1902 The park owes its name to the Philips family, who owned the land between 1799 and 1948. The land, which was originally part of the medieval Pilkington Park deer parkPrestwich and Whitefield Guide 2008-08-07: Digging up clues in the family's history was purchased by Robert Philips of the textile firm J. & N. Philips, in 1798. Robert and his wife Ann had two sons (the politicians Mark Philips and Robert Philips), and nine daughters.see: Responsible for the construction of the buildings, the Philips family also retained some natural and man-made features when landscaping the area. These included the ancient woodlands of North Wood, Mid Wood, Mere Clough, and a Medieval Deer pale marking the southern and eastern boundaries. The Liberal Party politician Mark Philips was born in the park on 4 November 1800. The family lived in Philips Park until the granddaughter of Robert Philips, Anna Maria Philips, died in 1946. The park was sold to Whitefield Council (to be shared with Prestwich Council) and opened as a public park in 1948. The contents of the park were auctioned, with items such as a Georgian mahogany dining room sideboard by Robert Gillow being sold for ¬£6. In 1971 the construction of the M62 motorway reached the area, removing much of the valley of the North Wood during construction. Buildings=The park= The car park where the park was located. Some of the foundations of the building are visible in this image. Completed by Robert Philips in 1830, \\"the park\\" was the family's main residence. Built in the Italian villa style and furnished by Robert Gillow, the house was situated close to a steep bank which sheltered it from the north. The front was well proportioned and the back faced onto a lawn. The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1950. The area where it stood is now occupied by a car park. Access to the park was originally from Park Lane. In 1852 a viaduct was built enabling carriages to be driven directly from Bury New Road, along Philips Park Road, to the park. The viaduct became unsafe and was closed off for many years before being demolished by the Royal Engineers in a controlled explosion in the 1960s. =Outwood Lodge= The former home of John Grundy (chairman of the East Lancashire Railway) and later Mark Philips, it overlooked the North Wood and was designed by Johnson of Lichfield. It was replaced by the present North Lodge from around 1890‚Äì1900. All that remains is part of a wall outside the North Lodge. =North Lodge= North Lodge with the entrance to Philips Park on the left. Located at the junction of Philips Park Road and Park Lane, this building replaced Outwood Lodge. Parts of Outwood Lodge were used in its construction. This building was used as staff accommodation until the death of Anna Maria Philips in 1946. Located at 53.537759,-2.304474 =Philips Park Road Viaduct= This viaduct was built in 1852 at a cost of ¬£8,000. Eight brick arches spanned the valley some below. The cost of construction was shared between Robert Philips, the Earl of Derby, and the East Lancashire Railway. The viaduct provided a direct route for coaches between Bury New Road, the park and Molyneux Brow railway station. The pathway underneath the viaduct to Mere Clough was the subject of a legal case, when the Earl of Derby's agent, Tom Statter, blocked the pathway to prevent acts of trespass. The case was dismissed and costs awarded against the Earl. Located at 53.537343,-2.29772 The viaduct was showing severe signs of dilapidation by 1965, and was subsequently demolished in November of the same year. The M60 motorway has replaced the path of the viaduct and other than the height of the motorway at that point (relative to the valley floor), no trace of its existence remains. =Philips Park Lodge= Philips Park Lodge, known locally as the \\"Witch's Cottage\\" was a small thatched cottage dating from and built in the style of the regency period. Latterly, it existed in a neglected condition for some time and had been subject to arson attacks by vandals. It was demolished in 1969 to make way for the M62 motorway. =South Lodge= The South Lodge, built in the same period as Philips Park Lodge, overlooked a small reservoir east of Molyneux Brow railway station, along an ancient packhorse route. As late as the 1960s, the property had no gas or electricity. Despite attaining listed building status, it fell into disuse and disrepair, and was demolished in 1974. Located at 53.531862,-2.312837 =Thatched Cottage= The Thatched Cottage was the original entrance lodge to Philips Park. Built alongside a tree-lined driveway, the cottage was replaced in the early 1900s by the North Lodge, although not on the same site. This cottage was demolished to make way for the M62 in 1968. Located at 53.536896,-2.304103 =The Stables= The Stables. Recently a nightclub, now being restored to pre-20th century state. This has involved the demolition of all the sections that were added to make a nightclub venue, revealing the original courtyard that had become hidden. The project has been supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Features=The Conservatory= The Conservatory. The conservatory was built in ashlar sandstone soon after 1800. Its facade has large rectangular windows with glazing bars and a central pediment. Its glazed roof has a circular lantern light. It is a grade II listed building. Its centerpiece was a bronze fountain with a stone basin from Florence, set in a moss lined alcove. A lily pond is below the conservatory. =Grass Walk= Grass Walk. The Grass Walk was a grass staircase leading to a Garden Temple originally housing a marble statue carved in Rome in 1856. Current status Some of the original buildings remain, such as the Grade II listed North Lodge and Grade II listed Conservatory, the Park Hall, and some of the staff accommodation and stables area. The original house occupied by the Philips family was demolished in 1950. In 1998 a restoration plan for the park was commissioned by Bury Council, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. A year later Philips Park was de-listed from the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England due to deterioration. The park is currently subject to a ¬£4m five-year plan to regenerate the area. In 2009 the Friends of Prestwich Forest Park successfully applied for a grant which, along with funding from Bury Metropolitan Borough Council, was used to clear Cobster Field. The field was a large expanse of grazing ground, the purpose of which was to impress visitors as their carriages came down the drive to the Philips' mansion but when the M62 motorway was built the field had been covered with subsoil and was reverting to woodland. The money was used to clear the field, reseed with grass, and reinstate the views down the Irwell Valley to Manchester city centre. Access Vehicular access to the park is by Park Lane, northwest of Junction 17 of the M60 motorway. The North Lodge of the park is located on the junction of Park lane and Philips Park Road. The lane crosses the motorway over a bridge. Access is also possible by foot or cycle by the multitude of old roads and trails around the park perimeter.

The first presenter on air was Roger Day and the first song played on air was Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. In early 1987, due to a nationwide reorganisation of the FM band, Piccadilly moved its VHF (FM) frequency from 97 to 103 FM. A year later, the Government and the IBA began encouraging all ILR stations with multiple frequencies to provide split programming in order to increase listener choice and competition. =Key 103= Piccadilly split its services into two on Saturday 3 September 1988. Key 103 launched at midday on 103 FM while the original Piccadilly Radio service continued on 1152 AM. The first presenters on air were Tim Grundy and Rebecca Want.

Education Page attended Barr's Hill Grammar School for Girls. She was later educated at Royal Holloway, University of London where, as an undergraduate she had been awarded the George Smith Studentship and where she obtained a First-Class Honours BA degree in English in 1966 followed by a Driver postgraduate scholarship. Early career Prior to her appointment to the Dome project, she was Chief Executive of English Heritage from 1989 to 1995, having been recruited by the then chairman, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu (chairman 1984‚Äì1992). She later worked for chairman Jocelyn Stevens.Press Release: New Chairman of English Heritage On her appointment to the Millennium Commission, Stephen Dorrell said: > \\"The work of the Commission will leave a permanent mark of the face of the > country and the job of the Chief Executive will be crucial to the > Commission's success.

She has been my chief collaborator and strong > support through a challenging period. I will miss her and her intuitive > wisdom very much indeed and I wish her the same success in her new job that > she has achieved at English Heritage. The Millennium Commission is > singularly fortunate in obtaining Jennie's extraordinary combination of > knowledge and management skills.\\" Before the appointments at English Heritage and the Dome project she was a civil servant in the Departments of the Environment and Transport, Britoil (formerly BNOC), London Docklands Development Corporation, and Pallas Group. She was also a non-executive director of Railtrack Group plc, a part-time appointment earning her ¬£26,000 per year. Railtrack Group was placed into members' voluntary liquidation as RT Group on 18 October 2002.Liquidation RT Group She was also a non-executive director of The Equitable Life Assurance Society which almost collapsed financially in the millennium year. The Society issued claims for negligence against nine former directors, including Page, but in 2005 conceded total defeat in a four-year ¬£3.2bn legal action to obtain compensation for policyholders. ¬£10.2m was paid to the former directors to cover much of their legal expenses with Page paid just over ¬£3m.\\"Final curtain falls on a long-running legal fiasco\\", Equitable Members Action Group, 3 December 2005 Position as Dome chief executive Page was headhunted for the job by the then Heritage Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, according to The Observer. Page had previously worked for the London Docklands Development Corporation and had a reputation for a hardheaded style of management. Cracks developing behind the scenes began to show in January 1998 when Stephen Bayley, creative director of the project, resigned. He described Government Minister Peter Mandelson, whose project it had become, as a dictator reminiscent of: \\"an East German Stalinist\\". Page was sacked as Chief Executive on 5 February 2000. She had come under pressure after an opening night fiasco on 31 December 1999, followed by poor attendance in January 2000 and a revolt by sponsors. She was replaced by an unknown 34-year-old Frenchman, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, known as \\"P-Y\\" and also nicknamed \\"the Gerbil\\" by the popular press, who had previously worked for the Disneyland Paris theme park. He was not thought particularly senior in the Disney organisation. During her time at the Dome, and with compensation for her early departure, she was rumored to have received a salary of ¬£500,000. Later, in June 2000, Page gave evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport. She stated that \\"[t]he Dome had been seen by ministers and the public as a political project almost since its inception\\". Page claimed that she had asked ministers to step back from the project to calm the controversy surrounding it. In what was seen as a reference to the close interest in the Dome from Peter Mandelson, the former so-called \\"Minister for the Dome\\", and his successor Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Page told the committee: \\"I made several attempts to persuade ministers that standing back from the Dome would be good for them as well as good for the Dome\\". Page added to her criticism of ministers by insisting that the unexpected decision by the Prime Minister Tony Blair to invite one million schoolchildren to the Dome for free had had a significant impact on its income. It meant many parents would no longer pay to visit with their families, and forced the building of extra facilities for the large school parties. A decision to ban visitors arriving by car also cut the public's level of interest. Post-Dome career In 2001 Page married Jeremy David Orme, an accountant.

Following the Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann, most consider the work to be a literary forgery, although a small minority argues for the book's authenticity. It was supposedly written in 1889 or early 1890 during Nietzsche's stay in a mental asylum in the Thuringian city of Jena. If legitimate, My Sister and I would be Nietzsche's second autobiographical and final overall work, chronologically following his Wahnbriefe (Madness Letters), written during his extended time of mental collapse. My Sister and I makes several bold and otherwise unreported biographical claims, most notably of an incestuous relationship between Nietzsche and his sister Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche, as well as an affair with Richard Wagner's wife Cosima. It is written in a style that combines anecdote and aphorism in a manner similar to other Nietzsche works. History My Sister and I was first published in 1951 by Boar's Head Books and distributed by Seven Sirens Press in New York City. Along with Nietzsche's authorship attribution, the translation from German was credited to noted early Nietzsche scholar Oscar Levy. The book was tied quickly to controversial publisher Samuel Roth, the putative owner of Seven Sirens, who had spent jail time for the unlawful distribution of a version of James Joyce's Ulysses (1922). In the book's introduction, an anonymous publisher claimed to have received the manuscript from a fellow inmate of Nietzsche's in Jena and to have hired Levy to translate the work only to have both German and English manuscripts confiscated, with only the latter surviving. In a response letter, Levy's daughter vehemently denied her father's involvement with My Sister and I. Kaufmann claimed in a footnote in his Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (first published 1950) to have received a ghostwriting confession from minor author David George Plotkin in 1965.Kaufmann, Walter. Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist. Princeton University Press, 2013, p. 503. Reception Nietzsche scholars in general adopted the opinion of Kaufmann, who immediately identified the book as a forgery in a 1952 article. Evidence against the book cited both by Kaufmann and later commentators includes chronologically unsound information, such as a reference to an 1898 incident, incongruous references to Marxism and the city of Detroit (globally unknown in the late 19th century), a seemingly poor grasp of philosophy, and the book's sexualized pulpy content. Kaufmann also notes instances of clever wordplay in this English text that are impossible to express as such in the German language. Since the only copy of this alleged work is in English, and there was never a single page of what would have been his original in German, opinion has been largely that the work is a forgery. Nevertheless, a minority holds the work to be authentic. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a handful of articles began to call for its reevaluation, including references to more recently discovered journals and letters from Nietzsche and Cosima Wagner. Amok Books' 1990 edition reprints many secondary articles on the subject, and includes an original introduction calling for a reevaluation of the book. Nietzsche scholar Walter K. Stewart, in his 185 page monograph Nietzsche: My Sister and I ‚Äî A Critical Study published in 2007, argues for the original's potential legitimacy by conducting a point-by-point analysis of Kaufmann's book review. In his 2011 followup, Friedrich Nietzsche My Sister and I: Investigation, Analysis, Interpretation, Stewart uses direct textual analysis to argue that whoever wrote My Sister and I was intimate with every aspect of Nietzsche‚Äôs life and perspective.

Introduced in Star Wars (1977), the stormtroopers are the elite shock troops/space marines of the Galactic Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine and his commanders, most notably Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, during the original film trilogy (1977‚Äì1983). The prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2005) establishes their origin as the Galactic Republic's clone troopers, clones of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, used by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to \\"win\\" the Clone Wars and later to take over the government and exterminate the Jedi. Despite this, later stormtroopers are established as recruits; at the time of the original trilogy, only a few stormtroopers are clones, with the only known legion to still contain a significant number of clones being the 501st Legion, aka \\"Vader's Fist\\". In the sequel trilogy (2015‚Äì2019), the upgraded stormtroopers serve the First Order under the leadership of Supreme Leader Snoke and his commanders, most notably Kylo Ren, General Hux, and Captain Phasma. The final film of the trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker (2019), introduces Sith Troopers, an upgraded variant of the First Order stormtroopers that sport red armor and serve the Final Order, led by a resurrected Emperor Palpatine. The order of battle of the Stormtrooper Corps is unspecified in the Star Wars universe. Accompanying the Imperial Navy, stormtroopers are able to be deployed swiftly and respond to states of civil unrest or insurrection, act as a planetary garrison, and police areas within the Galactic Empire. They are shown in collective groups of varying organizational sizes ranging from squads to legions and for some, their armor and training are modified for special operations and environments. Development Stormtroopers' designs were intended to look \\"terrifying, but also supercool, super clean\\", with the helmets being \\"very stylized skulls\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ekj17ldqk Star Wars  The Evolution of the Stormtrooper In early drafts of Star Wars and Ralph McQuarrie's concept designs, stormtroopers were to wield lightsabers and hand-held shields as common weapons not limited to the Jedi or Sith. George Lucas, when composing background information in 1977, stated that females did exist in the Stormtrooper Corps, although there were few stationed on the Death Star. He suggested that there were numerous in other units.Guenette, Robert, director. The Making of Star Wars: as Told by C-3PO and R2D2. Films Inc., 1977. =Performers= While stormtrooper performers like Michael Leader (Episode IV), Laurie Goode (Episode IV), Peter Diamond (Episode IV-VI), Stephen Bayley (Episode IV), and Bill Weston (Episode IV) have generally been uncredited in the film series, there have been a few exceptions. In Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005), the clone troopers, which serve as the basis of what would become the Empire's stormtrooper force, were computer- generated images and voiced by Temuera Morrison, who played the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template of the clone army. The child clone troopers were played by Daniel Logan, who also played Jango's clone son Boba Fett, and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor, who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison. In Revenge of the Sith, Morrison also played Commander Cody, the only named clone trooper who is seen unmasked in the prequel trilogy. In The Force Awakens (2015), John Boyega stars as Finn, the former Stormtrooper FN-2187 who defects from the First Order and joins the Resistance, and Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma, commander of the First Order's stormtroopers. Daniel Craig has a small uncredited role as a stormtrooper whom Rey compels using the Jedi mind trick to let her escape from captivity, and director J. J. Abrams also cast Alias and Lost composer Michael Giacchino as FN-3181, and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich as FN-9330. A riot control stormtrooper who calls Finn a traitor during the battle on Takodana, portrayed by stunt performer Liang Yang and voiced by sound editor David Acord, is identified as FN-2199 in the anthology book Star Wars: Before the Awakening (2015) by Greg Rucka. The trooper, armed with a \\"Z6 baton\\" and dubbed \\"TR-8R\\" by fans, quickly inspired multiple memes and fan art. Actor/director Kevin Smith also voiced a stormtrooper in the Takodana sequence. In Star Wars Rebels, different voice actors have provided the voices of the stormtroopers, including David Acord, Dee Bradley Baker, Steven Blum, Clancy Brown, Robin Atkin Downes, Greg Ellis, Dave Fennoy, Dave Filoni, Tom Kane, Andrew Kishino, Phil LaMarr, Liam O'Brien, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Andr√© Sogliuzzo, Stephen Stanton, Greg Weisman, Gary Anthony Williams, and Matthew Wood. In Ralph Breaks the Internet, the stormtroopers in the \\"Oh My Disney\\" website are voiced by Jesse Averna, Kevin Deters, Jeremy Milton, and Rich Moore. Jason Sudeikis and Adam Pally play scout troopers in \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", the 2019 first-season finale episode of The Mandalorian. Background=Skywalker saga= Introduced in Star Wars (1977), the Imperial stormtroopers serve as the army of the Galactic Empire, establishing Imperial authority and putting down any revolts. In the prequel film Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002), the first clone troopers are cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett, to be the Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars. In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005), Chancellor Palpatine orders them to slay their Jedi generals in the Great Jedi Purge, effectively making them stormtroopers. The Imperial Stormtrooper Corps swell in size after Palpatine completely replaced the clones with recruits and conscripts of the Empire, though the replacement of clones with natural beings lowered the effectiveness of the Empire's soldiers. With the Empire firmly stabilized and an Imperial Army and Navy established, the stormtroopers are integrated into Palpatine's personal army and stationed on Imperial bases and cruisers, as well as on the Death Star. As established in The Force Awakens (2015), after Palpatine's death the stormtroopers continue to serve under the factions that broke apart from the Empire. With redesigned armor, they eventually serve under the leadership of the First Order.Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). In the First Order, an undisclosed number of stormtroopers are abducted as young children, given serial numbers for names and mentally conditioned for loyal service. Stormtrooper FN-2187, later known as Finn, plans his escape when his resistance to this conditioning puts him in line to be reprogrammed. Additionally, Rey's goggles were based on scavenged stormtrooper lenses. =Other appearances= The streaming series The Mandalorian, which is set after the fall of the Empire, portrays stormtroopers as freelance mercenaries in the service of Moff Gideon, a former officer of the Imperial Security Bureau. Star Wars Legends media such as games and comics feature a number of specialized stormtrooper units. The Marvel-produced comics of the late 1970s and early 1980s featured Shadow Troopers. Other specialists have included commandos and troopers equipped to work in the vacuum of outer space, such as the zero gravity Spacetroopers depicted engaging in extra vehicular battle in the 1991 novel Star Wars: Heir to the Empire, and its 1995 Dark Horse Comics adaptation. A distinct variant known as \\"Shadowtroopers\\" appear in Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, wearing black armour that incorporates a lightsaber-resistant mineral called cortosis. As a project of the Dark Jedi named Desann aligned with a Remnant of the Empire, the Shadowtroopers themselves had been immersed in a Force nexus on Ruusan, temporarily empowering them with Force sensitivity. This armour has a green synthetic gem set into the breastplate which sustained the otherwise temporary effect of their Force empowerment and combines with their abilities to render them near- invisible, with only a faint area of blue discoloration giving them away. In conjunction with their Force-granted telekinesis, reflexes, and agility, the Shadowtroopers are armed and trained in the use of mass-produced red lightsabers. Their combination of abilities allow them to lie in wait and ambush the enemy, representing formidable opponents even for trained Jedi, most often the game's Jedi protagonist, Kyle Katarn. Shadow stormtroopers appear in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and wear exactly the same type of Phase III armor as normal stormtroopers but not white in color, but rather a mixture of silver, grey and red detailing. These troopers also possess the invisible feature and use this tactic to ambush their enemies, but only if stormtrooper officers call out for support. In Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, Speedo-clad and stormtrooper-helmet-wearing \\"Beach Troopers\\" appear relaxing at the beach. In Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, they also wear life jackets. Description According to Star Wars lore, Imperial stormtroopers are human men and women who have been recruited (or conscripted) at a young age to serve as expendable foot soldiers of the Empire, gradually replacing clone troopers as their accelerated aging forces them to retire. These recruits are trained at Imperial Academies spread out across the galaxy where they undergo intense conditioning that instills fierce loyalty, strict discipline and ruthless efficiency while removing any sense of individualism or empathy. As the backbone of the Imperial Army, stormtroopers are dreaded for their brutality, carrying out atrocities in the name of Emperor Palpatine, and their fanaticism, engaging the enemy with no regard to casualties. Inevitably, some use their position for personal gain against a civilian population too terrified to resist. However, inconsistencies in academy standards led to stormtroopers of varying combat skill and ability.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 298-299 After subduing any remaining Separatist holdouts left over from the Clone Wars, stormtroopers primarily serve as an internal security and peacekeeping force until the Galactic Civil War where they start to engage the Rebel Alliance in large-scale battles. Unable to conscript millions of soldiers to fill its stormtrooper ranks, yet unwilling to switch back to using a rapidly produced clone troopers, First Order stormtroopers are bred, trained and indoctrinated from birth, raised their entire lives for no other purpose. First Order soldiers and crews have constantly trained for combat in war games and simulations, making them much more effective one-on- one than the endless waves of stormtrooper conscripts fielded by the Galactic Empire. First Order stormtroopers are regularly put through mental indoctrination and propaganda programs, to make sure that they remain fanatically loyal and never hesitate or question orders. Being taken from their families at birth, these soldiers are not even given individual names for themselves but merely serial numbers, such as \\"FN-2187\\". =Equipment=VehiclesWeapons The standard firearm for Imperial stormtroopers is the BlasTech E-11 blaster rifle, described in Star Wars sources as combining excellent range and firepower in a compact and rugged design. Features include a telescopic range-finding sight, accessory mounting rail, power setting adjuster, three-point folding stock, magnatomic adhesive pistol grip, and advanced cooling system. Plasma cartridges provide enough gas for 500 shots, though a standard power cell which energizes the gas to produce blaster bolts will last for approximately 100 shots.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 268-269 In addition to the E-11, stormtroopers employ a variety of different weapons as seen in the Star Wars films and other media. Examples include thermal detonators, sniper rifles, crew-served heavy repeating blasters, and mortars.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 270, 277, 282 Both firing and non-firing prop models of the E-11 were based on the Mk 4 Sterling submachine gun, with approximately 20 models built for the first Star Wars movie A New Hope. External modifications to the Sterlings to transform them into blaster rifles varied based on the parts available but most were similar in design. This included an American Mk38 azimuth tank scope and a Hengstler industrial counter box affixed to the top and left side of the receiver respectively. The Sterling would continue to serve as the basis for or inspire other blaster rifle designs in the rest of the Star Wars films. Background literature explains how the First Order's stormtroopers were armed in secret by the Sonn- Blas Corporation, a subsidiary of BlasTech Industries and Merr-Sonn Munitions created to circumvent the New Republic's disarmament treaties. Building on classic design templates, they are meant to possess greater battlefield accuracy, ammunition yields and operational lifespans. Examples include the F-11D blaster rifle, SE-44C blaster pistol, and FWMB-10 repeating blaster cannon. For subduing civilian populations, First Order stormtroopers will also carry ballistic riot shields and riot control batons.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 284-287 Armor As established in the original Star Wars trilogy of films, the troopers' most distinctive equipment is their white battle armor, which completely encases the body and typically has no individually distinguishing markings. According to in-universe reference material, this armor was developed and manufactured by the Imperial Department of Military Research, and consists of 18 white plastoid armor plates magnatomically attached to a black body glove. These plates are generally impervious to most projectile weapons and blast shrapnel, and will protect against glancing hits by other blaster rifles though a direct hit will penetrate. The armor also provides protection against inhospitable environments, including the vacuum of space for a short period of time. Their helmets are fitted with filtration systems for polluted environments, with hookups for incorporating an external atmospheric tank while operating in space or to filter potent toxins. The helmets also include built-in communication system and multi-frequency targeting and acquisition system linked to in-lens displays that provide tactical information, protection from excessive brightness, and vision modes for seeing through smoke, fire and darkness. Based on conceptual drawings by Ralph McQuarrie, Liz Moore and Nick Pemberton sculpted designs for the helmet, Brian Muir sculpted armor pieces for the stormtrooper costume. Muir, who was also responsible for sculpting the Darth Vader costume, worked out of the Art Department at Elstree Studios. The suit was molded and initially cast in plaster, with Muir sharpening the detail at the plaster stage. The plaster casts were then remolded and cast in fiberglass to use as the \\"tools\\" for the vacuum forming process. The suits were produced in house by Tashy Baines, the resident vacuum former, but then a problem developed with the machine. As Shepperton Design Studios had already been used to vacuum form the helmets, the fiberglass molds for the armor were then sent to them for vacuum forming the suits. By the end of production, two different helmets were produced; one for the common stunt trooper and a second design for close-ups. Fifty stunt helmets were produced in white-painted HDPE and six hero helmets were produced in white ABS plastic. Besides the material used, the two designs can be differentiated by differences in the eyes, the ears, and the mouth area. The copyright status of the armor design has undergone legal challenges. A 2004 lawsuit by Lucasfilm against one of the original prop designers, Andrew Ainsworth, who had been selling helmet replicas, confirmed the design to be under copyright in the US. However, a 2011 UK court decision in Ainsworth's favor deemed the costume to be industrial design, which is protected there only for 15 years. This puts the armor design in the public domain in the UK, and likely throughout the European Union. To differentiate the First Order stormtroopers from their earlier Imperial counterparts, the helmet and armor were redesigned for the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens by costume designer Michael Kaplan with input from director J. J. Abrams. Within the Star Wars setting, this armor is described as being an improvement over the previous iteration, including better joint design for greater flexibility, stronger betaplast armor plating, and upgraded helmet communication and targeting systems. =501st Legion= The 501st Legion Elite Stormtrooper Unit, or \\"Vader's Fist\\", is a stormtrooper unit from the Star Wars movies and Star Wars Legends continuity. Commanded by the ruthlessly cunning General Maximilian Veers and composed of the best trained soldiers in the Star Wars galaxy, the legion earned a fierce reputation for completing missions considered unwinnable or suicidal. The 501st serves as Darth Vader‚Äôs personal death squadron, whom he leads in the Jedi extermination. The 501st spearhead the assault upon the Tantive IV consular ship, and capture Princess Leia. During the Battle of Hoth, the 501st is instrumental in the destruction of the Rebel Alliance base, and nearly succeeds in capturing the Millennium Falcon. Most of the background story linked to the 501st comes from Star Wars novels, the games Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars The Force Unleashed, and the TV show Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The elite 501st designation is resurrected by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who in the Thrawn trilogy is charged with the defense of the \\"Hand of the Empire\\" imperial remnant forces. Thrawn's 501st is composed of aliens, humans and Jango Fett clones. The First Order‚Äôs 501st units wear stark white armor derived from that worn by the Republic's clone troopers and the Empire‚Äôs stormtroopers. Members of this new generation of stormtroopers are trained from birth, growing up with unit designations instead of names and fed a steady diet of First Order propaganda to ensure absolute loyalty. Where the Empire opted for numbing routine, the First Order‚Äôs training simulations and live-fire drills encourage improvisation on the battlefield, making these stormtroopers more dangerous than their Imperial predecessors. The Legion's name is based on a fan organization of the same name; their inclusion in the official continuity was based on the worldwide organization's dedication to Star Wars fandom. =Specialists= Within the Star Wars franchise, several types of \\"military occupation specialist\\" stormtrooper units are seen. These include: Imperial variants * Sandtroopers are first seen on the desert world of Tatooine during Star Wars (1977). They are trained to serve in arid environments and their armor is equipped with cooling units, anti-glare lenses, extra rations and water supplies. Sandtroopers can be distinguished by their colored pauldrons which indicate rank: black for enlisted, white for sergeants, and orange for unit leaders.Lucendo, et al. (2018), p. 190-191Barr, et al. (2019), p. 128 Sandtroopers that ride Dewbacks are known as Dewback riders. * Snowtroopers, also known as cold weather assault stormtroopers, are first seen during the battle of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Their armor is insulated against cold weather and modified with polarized snow goggles, heated breather mask, insulated belt cape and ice boots. Battery packs can keep their systems powered for up to two weeks, while additional cold-weather gear is carried including grappling hooks, ion flares and homing beacons.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 133 * Scout Troopers are first seen on Endor in Return of the Jedi (1983). They are trained in advanced reconnaissance and with an unusual degree of independence so they can serve as scouts and snipers far from Imperial support. Their armor is lighter than standard stormtrooper suits, with protection only covering the upper body and head, while their helmets incorporate a boosted communication system and enhanced macrobinocular viewplate for spotting targets at long range. On Endor, scout troopers piloted swift 74-Z speeder bikes to patrol the area around the Death Star II's shield generator.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 137 * Shock Troopers are an updgraded variant of the Clone Shock Troopers, the red-armored clone troopers, who first appeared in Revenge of the Sith (2005). They patrol government facilities and serve as bodyguards for Emperor Palpatine and those closest to him.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 87 * Death Troopers are elite soldiers of Imperial Intelligence which make their first appearance in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016). Undergoing rigorous training and receiving top-secret augmentations which boost their performance beyond human limitations, death troopers are assigned to defend VIPs such as Director Krennic and Grand Admiral Thrawn and take part in other operations critical to the Empire. heir classified armor monitors biofeedback implants in their bodies and can stimulate sensory organs for increased performance, features targeting systems far superior to standard stomtrooper versions, and is sprayed with a polymer called \\"reflec\\" that warps electromagnetic waves to defeat enemy sensors. The in-universe origin for their name is that it was specially chosen by Emperor Palpatine to play on rumors of an Imperial project to reanimate dead tissue.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 122, 275 The Star Wars novel Death Troopers, part of the non-canon Legends continuity, revolves around the outbreak of a zombie virus aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer. * Shoretroopers, also known as coastal defender stormtroopers, are introduced in Rogue One, where they are seen patrolling the beaches and bunkers of Scarif. They are described as uncommon stormtrooper specialists trained for combat in coastal environments on tropical worlds. Their armor is flexible and lightweight, designed to withstand corrosive aquatic environments and repel excess moisture, and can be modified to operate underwater. Shoretroopers are generally of sergeant rank or higher and command squads of other stormtroopers during instances of seaside combat.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 126 * Combat assault tank pilots and commanders, also known as tank troopers, operate the Empire's arsenal of armored repulsorlift vehicles, from troop transports to heavily armored hovertanks. Combat drivers are lightly armored, relying instead on the thick skin of their vehicles to protect them in battle. The commander stays in contact with his crew and with headquarters to keep updated on changing combat conditions. This type of troopers were introduced in the 2016 Han Solo comic book series, and made their on-screen debut in Rogue One. * Patrol Troopers are enforcement-based stormtroopers, commonly found in large cities with particular strategic importance where they take the place of local security forces. The urban counterpart to scout troopers, they ride speeder bikes much like them. Patrol troopers are first seen in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), where one such trooper briefly pursues Han Solo and Qi'ra on Corellia. * Swamp Troopers, also known informally as mudtroopers, are Imperial soldiers assigned to fight on swampy, war-torn worlds, often as a form of punishment. They wear gas masks and goggles, as well as camouflaged armour and cloaks. They are not considered official stormtroopers. Swamp troopers are first seen on the planet Mimban in Solo, with Han Solo having been one such trooper during his service for the Empire. * Wet-weather gear stormtroopers, also known as Mimban stormtroopers (for those stationed on Mimban), are trained to serve in swampy environments. Their armor is that of a standard stormtrooper, but heavily customized to allow for optimal operation in the areas where they are dispatched. They can be distinguished by their grey, muddy armor and waterproof capes. This type of stormtroopers are featured in Solo. * Range Troopers are first seen on Vandor in Solo. Considered to be one of the toughest branches of the Imperial Army, this type of troopers are selected from the ranks of the most skilled Imperial soldiers and usually assigned to protect valuable cargo, but sometimes can be deployed to combat zones. Range Trooper are outfitted with snowtrooper-like armor, including fur-lined kamas for protection against cold environments, and magnetic boots. * Jumptroopers, also known as rocket troopers, are outfitted with jetpacks. They are trained to act in unison, often swarming and overwhelming their targets. There are multiple variants of jumptroopers, such as the Arctic Jumptrooper, deployed in cold environments, the Desert Jumptrooper, deployed in arid environments, and the Forest Jumptrooper, deployed in forested areas. Jumptroopers are featured in various Star Wars media, both Legends and canon, with varying designs. * Dark Troopers have made various appearances in Star Wars Legends material, often with varying designs. They are commonly depicted as dark-armored cybernetically enhanced humans, or in some variations droids, and are used in small numbers by the Empire. Dark Troopers were reintroduced in the current Star Wars canon through the mobile game Star Wars: Commander (2015). * Shadow Troopers, also known as black hole troopers, are elite special-ops troopers featured mostly in Star Wars Legends material. Assigned to the Empire's mysterious Shadow Guard, one of their most prominent appearances is in the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, where they have shiny, reflective black armor that allows them to become invisible. Shadow Troopers returned in Star Wars Battlefront, which reintroduced them in the Star Wars canon. * Lava Troopers are an elite class of stormtroopers stationed at Fortress Vader on Mustafar. They are outfitted with heat-resistant black armor. Lava Troopers are featured in the comic book series Tales from Vader's Castle. * Forest Troopers are trained to serve in forested environments. They are distinguished by their camouflaged armor. Forest Troopers are featured in the novel Aftermath: Life Debt. * Seatroopers specialize in underwater operations. They are outfitted with breathing tubes attached to a scuba backpack and underwater propulsion jets. Seatroopers were originally introduced in Star Wars Legends in Marvel Comics' Star Wars comic book series, before being later reintroduced in the current Star Wars canon. * Spacetroopers are stormtroopers trained to operate in Zero-G environments. They resemble the standard stormtroopers, but are outfitted with a rebreather pack to survive the harsh conditions of space. Two spacetroopers can be seen outside the Death Star in Star Wars (1977). They have since made appearances in a few other pieces of Star Wars media. In Star Wars Legends material, a different variation of spacetroopers with a bulkier appearance, called Zero-G assault stormtroopers, are featured. * Flametroopers specialize in the use of flamethrowers. They have appeared in various Star Wars media, with varying designs. * Incinerator Troopers are outfitted with flamethrowers and heat- resistant armor. They are distinguished by their red pauldrons and the red markings on their armor. They are likely an improved variant of the flametroopers. An Incinerator trooper is seen in the season one finale of The Mandalorian (2019). * Special Commando Advanced Recon Troopers, or SCAR troopers, are an elite class of stormtroopers in the Imperial Special Forces division. Most of these stormtroopers are unique in terms of armor design, equipment, and specialization, and are deployed in small groups by the Empire, to complete tasks that require their talents. One notable SCAR trooper squad is Task Force 99, featured in the 2016 Star Wars comic book series. *Storm Commandos, also known as shadow scouts, are elite stormtroopers, trained to perform tasks that regular trooper are incapable of accomplishing. They operate in small groups and are outfitted with silver scout trooper armor to make them less visible for the enemy. Storm commandos are featured in various Star Wars Legends material, and were reintroduced in the current Star Wars canon through the mobile game Star Wars: Galactic Defense. * Heavy Troopers are an elite class of stormtroopers that specialize in melee combat. They are outfitted with electrostaffs and special combat armor. Heavy Troopers are featured in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and were reintroduced in the current Star Wars canon through Star Wars: Galactic Defense. * Riot control stormtroopers specialize in melee combat. They are outfitted with batons and sometimes a shield. Most riot control stormtroopers are used as a security force tasked with the dispersion and arrest of insurgents taking part in disruptive activities. A different variaton appears in the Legends game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, where they are outfitted with electrostaffs and sport unique armor rather than standard stormtrooper armor. * Rocket stormtroopers are stormtroopers outfitted with rocket launchers. They are usually tasked with destroying armored vehicles or buildings. Rocket stormtroopers have appeared in several Star Wars games. * Demolition Troopers are stormtroopers that speciliaze in the use of explosive weapons, such as smart rockets. They are featured in the video games Star Wars: Battlefront (2015) and Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017). * Heavy Weapons Stormtroopers, also known as heavy assault stormtroopers, heavy troopers, or heavy gunners, are stormtroopers that specialize in the use of large rapid-fire blasters. Heavy troopers have appeared in various Star Wars media, with varying designs. * Stormtrooper snipers are outfitted with sniper rifles. They can be distinguished by their visor and blue pauldron. A variant of the stormtrooper sniper, known as Imperial sharpshooters, appear in Star Wars: Commander; this type of sharpshooters are drawn from the ranks of elite scout troopers and outfitted with E-11s sniper rifles and a grey variant of the scout trooper armor. * Magma Troopers are stormtroopers used by the Empire to crush revolts on volcanic mining worlds, such as Sullust and Mustafar. They are outfitted with heat-resistant armor and a respirator connected to a backpack via a tube to protect them from volcanic ash and gasses. They can be distinguished by their black pauldrons (colored for the officers) and extra armor on their legs. Magma troopers first appeared in Star Wars: Battlefront (2015). First Order variants * Flametroopers are first seen during the attack on the Tuanul village on Jakku in The Force Awakens (2015). Often deployed alongside standard First Order infantry, these specialized units flush out entrenched enemies with roaring sheets of flame from their flamethrowers. They wear backpack-style propellant tanks, special helmets with slit-like lenses that reduce glare, and temperature-control body gloves beneath their armor. * Megablaster heavy assault troopers, more commonly known as heavy troopers, are introduced in The Force Awakens. They carry large FWMB-10 repeating blasters and web gear loaded with extra ammunition. * Riot Control Troopers are first seen during the battle of Takodana in The Force Awakens. While they resemble the standard First Order stormtroopers, these specialized units excel in riot control and are outfitted with non-lethal betaplast shields and Z6 batons. * Snowtroopers are first seen on Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens. They wear specialized armor and gear that let them operate effectively in icy conditions. Snowtroopers carry a backpack-style personal environment unit and wear insulated helmets with glare-reducing slit lenses, gloves, a kama, and a heat-resistant body glove beneath an oversuit of wind-resistant fabric. Snowtrooper teams scouted the planet that once housed Starkiller Base, eliminating native life forms that posed a potential threat. * Stormtrooper Executioners, introduced in The Last Jedi (2017), are a branch of military police specialists specifically founded to dispense final justice toward stormtroopers who are found guilty of treason. They are outfitted with BL-155 Laser axes used for execution and are distinguished by the black markings on their armor. * Jet Troopers are first seen on Pasaana in The Rise of Skywalker (2019). They are equipped with agile rocket packs that they use to soar into battle. Jet troopers specialize in aerial and space operations. * Treadspeeder drivers are seen on Pasaana in The Rise of Skywalker. Reminiscent of the Imperial scout troopers, they are outfitted with lighter armor and specialize in riding speeder bikes; in this case, the 125-Z treadspeeder bike, from which they take their name. * Electropod troopers are featured in The Rise of Skywalker. They are outfitted with electrical staffs called \\"electropods\\", but are otherwise identical to the standard First Order stormtroopers. * Raiders, featured in Star Wars Resistance, are an elite variant of First Order stormtroopers that specialize in hunting, especially relic hunting. They were mainly used by Supereme Leader Kylo Ren in his search for Sith relics. * SCUBA troopers, featured in Star Wars Resistance, specialize in underwater operations. They are outfitted with underwater blasters, flippers, and a breathing apparatus. * Tech stormtroopers, featured in Star Wars Resistance, specialize in extracting, decrypting, and analyzing data from droid memory cores or other sources.  Final Order variants  *Sith Troopers are introduced in The Rise of Skywalker. Loyal only to the Sith Eternal, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine's secret Sith cult, these elite stormtroopers make up most of the Final Order's military. As the next evolution of stormtroopers, Sith Troopers were raised by the Sith Eternal on Exegol to be the perfect soldiers, and outfitted with highly impact-resistant armor and better equippment than the First Order stormtroopers. They are distinguished by their bright red armor, which feature a slightly more textured pattern, although the overall design is reminiscent of past clone troopers. Sith Troopers draw their power and inspiration from the ancient Sith Order, with their armor's color meant to be reminiscent of the Sith's red lightsaber and strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. *Sith Trooper Officers are trained to command squads of Sith Troopers. Their armor is outfitted with advanced sensor technology. *Sith Jet Troopers are outfitted with jet packs. They closely resemble the First Order jet troopers, but are outfitted with red armor like the standard Sith Troopers. *Sovereign Protectors serve as the resurrected Emperor Palpatine's elite bodyguards on Exegol. Outfitted with red armor and full-body capes, they are reminiscent of the old Emperor's Royal Guard, but carry two-pronged blaster rifles instead of force pikes. Within Star Wars Legends material, Sovereign Protectors are the most elite variant of Imperial Guards. Cultural impact Stormtroopers have become cultural icons, and a widely recognized element of the Star Wars franchise. In 2015, an Imperial stormtrooper helmet from The Empire Strikes Back that was expected to sell at auction for $92,000 sold for $120,000. In 2019, a team of biologists named a new genus of Colombian spiders, Stormtropis, after the stormtroopers, noting the spiders, like the fictional soldiers, are \\"very similar to each other, with some capacity for camouflage but with unskillful movements\\".

Its statement is as follows. Let X1, ... , Xn be independent, identically distributed random variables, uniform on [0, 1]. We observe the Xk's sequentially and must stop on exactly one of them. No recall of preceding observations is permitted. What stopping rule minimizes the expected rank of the selected observation, and what is its corresponding value? The general solution to this full-information expected rank problem is unknown. The major difficulty is that the problem is fully history-dependent, that is, the optimal rule depends at every stage on all preceding values, and not only on simpler sufficient statistics of these. Only bounds are known for the limiting value v as n goes to infinity, namely 1.908 < v < 2.329. It is known that there is some room to improve the lower bound by further computations for a truncated version of the problem. It is still not known how to improve on the upper bound which stems from the subclass of memoryless threshold rules. Importance One of the motivations to study Robbins' problem is that with its solution all classical (four) secretary problems would be solved. But the major reason is to understand how to cope with full history dependence in a (deceptively easy-looking) problem. On the Ester's Book International Conference in Israel (2006) Robbins' problem was accordingly named one of the four most important problems in the field of optimal stopping and sequential analysis. History  Herbert Robbins presented the above described problem at the International Conference on Search and Selection in Real Time in Amherst, 1990. He concluded his address with the words I should like to see this problem solved before I die. Scientists working in the field of optimal stopping have since called this problem Robbins' problem.

He served in First Anglo-Chinese War and Second Anglo-Chinese War. He died during the Battle of Canton in 1857.  Early life  Bate was born in 1818, the son of the Governor of Ascension Island. He entered the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth at the age of 13, spending two years studying there.Rogers 1867, pp. 151‚Äì162 He was then appointed as a midshipman aboard HMS Isis, and sailed with her to the Cape of Good Hope. He spent five years at the Cape, transferring to HMS Britannia and then, on his passing his lieutenant's exam, to HMS Blenheim. He sailed with the Blenheim to the China Station. While serving there, the First Opium War broke out. A party of men from Blenheim was landed to attack Chinese positions. Bate was one of those involved, helping to capture a fort, but being wounded in the neck as he did so. For his actions, he was promoted to lieutenant on 11 October 1841.Baillie 1862, p. 23  Surveying career  HMS Royalist on a coral reef In autumn 1842, Bate was assigned to Commander Collinson on HMS Bentinck, who had been tasked with surveying the waters around the Chinese coast. In May 1842, he was involved in the attack on Chapu. Collinson was responsible for surveying the approaches to Chapu, and once the troops were landed, Bate accompanied them. He was involved in a hand-to-hand battle with a Chinese defender. Bate captured him, then opened the gates of the fort to the British, at which the Chinese fled. This earned him a Mention in Despatches from Vice Admiral William Parker who commanded the force. He returned to England in 1846, and took a series of scientific courses at the colleges at Woolwich and Portsmouth. He was promoted to Commander in 1848 and given command of HMS Royalist, with which he was to carry out further surveys of the Chinese coast. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 9 March 1849.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (1859). Volume 19. London: George Barclay. p. 118. He was taken ill with smallpox in 1852, but recovered and was able to complete his surveys, including one of the island of Palawan. After completing these tasks, Bate returned to England. In January 1856 he was appointed to command HMS Bittern, and to return to Chinese waters to conduct further surveys. He took command in April that year, but it was soon found that the Bittern was unsuitable to the task. Bate sent her back to Britain, transferring his command to the sixth rate HMS Actaeon, while he awaited the arrival of his new ship. While cruising off the Chinese coast, the Arrow incident occurred, the prelude to the Second Opium War, and the British decided to bombard the port of Canton. Bate was put in charge of the landing parties, and whilst overseeing operations from HMS Barracouta, was struck on the hand by some shot, and was slightly wounded. After the subduing of resistance, Bate took over and garrisoned a fort with 300 men. He held the fort under siege for five months, before the Admiralty ordered him to evacuate. He returned to the Actaeon, then at Hong Kong. As a reward for his services, he was promoted to Captain. Bate returned to Canton in November 1857, and delivered Lord Elgin's ultimatum to the Chinese officials. There being no reply, the navy began to bombard the port on 28 December.  Death  The spot where Bate died in Canton In the Battle of Canton, Bate volunteered to lead a party in storming the walls of the city. After landing, he was determining the height of the wall to be scaled with his sextant but was hit in the right breast by a ball fired from a jingal. He died half an hour later. Admiral Michael Seymour wrote to the Admiralty after the capture of Canton: He was buried in Hong Kong Cemetery at Happy Valley, Hong Kong.Ting 2008, p. 25  Legacy  Bate's strong Christian views led to him becoming lionised as a Christian hero.

Set in Norfolk, it features a developing friendship between two boys who share an interest in aeroplanes, living near RAF Coltishall during the months in 1974 when the Royal Air Force is phasing out its English Electric Lightning fighters and introducing the SEPECAT Jaguar. Mark won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She also won a prize for children's novels by new writers, sponsored by The Guardian newspaper. Atheneum Books published the first U.S. edition in 1979, retaining the Russell illustrations. Origins Jan and Neil Mark moved to Norfolk in 1969 and lived \\"directly under a flight-path, with Lightning fighters from RAF Coltishall taking off 200 feet above the roof\\". According to her obituary in The Guardian, she wrote her debut novel Thunder and Lightnings for \\"the Kestrel/Guardian prize for a children's novel by a previously unpublished writer\\", and won it. This was not the venerable Guardian Children's Fiction Prize (1966 to present), which annually recognises a book by someone who has not yet won the award; Jan Mark never won that. Evidently it was co-sponsored by a publisher; 2006 obituaries in The Guardian and The Independent named it \\"Kestrel/Guardian\\" and \\"Penguin/Guardian\\" respectively. Plot summary Andrew Mitchell moves to Tiler's Cottage in East Anglia. He goes to his new school and meets Victor Skelton in General Studies class. The two slowly become friends and do things together, including going to RAF Coltishall to see the aeroplanes, which are English Electric Lightnings. Victor is devastated when he discovers that his beloved Lightnings are to be replaced with Jaguars.

In the course of the war, he was the manager of the factories which produced weapons, ammunition, trucks and other equipment for the Paraguayan army. Life Jos√© Alfredo Bozzano Baglietto was born on December 7, 1895 in the Asunci√≥n neighborhood of San Jer√≥nimo, \\"just fifty metres from the Dockyards\\", which at that time was located there. The birth date is contained in official documents and was confirmed by his grandson, engineer Luis Lamas Bozzano, curiously because he gave another date (1899) \\"to remove a few years; pure coquetry\\", as stated at times his wife, Mrs. Virginia Cardozo of Bozzano, who in turn was the daughter of educator Ramon Indalecio Cardozo and sister of politician Efra√≠m Cardozo. His parents were the Genoese ship owner Jos√© Bozzano and the Argentine citizen Benedicta Baglietto. Bozzano spoke Italian, English, French and Guaran√≠ fluently and had extensive knowledge of classical Greek and Latin. He read Stefan Zweig, Emerson, Kant, Schiller and Goethe. His favorite Paraguayans writers were Manuel Dom√≠nguez, Cecilio B√°ez, Fari√±a Eloy N√∫nez, Carlos Zubizarreta and Rub√©n Bareiro Saguier. He learned piano with Nicolino Pellegrini. Bozzano lingered on Chopin and enjoyed Paraguayan music (his favorite song was √ëasaindyp√©, composed by F√©lix F√©rnandez and Jos√© Asunci√≥n Flores). Education Bozzano was educated at the Colegio Nacional at Asunci√≥n, studying the career of lawyer until the third year. He joined the Paraguayan Navy as midshipman on September 21, 1917. Since April 1918 he served in the state-owned national dockyards. In May 1920, the government of Jos√© P. Montero (1919‚Äì1920) sent him to the United States for further studies of Naval Engineering. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1924, Bozzano graduated as a naval architect and engineer. He went on to graduate school and in 1925 received a master's degree in Aviation Engineering. Bozzano returned to Paraguay during the constitutional government of Eligio Ayala (1924‚Äì1928). On March 9, 1925, he was appointed director of the national dockyards, by decree n¬∫ 20297. In March 1927, president Ayala commissioned him to Europe for ordering the construction of two gunboats for the Navy that would protect the Paraguay River in the imminent war with Bolivia. Bozzano departed with the plans that he himself had traced. After contacts with shipyards in England and Germany, the gunboats were eventually ordered from the Italian Odero Terni Orlando shipyard in Genoa. The two vessels, Paraguay and Humait√°, arrived in Paraguay on May 5, 1931. On December 28 of that year, Bozzano returned to the direction of the national dockyards. Chaco War The dockyards produced more than 300,000 hand grenades, the famous carumbe \`i (Guaran√≠ for \\"little turtle\\"), which, for the pride of Paraguayans in the war, proved more effective than the Belgian designed SIP grenades, used by the Bolivian army) and built and assembled the coachworks of 2,308 trucks (at a rate of five per hour). The dockyards also produced 25,000 mortar grenades and 7,500 aerial bombs. Another of his feats was the making of mortar tubes with 23 columns from old trams. At the same time, 4,300 iron bars and wooden tables were made for stretchers, stoves, autoclaves and even trepans for cranial surgery. Bozzano's factories also built equipment for the vital water well drilling in the Chaco. Another milestone in the dockyard's war effort was the reverse engineering of 15 cipher machines from a model bought in an undisclosed \\"European country\\".Farina, Bernardo Neri (2011).Jos√© Bozzano y la Guerra del Material. Colecci√≥n Protagonistas de la Historia, Editorial El Lector, Online edition Chapter Los Arsenales ante la Guerra. There were 4,400 truck drivers from the Paraguayan navy in the Chaco under the command of Captain Bozzano. He was appointed acting director of the military aviation on March 7, 1933 replacing Argentine World War I veteran pilot Vicente Almandos Almonacid. Works and awards He left a brief but very valuable book of memories, Reminiscences, which recalls the history of the dockyards in the war. It started as an essay made at the request of Justo Pastor Ben√≠tez, who thought to include it in one of his historical works, but ended up being a book by its own value. Bozzano was a Paraguayan officer heavily trained in science and technology.

From 1932 to 1935 he commanded a force of 6,000 workers who forged the iron that was decisive for the outcome of the war. When the conflict was over, Bozzano was awarded the Cruz del Chaco (\\"Chaco Cross\\"). He continued to serve to his country in different positions. During the government of F√©lix Paiva (1937‚Äì1939), Bozzano was appointed Minister of War and Navy on April 12, 1938 and then Minister of Economy on October 14, 1938. He also served as mayor of Asunci√≥n and a teacher at the School of Mathematics and Physical Sciences (Engineering) in the National University of Asunci√≥n. The government decree that awarded him the Cruz del Chaco described captain Jos√© Bozzano as \\"one of the most authentic craftsmen of victory\\". Death The last years of his life were spent working in the family owned shipyard at Varadero, Asunci√≥n. He was a living legend of the nation's history. Captain Bozzano died on December 14, 1969.

Private enterprises are usually incorporated under the Companies Act 2006, regulated by competition law and insolvency law, while almost one third of the workforce and half of the UK economy is in enterprises subject to special regulation. Enterprise law mediates the rights and duties of investors, workers, consumers and the public to ensure efficient production, and deliver services that UK and international law sees as universal human rights. Labour, company, competition and insolvency law create general rights for stakeholders, and set a basic framework for enterprise governance, but rules of governance, competition and insolvency are altered in specific enterprises to uphold the public interest, as well as civil and social rights. Universities and schools have traditionally been publicly established, and socially regulated, to ensure universal education. The National Health Service was set up in 1946 to provide everyone with free health care, regardless of class or income, paid for by progressive taxation. The UK government controls monetary policy and regulates private banking through the publicly owned Bank of England, to complement its fiscal policy. Taxation and spending composes nearly half of total economic activity, but this has diminished since 1979. Since 1980, a large segment of UK enterprise was privatised, reducing public and citizen voice in their services, particularly among utilities. Since the Climate Change Act 2008, the modern UK economy has increasingly been powered by renewable energy, but still depends disproportionately on oil, gas and coal. Energy governance is framed by statutes including the Petroleum Act 1998 and the Electricity Act 1989, which enable government to use its licensing powers to shift to a zero-carbon economy, and phase out fossil fuels. Energy ratepayers typically have rights to adequate standards of supply, and increasingly the right to participate in how their services are provided, overseen by the Oil and Gas Authority and Ofgem. The Water Industry Act 1991 regulates drinking and sewerage infrastructure, overseen by Ofwat. The Railways Act 1993, the Transport Act 1985 or the Road Traffic Act 1988, under the Office of Rail and Road, govern the majority of land transport. Rail and bus passengers are entitled to adequate services, and have limited rights to voice in management. A growing number of bus, energy and water enterprises have been put back into public hands, while in London and Scotland, railways may be wholly publicly run. While, post, telephones and television were the major channels for communication and media in the 20th century, 21st century communications networks have increasingly converged on the Internet. Particularly in social media networks, this has presented problems in ensuring standards of safety, accuracy and fairness in online information and discourse. Like securities and other marketplaces, online networks dominated by multinational corporations, have received increased attention from regulators and legislators as they have become associated with political crisis.

On top of ordinary principles of commercial law, based on contract, property, tort, and trusts, five main fields of law settled the rights and duties of enterprise stakeholders. First, UK company law determines the constitution, governance and finance of major corporations. Much of the Companies Act 2006 concerns the duties of company directors, and the rights of members, who are usually registered as holding share capital. Equity investment mostly derives from people saving for retirement in mutual funds, life insurance and pensions. Second, UK labour law structures the rights of employees and their representative unions against the management of an enterprise. Employees are entitled to a minimum floor of rights, and to rights of voice through collective bargaining or occasionally votes at work in their enterprise. Third, competition law, which is closely coordinated with EU law aims to protect consumers' and the public interest in choice in markets, particularly where enterprise is privately owned. Fourth, UK insolvency law determines the relative rights of creditors when an enterprise can no longer pay its debts when they fall due. Fifth, within the framework of UK constitutional law, the government's fiscal policy sets powerful incentives for the arrangement of enterprise. In particular, tax policy alters enterprise incentives for arranging corporate groups, the level and distribution of incomes, dividend returns to shareholders, consumer prices, and trading conditions. All enterprises are subject to general duties under UK environmental law and criminal law. =Corporate governance= *Companies Act 2006 ss 21, 112, 168 and 284, company constitutions, amendment, voting rights and removal of directors *Model Articles, Sch 3, paras 3 and 34, model articles for public companies *Companies Act 2006 ss 170-177, 260-263 and 419 (directors‚Äô duties, derivative claims, report) *Pensions Act 2004 ss 241-243, right of pension beneficiaries to nominate pension trustees *Charities Act 2006 =Labour rights= *Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher [2011] UKSC 41, minimum wage and working time claims *Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 ss 179, 219, 224, 244 (collective agreements not legally binding, immunity from damages for collective action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, no secondary action, meaning of a trade dispute) *ECHR article 11 *RMT v United Kingdom [2014] ECHR 366, secondary action *Health and Safety Executive =Competition and consumers= *TFEU arts 101 and 102 *Competition Act 1998 ss 2-3, 18-19 and Sch 3, prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and collusion *TFEU arts 106(2) and 345, state aid and neutrality to public ownership *Albany International BV v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie (1999) C-67/96 *Public procurement *State aid *Consumer Rights Act 2015 *Sale of Goods Act 1979 *Consumer cooperative *Consumer Protection Act 1987 *Environmental Protection Act 1990 =Insolvency= *Insolvency Act 1986 ss 175-176A and Sch 6, preferential rights in insolvency for employees and pensions *Re Spectrum Plus Ltd [2005] UKHL 41, interpretation of a ‚Äòfloating charge‚Äô *Insolvency Act 1986 Sch B1, paras 3, 14, 22 and 36, governance in administering insolvent companies Specific enterprises While many sectors of the economy function under general rules of enterprises alone, specific enterprise laws developed where \\"free markets\\" were seen as inadequate to protect consumer or public interests. In enterprises that concerned central social and economic rights, were \\"network\\" or \\"natural monopolies\\", for \\"public goods\\", or where significant capital investment was necessary, the UK law developed specific rules. Usually, a combination of public ownership, positive rights of voice for users or citizens, or sector-specific regulators emerged. These regulate the rights of exit, basic standards, and voice of stakeholders, beyond investors of capital or labour. =Education= According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 26 states everyone has the right to education, that is \\"free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages\\" and \\"higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.\\"UDHR 1948 art 26. See also European Social Charter 1961 arts 7, 10 and 17 and ECHR 1950 Protocol 1, article 2 and the Belgian Linguistic case (No 2) (1968) 1 EHRR 252. CFREU 2000 art 14. In practice, the UK has always gone further than international law requires, guaranteeing free childhood, higher and adult education, plus maintenance grants for most of the twentieth century. It has, however, been intensively debated whether schools should be allowed to segregate students according to parental income, and the extent to which fees deter people from pursuing the education they aspire to.L Dearden, E Fitzsimons and G Wyness, 'The Impact of Tuition Fees and Support on University Participation in the UK' (2011) IFS Working Papers W11/17 While universities have passed from being private corporations, to public, to autonomous institutions, tuition fees have varied dramatically since the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. Similarly, there are at least five different kinds of school: comprehensive schools that are publicly owned and run, grammar schools in some counties that have selective admissions, academies that are mainly public but enable some private contributions and governance, and private fee-paying schools that depend on charging parents money for tuition (also called \\"independent\\" or \\"public\\", following the Public Schools Act 1868 schools, in many quarters). Some schools also apply for \\"specialist\\" status if they focus on particular curriculum topics. endowments, funding councils paid for by taxation, and tuition fees levied on students. Cambridge's endowment, at ¬£6.25 billion is the largest, while tuition fees have been abolished in Scotland and remain highly controversial elsewhere. Universities in the UK do not have a coherent system of funding or governance, and both remain heavily debated. Before 1998, universities were funded mainly by central government, although they have been increasingly reliant on charging students and seeking to raise private capital. First, universities have the power to generate income through endowment trust funds, accumulated over generations of donations and investment. Second, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 there are funding councils paid for through general taxation for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For England and Wales, the Secretary of State appoints twelve to fifteen members and the chair, of which six to nine should be academics and the remainder with \\"industrial, commercial or financial\\" backgrounds. Funds are administered at the funding councils' discretion but must consult with \\"bodies representing the interests of higher education institutions\\" such as the University and College Union and Universities UK.Further and Higher Education Act 1992 ss 62-69 After the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, the English funding council was renamed the Office for Students in 2018. Further, there are seven research councils (AHRC, ESRC, MRC, etc.) which distribute funds after peer review of applications by academics conducting research. Third, and most controversially, funding may come from charging students. After the Second World War, tuition fees in the UK were effectively abolished and local authorities paid maintenance grants. The Education Act 1962 formally required this position for all UK residents, and this continued through the expansion of university places recommended by the Robbins Report of 1963. However, over the 1980s and 1990s, grants were diminished, requiring students to become ever more reliant on their parents' wealth. Further, appointed in 1996, the Dearing Report argued for the introduction of tuition fees because it said graduates had \\"improved employment prospects and pay.\\" Instead of funding university through progressive tax, the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 permitted ¬£1,000 fees for home students. In England, this rose to ¬£3,000 in the Higher Education Act 2004, and ¬£9,000 after the Browne Review in 2010 led by the former CEO of oil corporation BP plc. In 2017, the limit on fees was ¬£9,250 for students in England, ¬£9,000 in Wales, and ¬£3,805 in Northern Ireland. The same rates apply for European Union students, who cannot be discriminated against under EU law (e.g. Commission v Austria (2005) C-147/03). By contrast, under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish government resolved not to introduce tuition fees for students under 25.Scotland Act 1998 ss 28-29 and Sch 6 leaves higher education fees as a devolved matter. Under EU law, while the UK Parliament does not abolish tuition fees, that English students are charged tuition fees in Scottish universities while EU students may not be, because non-discrimination for free movement of citizens does not apply to internal domestic affairs.Brown v Secretary of State for Scotland (1988) Case 197/86 For English universities, the Higher Education Act 2004 enables the Secretary of State to set fee limits, while universities are meant to ensure \\"fair access\\" by drafting a \\"plan\\" for \\"equality of opportunity\\".Higher Education Act 2004 ss 23-24 (SS sets fees up to a 'higher amount') and 31-34 (Director of Fair Access requires fee-charging university plans). There is no limit on international students fees, which have steadily risen to typically around double. A system of student loans is available for UK students through the government-owned Student Loans Company. Means-tested grants were also available, but abolished for students who began university after August 2016. While EU students qualify for the same fees as UK students, they only qualify for loans (or previously grants) if they have been resident for three years in the UK.R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing (2005) C-209/03 As the UK is in a minority of countries to still charge tuition fees, increasing demands have been made to abolish fees on the ground that they burden people without wealthy families in debt, deter disadvantaged students from education, and escalate income inequality.A counter-argument is that abolishing fees would \\"be regressive, benefiting the richest graduates\\". See The evidence for this claim is unclear. Almost all universities by law require staff and student representation in the governing body. Governance of universities is set by each university's constitution, typically deriving from an Act of Parliament, a royal charter or an Order in Council issued by the Privy Council. The most progressive models support a high degree of voice for staff and students. Reforms were first put into law after the Oxford University Commission of 1852 stated it must reverse \\"successive interventions by which the government of the University was reduced to a narrow oligarchy.\\"Oxford University Act 1854 ss 16 and 21, cf Statute IV and VIOxford University Council Regulations 13 of 2002, regs 4-10. For example, since the Cambridge University Act 1856 set its rules in law,Cambridge University Act 1856 ss 5 and 12 Cambridge University's statutes require that its Regent House (mostly full-time university members) elects its governing body, the 23 member council. Four members are elected by heads of colleges, four by professors and readers, eight by other academic fellows, three by students, four by a \\"grace\\" (a vote) of the whole Regent House.Cambridge University Statute A, chs I-IV, and ch IV(2) on voting rights. At the London School of Economics, which unusually the legal form of a company limited by guarantee, its constitution currently requires its seventeen-member council to have two student representatives, three staff representatives. Anomalously, the King‚Äôs College London Act 1997 required a 38-member council with five ex-officio members, twenty lay appointees, eight elected by academics, three elected by students, and two by non-academic staff members, however the elected members were abolished in 2009. Other universities have a broad variety of governance structures, although if there is not a special statute or constitution, the general rules are set by the Education Reform Act 1988. This says that university governing bodies with constitutions issued by the Privy Council should have between 12 and 24 members, with up to thirteen lay members, up to two teachers, up to two students, and between one and nine members co-opted by the others.Education Reform Act 1988 ss 124A, 128, Schs 7 and 7A, para 3 (on constitutions by Privy Council) The wide variations in governing bodies raise the question about staff or student voice should have any limit, given their fundamental expertise in university life. So far as rights to other standards go for staff, or students, universities are subject to both judicial review and rights in contract law because they are seen as having both an equally \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" nature. In a leading case of Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Humberside a student claimed that she should not have received a third class degree after her computer crashed, she lost an assignment, and was forced to rush a new one.[2000] EWCA Civ 129 The Court of Appeal held that her application for both breach of contract and judicial review should not be struck out because there could be a good case to hear, so long as it did seek to overturn \\"issues of academic or pastoral judgment\\" where \\"any judgment of the courts would be jejune and inappropriate\\". However, the shorter time limit of three months in judicial review was more appropriate than six years in contract.[2000] EWCA Civ 129, [17] and [30]-[35] Cases which have sought to challenge academic judgment for failing students are typically bound to fail, as grading with a fair process is in the bounds of academic judgment. In Buckland v Bournemouth University, where the university management interfered with the academic assessment of student grades, this founded a right for a professor to claim he was constructively and unfairly dismissed.Buckland v Bournemouth University [2010] EWCA Civ 121 All access to education must be free from unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act 2010.Equality Act 2010 ss 90-94, 98-99, 116 The Higher Education Act 2004 provides for a modern complaints procedure to be followed in universities. ;Schools *Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833 *Public Schools Act 1868, following the Clarendon Commission removed charity schools from government or education department oversight, and now the main UK private schools *Elementary Education Act 1870, five to twelve-year-olds, school boards providing universal primary education *Education Act 1902, abolished 2,568 school boards and instituted 328 local education authorities in their place, following the Cockerton judgment *Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906, introduced free school meals *Education (Administrative Provisions) Act 1907, medical services *Education Act 1918, school leaving age raised to fourteen years, maximum class size of thirty *Education Act 1944, attempted foundation of a tripartite secondary school system, every child got free school meals, until 1949 when it was 2.5 pence *Education Reform Act 1988, schools could remove themselves from LEA oversight and become \\"grant- maintained\\" by central government, headteachers getting financial control, academic tenure abolished, national curriculum with key stages, league tables *Education Act 1996, teacher training, and opt-out from students' unions *School Standards and Framework Act 1998, thirty infant pupil class size limit, replaced \\"grant-maintained schools\\" with \\"foundation status\\" meaning money is channelled from central government through the LEA, restrictions on selection *Learning and Skills Act 2000 and Education Act 2002 and Academies Act 2010, allowed for academies outside national curriculum and autonomy over teacher pay *Education Act 2005, Ofsted inspections *Education and Inspections Act 2006, trust schools *General Teaching Councils and code ;Libraries *Museums Act 1845 *Public Libraries Act 1850 *British Library Act 1972 =Health= Like education, there is a universal right to \\"health and well- being\\" including \\"medical care and necessary social services\\".UDHR 1948 art 25. See also European Social Charter 1961 Part I, art 11, states \\"Everyone has the right to benefit from any measures enabling him to enjoy the highest possible standard of health attainable.\\" ICESCR 1966 art 12(1) acknowledges \\"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\\" CFREU 2000 art 35 requires a \\"right to benefit from medical treatment\\" under national law and a \\"high level of human health protection\\". ECHR 1950 arts 2, 3 and 8 (right to life, no torture, private and family life) set only the most minimum standards, although exceptions to most rights refer to protection of health. The National Health Service, founded in 1946, has consistently been seen as one of the most important aspects of the UK's constitution,See S Fredman, 'New horizons: incorporating socio-economic rights in a British Bill of Rights' [2010] Public Law 297, 299, citing Ministry of Justice, Rights and Responsibilities: Developing our Constitutional Framework (2009) Cm 7577, para 1.11 (ranking the NHS as a landmark next to the Magna Carta) and Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust, State of the Nation 2006 (2006) finding an ICM poll 88% of people said the right to NHS hospital treatment in a reasonable time should be in any future Bill of Rights, compared to 89% who wanted to include the right to a fair trial before a jury. and goes considerably beyond international human rights standards. Its founding principle, that everyone should receive health care free, as a right, is usually seen as politically \\"untouchable\\", and is consistently rated as the UK's most popular institution.e.g. P Armstrong, 'Socialized healthcare: The 'untouchable' of UK politics' (5 May 2010) CNN. British Future, State of the Nation (2013) 16-18 and 26 polling 2,515 people in 2012. See further, 'Public satisfaction with the NHS' (2016) www.kingsfund.org.uk However, the details of funding and governing health have been volatile and contested. The UK has among the world's highest life expectancy (82.8 years in 2015), but spends a relatively low amount of money on its service (9.7 per cent of GDP in 2016).See OECD, Health Expenditure and Financing (2017) at stats.oecd.org Since the Health and Social Care Act 2012 changed its governance, health care expenditure rose dramatically without visible health gains.Between 2012 to 2013, from 8.5% to 9.9% of GDP, or US$3069.7 per capita to US$3613.1, calculated by the OECD at 2010 prices: stats.oecd.org The National Health Service is funded directly by the UK Treasury from general taxation, which requires no citizen to buy insurance, or pay upfront costs (except for capped, and means tested prescription charges for medicines, dental and optical service in England.n.b. The first Minister for Health, Aneurin Bevan from the Labour Party leadership over introduction of charges for dental and optical services. Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland scrapped prescription charges).See 'NHS prescription charges from April 2017' (16 March 2017). See also, 'NHS Prescription Charges' (2012) politics.co.uk According to the NHS Constitution for England art 1(2), \\"Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual‚Äôs ability to pay\\".Department of Health, NHS Constitution for England (27 July 2015) art 1(2) Health care is a devolved matter, but each country of the UK organised its health system following the model in the proposals of the landmark Beveridge Report of 1942.Social Insurance and Allied Services (1942) Cmd 6404, ch 1, 11, \\"Medical treatment covering all requirements will be provided for all citizens by a national health service organised under the health departments...\\" The Beveridge model of health provision, common to countries like Denmark, Sweden or Greece, removed the requirement of contributions by workers under the National Insurance Act 1911.BB Gilbert, 'The British National Insurance Act of 1911 and the Commercial Insurance Lobby' (1965) 4(2) Journal of British Studies 127 Insurance systems continue in countries like France, Germany,Established by the Gesetz betreffend die Krankenversicherung der Arbeiter vom 15. Juni 1883, and now regulated by the Sozialgesetzbuch or the United States.Regulated by the Public Health Service Act of 1944, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, held constitutional in National Federation of Independent Business v Sebelius 567 US 519 (2012) As the UK government bears the cost of health care, and the potential to profit from people being ill is eliminated, the government has a strong incentive to improve public health with measures like the Public Health Act 1961, the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, or the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Aneurin Bevan at a Manchester hospital on the NHS's first day in 1948 said to get the British Medical Association to agree to a public health system he had \\"stuffed their mouths with gold\\". Today, the NHS has universal support and has among the world's best health outcomes for money spent.See OECD, Health Spending and [Health Statistics]. National Health Service governance has seen three phases of change. While the NHS Constitution states patients and staff should be \\"involved\\" and \\"engaged\\", the actual right of stakeholders to vote has been slow.NHS Constitution for England (2015) arts 3a (on patient rights and involvement) and 4a (on staff rights and engagement) First, and originally, the NHS Act 1946 created a system of 14 regional hospital boards that would pay for staff, buildings and equipment at hospitals, and gave grants to local health authorities in each council which ran health centres overseen by \\"executive councils\\".National Health Service Act 1946 ss 11-14 and Sch 3 (regional hospital boards), ss 19-52 and Schs 4-5 (local health authorities and executive councils). The Minister of Health (with Whitehall civil servants) appointed the regional boards, while executive councils and local health authorities were medical professional representatives (though not necessarily elected), local government and Minister appointees.NHS Act 1946 s 19 and Sch 5 In 1973, regional hospital boards were renamed regional health authorities, and 90 area health authorities plus 205 district health authorities took over from the more numerous local health authorities, while the government aimed to give stakeholders more direct voting rights in all.e.g. Democracy in the National Health Service (21 May 1974) C(74)49 remarking how despite some advantages in \\"the separation of functions\\" between management, staff and oversight by patients, \\"total separation is to challenge in a fundamental way the essence of democratic control\\". It sought \\"real devolution to those operating the service\\". Second, from the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 health authorities had to predict and account for their spending, and contract for their purchases of medical services from NHS trusts, which would compete among one another to sell health services. This did not yet mean that private companies could also compete, although the NHS (Private Finance) Act 1997 enabled the Secretary of State to approve \\"private finance initiative\\" schemes to borrow money for, or lease, the building and running of health facilities from private contractors (e.g. Telereal Trillium Ltd, Innisfree Ltd or HSBC Infrastructure Co Ltd). From 1995 to 2006 a new NHS Executive was created to manage the NHS in England, but was reabsorbed into the Department of Health. The executive or department oversaw strategic health authorities (28 reduced to 10), and primary care trusts (303 reduced to 101) which provided health services, and bought or \\"commissioned\\" \\"secondary care\\" health services (e.g. from a specialist doctor). From 2003, NHS foundation trusts were created, which could borrow money without Department of Health approval.NHSA 2006 ss 40-42 Under the National Health Service Act 2006 Schedule 7, its \\"council of governors\\" must have a constitution where at least three governors (but under half) must be elected by the foundation trust's employees, at least one by nearby local authorities, one by a university (if any) in the area. A trust's constitution is free to enable residents, employees or patients to vote, although the law does not fix rules. Third, instead of enabling NHS Foundation Trusts to take purchasing in-house, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 set up around 200 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to replace primary care trusts.HSCA 2012 ss 9-10 and ss 33-34 CCGs are funded and mediated by NHS England.NHSA 2006 s 1H referring to the \\"NHS Commissioning Board\\", which is branded as NHS England, inserted by HSCA 2012 s 9. According to the HSCA 2012, a clinical commissioning group is a \\"body corporate\\" that should buy services, with members who can set pay for themselves.NHSA 2006 s 1I and Sch 1A paras 10 and 13(1) \\"A clinical commissioning group may pay members of its governing body such remuneration and travelling or other allowances as it considers appropriate.\\" Inserted by HSCA 2012 s 10 and Sch 2, para 1. A CCG must include at least six members (many came from abolished primary care trusts, general practitioners or private business), with one person qualified in accounting or finance, a nurse, a secondary care specialist, and two lay people who understand finance and the local area.National Health Service (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 regs 11-12 Two central features of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 were that section 75 required commissioning was subjected to competition law (i.e. CCGs are potentially unable to cooperate to bargain down drug company prices, etc.),HSCA 2012 s 75 and section 165 enabled NHS foundation trusts to derive up to 49% of their income from private work.See NHSA 2006 s 44(6), after amendments by HSCA 2012 s 165. E Jackson (2016) 44, quoting King‚Äôs Fund, says the HSCA 2012 has not privatised the NHS but fragmenting structures will \\"have been profoundly damaging\\". It \\"seems likely that the massive organisational changes... contributed to widespread financial distress and failure to hit key targets for patient care...\\" In theory, clinical commissioning groups are meant not to discriminate, seek the best \\"value for money\\" and avoid conflicts of interest when buying services.NHS (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) (No 2) Regulations 2013 regs 3-6 However, the enforcement of the prohibition on conflicts of interest requires costly judicial review, while derivative claims by patients or staff are excluded without membership. Although CCGs are under a duty to \\"involve\\" patients and the public in decision-making,NHSA 2006 ss 14U and 14Z2 inserted by HSCA 2012 s 26 those stakeholders can be ignored because unlike in NHS foundation trusts they have no right to vote. The Care Quality Commission and a subordinate Healthwatch England network is meant to inspect and maintain standards. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 changes, and the private finance initiative have been opposed by protests and groups like \\"Keep Our NHS Public\\". Since 2012, with more private money, the cost of the NHS has risen without better outcomes. Although rights to vote are lacking, patients have some rights to bring claims in court over levels of service. First, the Secretary of State for Health is meant to improve the \\"physical and mental health of the people\\" and \\"have regard to the need to reduce inequalities\\" in health.NHSA 2006 ss 1A-C and 3 (service provision) These duties, however, are difficult to enforce in practice because the courts give wide discretion to ministers in judicial review. Second, it is possible to sue in tort for medical negligence if operations go wrong. This is controversial because (unlike New Zealand's Accident Compensation Corporation) claims require litigation, and substantial sums of money go to lawyers, instead of the person who is harmed and withdraws resources for other NHS patients. Third, challenges can be brought over the refusal to provide treatment, although they are unlikely to succeed. For instance, in R (B) v Cambridge Health Authority parents claimed their 11-year-old girl should receive a second bone marrow transplant for myeloid leukemia, even though doctors said success was 20% likely and would cause \\"considerable suffering\\".[1995] EWCA Civ 43 The Sun and The Daily Mail said the boy was being ‚ÄòCondemned by Bank Balance‚Äô and ‚ÄòSentenced to Death‚Äô by the NHS. Although Laws J held that refusal was inadequate,Doctors had to ‚Äòdo more than toll the bell of tight resources. They must explain the priorities that have led them to decline to fund the treatment.‚Äô Sir Thomas Bingham MR held the health authority acted rationally and fairly.\\"Difficult and agonising judgments have to be made as to how a limited budget is best allocated to the maximum advantage of the maximum number of patients. That is not a judgment which the court can make. In my judgment, it is not something that a health authority such as this Authority can be fairly criticised for not advancing before the court.\\" After the case, because of the tabloid campaign, a donor paid for ¬£75,000 in private treatment, but the operation failed. By contrast in R (Coughlan) v North and East Devon HA Mrs Coughlan successfully claimed to remain at the \\"Mardon House\\" care home after an accident left her tetraplegic and she was promised it was a \\"home for life\\". Lord Woolf MR held in judicial review that the promise generated a \\"legitimate expectation\\" that was \\"equivalent to a breach of contract in private law\\", which could not be unilaterally withdrawn, even if the Secretary of State was concerned about cost.[1999] EWCA Civ 1871 Further, in R (Ann Marie Rogers) v Swindon Primary Care Trust Sir Anthony Clarke MR held that a primary care trust's reasons for refusing Rogers Herceptin treatment for breast cancer were inadequate. This drug was yet not approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, but simply stating Rogers' case was not \\"exceptional\\" (as other people were refused the drug) was not a reason in itself, and its decision was therefore irrational.[2006] EWCA Civ 392 Within the European Union, British residents also have the right to move to other member states for treatment and be reimbursed if NHS waiting lists happen to be unreasonably long, assessed by objective criteria.NHSA 2006 s 6BB, following from TFEU art 57 and the Patients' Rights Directive 2011 (2011/24/EU). This is summarised in the Department of Health, NHS Constitution for England (27 July 2015) arts 3a(iv) ‚Äòin certain circumstances, to go to other European Economic Area countries or Switzerland‚Äô for services available on the NHS. For example, in R (Watts) v Bedford Primary Care Trust, Mrs Watts paid ¬£3900 for a hip replacement operation in France after the NHS waiting lists were 4 to 6 months, and successfully claimed that she should be reimbursed by the NHS.(2006) C-372/04. See also Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds; Peerbooms v Stichting CZ Groep Zorgverzekeringen (2001) C-157/99 These rights to move for health and be reimbursed by the NHS, however, may be removed if the UK leaves the European Union and the single market. No charges can be applied by the NHS to people who are \\"ordinarily resident\\" in the UK,National Health Service Act 2006 ss 175 although controversially the Conservative government introduced a \\"duty\\" on hospitals and health services to charge overseas visitors if they fall sick. Given the tiny number of cases, most health services refused to charge patients even when they could, because of disproportionate bureaucratic cost, and compassion.National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 regs 3-9 (charges cannot be made for emergency treatment). Another issue of migration, is that a deportation of an illegal migrant is very unlikely to be delayed by ill-health. In N v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that a citizen of Uganda had no right under ECHR article 3 to delay deportation, even though health treatment for HIV/AIDS was highly unlikely there.[2008] ECHR 453. Contrast D v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 423, where deportation was delayed due to the patient's imminent death. The UK, however, has the option at any time to improve its service beyond the minimum standards of human rights. =Banking= UK banking has two main parts. First, the Bank of England administers monetary policy, influencing interest rates, inflation and employment, and it regulates the banking market with HM Treasury, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. Second, there are private banks, and some non-shareholder banks (co-operatives, mutual or building societies), that provide credit to consumer and business clients. Borrowing money on credit (and repaying the debt later) is important for people to expand a business, invest in a new enterprise, or purchase valuable assets more quickly than by saving. Every day, banks estimate the prospects of a borrower succeeding or failing, and set interest rates for debt repayments according to their predictions of the risk (or average risk of ventures like it). If all banks together lend more money, this means enterprises will do more, potentially employ more people, and if business ventures are productive in the long run, society's prosperity will increase. If banks charge interest that people cannot afford, or if banks lend too much money to ventures that are unproductive, economic growth will slow, stagnate, and sometimes crash. Although UK banks, except the Bank of England, are shareholder or mutually owned, many countries operate public retail banks (for consumers) and public investment banks (for business). The UK used to run Girobank for consumers, and there have been many proposals for a \\"British Investment Bank\\" (like the Nordic Investment Bank or KfW in Germany) since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, but these proposals have not yet been accepted. The Bank of England acts as the UK's central bank, influencing interest rates paid by private banks, to achieve targets in inflation, growth and employment. The Bank of England provides finance and support to, and may influence interest rates of the private banks through monetary policy. It was originally established as a corporation with private shareholders under the Bank of England Act 1694,Bank of England Act 1694 5 & 6 Will & Mar c 20. to raise money for war with Louis XIV, King of France. After the South Sea Company collapsed in a speculative bubble in 1720, the Bank of England became the dominant financial institution, and acted as a banker to the UK government and other private banks. This meant, simply by being the biggest financial institution, it could influence interest rates that other banks charged to businesses and consumers by altering its interest rate for the banks' bank accounts. It also acted as a lender through the 19th century in emergencies to finance banks facing collapse., discussing Overend, Gurney and Co Because of its power, many believed the Bank of England should have more public duties and supervision. The Bank of England Act 1946 nationalised it. Its current constitution, and guarantees of a degree of operational independence from government, is found in the Bank of England Act 1998. Under section 1, the bank's executive body, the court of directors is \\"appointed by Her Majesty\\", which in effect is the prime minister. This includes the Governor of the Bank of England (currently Mark Carney) and up to 14 directors in total (currently there are twelve, nine men and three women). The governor may serve for a maximum of eight years, deputy governors for a maximum of ten years,Bank of England Act 1998 Sch 1, paras 1-2 but they may be removed only if they acquire a political position, begin to work for the bank, are absent for over three months, become bankrupt, or \\"is unable or unfit to discharge his functions as a member\\".Bank of England Act 1998 Sch 1, paras 7-8 This makes removal hard, and potentially judicially reviewable. A sub-committee of directors sets pay for all directors,Bank of England Act 1998 Sch 1, paras 14 rather than a non- conflicted body like Parliament. The Bank's most important function is administering monetary policy. Under the Bank of England Act 1998 section 11 its objectives are to (a) \\"maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty‚Äôs Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.\\" Under section 12, HM Treasury issues its interpretation of \\"price stability\\" and \\"economic policy\\" each year, together with an inflation target. To change inflation, the Bank of England has three main policy options. First, it performs \\"open market operations\\", buying and selling banks' bonds at differing rates (i.e. loaning money to banks at higher or lower interest, known \\"discounting\\"), buying back government bonds (\\"repos\\") or selling them, and giving credit to banks at differing rates. This will affect the interest rate banks charge by influencing the quantity of money in the economy (more spending by the central bank means more money, and so lower interest) but also may not. Second, the Bank of England may direct banks to keep different higher or lower reserves proportionate to their lending. Third, the Bank of England could direct private banks adopt specific deposit-taking or lending policies, in specified volumes or interest rates. The Treasury is, however, only meant to give orders to the Bank of England in \\"extreme economic circumstances\\".Bank of England Act 1998 s 19 This should ensure that changes to monetary policy are undertaken neutrally, and artificial booms are not manufactured before an election. The largest UK banks are HSBC, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. Outside the central bank, banks are mostly run as profit-making corporations, without meaningful representation for customers. This means, the standard rules in the Companies Act 2006 apply. Directors are usually appointed by existing directors in the nomination committee,Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008, Sch 3, para 20UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 section B unless the members of a company (invariably shareholders) remove them by majority vote.Companies Act 2006 ss 168-9 Bank directors largely set their own pay, delegating the task to a remuneration committee of the board.Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008, Sch 3, para 23 and UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 section D Most shareholders are asset managers, exercising votes with other people's money that comes through pensions, life insurance or mutual funds, who are meant to engage with boards,UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, section E but have few explicit channels to represent the ultimate investors. Asset managers rarely sue for breach of directors' duties (for negligence or conflicts of interest), through derivative claims.Companies Act 2006 ss 170-77, 260-263 However, there is some public oversight through the bank licensing system. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 section 19 there is a \\"general prohibition\\" on performing a \\"regulated activity\\", including accepting deposits from the public, without authority.Credit Institutions Directive 2013/36/EU arts 8-14 The two main UK regulators are the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Once a bank has received authorisation in the UK, or another member state, it may operate throughout the EU under the terms of the host state's rules: it has a \\"passport\\" giving it freedom of establishment in the internal market. Since the Credit Institutions Directive 2013,Credit Institutions Directive 2013/36/EU arts 88-96 there are some added governance requirements beyond the general framework: for example, duties of directors must be clearly defined, and there should be a policy on board diversity to ensure gender and ethnic balance. If the UK had employee representation on boards, there would also be a requirement for at least one employee to sit on the remuneration committee,Credit Institutions Directive 2013 (2013/36/EU art 95, \\"If employee representation... is provided for by national law, the remuneration committee shall include one or more employee representatives.\\" but this step has not yet been taken. had been forced to nationalise Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, the Royal Bank of Scotland and part of HBOS-Lloyds TSB. The Banking Act 2009 contains a mechanism to prevent a systemic crisis occurring from banker insolvency. While banks perform an essential economic function, supported by public institutions, the rights of bank customers have generally been limited to contract. In general terms and conditions, customers receive very limited protection. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 140A to 140D prohibit unfair credit relationships, including extortionate interest rates. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 sections 62 to 65 prohibit terms that create contrary to good faith, create a significant imbalance, but the courts have not yet used these rules in a meaningful way for consumers.Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc [2009] UKSC 6Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2001] UKHL 52 Most importantly, since Foley v Hill the courts have held customers who deposit money in a bank account lose any rights of property by default: they apparently have only contractual claims in debt for the money to be repaid.Foley v Hill (1848) 2 HLC 28 If customers did have property rights in their deposits, they would be able to claim their money back upon a bank's insolvency, trace the money if it had been wrongly paid away, and (subject to agreement) claim profits made on the money. However, the courts have denied that bank customers have property rights. The same position has generally spread in banking practice globally, and Parliament has not yet taken the opportunity to ensure banks offer accounts where customer money is protected as property. Because insolvent banks do not, governments have found it necessary to publicly guarantee depositors' savings. This follows the model, started in the Great Depression,Banking Act of 1933 the US set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to prevent bank runs. In 2017, the UK guaranteed deposits up to ¬£85,000,Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ss 214-215 mirroring an EU-wide minimum guarantee of ‚Ç¨100,000.Deposit Guarantee Directive 2014/49/EU Moreover, because of the knock-on consequences of any bank failure, because bank debts are locked into a network of international finance, government has found it practically necessary to prevent banks going insolvent. Under the Banking Act 2009 if a bank is going into insolvency, the government may (and usually will if \\"the stability of the financial systems\\" is at stake) pursue one of three \\"stabilisation options\\".Banking Act 2009 ss 1, 7-13 The Bank of England will either try to ensure the failed bank is sold onto another private sector purchaser, set up a subsidiary company to run the failing bank's assets (a \\"bridge-bank\\"), or for the UK Treasury to directly take shares in \\"temporary public ownership\\". This will wipe out the shareholders, but will keep creditors' claims intact. One method to prevent bank insolvencies, following the \\"Basel III\\" programme of the international banker group, has been to require banks hold more money in reserve based on how risky their lending is. EU-wide rules in the Capital Requirements Regulation 2013 achieve this in some detail, for instance requiring proportionally less in reserves if sound government debt is held, but more if mortgage-backed securities are held.(EU) No 575/2013, arts 114-134 =Natural resources= Natural resources have historically been critical for energy and raw materials in the UK economy. Before the industrial revolution, energy and heating needs were served mainly by burning timber. The development of the steam engine, particularly after James Watt's patents in 1775, and rail transport led coal to be the UK's dominant energy source, now governed under the Coal Industry Act 1994. The development of the internal combustion engine in the late 19th century, led to a gradual displacement of coal by oil and gas. In the 21st century, because of critical threat of climate damage caused by human beings burning coal, oil and gas (or any fossil fuel releasing carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases), the UK is trying to shift to energy based on zero-carbon: wind, hydro or solar based power. In 2015, the UK's energy consumption was 47% petroleum, 29% natural gas, 18% electricity and 5% other, but the growth of renewable electricity, and the introduction of electric vehicles is increasingly rapid. Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK government is bound to ensure there is a 100% reduction of carbon emissions compared to 1990 levels, when the Kyoto Protocol was drafted. A difficulty is that the Kyoto Protocol measures countries' production, rather than final consumption, and fails to account for the UK's consuming greenhouse gas intensive products that are imported from countries with lower standards (e.g. China, Russia, or the US), unless there is a border carbon tax.The European Green Deal COM(2019) 640 final, 5 \\"a carbon border adjustment mechanism\\". The elimination of carbon emissions is meant to prevent the damage from extreme weather, flooding and coastlines going under the sea. The scientific community takes the view that, while the oil, gas or coal industry still provides energy, it must be phased out. An anti-fracking protest at a limestone oil well in Balcombe. Although both coal and oil production were publicly owned in the past, coal, oil and gas extraction is performed today by private corporations under government licence. The largest entities include BP, Shell, but also now joined by entirely foreign firms such as Apache, Talisman, CNR, TAQA or Cuadrilla. This means that ordinary UK company law (or US corporate law) sets the governance rights of oil and gas corporations, with board of directors invariably removable only by shareholders (typically large asset managers). Under the Petroleum Act 1998 section 2, rights of land ownership do not equate to rights to oil and gas (or hydrocarbons) underneath. In Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd, the Supreme Court did hold that a landowner may sue a company for trespass if it drills under its land without permission, but a majority held that damages will be nominal. This meant that a landowner in Surrey was only able to recover ¬£1,000 when a licensed oil company drilled a diagonal well 800 to 2,800 feet under its property, and not the ¬£621,180 awarded by the High Court to reflect a share of the oil profits. Similarly, under the Continental Shelf Act 1964 section 1 rights \\"outside territorial waters with respect to the sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources\\" are \\"vested in Her Majesty.\\" Since 1919, the Crown has prohibited searching and boring for oil and gas without a licence.Petroleum Act 1998 s 3 Under the Energy Act 2016, licensing is managed by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). Under section 8, the OGA should hand out licences so as to minimise future public expense, secure the energy supply, ensure storage of carbon dioxide, fully collaborate with the UK government, encourage innovation, and encourage stable regulation to promote investment. Overshadowing this is the duty in Petroleum Act 1998 sections 9A-I on the Secretary of State for ‚Äòmaximising the economic recovery of UK petroleum‚Äô. This contrasts with the goal of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions in section 1 of the Climate Change Act 2008. The Secretary of State may give directions to the OGA in the interests of national security, or the public in exceptional circumstances,Energy Act 2016 s 9 while the OGA is nominally capable of funding itself through fees on license applicants and holders.Energy Act 2016 ss 12-13 In the process of licensing, the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations 1995 require objective, transparent and competitive criteria to be applied by the Oil and Gas Authority. Under regulation 3, the OGA should consider an applicant's technical and financial capability, price, previous conduct, and refuse all applications if none are satisfactory, while regulation 5 requires that all criteria to be applied are stated in the public notice for tenders. Under section 4 of the Petroleum Act 1998, model licence clauses are prescribed by the Secretary of State, for instance in the Petroleum Licensing (Production) (Seaward Areas) Regulations 2008. Schedule 1's model clauses give the OGA discretion over the licence term, the licensee's obligation to submit its work programme, revocation on breach of a licence, arbitration for disputes, or health and environmental safety. For onshore oil and gas extraction, and particularly hydraulic fracturing (or \\"fracking\\"), there are further requirements that must be fulfilled. For fracking, these include negotiating with landowners where a drill site is situated, getting the local mineral planning authority's approval for exploratory wells, consent from the council under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 section 57, getting permission for disposing of hazardous waste and inordinate water use,Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010Water Resources Act 1991 and finally consent from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In R (Frack Free Balcombe Residents Association) v West Sussex CC a residents association in Balcombe lost an action for judicial review of their council's planning permission for Cuadrilla Resources to explore the potential to frack for shale gas. Large protests had opposed any steps toward fracking. However, Gilbart J held that the council had not been wrong in refusing to consider public opposition, and took the view would have acted unlawfully if it had considered the opposition. \\"In my judgment that very clear statement of principle is one which must apply in this case. While I have no doubt that County Councillor Mullins meant well, the reality of her objection was that she asked WSCC to refuse to permit that which it would otherwise have permitted, on a basis that its granting permission would excite opposition leading to protests designed and intended to disrupt a perfectly lawful activity. In my judgment, had it taken County Councillor Mullins' original argument into account, WSCC would have had regard to an immaterial consideration and would have acted unlawfully.\\" The Brent Spar oil storage buoy is one of 470 platforms and 5000 wells that must be decommissioned, to avoid environmental damage, as resource companies promised in their licences. Companies have lobbied for tax cuts, meaning that taxpayers bear the costs. The interests of third parties and the public are partially represented through provisions on access to infrastructure, tax, and decommissioning. Under the Petroleum Act 1998 sections 17-17H there is a right of companies that are not owners of pipelines or gas interconnectors to use the infrastructure if there is spare capacity. This is not well utilised, and it usually left to commercial negotiation. Under the Energy Act 2011 sections 82-83 the Secretary of State can require a pipeline owner gives access on its own motion, apparently to reduce the problem of companies being too timid to exercise legal rights for fear of commercial repercussions. Taxation on oil and gas outputs have increasingly been reduced. Initially, the Oil Taxation Act 1975 section 1 required a special Petroleum Revenue Tax, set as high as 75% of profits in 1983, but this ended for new licences after 1993, and then reduced from 50% in 2010, down to 0% in 2016.Finance Act 2016 s 140(1) Under the Corporation Tax Act 2010 sections 272-279A there is still a \\"ring-fenced corporation tax\\", on individual fields that are ring-fenced from other activities, set at 30%, but just 19% for smaller fields. An additional \\"supplementary charge\\" of 10% of profits was introduced in 2002 to ensure a ‚Äòfair return‚Äô to the state, because ‚Äòoil companies [were] generating excess profits‚Äô.Corporation Tax Act 2010 s 330 Finally, under the Petroleum Act 1998 sections 29-45 require responsible decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure. Under section 29, the Secretary of State can require a written notice of a decommissioning plan, on which stakeholders (e.g. the local community) must be consulted. Under section 30, notice regarding abandonment can be served on anyone who owns or has an interest in an installation. There are fines and offences for failure to comply. Estimates for the cost of decommissioning the UK's offshore platforms have been ¬£16.9bn in the next decade, and ¬£75bn to ¬£100bn in total. A series of objections have been raised against the government's policy of cutting taxes while subsidising BP, Shell and Exxon for these costs. =Energy= The need to stop climate damage, and create sustainable energy, has driven UK energy policy. The Climate Change Act 2008 section 1 requires an 80% reduction on 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but this can always be made more stringent in line with science or international law.Climate Change Act 2008 ss 1-2. This is reflected in the Renewable Energy Directive 2009 art 3 and Annex I Eliminating carbon emissions and fossil fuels means using only electricity (no more petrol or gas) and only using zero carbon inputs. In 2015, total UK energy use was composed of 18% electricity, 29% natural gas, and 49% petroleum. Electricity itself, by 2015, was generated 24% from \\"renewable\\" sources, 30% gas, 22% coal, and 21% nuclear. \\"Renewable\\" sources were 48% wind, 9% solar (doubling each year to 2016), and 7.5% hydroelectric. But 35% of \\"renewable\\" electricity was \\"bioenergy\\", that is mostly timber, emitting more carbon than coal as it is burnt by converted coal stations. Under the Energy Act 2013 section 1, the Secretary of State can set legally binding decarbonisation targets in electricity,Energy Act 2013 ss 1-4, stating targets must begin with a carbon budget including the year 2030. but the government has not done this yet. Under section 131, the Secretary of State should, however, give Parliament an annual \\"Strategy and Policy Statement\\" on its strategic energy priorities, and how they will be achieved.Energy Act 2013 ss 131-138 The Westmill Solar Co- operative was established by residents in Oxfordshire to generate community solar power. Solar panel prices have decreased exponentially. Every home or business can access the feed-in tariff. In 2017, fourteen 280Watt solar panels, and a 10kW battery (enough to power a home, and have zero electricity bills indefinitely) cost around ¬£7500. Two main strategies have pushed a transition to renewable power. First, under the Electricity Act 1989 sections 32-32M, the Secretary of State was able to place renewables obligations on energy generating companies. Large electricity generating companies (i.e. the big six, British Gas, EDF, E.ON, nPower, Scottish Power and SSE) had to buy fixed percentages of \\"Renewable Obligation Certificates\\" from renewable generators if they did not meet set quotas in their own electricity generators. This encouraged significant investment in wind and solar farms, although the Energy Act 2013 enabled the scheme to be closed to new installations over 5 MW capacity in 2015 and all in 2017.Renewables Obligation Closure Order 2014 and Renewables Obligation Closure (Amendment) Order 2015 art 2, made under Electricity Act 1989 ss 32K-L In Solar Century Holdings Ltd v SS for Energy and Climate Change a group of solar companies challenged the closure decision by judicial review. Solar Century Ltd claimed they had a legitimate expectation from the government in its previous policy documents for \\"maintaining support levels\\".[2016] EWCA Civ 117 The Court of Appeal rejected the claim, because no unconditional promise was given. As a replacement, under the Energy Act 2013 sections 6-26 created a \\"contracts for difference\\" system to subsidise energy companies' investment in renewables. The government owned \\"Low Carbon Contracts Co.\\" pays licensed energy generators money under contracts lasting, for example, 15 years, reflecting the difference between a predicted future price of electricity (a \\"reference price\\") and a predicted future price of electricity with more renewable investment (a \\"strike price\\"). The LCCC gets its money from a levy on the energy companies, which pass costs onto consumers. This system was apparently seen by the government as preferable to direct investment by taxing polluters' profits.Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low‚Äëcarbon electricity (2011) Cm 8099, 148-150 The second strategy to boost renewables was the Energy Act 2008's \\"feed-in tariff\\".Employment Act 2008 ss 41-43 on the feed-in tariffs. Electricity produced with renewables has to be paid a certain price by electricity companies: a \\"generation\\" rate (even if the producer uses the energy itself) and an \\"export\\" rate (when the producer sells to the grid). In PreussenElektra AG v Schleswag AG a large energy company (now part of E.ON) challenged a similar scheme in Germany. It argued that the feed-in tariff operated like a tax to subsidise renewable energy companies, since non-renewable energy companies passed the costs on, and so should be considered an unlawful state aid, contrary to TFEU article 107.(2001) C-379/98 The Court of Justice rejected the argument, holding that the redistributive effects were inherent in the scheme, as indeed they are in any change to private law.Opinion of AG Jacobs: \\"If the argument of the Commission and PreussenElektra were to be accepted then all sums which one person owes another by virtue of a given law would have to be considered to be State resources. That seems an impossibly wide understanding of the notion.\\" Since then, feed-in tariffs have been considerably successful at promoting small scale electricity production by homes and business, and solar and wind in general. The Gwynt y M√¥r wind farm, is owned 50% by RWE, 30% Stadtwerke M√ºnchen, 10% Siemens, and 10% UK Green Investment Bank. It has 576 MW capacity. The ownership and governance voice of stakeholders in UK energy companies has been mostly monopolised by private shareholders since the Electricity Act 1989 started the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board. However, in 2015 Robin Hood Energy run by Nottingham City Council, and Bristol Energy run by Bristol City Council became the first new municipally owned energy companies, selling below profit-making company prices and committing to renewable sources. This follows widespread publicly owned energy models around Europe, which the Court of Justice of the European Union held could not be challenged. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 345 states the EU treaties \\"shall in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership.\\" Nevertheless, in Netherlands v Essent NV a private Dutch energy company, Essent NV, argued that a Dutch law requiring public ownership of all shares in electricity distribution companies violated free movement of capital in TFEU article 63, as in other cases restrictions on golden shares had been struck down. But the CJEU held nothing precluded either nationalisation or privatisation. It is up to member states alone, and the Dutch government had shown \\"overriding reasons in the public interest\\" for public ownership. Given the international evidence that publicly owned energy companies are cheaper,M. Florio, ‚ÄòThe Return of Public Enterprise‚Äô (2014) Working Paper N. 01/2014 there has been an increase Europe-wide of \\"remunicipalisation\\" of services. Many local councils also require both employee and citizen representation in their energy companies. For example, the \\"Communal Ordinance of North Rhine- Westphalia\\" (which includes cities like Dortmund) ¬ß¬ß107-114 gives councils capacity to create energy companies. If they do, one third of board members will ordinarily be employee representatives, and the constitution must be written to include council representatives, although there are not yet provisions requiring direct voting rights for residents. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, or Ofgem, carries out licensing for electricity generation. Its chair and at least two other board members must be appointed by the Secretary of State for 5 to 7 years, and while ostensibly \\"independent\\",Utilities Act 2000 Sch 1, para 2A they must follow directions of the Minister.Utilities Act 2000 ss 1, 5 and Sch 1, paras 1-3 Under the Electricity Act 1989 nobody can generate and supply electricity to others without a licence.Electricity Act 1989 s 4 Ofgem follows a Standard Electricity Supply Licence, which can be modified by the Secretary of State if circumstances change,Utilities Act 2000 s 68 for instance, to alter price controls.R (Scottish Power) v Director General of Electricity Supply [1997] CLY 4949, quashing a decision of the DG that refused to modify licence conditions. There are exemptions from getting a licence, for instance, for small generators under 10 MW (or up to 50 MW if net capacity is under 100 MW), or certain offshore generators.Electricity Act 1989 s 5 and Electricity (Class Exemptions from the Requirement for a Licence) Order 2001 Planning permission for non-exempt generators also require Secretary of State consent, and the granting of planning could be challenged.Finn-Kelcey v Milton Keynes BC [2008] EWCA Civ 1067, on the three month period to make a challenge. In Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers Donald Trump, who had recently started his US Presidential campaign argued that the offshore Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm could not be built near his golf course.[2015] UKSC 74 He argued the Secretary of State could only give permission to existing licensees or exempt generators, ostensibly, by necessary implication from another provision on natural beauty. The Supreme Court unanimously held that Trump lost: there was to be no implied term. In R (Gerber) v Wiltshire Council, Mr Gerber attempted to challenge the construction of a 22 hectare solar farm near his grade II listed home Gifford Hall, because he thought it would have a \\"detrimental impact\\" on the \\"setting\\".[2016] EWCA Civ 84 He had not noticed anything happening until some time after construction began, and then tried to argue that Wiltshire Council's \\"Statement of Community Involvement\\" required that he would have been notified about the plans he missed. The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected that any \\"legitimate expectation\\" in judicial review had been broken. Electricity generated (TWh) from renewable sources in the United Kingdom between 2009 and 2018. Unless citizens set up their own generation, or own energy companies through their council, they are guaranteed few other rights by law: the idea has been that Ofgem \\"protect the interests of consumers\\" by \\"promoting effective competition\\" is meant to automatically improve service.Utilities Act 2000 ss 9 and 13 revising Electricity Act 1989 s 3A and Gas Act 1986 s 4AA In practice, further duties have been seen as necessary. The Electricity Act 1989 section 44 Ofgem can direct the maximum prices at which electricity may be sold.EA 1989 s 44, Ofgem can ‚Äòdirect that the maximum prices at which electricity supplied by authorised suppliers may be resold‚Äô. Originally, the idea was that the regulator would \\"wither away\\" as effective market competition replaced any need for a state, but in a transition period prices would be capped through a formula known as \\"RPI - X\\". This was supposed to mean that energy companies could only raise their prices by the increase in the retail price index (RPI), minus a percentage calculated by Ofgem to reflect how much in efficiency savings (X) could be made, but also potentially allowing higher prices for investment.J Meek, ‚ÄòHow we happened to sell off our electricity‚Äô (2012) 34(17) London Review of Books 3 Further minimal consumer rights are inserted into the Standard Electricity Supply Licences given to electricity companies. For example, under condition 27, a consumer cannot be disconnected unless all reasonable steps have been taken to let them pay bills (including a pay as you go meter), and pensioners may not be disconnected at all in the winter. This has not, however, come close to eliminating the extra deaths from cold weather (estimated to be around 9000 people in 2016) from fuel poverty. Analogous regulatory regimes for electricity apply to gas,Gas Act 1986 ss 3, 4AA, 34 (regulatory objectives) and 5-11, 19 and 23-23G (gas licensing, consuemers, modification of conditions and appeal) and to nuclear power.Nuclear Installations Act 1965 ss 1, 65-87 (nuclear licensing) In practice there has been no possibility to abolish government involvement, and in law there has been consistent recognition that whether owned by private shareholders or not, energy remains a public service that is the responsibility of the state.Foster v British Gas plc (1990) C-188/89, [1991] 2 AC 306 (on nature of a public service) When energy companies go into insolvency, often indebted to the government (but not always), they can be put into administrative receivership allowing that creditor greater control over the insolvency process.Insolvency Act 1986 ss 72C-D and Sch 2A, para 10 Under the Standard Electricity Supply Licence, condition 8, Ofgem can impose a duty on energy companies to be a supplier of last resort. These rules were updated slightly in 2011 so that the government can give financial support and keep a company trading until refinancing or a new owner is found.Energy Act 2011 ss 94-102 =Water= Water is a universal human right,UDHR 1948 art 25(1) and ICESCR 1966 art 11(1), which is ratified by the UK, both expressly protect the right to food, in which water is implicit. This was acknowledged by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2002) General Comment No 15. and basic to survival. While the UK has the fortune of substantial rainfall, climate damage means water resources are under pressure, and less predictable than before.S Hendry, Frameworks for Water Law Reform (2014) ch 5, 86 and C Harlow and R Rawlings, Law and Administration (3rd edn 2009) ch 7, 292-304 Historically, water for drinking, general use, or sewerage was largely left to private arrangements.J Getzler, A History of Water Rights at Common Law (2004) 328-352 The recurrence of water poisoning, and large public health crises were a part of people's ordinary existence until scientific advances of the 19th century. After the Broad Street cholera outbreak of 1854, John Snow first identified the cause of cholera as drinking water being polluted by excrement. Following the Great Stink of 1858, where the River Thames had become so bad smelling that it offended the Queen and forced Parliament to relocate, Joseph Bazalgette began to build the London sewerage system. Starting with the Public Health Act 1848 and its creation of a local board of health in each council, and the Public Health Act 1866, local government built drains, sewers, and began piping clean water to households. The Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 and 1863 provided model constitutions for the dozens of spreading private and local government water companies. The Public Health Act 1875 required all new houses to have running water and internal drainage. By 1944, there were over 1000 water suppliers in England and Wales, though 26 supplied half, and 97 a further quarter of total volume.E Porter, Water Management in England and Wales (1978) 29 The Water Act 1945 organised a national water supply policy, before the Water Act 1973 finally organised ten regional water authorities for England and Wales, and additional authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland.e.g. Water (Scotland) Act 1980 (c 45) However, following other privatisations, the Water Act 1989 changed the ten authorities into ten private water companies, each with a local monopoly, subject to price caps of a new regulator known as Ofwat.Water Act 1989 ss 4, 83-85 were the initial privatisation provisions. See C Harlow and R Rawlings, Law and Administration (3rd edn 2009) ch 7, 293-295. Scottish Water, after a public campaign remained publicly owned, and as a result has maintained significantly lower prices than in England and Wales.e.g. 'Water costs cheaper in Scotland' (19 February 2009) BBC Only around 10 per cent of water companies around the world are privatised,S Hendry, Frameworks for Water Law Reform (2014) ch 5, 78, quoting P Marin, Public private partnerships for urban water utilities: A review of experiences in developing countries (2009) finding 7% of companies were privatised, and suggesting even if this is too low, 15% would be a \\"generous estimate\\". tending to be less efficient and more expensive.D Hall, E Lobina and P Terhorst, 'Re-municipalisation in the early twenty-first century: water in France and energy in Germany' (2013) 27(2) International Review of Applied Economics 193 and J Meek, ‚ÄòNot a drop to drink‚Äô in Private Island: Why Britain Belongs to Someone Else (2014) ch 3 Loch Faskally is one of many reservoirs used by publicly owned Scottish Water. Its prices are around 20% lower than privatised English and Welsh water companies.See 'Water costs cheaper in Scotland' (19 February 2009) BBC. D Hall, E Lobina and P Terhorst, 'Re- municipalisation in the early twenty-first century: water in France and energy in Germany' (2013) 27(2) International Review of Applied Economics 193 and J Meek, ‚ÄòNot a drop to drink‚Äô in Private Island: Why Britain Belongs to Someone Else (2014) ch 3 The publicly owned Scottish Water is appointed by Scottish Ministers,Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002, constitutes Scottish Water. Sch 3 requires an 8-13 member board appointed by the Scottish Ministers as experts. The Water (Scotland) Act 1980, contains duties and functions. The Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 deals with sewage. and overseen by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland,Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 s 1 although it has no direct voting power for customers.There is, however, a \\"Customer Forum\\" without any binding rights, but which may have some useful input: see S Hendry, Frameworks for Water Law Reform (2014) ch 5, 95, fn 282 By contrast, in England and Wales, each company board is typically accountable to shareholders, mostly asset managers, under the Companies Act 2006. While both UK and EU law is clear that water companies, even if privatised, still are public bodies,See Griffin v South West Water Services [1995] IRLR 15 and Fish Legal v Information Commissioner, United Utilities, Yorkshire Water and Southern Water (2014) C-279/12 these companies pursue shareholder profit, only restricted by regulation. Ofwat (technically called the Water Services Regulation Authority) has at least three members appointed the Secretary of State,Water Industry Act 1991 s 1A and Sch 1A, para 1. This was amended by the Water Act 2003 and is meant to \\"protect the interests of consumers, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition\\" and yet ensure companies have a \\"reasonable returns on their capital\\",Water Industry Act 1991 s 2 rather than simply act in the public interest.cf Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 s 1, requiring \\"promoting the interests of customers\\". Ofwat licences companies (known as water \\"undertakers\\") to operate water and sewer services with \\"instruments of appointment\\", and can impose various conditions.WIA 1991 s 11. The Water Act 2003 s 52 gives Ofwat a duty to cooperate with the Secretary of State, the National Assembly for Wales, the Environment Agency, and the Natural Resources Body for Wales. Licences usually last 25 years but can be terminated on 10 years notice by government. Because of public outcry over rising prices,e.g. R Graham, 'Water in the UK - public versus private' (19 December 2014) openDemocracy the government tried to construct more competition, with the Water Act 2014 requiring suppliers can access or pump water through other providers' pipes, for a reasonable cost, so that consumers might choose their company.WIA 1991 ss 66A-L. Slightly different, WIA 1991 ss 105A-C enables transfer of lateral drains and private sewers to water companies where they were draining to a public mains sewer and treatment works, to avoid deterioration. Water Industry (Schemes for Adoption of Private Sewers) Regulations SI 2011/1566. In Scotland, it was thought this kind of competition could pose a public health risk.S Hendry, Frameworks for Water Law Reform (2014) ch 5, 81 Under EU water law drinking water, bathing waters, and the general environment, like at the River Wandle, must be kept clean and improved. As real competition in natural monopolies always appeared unlikely, Ofwat has always set upper limits to prices, historically for 5 year periods.WIA 1991 ss 11-12, price determinations and conditions set in Instruments of Appointment, Condition B, each 5 years. This has followed the formula of RPI - X + K, where prices should rise no more than the retail price index of inflation, reduced by efficiency savings (X), but allowing for capital investment (K). This means prices could be fixed down or go up. Companies must publicise an annual charging scheme approved by Ofwat,WIA 1991 ss 142-150 while Ofwat must openly report its work programme, report to the Secretary of State, keep a register of appointments and make information on costs available.WIA 1991 ss 192A-B, 201-202 Companies can appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority for disputes over access and price caps, while Ofwat can refer companies to the CMA for breaches of conditions.Ofwat and the CMA also have jurisdiction for mergers for companies with a size over ¬£10m p/a: WIA 1991 ss 31-35. After unacceptable experience of people being disconnected by private companies for non-payment,See R (Oldham MBC) v Director General of Water Services (1998) 31 HLR 224 finding automatic disconnection from water through a prepayment meter did not comply with the law. R (Lancashire CC) v Director of Water Services [1999] EnvLR 114, stopped disconnections or limiting devices. The Water Industry Act 1999 stopped arbitrary disconnections. new regulations introduced exemptions for vulnerable customers, particularly people who are unable to pay, have large families or have medical conditions.ater Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) Regulations SI 1999/3441 and Floods and Water Act 2010 s 44. This does not mean that company profits' are reduced by vulnerable customers, as companies can raise prices for other customers to ensure their profits are not reduced. Everyone has the right to be connect to a water supply and to sewers, but the cost of new connections is borne by the customer.WIA 1991 ss 37, 45 (water) and 94-99 (sewers). UK water quality is generally high, since large new investments were made following the EU Drinking Water Quality Directive 1998, requiring water is \\"wholesome and clean\\".Drinking Water Quality Directive 98/83/EC art 4, meaning water is free from any micro-organisms and parasites dangerous to health, and complies with chemical and biological standards listed in Annex I. This is implemented by the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 SI 1989/1147. In McColl v Strathclyde RC 1983 SC 225 water fluoridation was successfully challenged. Ofwat is required to issue enforcement orders under the Water Industry Act 1991 section 18 to uphold drinking quality standards, rather than being content with \\"undertakings\\" from water companies.Commission v United Kingdom (1992) C-337/89, on the failure to transpose the Directive. The UK system under WIA 1991 s 19 of accepting undertakings from water companies (instead of s 18 enforcement orders) was not an adequate legal framework to comply with EU law. Contrast Commission v Spain (2003) C-278/01 on bathing water quality, where the CJEU confirmed fines of a ‚Ç¨624,150 per year and per 1% of bathing areas in Spanish inshore waters which were found not to conform to the Bathing Waters Directive 2006/7/EC. The Drinking Water Inspectorate has powers of investigation.WIA 1991 s 86 There are further standards for water companies to keep up water pressure in pipes, respond quickly to letters, phone calls and keep appointments, restore supply and provide water in emergencies, and stop sewer flooding or compensate up to ¬£1000.Water Supply and Sewerage Services (Customer Service Standards) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/594) regs 6-12 Finally, the Consumer Council for Water is meant to hear complaints and publicise issues with Ofwat and water companies, but its members are not elected by water customers and it has no legal power to bind Ofwat or the companies.cf WIA 1991 ss 27A-27K An 1828 cartoon of a woman dropping her teacup when she sees Thames Water magnified.By William Heath at the time of the Commission on the London Water Supply report, 1828 After the Great Stink of 1858, the London sewerage system was built under Joseph Bazalgette. Water companies have a chequered history of responsibility for damage they cause, but also the law has failed to ensure businesses are fully responsible for water pollution. In principle, a water authority used to be strictly liable for damage it caused.Department of Transport v North West Water Authority [1984] AC 336 However, more recently water company liability particularly for sewerage leaks has not appeared to as a sufficient deterrent. In R v Anglian Water Services Ltd the Court of Appeal held that fines for pollution should always be set to ensure sufficient deterrence, but on the facts reduced a fine from ¬£200,000 to ¬£60,000.[2003] EWCA Crim 2243 In Marcic v Thames Water plc the House of Lords held that Thames Water plc was not liable in nuisance, or for breach of a homeowner's right to property, as sewerage repeatedly overflowed residents' gardens.[2003] UKHL 66 According to Lord Hoffmann, the owners had to use statutory mechanisms to secure accountability rather than suing in tort. More recently in Manchester Ship Canal Co Ltd v United Utilities Water Plc the Supreme Court held that United Utilities was responsible for trespass and pollution of canalways, but only before 1991 when statutory reform provided immunity.[2014] UKSC 40 By contrast, in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc, the House of Lords held that a tanner business was not liable for polluting the Cambridge Water supply with toxic chemicals, because it said the loss was not \\"reasonably foreseeable\\" and therefore too remote.[1994] 2 AC 264 These cases sit uneasily with the principle that polluters should pay, and the scheme of the Water Framework Directive 2000 to ensure proper enforcement of clean water standards.Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC recital 53, and see E Fisher, B Lange and E Scotford, Environmental Law Text, Cases, and Materials (2013) ch 14 =Transport= As the home of the industrial revolution, and a densely populated country, the UK's transport networks are among the world's oldest and most used. Roman roads in Britain are still major thoroughfares. From medieval times, highways were maintained through turnpike trusts, a system of parish and toll funded roads.S Webb and B Webb, English Local Government Vol 5, The story of the king‚Äôs highway (1913) While the British Empire developed as a maritime power abroad, canals were built in the early industrial revolution to transport large volumes of goods. With steam engine technology, railway construction spread, and then boomed from 1840. Private investors built railways with huge subsidies from Parliament, granting planning and compulsory purchase rights, and were only haphazardly held responsible in tort law for worker deaths, and damage to the environment. Under the Transport Act 1947, the government nationalised British Rail. Yet in the post-war period, more people were encouraged to buy cars, and more goods transportation shifted into trucking. Commercial aviation also developed rapidly. British Rail was privatised once more after the Railways Act 1993 was put into effect in 1996, as again more people switched away from over-crowded roads to trains. The need to eliminate fossil fuels in accordance with the Climate Change Act 2008 means more trains have been electrified, and electric motor vehicles are slowly being introduced. While train fares have increased beyond inflation since privatisation,T de Castella, 'Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?' (22 January 2013) BBC London Underground fares under public control have not increased under Labour mayors, but increased under a Conservative mayor.See R Holdsworth, 'London Transport Fares 2000-2016' (2016) Londonist, showing a 56% increase in zone 1 to 4 tube fares (with Oyster cards from 2004) under Boris Johnson, while fares were held constant under Ken Livingstone and Sadiq Khan. Since 2015, the Office of Rail and Road has been a combined regulator for railways and highways.Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 ss 15-16. This renamed \\"Ofrail\\" which had existed since 2003, that in turn replaced the Rail Regulator. The chair and four other members is appointed by the Secretary of State for up to five year terms, and can be dismissed for a good reason.Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 Sch 1, para 2, dismissal possible for absence from meetings for 3 months, financial or personal interest, ‚Äòhas misbehaved‚Äô or ‚Äòis unable, unfit or unwilling to perform his functions as a member.‚Äô Although it exercises no direct control, under the Railways Act 1993 section 4 the ORR has a long list of duties, including to improve railway service performance in the interest of passengers, promote usage, \\"competition\\", interconnection, safety, but also to enable railways companies \\"to plan the future of their businesses with a reasonable degree of assurance.\\"Railways Act 1993 s 4 The Single European Railway Directive 2012 requires that infrastructure managers and \\"railway undertakings\\" are structurally separate, so that railway companies (whether public or privately owned) have less of an incentive to exclude other operators.Single European Railway Directive 2012/34/EU arts 4 and 7. This followed the First Railway Directive 91/440/EC. Each must have separate accounts and member states are obliged to run railways \\"at the lowest possible cost for the quality of service required\\",Single European Railway Directive 2012/34/EU art 5-6 although in practice this enables huge variety and ownership structures around different countries. In the UK, infrastructure is managed by Network Rail. It was originally privatised and called Railtrack, and was meant to run as a regulated monopoly, in private hands, and be in charge of railway tracks, signalling, tunnels, bridges, level crossings. However, after the Hatfield train crash in 2000 which killed 4 people and injured 70, and the Potters Bar crash in 2001 which killed 7 and injured 76, it was forced into insolvent administration and the government took rail infrastructure back into public ownership. In Weir v Secretary of State for Transport a group of 48,000 shareholders challenged the Minister's decision to force an insolvency procedure, arguing their property was being illegally taken and the Minister was guilty of \\"misfeasance\\" in public office, but these were completely rejected.[2005] EWHC 2192 (Ch) per Lindsay J. Network Rail, from 2003, became a not-for-profit company, re-investing in safety, and is accountable to the Office of Rail and Road.L Whitehouse, ‚ÄòRailtrack is dead ‚Äì long live Network Rail?‚Äô Nationalisation under the Third Way‚Äô (2003) 30 JLS 217. The Future of Rail: White Paper (July 2004) Cm 6233. cf R Jupe, ‚ÄòPublic (interest) or private (gain)? The curious case of Network Rail‚Äôs status‚Äô (2007) 34 JLS 24, 252, noting that the former Prime Minister Tony Blair disparaged, ‚Äòthe sterile debate between wholesale privatisation and old-style state control.‚Äô See further TUC, Rebuilding Rail (2012) pointing out high CEO pay at Network Rail, and that it was not formally classified by as a public body until 2013. New infrastructure projects will require planning permission, and environmental impact consultation. In R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v SS for Transport a group of people opposed to the High Speed Rail 2 project argued it failed the consultation standards in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011, because there was a party whipped vote in Parliament for its approval. The Supreme Court rejected the claim, because political organisation did not stop proper consultation and debate.[2014] UKSC 3. To run a train company itself, the Railways Act 1993 section 8 requires companies apply to the Office of Rail and Road for a licence, and pay Network Rail an access charge. Access to track under EU law must be \\"equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent\\",Single European Railway Directive 2012/34/EU art 10, Conditions of access to railway infrastructure (1) ‚ÄòRailway undertakings shall be granted, under equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent conditions, the right to access to the railway infrastructure in all Member States for the purpose of operating all types of rail freight services.‚Äô but this does not mean charging practices cannot be updated. In Great North Eastern Railway Ltd v Office of Rail Regulation, GNER sued the Office of Rail Regulation as other operators were not given a fixed charge for track access, but a charge varying with the number of passengers. It argued this was unlawful discrimination and state aid, but Sullivan J held the ORR had a broad discretion to set prices in the passengers' interest, and should be slow to challenge the expert regulator's decisions on technical pricing issues.[2006] EWHC 1942 (Admin) GNER subsequently handed the InterCity East Coast franchise back to the Department for Transport. Most controversially, the Railways Act 1993 section 25 prohibits any government body or government-appointed corporation from becoming a rail franchise in England and Wales.Railways Act 1993 s 25 The government-owned rail operators of France, the Netherlands, or Germany all run trains in the UK. But the UK government is the only one in the world that is prohibited from running UK trains. In 2016, Scotland was empowered to make Scottish trains public again,Scotland Act 2016 s 57, amending RA 1993 s 25 and the same policy was supported by a large majority of the UK public. Different rules apply to Transport for London, where the most controversial policies have surrounded the cost of Public Private Partnerships. The Greater London Authority Act 1999, while transferring responsibility for Transport for London back to an elected Mayor, required that the mayor follow public-private partnership agreements in rebuilding the London Underground and train network.Greater London Authority Act 1999 ss 41 and 141 (Mayor duties for transport) and ss 210-230 (PPP agreements). While the Mayor Ken Livingstone argued he was not bound and in an \\"impossible position\\", after being elected on a platform opposing privatisation, the High Court ruled that statute required he would be bound.R (Transport for London) v London Regional Transport [2001] EWHC Admin 637, per Sullivan J, \\"‚ÄòEntering into agreements may be wise, as asserted by the Government, LUL and LRT, or it may be foolish, as claimed by the Mayor and... TfL... judgments about the merits, as opposed to the legality of entering into the proposed PPP agreements, must be made by elected politicians and not by judges.\\" In 2008, one of the two main companies responsible for tube upgrades, Metronet went into administration with an estimated cost of ¬£410m.C Millett, 'Metronet failure cost taxpayer upto ¬£410m' (5 June 2009) Contract Journal. See also House of Commons, Transport Committee (January 2008) ‚ÄúThe return anticipated by Metronet‚Äôs shareholders appears to have been out of all proportion to the level of risk associated with the contract...‚Äù ‚ÄúIn terms of borrowing, the Metronet contract did nothing more than secure loans, 95% of which were in any case underwritten by the public purse, at an inflated cost...‚Äù ‚ÄúMetronet‚Äôs inability to operate efficiently or economically proves that the private sector can fail to deliver on a spectacular scale..‚Äù See also Re Metronet Rail BCV Ltd [2007] EWHC 2697 (Ch) Coal powered trains became the dominant form of transport in the 19th century, while oil powered motor vehicles dominated the 20th century. Passengers have a number of rights codified in law, but little direct voice in the running of their services. The Office of Rail and Road can set any conditions in licences, including \\"the fares to be charged for travel\\".Railways Act 1993 s 28(1) ‚ÄòA franchise agreement may include provision with respect to the fares to be charged for travel by means of the franchised services.‚Äô Also, s 29(5) ‚Äòsubject to any [statutory] requirements a franchise agreement may contain any such provisions as the Franchising Director thinks fit‚Äô. But although there can be regulatory price caps, UK train prices have risen consistently every year, usually beyond inflation.e.g. DataBlog, ‚ÄòRail fares rise: All the available data on British rail revenues‚Äô (17 August 2011) Guardian, fares rising 8% and ticket holders prices rising 13% By contrast, in London where the Mayor has control,Greater London Authority Act 1999 s 174. However, courts have attempted to intervene in the past: Bromley LBC v Greater London Council [1981] UKHL 7 (no deficit spending for fare reductions). fares have been consistently low when Labour mayors have been elected, although rising when a Conservative mayor was elected. The EU Passenger Rights Regulation 2007 contains a host of other legal rights against train companies. Passengers have a right to take bicycles on trains if not too crowded, must have proper information on tickets, must be able to make reservations, and must receive minimum compensation for long delays.Passenger Rights Regulation 2007 (EC) No 1371/2007 art 3 (bikes), 8-9 (information and tickets), 17 (delays: 25% of the ticket price for a 60-119 min delay, 50% for 120 min or more.

So, in R (Save Our Railways) v Director of Passenger Rail Franchising a passenger group argued that the Regulator unlawfully allowed a reduction in services in rural areas in its franchises. The Court of Appeal accepted the group's right to review, but referred the question back to the Regulator for reconsideration.[1996] CLC 596 Passengers are represented in a Passengers' Council, with a chair appointed by the Secretary of State, regional government representation and others who are seen to represent passenger groups,RA 2005 ss 19-21 and Schs 5-6 but they have no binding rights against train companies, rather than rights to investigate issues and make representations.Railways Act 1993 ss 76-78 If train companies go insolvent, a special procedure deviating from the normal Insolvency Act 1986 procedure is followed, to give the government, rather than banks and creditors control over administration.Railways Act 1993 ss 59-65 and Sch 6 This does not affect the powers of the Office of Rail and Road and a Minister's powers to make directions against a company in administration.Winsor v Special Railway Administrators of Railtrack Plc [2002] EWCA Civ 955 *Highways Act 1555, Highways Act 1562, Turnpike Act 1707 and Turnpike trust *Locomotive Acts 1861, 1865, 1878 *Local Government Act 1888, establishing county and borough councils, gave them powers to maintain roads Electric vehicles have spread slowly, starting with Low emission buses in London.

Historically, the regulation of communication systems was closely connected to state ownership and international treaties, from the Royal Mail, to the International Telecommunication Union established in 1865, to the Telegraph Act 1868 enabling the government make telegraph and telephone companies public. However, a process of liberalisation, and then privatisation, took place between 1981 and 1984. Today, the Communications Act 2003 governs the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications, underpinned by four main Directives in EU law.Electronic Communications Framework Directive 2002 2002/21/EC arts 8-9 (on regulator tasks)Authorisation Directive 2002 2002/20/EC arts 3-7Access Directive 2002 2002/19/EC arts 3-5The Universal Service Directive 2002 2002/22/EC arts 3-4 and 9-13 (telephone connection, affordability) The internet backbone is old copper and new optical fibre networks that span the globe. In the UK, networks such as the publicly funded JANET, or the privately owned Liberty Global (Virgin Media) connect each computer's Internet Protocol address. Under the Communications Act 2003 section 3, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, has duties to further citizens' interests in communications, and consumers' interests \\"by promoting competition\\", and secure \\"optimal use for wireless telegraphy of the electro- magnetic spectrum\\", make electronic communications, TV, radio, and plurality of media widely available.Communications Act 2003 s 3, also mentioning the need to prevent offensive, harmful or unfair material in TV and radio (but not Internet). Under s 4, it must comply with EU law. It is also subject to directions by the Secretary of State.CA 2003 s 5 Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 section 2 another one of Ofcom's main duties is to publish a \\"UK Plan for Frequency Authorisation\\", for how wireless telegraphy frequencies are allocated, and should reflect current and future demand, promote efficient use, innovation and competition. While there is no longer a licence required for merely setting up a telecommunications company,CA 2003 s 147 and local authorities may set up public electronic communications networks (such as free public wifi),Communications Act 2003 s 148 establishing wireless telegraphy apparatus (except for TV receivers, and other groups exempt) without a licence from Ofcom is prohibited, which can be subject to any terms Ofcom thinks fit.Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 ss 8-9 Practically, the prices that telecommunications companies charge are one of the most important factors on which Ofcom can set conditions. First, considerable revenue is raised by setting licence prices. In EE Ltd v Office of Communications the Secretary of State issued a direction to Ofcom to charge full market value for its annual licence fee in the 900MHz and 1800MHz frequencies and conduct an auction. However, the company EE Ltd successfully claimed that in doing so, Ofcom failed to consider all its duties on promoting competition, being objective, transparent and proportionate before following the Secretary of State's direction, and would have to decide again.[2017] EWCA Civ 1873 Ofcom can also cap prices where a provider has \\"significant market power\\" so that competition is unlikely to work alone in the public interest.CA 2003 ss 87-88 In Telefonica O2 UK Ltd v British Telecommunications plc the Supreme Court held that Ofcom improperly exercised its discretion in rejecting price rises by BT in its \\"Standard Interconnect Agreement\\" for mobile operators to use its networks. Lord Sumption held Ofcom did not adequately show that price BT's rises damaged the consumer interest.Telefonica O2 UK Ltd v British Telecommunications plc [2014] UKSC 42 Ofcom, with headquarters at Southwark Bridge, licenses the electromagnetic spectrum, and the operation of most communication firms. EE, O2, Vodafone, and 3 dominate mobile phones, and BT, Sky, Virgin and TalkTalk dominate broadband.Ofcom, The Communications Market 2016 154, Figure 4.2.1 and Ofcom, Communications Market Report (2017) 147, Figure 4.15 Though Ofcom can control prices, it also has a duty to make companies compete. The Enterprise Act 2002 section 131 enables Ofcom to make references to the Competition Commission if it suspects \\"features of a market... distorts competition in connection with the supply or acquisition\\" of communication products\\". This mirrors standards in EU law, particularly from TFEU article 102 on dominant undertakings abusing their position. Ultimately the Competition Commission has power to break up companies, subject to appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal and the courts. With this in mind, under section 154 Ofcom can also accept undertakings from firms to change their business. This occurred in 2005, when BT gave an undertaking to separate its network, now called Openreach, from its wholesale and retail services, and provide other companies equal access to its own. Equal treatment can also be enforced by the European Commission. In France Telecom SA v Commission the Commission found that France Telecom's subsidiary \\"Wanadoo Interactive\\" was engaging in predatory pricing (setting prices deliberately low, sustained by France Telecom's other divisions) to drive out competitors. The Court of Justice rejected there was any need to show that France Telecom would later be able to make up or \\"recoup\\" its losses if it was shown that Wanadoo's prices were below average \\"variable costs\\".France Telecom SA v Commission (2009) C-202/07 In Deutsche Telekom AG v Commission the Commission also found Deutsche Telekom had abused its dominant position by charging competitors so much in wholesale prices for its \\"local loop\\" network (the circuits connecting fixed telephones to main distribution frames) that others could not credibly compete with Deutsche Telekom in its retail prices. The Court of Justice held that Deutsche Telekom has \\"squeezed the margins\\" (between wholesale and retail) of its competitors enough to be an abuse, and once those figures were proven, it was unnecessary to engage in some detailed economic analysis of competition's effects.Deutsche Telekom AG v Commission (2010) C-280/08 Similarly in Telef√≥nica SA v Commission the Court of Justice upheld a ‚Ç¨151m fine on Spain's Telefonica for abuse by imposing unfair prices on competitors to access its ADSL broadband fixed telephone network. This had squeezed competitors' margins, and so distorted competition. The test is whether a hypothetical competitor working as efficiently as the incumbent could compete.Telef√≥nica SA v Commission (2014) C-295/12 In the UK, TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc v Ofcom held that Ofcom imposing charge controls on BT under the Communications Act 2003 section 86 was legitimate, as BT had over 70 per cent of the local exchange market. The Court of Appeal held that, even though TalkTalk was expanding its local exchange network as Ofcom made its finding that BT had \\"significant market power\\" so long as there was no material change that falsified Ofcom's original finding, the price controls could remain.TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc v Ofcom [2013] EWCA Civ 1318 However, in Vodafone Ltd v British Telecommunications Plc, the Court of Appeal held that if price controls (capping and reducing Vodafone's charges for wholesale mobile calls for four years) were appealed, the Competition Appeal Tribunal had no power to instruct Ofcom about replacement prices: Ofcom's decision if void, would have to be made again.Vodafone Ltd v British Telecommunications Plc [2010] EWCA Civ 391 As well as competition and price controls, consumers have basic rights under the Universal Service Directive 2002,Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC arts 3-4 and 9-13 (telephone connection, affordable) and the Communications Act 2003. For example, Ofcom requires that people should be able to keep their telephone numbers even if they transfer between companies to enable people to switch competitors easily.Communications Act 2003 ss 58-59 Practically important across the EU, the Roaming Regulation 2012 required reduction and elimination of charges for phone calls and text messages when abroad by June 2017.Roaming Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 arts 7-8 (this is the successor to 717/2007) In R (Vodafone Ltd) v SS for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Vodafone attempted to argue this was unlawful under (what is now) the TFEU because it was \\"disproportionate\\" and compromised \\"subsidiarity\\". The CJEU Grand Chamber rejected the claim, as it was based on objective criteria, and encouraged competition among networks for quality.(2010) C-58/08 ;Post *Postal Services Act 2000 *PostComm *Postal Services Act 2011 =Media and social networks= The Aldwych in London was home to the first radio broadcasts, and to the BBC's World Service from 1941-2012. Both telecommunications infrastructure, and the electro-magnetic spectrum, is used for broadcasting of radio, television, and all forms of web media. The British Broadcasting Corporation is the UK's largest and oldest broadcast media firm, and in substance competes with print media (through news.bbc.co.uk), radio, television and web streaming. Established with a royal charter in 1927,White Paper on Broadcasting Policy (1946) Cmd 6852. with an object to \\"inform, educate and entertain\\". Today the BBC's royal charter requires that it is independent, acts \\"in the public interest\\", delivers \\"impartial\\" news, supports learning, creativity, high and distinctive quality, serving UK diversity, the creative economy and reflecting UK culture and values to the world.Royal Charter of the BBC (2016) Cm 9365, arts 3-7 In practice, the BBC's independence from government is achieved through its governance structure. The BBC's Board has a maximum of fourteen members, and while the chair and four nation representatives are appointed by an Order in Council (effectively by the prime minister), the other nine executive members, including the Director General are appointed by the existing board.BBC Charter (2016) Cm 9365, arts 21-25 The Secretary of State sets the terms of appointments (with a four-year maximum) and pay, while the terms of everyone else will be set by the board.BBC Charter (2016) arts 27-32 Article 35 does require \\"suitable arrangements\\" to \\"consult BBC staff on all matters affecting the interests of those staff\\". But there is, however, not yet direct representation of staff or license-fee payers in BBC (or other media organisation) governance. Ofcom licences all broadcasters in radio and TV (but not on the internet), including the BBC,CA 2003 s 198 and requires that all comply with the Broadcasting Code.CA 2003 ss 3, 42, 232-240, 319 Local authorities are explicitly empowered to provide broadcasting. Ofcom can also review media ownership, and the law restricts licensing of broadcasters if they run a national newspaper with a market share over 20 per cent, over a 6-month period.CA 2003 ss 357, 391 and Sch 14 If licensees breach a duty of accuracy, Ofcom may require a broadcaster to make corrections or give a statement of findings, and can impose fines up to 5 per cent or advert and sponsorship revenue. Licences can also be revoked. Under the Communications Act 2003 section 319, broadcast standards require protection of children, no material that could incite crime, due impartiality, accuracy, no \\"offensive and harmful material\\", restriction on political advertising, any ads that are \\"misleading, harmful or offensive\\", and \\"no use of techniques\\" on viewers for \\"influencing their minds, without their being aware\\".CA 2003 s 319, while s 320 further defines impartiality. There are further requirements to stop party political advertisements, except under fairly allocated time.CA 2003 s 333 and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 ss 37 and 127. As an example of decency and offensiveness standards, in R (Gaunt) v Ofcom the Court of Appeal held that Ofcom was fully justified in finding that a right-wing commentator called Jon Gaunt on Talksport had breached the Broadcasting Code. Gaunt hectored a councillor, who was proposing restricting smokers from fostering children, as a \\"health Nazi\\", an \\"ignorant pig\\" and to \\"shut up\\". Talksport fired Gaunt summarily, before 53 complaints were made to Ofcom, which issued a censure. Gaunt argued the censure breached his ostensible right to freedom of expression under ECHR article 10, but Lord Neuberger MR rejected the claim because the programme's purpose seemed to any reasonable viewer to be no more than \\"to insult, belittle and berate\\" the councillor.[2011] EWCA Civ 692. An appeal to ECHR was rejected. Similarly, in R (DM Digital Television Ltd) v Ofcom Stuart-Smith J held that Ofcom was justified in imposing ¬£85,000 and ¬£20,000 fines on a small station called DM Digital, after it broadcast programmes with an Islamic \\"scholar\\" inciting crime, and criticising a Pakistani political party and NATO without inviting their comments and a chance to respond. He rejected claims that Ofcom's process was \\"biased\\" or that the financial penalties were disproportionate, noting that Ofcom had not gone further and revoked the broadcaster's licence.[2014] EWHC 961 (Admin) The most used web networks in the UK are Google and YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, the BBC, Amazon and Wikipedia.Alexa Top Sites (2018) Only Wikipedia and the BBC give voice to users in their governance structure. Facebook had, but removed the right of users to vote over privacy and data policy in 2012.See 'Letter from Mark Rotenburg to Facebook' (27 November 2017) Despite the common social standards applicable to broadcast media, standards have not been enforced on internet corporations with dominant market power. According to Alex, the world's top five websites include Google, YouTube, Facebook and Wikipedia, while Twitter stands at number 13 but occupies an important role in public discourse. The Electronic Commerce Directive 2000, implemented by the UK Electronic Commerce Regulations 2002 (to some extent following analogues in the United StatesSee Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 USC ¬ß230 and Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, 339 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir 2003)) an \\"information society service\\" that hosts information is \\"not liable for information stored\\" if the provider \\"does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity.2000/31/EC) art 14 Moreover there should be no \\"general obligation on providers... to monitor the information which they transmit or store\\".Electronic Commerce Directive 2000, art 15 In light of growing problems with hate speech, harassment, fake news, bots and interference with democracy, the question is whether these exemptions apply to major news networks. In one of the first cases, CG v Facebook Ireland Ltd the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal held that Facebook breached a duty to promptly remove a page that was designed to persecute a former sex offender who had completed a prison sentence.[2016] NICA 54 *Wikimedia.

Since the Bill of Rights 1689 secured the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown, the \\"levying Money for or to the Use of the Crowne by pretence of Prerogative without Grant of Parlyament... is Illegall.\\"Bill of Rights 1689 cl 4. This followed the Magna Carta 1215 cl 12, the Petition of Right 1628 (3 Car 1 c 1), the Case of Ship Money, R v Hampden (1637) Salmon‚Äôs State Trials, vol 1, 698, the Ship Money Act 1640 and the English Civil War. There can be no tax without Parliament, and any subordinate legislation passed without an Act will be declared invalid in court.e.g. Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Cure and Deeley Ltd [1962] 1 QB 340, and Woolwich BS v IRC (No 2) [1993] AC 70, ultra vires money recoverable by taxpayer with interest. Moreover, since 1713, it is a Standing Order of the House of Commons that the House cannot consider any new charges on the public revenue except on the recommendation of the government, signified by a Minister.Standing Order (1713) HC 314, SO 48 Since 1714, the government's finances were transferred from what was the Lord High Treasurer to a board of commissioners including the First Lord of the Treasury (i.e. the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the junior Lords of the Treasury (i.e. assistant government whips in the Commons). As a department, the Treasury controls both tax and spending and guides economic policy.e.g. the document on Departmental Strategic Objectives (2007) aimed to ensure ‚Äòhigh and sustainable levels of economic growth, well being and prosperity for all‚Äô, and to eradicate child poverty by 2020. This latter goal was removed by the succeeding government as the Child Poverty Act 2010 was renamed the Life Chances Act 2010. The Treasury controls Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, and its commissioners \\"shall comply with any directions\\" given by the Treasury.Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 s 11 and the Taxes Management Act 1970, on the administration of HMRC. The Treasury also has a duty to prepare a \\"Charter for Budget Responsibility\\" that is laid before Parliament and sets out the \\"formulation and implementation of fiscal policy and policy for the management of the National Debt\\".Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 s 1(1) The Treasury has to prepare a financial statement and budget report for each financial year\\", and it appoints an Office of Budget Responsibility to \\"examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances.\\"Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 ss 2-4 All money received from tax revenue goes to the Consolidated Fund,Consolidated Fund Act 1816 s 1 and Exchequer Audit Departments Act 1866 s 10, ‚ÄòAll public moneys payable to the Exchequer shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund...‚Äô while money from National Insurance Contributions goes to the National Insurance Fund.Social Security Administration Act 1992 s 162 The government also has a National Loans Fund for borrowing, which the Consolidated Fund draws upon to maintain a daily balance of zero,National Loans Act 1968 s 18, there is daily balancing between the NLF and CF. a Contingency Fund for emergency spending,Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act 1946 and the Treasury maintains an Exchange Equalisation Account for trading foreign currency, gold, and special drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the pound sterling.Exchange Equalisation Account Act 1979 s 1 The government can also establish trading funds for specific public bodies, such as the Royal Mint or the Land Registry where it is suitable to make funds separate from the budget's annual cycle.Government Trading Funds Act 1973 Government departments may be required to do accounts each year by the Treasury.Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 s 7 Government spending in the United Kingdom and sources of revenue, for 2019-2020. The main sources of revenue for the government are taxes on labour, capital, trade in goods and services, and land, although the balance of these has shifted considerably in recent decades. Taxes on income have been increased for lower and middle earners and reduced for higher earners, corporation tax has been cut, value added tax has been increased, and taxes on land and wealth have reduced. First, income tax and National Insurance Contributions come mainly from the incomes of employees and the self-employed at work, albeit different rates, but it is also charged on savings and investment income.Income Tax Act 2007 s 3 In 2020, there was no tax charged on the first ¬£12,500 of income each year (the personal allowance), 20% income tax up to ¬£50,000, 40% up to ¬£150,000, and 45% over ¬£150,000.Income Tax Act 2007 ss 10‚Äì12, 35 and 57A. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 defines earnings subject to tax and See Income Tax Rates at gov.uk While there are several categories, the main National Insurance rates paid by employees are 12% for earnings between ¬£166.01 and ¬£962 each week, and 2% on the earnings above, while employers pay 13.8% on earnings over ¬£166.01. By contrast, most people who are self-employed as sole traders or in a partnership pay ¬£3 a week over ¬£6,365 a year, 9% on profits between ¬£8,632 and ¬£50,000 each year, and 2% on profits over ¬£50,000. This means that, although National Insurance operates in the same way as a tax, it is regressive. Second, the rates for income tax on income from dividends from shares is lower than for employment income, standing at 7.5% for the basic rate, 32.5% for the higher rate, and 38.1% for the additional rate.Income Tax Act 2007 s 8 This is mirrored in the lower rates of Corporation Tax Act 2010. For corporate profits, the main rate of tax is 19% in 2020.Corporation Tax Act 2010 s 3 refers to the main rate as being set by Parliament, which in turn is set in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 s 7 at 19%. For 2020, the March Budget announced the main rate would remain at 19%, notwithstanding the planned drop to 17%. This has been reduced from 28% since 2010, and from at 52% in 1982 with a lower rate of 38% for small companies. Under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 an additional tax on capital gains is charged at 18% for residential property, and 10% for other assets, for those still within the basic rate of income, and 28% and 20% for those in the higher or additional rates.Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 s 1H Third, the rate of Value Added Tax stands at 20% in 2020, after being increased from 17.5% in 2010,Value Added Tax Act 1994 s 2, put up by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2010 s 3(1) from 15% in 1991, and from 8% in 1979. Fourth, there are two taxes payable on land.

See also Business rates in Scotland. Overall the shifts in taxation have become more regressive, enabling the wealthiest to pay the least, and making the poor pay more. Government spending is set out each year in the UK government budget. Most money goes to pensions, unemployment insurance, social care, the National Health Service and education. Proportionally, the sums going to education have decreased with cuts to schools and universities becoming reliant on tuition fees charged to home and international students. A considerable proportion goes to military spending and paying off the national debt, which primarily means profits for international banks that lend the UK government money. In the March 2020, the government planned large increases in transport, communication infrastructure and housing spending, as well as more nurses and police officers. It is generally thought that more investment in education, public health, clean energy, transport and communication infrastructure enable the greatest multipliers for future economic performance,e.g. W Easterly and S Rebelo, ‚ÄòFiscal policy and economic growth: An empirical investigation‚Äô (1993) 33(2) Journal of Monetary Economics 417 coupled with policies to maintain full employment at fair wages.

He is known for having played a wide range of starring or supporting roles, including comedy, romance, and darkly comic portrayals of anti-heroes and villainous characters. In many of his films, he played the \\"eternal outsider, the sardonic drifter\\", someone who rebels against the social structure. His most known and celebrated films include the road drama Easy Rider (1969); the dramas Five Easy Pieces (1970) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975); the comedy-dramas Carnal Knowledge (1971), The Last Detail (1973), Terms of Endearment (1983), Prizzi's Honor (1985), Heartburn (1986), As Good as It Gets (1997), and About Schmidt (2002); the neo-noir mystery Chinatown (1974); the horror film The Shining (1980); the biopic Reds (1981); the fantasy comedy The Witches of Eastwick (1987); the superhero film Batman (1989); the legal drama A Few Good Men (1992); the romantic horror film Wolf (1994); the science fiction comedy Mars Attacks! (1996); the comedy Anger Management (2003); the romantic comedy Something's Gotta Give (2003); and the crime drama The Departed (2006). He has also directed three films, including The Two Jakes (1990). Nicholson's 12 Academy Award nominations make him the most nominated male actor in the Academy's history. He has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and As Good as It Gets (1997), and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Terms of Endearment (1983). He is one of only three male actors to win three Academy Awards, and one of only two actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. He has won six Golden Globe Awards and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, at 57, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award. Nicholson had a number of high-profile relationships, including ones with Anjelica Huston and Rebecca Broussard, and was married to Sandra Knight from 1962 to 1968. He has five children: one with Knight, two with Broussard (including Lorraine Nicholson), and one each with Susan Anspach and Winnie Hollman. Early life Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune City, New Jersey, the son of a showgirl, June Frances Nicholson (stage name June Nilson; 1918‚Äì1963). Nicholson's mother was of Irish, English, German, and Welsh descent. She married Italian-American showman Donald Furcillo (stage name Donald Rose) in 1936, before realizing that he was already married.Berliner, Eve. Marriage certificate of June Nilson and Donald Furcillo. Young Jack Nicholson: Auspicious Beginnings. Evesmag.com. 2001. Biographer Patrick McGilligan stated in his book Jack's Life that Latvian-born Eddie King (originally Edgar A. Kirschfeld), June's manager, may have been Nicholson's biological father, rather than Furcillo. Other sources suggest June Nicholson was unsure of the father's identity. As June was only seventeen years old and unmarried, her parents agreed to raise Nicholson as their own child without revealing his true parentage, and June would act as his sister.Jack Nicholson Biography, Biography.com In 1974, Time magazine researchers learned, and informed Nicholson, that his \\"sister\\", June, was actually his mother, and his other \\"sister\\", Lorraine, was really his aunt.Collins, Nancy. The Great Seducer: Jack Nicholson. Rolling Stone, March 29, 1984, By this time, both his mother and grandmother had died (in 1963 and 1970, respectively). On finding out, Nicholson said it was \\"a pretty dramatic event, but it wasn't what I'd call traumatizing ... I was pretty well psychologically formed\\". Nicholson grew up in Neptune City. He was raised in his mother's Roman Catholic religion. Before starting high school, his family moved to an apartment in Spring Lake, New Jersey. \\"When Jack was ready for high school, the family moved once more‚Äîthis time two miles farther south to old-money Spring Lake, New Jersey's so-called Irish Riviera, where Ethel May set up her beauty parlor in a rambling duplex at 505 Mercer Avenue.\\"Nicholson, Jack. \\"No Getting Away From NJ: Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson attempts to elucidate the definitive quality of New Jersey\\", New Jersey Monthly, November 15, 2010. Retrieved July 14, 2011. \\"I grew up on the Shore ... in Neptune, Neptune City, Manasquan, and Spring Lake. Graduated from Manasquan [High School]. No offense to Atlantic City, but, where we grew up, we called it 'The Shore'.\\" \\"Nick\\", as he was known to his high school friends, attended nearby Manasquan High School, where he was voted \\"Class Clown\\" by the Class of 1954. He was in detention every day for a whole school year. A theatre and a drama award at the school are named in his honor. In 2004, Nicholson attended his 50-year high school reunion accompanied by his aunt Lorraine. Military service In 1957, Nicholson joined the California Air National Guard, a move he sometimes characterized as an effort to \\"dodge the draft\\"; the Korean War‚Äìera's Military Selective Service Act was still in force, and draftees were required to perform up to two years of active duty. After completing the Air Force's basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Nicholson performed weekend drills and two-week annual training as a firefighter assigned to the unit based at the Van Nuys Airport. During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Nicholson was called up for several months of extended active duty, and he was discharged at the end of his enlistment in 1962. Career=Early work= Nicholson as Wilbur Force in The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) Nicholson first came to Hollywood in 1954, when he was seventeen, to visit his sister. He took a job as an office worker for animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the MGM cartoon studio. They offered him an entry-level job as an animator, but he declined, citing his desire to become an actor. While accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 56th Golden Globe Awards, he recalled that his first day as a working actor was May 5, 1955, which he considered lucky, as \\"5\\" was the jersey number of his boyhood idol, Joe DiMaggio. \\"Jack Nicholson Receives Cecil B Demille Award - Golden Globes 1999\\" via Dick Clark Productions; retrieved February 24, 2020 He trained to be an actor with a group called the Players Ring Theater, after which time he found small parts performing on the stage and in TV soap operas.Katz, Ephraim. The Film Encyclopedia, HarperCollins (2012) pp. 1079‚Äì1080 He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama The Cry Baby Killer (1958), playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film's producer, Roger Corman. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, such as in The Little Shop of Horrors, as masochistic dental patient and undertaker Wilbur Force, and also in The Raven; The Terror, where he plays a French officer seduced by an evil ghost; and The St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Nicholson also frequently worked with director Monte Hellman on low-budget westerns, though two in particular‚ÄîRide in the Whirlwind and The Shooting‚Äîinitially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art- house circuit in France and were later sold to television. Nicholson also appeared in two episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. =1960s= With his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the screenplay for the 1967 counterculture film The Trip (directed by Corman), which starred Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. After first reading the script, Fonda told Nicholson he was totally impressed by the writing and felt it could become a great film. However, Fonda was disappointed with how the film turned out and blamed the editing which turned it into a \\"predictable\\" film and said so publicly. \\"I was livid\\", he recalls.Linderman, Lawrence. \\"Playboy Interview with Peter Fonda\\", Playboy magazine, September 1970 Nicholson also co-wrote, with Bob Rafelson, the movie Head, which starred The Monkees. He also arranged the movie's soundtrack. Nicholson's first big acting break came when a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper's Easy Rider (1969). He played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40 million. Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson's interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier \\"anti-hero\\" actors, such as James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, while promoting him into an \\"overnight number-one hero of the counter-culture movement\\".Parker, John. Michael Douglas: Acting on Instinct, Hachette Book Group (2011) e-book The part was a lucky break for Nicholson. The role had been written for the actor Rip Torn, who withdrew from the project after an argument with Hopper.Hill, Lee. A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern. Bloomsbury, 2001. In interviews, Nicholson later acknowledged the importance of being cast in Easy Rider: \\"All I could see in the early films, before Easy Rider, was this desperate young actor trying to vault out of the screen and create a movie career.\\" Nicholson was cast by Stanley Kubrick, who was impressed with his role in Easy Rider, in the part of Napoleon in a film about his life, and although production on the film commenced, the project fizzled out, partly due to a change in ownership at MGM, and other issues. =1970s= Nicholson with Michelle Phillips at the 1971 Golden Globes Nicholson starred in Five Easy Pieces alongside Karen Black in 1970 in what became his persona-defining role. Nicholson and Black were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, an oil rig worker, and Black played his waitress girlfriend. During an interview about the film, Black noted that Nicholson's character in the film was very subdued, and was very different from Nicholson's real-life personality. She says that the now-famous restaurant scene was partly improvised by Nicholson, and was out of character for Bobby, who wouldn't have cared enough to argue with a waitress.\\"Hold the Chicken ‚Äì Five Easy Pieces\\", fair use video clip \\"I think that Jack really has very little in common with Bobby. I think Bobby has given up looking for love. But Jack hasn't, he's very interested in love, in finding out things. Jack is a very curious, alive human being. Always ready for a new idea.\\"Crane, Robert. Jack Nicholson: The Early Years, Univ. Press of Kentucky (2012) Nicholson himself said as much, telling an interviewer, \\"I like listening to everybody. This to me is the elixir of life.\\"D'Agostino, Ryan. Esquire the Meaning of Life: Wisdom, Humor, and Damn Good Advice from 64 Extraordinary Lives, Sterling Publishing (2009) pp. 97‚Äì99 Black later admitted that she had a crush on Nicholson from the time they met, although they only dated briefly. \\"He was very beautiful. He just looked right at you ... I liked him a lot ... He really sort of wanted to date me but I didn't think of him that way because I was going with Peter Kastner ... Then I went to do Easy Rider, but didn't see him because we didn't have any scenes together ... At the premiere, I saw him out in the lobby afterward and I started crying ... He didn't understand that, but what it was that I really loved him a lot, and I didn't know it until I saw him again, because it all welled up.\\" Within a month after the film's release that September, the movie became a blockbuster, making Nicholson a leading man and the \\"new American anti-hero\\", according to McDougal. Critics began speculating as to whether he might become another Marlon Brando or James Dean. His career and income skyrocketed. He said, \\"I have [become] much sought after. Your name becomes a brand image like a product. You become Campbell's soup, with thirty-one different varieties of roles you can play.\\" He told his new agent, Sandy Bresler, to find him unusual roles so he could stretch his acting skill: \\"I like to play people that haven't existed yet, a 'cusp character'\\", he said: Also in 1970, he appeared in the movie adaptation of On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, although most of his performance was left on the cutting room floor. His agent turned down a starring role in Deliverance when the film's producer and director, John Boorman, refused to pay what Nicholson's agent wanted. Nicholson starred in Carnal Knowledge in 1971, a comedy-drama directed by Mike Nichols, which co-starred Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret, and Candice Bergen. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. As a director, Mike Nichols was limited in the actors who he felt could handle the role, saying, \\"There is James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda. After that, who is there but Jack Nicholson?\\" During the filming, Nicholson struck up what became a lifelong friendship with co-star Garfunkel. When he visited Los Angeles, Garfunkel would stay at Nicholson's home in a room Nicholson jokingly called \\"the Arthur Garfunkel Suite\\". Other Nicholson roles included Hal Ashby's The Last Detail (1973), with Randy Quaid, for which Nicholson won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and he was nominated for his third Oscar and a Golden Globe. Television journalist David Gilmour writes that one of his favorite Nicholson scenes from all his films was in this one when Nicholson slaps his gun on the bar yelling he was the Shore Patrol.Gilmour, David. The Film Club: A Memoir, Hachette Book Group (2008) e-bookShore Patrol scene in The Last Detail, fair use clip Critic Roger Ebert called it a very good movie, but credited Nicholson's acting as the main reason: \\"He creates a character so complete and so complex that we stop thinking about the movie and just watch to see what he'll do next.\\"Ebert, Roger. Roger Ebert's Four Star Reviews‚Äî1967‚Äì2007, Andrews McMeel Publishing (2007) p. 405 In 1974, Nicholson starred in Roman Polanski's noir thriller Chinatown, and was again nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Jake Gittes, a private detective. The film co-starred Faye Dunaway and John Huston, and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson's portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew \\"how to go over the top\\", as he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It is that edge that kept Chinatown from becoming a typical genre crime film.Ebert, Roger. The Great Movies, Volume 1, Broadway Books (2002) p. 106 Ebert also notes the importance of the role for Nicholson's career, seeing it as a major transition from the exploitation films of the previous decade. \\"As Jake Gittes, he stepped into Bogart's shoes\\", says Ebert. \\"As a man attractive to audiences because he suggests both comfort and danger ... From Gittes forward, Nicholson created the persona of a man who had seen it all and was still capable of being wickedly amused.\\"Ebert, Roger. 27 Movies from the Dark Side: Ebert's Essentials, Andrews McMeel Publishing (2012) e-book Nicholson had been friends with the director Roman Polanski long before the murder of Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate and others, at the hands of the Manson Family, and supported him in the days following their deaths. After Tate's death, Nicholson began sleeping with a hammer under his pillow and took breaks from work to attend the Manson trial. Nicholson in 1976 In 1977, three years after Chinatown, Polanski was arrested at Nicholson's home for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer, who was modeling for Polanski during a magazine photo shoot around the pool. At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say, \\"We'll be right out.\\" Polanski then came out with Geimer, and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs, which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Geimer was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall. After a few minutes of talking, Polanski had packed up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive off in his car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she \\"had witnessed nothing untoward\\" and never saw them together in the other room.Huston, Anjelica. Watch Me, Simon and Schuster (2014) e-book Geimer learned afterward that Huston herself wasn't supposed to be at Nicholson's house that day, since they had recently broken up, but stopped over to pick up some belongings. Geimer described Nicholson's house as \\"definitely\\" a guy's house, with lots of wood and shelves crowded with photos and mementos.Geimer, Samantha. The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski, Simon and Schuster (2013) p. 79 One of Nicholson's greatest successes came in 1975, with his role as Randle P. McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The movie was an adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel, and was directed by Milo≈° Forman and co-produced by Michael Douglas. Nicholson plays an anti-authoritarian patient at a mental hospital where he becomes an inspiring leader for the other patients. Playing one of the patients was Danny DeVito in an early role. Nicholson learned afterward that DeVito grew up in the same area of New Jersey, and they knew many of the same people. The film swept the Academy Awards with nine nominations, and won the top five, including Nicholson's first for Best Actor. The role seemed perfect for Nicholson, with biographer Ken Burke noting that his \\"smartass demeanor balances his genuine concern for the treatment of his fellow patients with his independent spirit too free to exist in a repressive social structure\\".Burke, Ken. Ed. The Guide to United States Popular Culture, Bowling Green State Univ. Press (2001) p. 578\\"You're Not Crazy!\\" ‚Äì a scene in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, fair use clip Forman allowed Nicholson to improvise throughout the film, including most of the group therapy sequences. Reviewer Marie Brenner notes that his bravura performance \\"transcends the screen\\" and continually inspires the other actors by lightening their mental illnesses with his comic dialogue. She describes his performance: Also in 1975, Nicholson starred in Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), which co- starred Maria Schneider. Nicholson plays the role of a journalist, David Locke, who during an assignment in North Africa decides to quit being a journalist and simply disappear by taking on a new hidden identity. Unfortunately, the dead person whose identity he takes on turns out to have been a weapons smuggler on the run. Antonioni's unusual plot included convincing dialogue and fine acting, states film critic Seymour Chatman.Chatman, Seymour; Duncan, Paul. Michelangelo Antonioni: The Investigation, Taschen (2004) p. 134 It was shot in Algeria, Spain, Germany, and England. The film received good reviews and revived Antonioni's reputation as one of cinema's great directors. He says he wanted the film to have more of a \\"spy feeling [and] be more political\\". Nicholson began shooting the film from an unfinished script, notes Judith Crist,Crist, Judith. \\"The Plot Slickens\\", New York Magazine', April 14, 1975 p. 76 yet upon its completion he thought so highly of the film that he bought the world rights and recorded a reminiscence of working with Antonioni. Critic and screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt provides an overview of Nicholson's role: He continued to take more unusual roles. He took a small role in The Last Tycoon, opposite Robert De Niro. He took a less sympathetic role in Arthur Penn's western The Missouri Breaks (1976), specifically to work with Marlon Brando. Nicholson was especially inspired by Brando's acting ability, recalling that in his youth, as an assistant manager at a theater, he watched On the Waterfront about forty times.Wild, David. \\"Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson\\", Rolling Stone, May 3, 2007, p. 110 \\"I'm part of the first generation that idolized Marlon Brando\\", he said.Nicholson, Jack. \\"Remembering Marlon\\", Rolling Stone, August 19, 2004 Nicholson has observed that while both De Niro and Brando were noted for their skill as method actors, he himself has seldom been described as a method actor, a fact which he sees as an accomplishment: \\"I'm still fooling them\\", he told Sean Penn during a phone conversation. \\"I consider it an accomplishment because there's probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do‚Äîor actually uses it more in his work. But it's funny, nobody really sees that. It's perception versus reality, I guess.\\" =1980s= Although he garnered no Academy Award for Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining (1980), it remains one of his more significant roles. He was Kubrick's first choice to play the lead role, although the book's author, Stephen King, wanted the part played by more of an \\"everyman\\". However, Kubrick as a director won the argument, and described Nicholson's acting quality as being \\"on a par with the greatest stars of the past, like Spencer Tracy and Jimmy Cagney\\".LoBrutto, Vincent. Stanley Kubrick: A Biography, Da Capo Press (1997) p. 420 On the set, Nicholson always appeared in character, and if Kubrick felt confident that he knew his lines well enough, he encouraged him to improvise and go beyond the script. For example, Nicholson improvised his now-famous \\"Here's Johnny!\\" line, along with a scene in which he unleashes his anger upon his wife while she interrupts his writing. There were also extensive takes of scenes, due to Kubrick's perfectionism. Nicholson shot a scene with the ghostly bartender thirty-six times. Nicholson states that \\"Stanley's demanding. He'll do a scene fifty times, and you have to be good to do that.\\"Ciment, Michel. Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Faber and Faber, Inc. (1980; 1999) In 1982, he starred as an immigration enforcement agent in The Border, directed by Tony Richardson. It co-starred Warren Oates, who played a corrupt border official.Trailer: The Border, fair use clip Richardson wanted Nicholson to play his role less expressively than he had in his earlier roles. \\"Less is more\\", he told him, and wanted him to wear reflecting sunglasses to portray what patrolmen wore. Richardson recalled that Nicholson worked hard on the set: Nicholson won his second Oscar, an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his role of retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment (1983), directed by James L. Brooks. It starred Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger. McGilligan claims it was one of Nicholson's most complex and unforgettable characters. He and MacLaine played many of their scenes in different ways, constantly testing and making adjustments. Their scenes together gave the film its \\"buoyant edge\\", states McGilligan, and describes Nicholson's acting as \\"Jack floating like a butterfly\\". Nicholson continued to work prolifically in the 1980s, starring in such films as: The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981); Reds (1981), where Nicholson portrays the writer Eugene O'Neill with a quiet intensity; Prizzi's Honor (1985); Heartburn (1986); The Witches of Eastwick (1987); Broadcast News (1987); and Ironweed (1987). Three Oscar nominations also followed (Reds, Prizzi's Honor, and Ironweed). John Huston, who directed Prizzi's Honor, said of Nicholson's acting, \\"He just illuminates the book. He impressed me in one scene after another; the movie is composed largely of first takes with him.\\"Grobel, Lawrence. \\"Playboy Interview with John Huston\\", Playboy magazine, September 1985 In the 1989 Batman movie, Nicholson played the psychotic murderer and villain, the Joker. The film was an international smash hit, and a lucrative percentage deal earned him a percentage of the box office gross estimated at $60 million to $90 million. Nicholson said that he was \\"particularly proud\\" of his performance as the Joker: \\"I considered it a piece of pop art\\", he said. =1990s= For his role as hot-headed Col. Nathan R. Jessup in A Few Good Men (1992), a movie about a murder in a U.S. Marine Corps unit, Nicholson received yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\\"You Can't Handle the Truth! ‚Äì A Few Good Men\\", fair use clip One review describes his performance as \\"spellbinding\\", adding that he portrayed \\"the essence of the quintessential military mindset\\".Bleiler, David, Ed. TLA Video & DVD Guide, St. Martin's Griffin (2003) p. 206 Critic David Thomson notes that Nicholson's character \\"blazed and roared\\". The film's director, Rob Reiner, recalls how Nicholson's level of acting experience affected the other actors during rehearsals: \\"I had the luck of having Jack Nicholson there. He knows what he's doing, and he comes to play, every time out, full-out performance! And what it says to a lot of the other actors is, 'Oooooh, I better get on my game here because this guy's coming to play! So I can't hold back; I've got to come up to him.' He sets the tone.\\"Kagan, Jeremy. Directors Close Up, Scarecrow Press (2006) p. 148 In 1996, Nicholson collaborated once more with Batman director Tim Burton on Mars Attacks!, pulling double duty as two contrasting characters, President James Dale and Las Vegas property developer Art Land. At first, studio executives at Warner Bros. disliked the idea of killing off Nicholson's character, so Burton created two characters and killed them both off. Not all of Nicholson's performances have been well received. He was nominated for Razzie Awards as worst actor for Man Trouble (1992) and Hoffa (1992). However, Nicholson's performance in Hoffa also earned him a Golden Globe nomination. While David Thomson states that the film was terribly neglected, since Nicholson portrayed one of his best screen characters, someone who is \\"snarly, dumb, smart, noble, rascally‚Äîall the parts of 'Jack'\\" Nicholson went on to win his next Academy Award for Best Actor in the romantic comedy, As Good as It Gets (1997), his third film directed by James L. Brooks. He played Melvin Udall, a \\"wickedly funny\\", mean-spirited, obsessive-compulsive novelist. \\"I'm a studio Method actor\\", he said. \\"So I was prone to give some kind of clinical presentation of the disorder.\\"Schruers, Fred. \\"Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson\\", Rolling Stone, March 19, 1998 pp. 38‚Äì40 His Oscar was matched with the Academy Award for Best Actress for Helen Hunt, who played a Manhattan wisecracking, single-mother waitress drawn into a love/hate friendship with Udall, a frequent diner in the restaurant. The film was a tremendous box office success, grossing $314 million, which made it Nicholson's second-best-grossing film of his career, after Batman. Nicholson admits he initially didn't like playing the role of a middle-aged man alongside much younger Hunt, seeing it as a movie clich√©. \\"But Helen disarmed that at the first meeting\\", he says, \\"and I stopped thinking about it.\\" They got along well during the filming, with Hunt saying that he \\"treated me like a queen\\", and they connected immediately: \\"It wasn't even what we said\\", she adds. \\"It was just some frequency we both could tune into that was very, very compatible.\\"Bona, Damien. Inside Oscar 2, Random House (2002) e-book Critic Jack Mathews of Newsday described Nicholson as being \\"in rare form\\", adding that \\"it's one of those performances that make you aware how much fun the actor is having\\".

In 1984, Nicholson stated that he was not convinced he is Caleb's father; however, in 1996, Caleb stated that Nicholson had acknowledged him as his son. At some point between 1988 and 1994, Nicholson provided financial assistance to put Caleb through college,Abcarian, Robin. \\"Never a Borrower or a Lender Be‚ÄîEspecially in Hollywood\\", Los Angeles Times.

I give unconditional love.\\" However, he has also lamented that he \\"didn't see enough of my eldest daughter because I was trying to make a career\\". =Assault charge and lawsuits= In a criminal complaint filed on February 8, 1994, Robert Blank stated that Nicholson, then 56, approached Blank's Mercedes-Benz while he was stopped at a red light in North Hollywood. After accusing the other man of cutting him off in traffic, Nicholson used a golf club to bash the roof and windshield of Blank's car. A witness confirmed Blank's account of the incident, and misdemeanor charges of assault and vandalism were filed against Nicholson. Charges were dropped after Nicholson apologized to Blank, and the two reached an undisclosed settlement, which included a reported $500,000 check from Nicholson. In 1996, a lawsuit was brought against Nicholson for rupturing a woman's breast implants. Later that same year, a second lawsuit was brought against Nicholson alleging that he promised a woman named Catherine Shaheen $1,000 for sex and then assaulted her when she asked for the money.

Warren Beatty also lived nearby, earning the road the nickname \\"Bad Boy Drive\\".

Nicholson stated that it was done out of respect to Brando's legacy, as it had become too expensive to renovate the \\"derelict\\" building which was plagued by mold. Nicholson's friendship with author-journalist Hunter S. Thompson is described in Thompson's autobiography Kingdom of Fear. Following Thompson's death in 2005, Nicholson and fellow actors Johnny Depp, John Cusack, and Sean Penn attended the private memorial service in Colorado.

This monument was the home of wise Swiss Moses Santiago Bertoni (born 1857 Lottigna, Ticino, Switzerland, died 1929 Foz de Iguazu, Paraguay), which eventually settled in this area while still young, and provided invaluable services to the people and Paraguayan Government. He became Minister of Agriculture, of Paraguay. He died at this site in 1929.  His house  Bertoni\`s house It is home to the history and life of a Swiss man who investigated and learned about the culture of the Guaran√≠ probably more than any other European time. Moses Bertoni was a real idealist and passionate botanist who established his family in the jungles of Paraguay in 1894 to implement their ideals anarchists from Europe. Bertoni\`s laboratory He ended up falling in love with the Guaran√≠ culture, their beliefs and people who knew. Probably his most significant contribution was his passion to promote and protect the Guaran√≠ culture and its people unknowingly today has left a legacy of great influence in the cultural identity in Paraguay. His house was also his laboratory, library and printing, where he printed his scientific papers (most of them never became public in the scientific community). All the forms that were issued in this place had the logo 'Ex silvis' (from the jungle). The timing of rain and predictions were used by Paraguayan, Brazilian and Argentine farmers for decades after his death. He was a meticulous observer of nature and the Guaran√≠, who lived with him in his colony, classifying and studying thousands of plants and was able to learn from them many uses of medicinal herbs. In the ten halls of the museum personal objects, manuscripts, books, letters, part of the library seven thousand volumes and a reconstitution of the laboratory and the graphical Bertoni can be observed. The ensemble is considered by specialists of important historical reference in the sciences to which Bertoni and his sons devoted decades of study.  The monument Paran√° River view from Bertoni\`s house The monument consists of 199 hectares, legally protected since 1955. This site normally inhabited the park rangers who look after the place and a community of indigenous Mbya. One thing unusual is that the cemetery of the family Bertoni descendants is a few meters from the house. Because it was a prolific family, after the death of sage, several descendants were buried there, until it was banned. Animals and Plants In this area can be seen legacies of wise Bertoni in botany, zoology, meteorology, anthropology and other sciences. Here we guard a small area of the Atlantic forest of the Paran√° River, with species such as palm (Euterpe edulis), Kuri'u (araucaria angustifolia), fern tree, Jacu√≠-APETI (bored jacutinga), the woodpecker (Dryocopus galeatus), among others, which are endangered and some emerging water and waterfalls. There are also essays, agroforestry experimental investigations, it is estimated that about 60% of plant species were introduced by Moises Bertoni. Many of these species only exist in this place, because they are alien species that were introduced by the wise, product of his exchange with experts from other latitudes, which was communicated through letters.  Location  The area is bounded by natural boundaries: in the north by the river Monday, in the east by the Paran√° River, south across the stream It√° Coty, and west along the route which connects with Presidente Franco Los Cedrales.  How to get there  It is a 26 km from Ciudad del Este, taking the superhighway south. 10 km is reached the city of Presidente Franco, take the road to Los Cedrales other 10 km there is a poster indicator, and enters into left (towards the river Parana) about 5 km and 15 km latter are dirt roads. Access is not good, but with a little patience can be done in light vehicles.  Tourism  The Puerto Bertoni, as called Paraguayans, is a tourist site of unique beauty, due to its strategic location on the banks of the Paran√° River, where this winding river that still runs squeezed, makes a shift of 70 degrees . Currently, tourism is operated by Brazilian and Argentine companies, which include within its circuit cataracts and the three borders, a ride in boats, and arrive daily until this place by the river. On the beach, the indigenous mbya, at dusk make their tribal dance and then offer visitors, handicrafts made by them. Later visitors climb up the house (about 600 mts.) to visit the museum and enjoy their journeys. Ecology It has an ecological value as representing the native ecosystem, a unique place, where they are housed research work, the wise Swiss Moises Santiago Bertoni, who lived in Paraguay, the Paraguayan rich flora, this museum was restored recently. The aim is to protect one of the last wild areas of Alto Paran√°, and also the conservation of natural resources, especially forests.

Geisha will usually take engagements for part or the whole of an evening referred to as ‚Äì a term that combines the name for a banqueting room, () and the honorific suffix , changing the meaning to a term exclusively referring to the engagements a geisha takes. History=Origins= In the early stages of Japanese history, (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families had been displaced by war. Some of these girls offered sexual services for money while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings. After the imperial court moved the capital to (Kyoto) in 794, aspects of now-traditional Japanese art forms and aesthetic ideals began to develop, which would later contribute to the conditions under which the geisha profession emerged. Skilled female performers, such as dancers, thrived under the Imperial court, creating the traditions of female dance and performance that would later lead to both the development of geisha and kabuki actors. During the Heian period, ideals surrounding relationships with women, sexual or otherwise, did not emphasise fidelity, with marriage within the Heian court considered a relatively casual arrangement. Men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives, with the ideal wife instead being a modest mother who managed the affairs of the house, following Confucian customs wherein love had secondary importance to the other roles a wife fulfilled within the marriage. As such, courtesans ‚Äì who provided not only sexual enjoyment, but also romantic attachment and artistic entertainment ‚Äì were seen as both an outlet for men, and common companions. Though geisha would not develop until the 1800s, the use and status of courtesans as artistic and romantic entertainers was a tradition that geisha would later come to employ, with the development of courtesan artforms leading the way for geisha to later develop. Walled-in pleasure quarters known as were built in the 16th century,, with the shogunate designating prostitution illegal to practice outside of these \\"pleasure quarters\\" in 1617. Within the pleasure quarters, (lit., \\"woman of pleasure\\") ‚Äì a term used to refer to prostitutes as a whole ‚Äì were classified and licensed, the upper echelons of which were referred to as , a category with its own internal ranks, the highest of which being the . Though the lower ranks of did not provide as much artistic entertainment than they did sexual, , whilst still prostitutes, also included the traditional arts as a key aspect of their entertainment, their practice of which differed considerably from those of geisha. As were considered to be low-ranking members of the nobility, the instruments they played and the songs they sung were often confined to those considered \\"respectable\\" enough for the upper classes. This typically meant that song long, traditional ballads ( ‚Äì lit., \\"long songs\\"), and played instruments such as the (a type of bowed ) and the (a thirteen-stringed harp). However, some also performed theatrical plays, dances and skits; one such person was , whose theatrical performances on the dry riverbed of the River are considered to be the beginnings of kabuki theatre. =18th-century emergence of the geisha= scroll depicting a geisha, from between 1800 and 1833 print by of a Kyoto geisha Following their inception by the shogunate in the 17th century, the pleasure quarters quickly became popular entertainment centres that developed their own additional forms of entertainment outside of sex. The highly accomplished courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing, and playing music. Some were renowned poets and calligraphers as well; the development of the cultural arts of the pleasure quarters led to the rise in being considered to be the celebrities of their day. Around the turn of the 18th century, the first geisha performing for guests of the pleasure quarters in general appeared; these geisha, who were something of travelling entertainers going from party to party, were men, who would entertain the customers of courtesans through song and dance. At the same time, the forerunners of female geisha, the teenage (\\"dancing girls\\"), developed, trained and hired as chaste dancers-for-hire within these pleasure quarters. In the 1680s, had become popular entertainers and were often paid to perform in the private homes of upper-class samurai; by the early 18th century, many of these had also begun offering sexual services as well as chaste performances. Performers who were no longer teenagers (and could no longer style themselves ) adopted other titles in order to continue working ‚Äì with one being \\"geisha\\", after the male entertainers of the time. The first woman known to have called herself \\"geisha\\" was a prostitute, roughly around 1750, who had become a skilled singer and player. The geisha, who took the name of , became an immediate success, bringing greater popularity to the idea of female geisha.Gallagher (2003), p. 252. Appendix II a timeline of geisha and related history; Gallagher says that \\"Kiku\\" from Fukugawa district founded the profession in 1750, and that by 1753 one hundred odoriko were consigned to Yoshiwara, which licensed (female) Geisha in 1761. As female geisha became greatly more widespread in the following two decades, many began to work as entertainers only, rather than offering sexual services as well; these performers often worked in the same establishments as male geisha.Seigle (1993), pp. 172‚Äì174. =Geisha in the 19th century to present day= Tokyo geisha with , circa 1870s By 1800, the profession of geisha was understood to be almost-entirely female, and was established as a distinct role in its own right; however, geisha were, throughout various points within the Edo period, unable to work outside of the pleasure quarters, being affected by reforms aimed at either limiting or shutting down the pleasure quarters. These reforms were often inconsistent, and were repealed at various times. Once established as an independent profession, a number of edicts were then introduced in order to protect the business of courtesans and separate the two professions. Geisha were firstly forbidden from selling sex, though many continued to do so; if a courtesan accused a geisha of stealing her customers and business of sex and entertainment, an official investigation was opened, with the potential for a geisha to lose her right to practice the profession. Geisha were also forbidden from wearing particularly flashy hairpins or kimono, both of which were hallmarks of the lower-upper-class courtesan. Despite their official status as lower-class entertainers, geisha continued to grow in popularity. While courtesans existed to meet the needs of upper-class men (who could not respectably be seen to visit a lower-class prostitute) and prostitutes existed to meet the sexual needs of lower-class men, this left a gap of skilled and refined entertainers for the emerging merchant classes, who, though wealthy, were unable to access courtesans due to their social class. The status of courtesans as celebrities and arbiters of fashion had also waned considerably; the art forms they practiced had become stiffly-cherished relics of the upper classes, as had their manner of speech and their increasingly gaudy appearance. In contrast, (lit., \\"town geisha\\") had begun to successfully establish themselves as worldly, cutting-edge entertainers, more artistically daring than their cloistered, indentured cousins, and able to come and go and dress as they pleased. This popularity was then increased by the introduction of various laws intended to clamp down on and regulate the lower classes ‚Äì in particular, the emerging merchant classes who had established themselves as the premiere patrons of geisha. Both had, over time, come to hold much of the purchasing power within Japan, with their status as lower class allowing them a degree of freedom in their tastes of dress and entertainment, in contrast to upper class families who had little choice but to appear in a manner deemed respectable to their status. As the tastes of the merchant classes for kabuki and geisha became widely popular, laws introduced to effectively neuter the appearances and tastes of geisha and their customers were passed. This, however, had the adverse effect of leading to the rise in popularity of more refined and subversive aesthetical senses within those classes, further alienating courtesans and their patrons from popularity and contemporary taste; the introduction of laws on dress only furthered the popularity of geisha as refined and fashionable companions for men. As a result, over time, courtesans of both higher and lower ranks began to fall out of fashion, seen as gaudy and old-fashioned. By the 1830s, geisha were considered to be the premiere fashion and style icons in Japanese society, and were emulated by women of the time. Many fashion trends started by geisha soon became widely popular, with some continuing to this day; the wearing of by women, for example, was first started by geisha from the Tokyo of in the early 1800s. There were considered to be many classifications and ranks of geisha, though some were colloquial or closer to a tongue-in-cheek nicknames than an official ranking. Some geisha would sleep with their customers, whereas others would not, leading to distinctions such as geisha ‚Äì a geisha who slept with customers as well as entertaining them through performing arts ‚Äì (\\"prostitute\\") and (\\"whore\\") geisha, whose only entertainment for male customers was sex, and geisha, who did not, officially and in reality, sleep with customers at all. By the end of the 19th century, courtesans no longer held the celebrity status they once did. This trend would continue until the criminalization of prostitution in Japan in 1956. Pre-war and wartime geisha World War II brought lasting change to the geisha profession; before the war, geisha numbers, despite seeing competition from (caf√© girls, the pre-cursor to the bar hostess profession in Japan), had been as high as 80,000, however, following the closure of all geisha districts in 1944, mostly all geisha had been conscripted into the war effort proper, with many finding work in factories or elsewhere through customers and patrons. Though geisha returned to the relatively quickly post-war, many had decided to stay on in their wartime jobs, considering it to be a more stable form of employment than their employment in the had been. Both during and after the war, the geisha name lost some status, as some prostitutes began referring to themselves as \\"geisha girls\\" to members of the American military occupying Japan. Post- war geisha In 1945, the saw restrictions on its practices lifted with teahouses, bars, and geisha houses () allowed to open again. Though many geisha did not return to the post-war, it was evident that working as a geisha was still considered to be a lucrative and viable career, with numbers increasing quickly. The vast majority of geisha post-war were aged 20‚Äì24, as many retired in their mid-twenties after finding a patron ‚Äì a trend carried over from the pre-war : > 'I showed the mother of the [, in 1975] some statistics on the age > distribution of the geisha population in the 1920s. She remarked on the big > dip in figures when women reached the age of twenty-five. \\"In those days, > when you found yourself a patron you could stop working. If you were lucky > you would be set up in your own apartment and have a life of leisure, taking > lessons when you wanted to for your own enjoyment ... I think it's pretty > unusual nowadays for a geisha to stop working when she gets a patron.\\"' The status of geisha in Japanese society also changed drastically post-war. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, much discussion had taken place surrounding the status of geisha in a rapidly-Westernising Japanese society. Some geisha had begun to experiment with wearing Western clothing to engagements, learning Western-style dancing, and serving cocktails to customers instead of sake. The image of a \\"modern\\" pre-war geisha had been viewed by some as unprofessional and a betrayal of the profession's image, but as a necessary change and an obvious evolution by others. However, the incumbent pressures of the war rapidly turned the tide against Westernisation, leading to an effective abandonment of the \\"Western-style\\" geisha experiments. Post-war, geisha unanimously returned to wearing kimono and practicing the traditional arts, abandoning all experimental geisha styles. This, however, led to the final blow for the profession's reputation as fashionable in wider society; though the geisha did not experience the rapid decline and eventual death that courtesans had experienced in the previous century, they were instead rendered as \\"protectors of tradition\\" in favour of preserving the image geisha had cultivated over time. Nonetheless, in the decades after the war, the profession's practices still underwent some changes. Following the introduction of the Prostitution Prevention Law in 1956, geisha benefited from the official criminalisation of practices such as , a practice that had at times been undertaken coercively or through force by some in mostly pre-war Japan. Despite this, the misconception of geisha being on some level prostitutes and of being a common practice continues, inaccurately, to this day.Gallagher (2003), p. 135. > After Japan lost the war, geisha dispersed and the profession was in > shambles.

In > modern Japan, girls are not sold into indentured service. Nowadays, a > geisha's sex life is her private affair. From the 1930s onwards, the rise of the bar hostess began to overshadow geisha as the premiere profession of entertainment at parties and outings for men. In 1959, the Standard-Examiner reported the plight of geisha in an article written for the magazine by Japanese businessman . stated that girls now \\"prefer[red] to become dancers, models, and cabaret and bar hostesses rather than start [the] training in music and dancing at the age of seven or eight\\" necessary to become geisha at the time. Compulsory education laws passed in the 1960s effectively shortened the period of training for geisha apprentices, as girls could no longer be taken on at a young age to be trained throughout their teenage years. This led to a decline in women entering the profession, as most required a recruit to be at least somewhat competent and trained in the arts she would later go on to use as a geisha; by about 1975, mothers in Kyoto began accepting both recruits from different areas of Japan in larger numbers, and recruits with little to no previous experience in the traditional arts. Before this point, the number of in had dropped from 80 to just 30 between 1965‚Äì1975. By 1975, the average age of a geisha in the district of Kyoto was roughly 39, with the vast majority being aged 35‚Äì49. The population of geisha at this time was also surprisingly high, roughly equivalent to the numbers of young women within the profession; geisha no longer retired young when they found a patron, and were less likely than other women of the same age to have both children and an extended family to support them. In 1989, it was reported in the New York Times that there were an estimated 600-700 geisha left throughout the whole of Japan. Present day geisha Entrance to , one of the most famous tea houses where geisha entertain in Modern geisha still live in , particularly during their apprenticeship, and are legally required to be registered to one, though they may not live there everyday. Many experienced geisha are successful enough to choose to live independently, though living independently is more common in some geisha districts ‚Äì such as those in Tokyo ‚Äì than others. Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at tea houses or traditional Japanese restaurants (). The charge for a geisha's time, previously determined by the time it took to burn one incense stick (known as (lit., \\"incense stick fee\\") or (lit., \\"jewel fee\\")), was modernised during the 19th century to a flat fee charged per hour. In Kyoto, the terms and (both meaning \\"flower fees\\") are used instead as part of the Kyoto dialect. However, appointments and arrangements are still made by the mother of the house () through the official registry office (), which keeps a record of both the appointments taken by a geisha and her schedule. In modern Japan, geisha and their apprentices are a rarer sight outside of the or ; most sightings of geisha and in and around cities such as Kyoto are actually tourists who pay a fee to be dressed up as either a or geisha for the day, a practice known as . Over time the number of geisha has declined, despite the efforts of those within the profession. Factors include the nature of the economy, declining interest in the traditional arts, the exclusive and closed-off nature of the , and the expense of being entertained by geisha. The number of and geisha in Kyoto fell from 76 and 548 in 1965 respectively to just 71 and 202 in 2006 as a result. However, following the advent of wider accessibility to the internet from the mid-2000s onwards, a greater number of recruits have decided to join the profession with no existing ties to the through watching online documentaries and reading websites set up by to promote their business; documentary pieces commonly inspire young women to join the profession, such as the geisha , who later became the most popular geisha in for a seven-year period: > [Geisha] first took an interest in the [lit., \\"five geisha districts\\" ‚Äì name > for geisha quarters in Kyoto] while a middle school student in Osaka, at > around the age of 14, after seeing a documentary about a 's training. ‚ÄúI > already had heard of , but it was when I saw the documentary that I thought > ‚Äì I want to do that.‚Äù In recent years, a growing number of geisha have complained to the authorities about being pursued and harassed by groups of tourists keen to take their photograph when out walking. As a result, tourists in Kyoto have been warned not to harass geisha on the streets, with local residents of the city and businesses in the areas surrounding the of Kyoto launching patrols throughout in order to prevent tourists from harassing geisha. Geisha districts Geisha work in districts known as ‚Äì lit. \\"flower towns\\", and are said to inhabit the ‚Äì \\"the flower and willow world\\", a term originating from a time when both courtesans and geisha worked within the same areas. Courtesans were said to be the \\"flowers\\" in this moniker due to their showy and beautiful nature, with geisha being the \\"willows\\" due to their understated nature. Part of the comparison between geisha and willows comes from the perceived loyalty amongst geisha to their patrons ‚Äì over time, it became known that certain factions, such as certain political parties, would patronise some geisha districts with their rivals patronising others. Though courtesans (and by extension, prostitutes) were humourously known for having loyalty only to the customer paying them for the night, a geisha would stand by her patrons and defend their best interests, her loyalty to her patrons being perceived as higher than her loyalty to her money. Historically, geisha on occasion were confined to operate in the same walled districts as courtesans and prostitutes; however, both professions have on some level always maintained a distance officially, despite often being legislated against by the same laws. =Tokyo= The six in Tokyo are ÊµÖËçâ, Ëµ§ÂùÇ, Á•ûÊ•ΩÂùÇ, Êñ∞Ê©ã, ÂêëÂ≥∂, and (Êó•Êú¨Ê©ã)Ëä≥Áî∫. Within the Tokyo prefecture but outside of the city's 23 wards, the city of Hachi√¥ji has its own geisha culture heritage. =Kyoto= The in Kyoto are known for their adherence to tradition and high prestige, with the image of a Kyoto typifying that of geisha culture within wider Japanese and international society. In Kyoto, the different ‚Äì known as the (lit., \\"five hanamachi\\") ‚Äì are seen as unofficially ranked. , and are seen as the most prestigious,Dalby (2000), p. 19. with at the top; below these three are and .Dalby (2008), pp. 6, 19, 82. The more prestigious are frequented by powerful businessmen and politicians. In the 1970s, the geisha districts in Kyoto were known as the (lit., \\"six hanamachi\\"), as the district of was still officially active as a geisha district, as well as hosting reenactors; however, no geisha are active in in the 21st century, despite modern continuing to work there. =Regional = Though regional are typically not large enough to have a hierarchy, regional geisha districts are seen as having less prestige than those in Kyoto, viewed as being the pinnacle of tradition in the . Geisha in towns such as may also be seen as less prestigious, as geisha working in these towns are typically hired to work in one hotel for travelling customers they are usually not familiar with before entertaining; nevertheless, all geisha, regardless of region or district, are trained in the traditional arts, making the distinction of prestige one of history and tradition. Stages of training Kyoto with her , and a from the Before the twentieth century, geisha began their training at a young age, around the age of 6. In the present day this is no longer the case, and geisha usually debut as around the age of 17 or 18. Labour laws stipulate that that apprentices only join an aged 18, although in Kyoto are legally allowed to take on recruits at a younger age, 15‚Äì17.\\"World's oldest geisha...\\" (2007). \\"Girls in the past could become apprentice geishas from the age of 13, but it is now illegal to become an apprentice before 18 except in Kyoto where a girl can be an apprentice at 15.\\" Now, girls must graduate from middle school and then make the personal decision to train to become a geisha. Young women who wish to become geisha now most often begin their training after high school or even college. Many more women begin their careers in adulthood. Before debuting as a , apprentices may live at the as ‚Äì essentially a trainee, learning all the necessary skills to become a , as well as attending to the needs of the house and learning to live with her geisha sisters and within the . By watching other geisha and learning from the mother of the house (known as the ‚Äì lit., \\"mother\\"), apprentices learn how to speak with guests, the mannerisms necessary to be a geisha, and the traditions of the . Apprentices also learn how to comfortably wear kimono. Traditionally the stage of training lasted for years, and some girls were bonded to geisha houses as children. Daughters of geisha were often brought up as geisha themselves, usually as the successor (, meaning \\"heir\\" or \\"heiress\\") or daughter-role () to the . Successors, however, were not always blood relations. Nowadays, a girl is often a for up to a year. A is an apprentice and is therefore bonded under a contract to her . The will usually supply her with food, board, kimono, , and other tools of her trade, but a may decide to fund everything herself from the beginning with either a loan or the help of an outside guarantor. A 's training is very expensive, and debts must be repaid over time with her earnings to either the or her guarantor. This repayment may continue after graduation to geishahood, and only when her debts are settled can a geisha claim her entire wages and work independently (if loaning from the ). After this point she may chose to stay on living at her , must still be affiliated to one to work, and even living away from the , will usually commute there to begin her working evening. A will start her formal training on the job as a (learning by observation) at an (a geisha party), where she will sit and observe as the other and geisha interact with customers. In this way, a trainee gains insights into the nature of the job, following the typical nature of traditional arts apprenticeships in Japan, wherein an apprentice is expected to learn almost entirely through observation. Although geisha at the stage of training will attend parties, they will not participate on an involved level and are instead expected to sit quietly. Trainees can be hired for parties, but are usually uninvited ‚Äì though welcomed ‚Äì guests, brought along by their symbolic older sister as a way of introducing a new trainee to patrons of the . usually charge just a third of the fee a typical geisha would charge, and typically work within just one particular tea house, known as the ‚Äì learning from the \\"mother\\" (proprietress) of the house. The stage of training involves learning techniques of conversation, typical party games, and proper decorum and behaviour at banquets and parties. This stage lasts only about a month or so. and performing the . After the period, a trainee will make her official debut () and become a . This stage can last between 3 and 5 years. During this time, they learn from both other trainees senior to them, and their geisha mentors, with special emphasis placed on learning from her symbolic \\"older sister\\" (). Though any or geisha \\"senior\\" in rank to an apprentice may be called \\"older sister\\", an apprentice's official \\"older sister\\" is a geisha bonded to her in an official ceremony, who will thereafter typically teach her about working in the . This involves learning how to serve drinks, hold casual conversation, and some training in the arts, though the latter is usually carried out through by dance and music teachers. Senior wearing , two weeks before her . There are three major elements of a 's training. The first is the formal arts training, which takes place in schools found in every . They study traditional instruments: the , the flute, and drums, as well as learn games, traditional songs, calligraphy, Japanese traditional dances (in the style), tea ceremony, literature, and poetry. The second element is the entertainment training which a trainee learns at various tea houses and parties by observing her \\"older sister\\". The third is the social skill of navigating the complex social web of the ; formal greetings, gifts, and visits are key parts of the social structure of the , and crucial for the support network necessary to support a trainee's eventual debut as a geisha. Around the age of 20‚Äì21, a will graduate to geisha status in a ceremony known as (turning of the collar)., page 184 Gallagher (2003), p. 159. Following debut, geisha typically do not go through major role changes, as there are no more formal stages of training. However, geisha can and do work into their eighties and nineties, and are still expected to train regularly, though lessons may only be put on a few times a month. A geisha may decide to retire from her work, either to move away from the , take on the role of \\"mother\\" of an , or to mainly focus on performances and teaching other younger geisha. Women in geisha society Women in geisha society are recognised as some of the most successful businesswomen in Japan, with almost the entirety of the being owned and run by women. New geisha are trained for the most part by their symbolic mothers and older sisters, and engagements are arranged through the mother of the house. Infrequently, men take contingent positions such as hair stylists, dressers (known as , as dressing a requires considerable strength) and accountants. The heads () of some dance and music schools that geisha train under, however, may be male, with some barrier to entry for women to achieve the legacy of being the head of an artistic school. Historically, the majority of women within Japan were wives who could not work due to familial duties. A geisha, however, could achieve independence by working to pay off her debts, making the profession one method for women to support themselves without becoming a wife.Iwasaki (2002). Moreover, a geisha chosen as the heir () of a geisha house would have stable employment for much of her life, running the throughout her career until the next generation. Over time, some Japanese feminists have seen geisha as exploited women, but some modern geisha see themselves as liberated feminists: \\"We find our own way, without doing family responsibilities. Isn't that what feminists are?\\" =Geisha and male guests= A geisha entertaining a foreign guest Historically, geisha held an appeal for mainly male guests as a woman outside of the role of \\"wife\\". Wives were modest, responsible, and at times sombre, whereas geisha could be playful and carefree. Geisha would, on occasion, marry their clients, but marriage required retirement as a matter of fact. Though relatively uncommon in previous decades, geisha parties are no longer understood to be affairs for male guests exclusively, with women commonly attending parties alongside other male guests. Though geisha will still gracefully flirt and entertain male guests, this is understood to be a part of a geisha's hostessing and entertainment skills, and is not taken as a serious sign of personal interest. =Geisha and relationships= Despite long-held connotations between sex and geisha, a geisha's sex and love life is usually distinct from her professional life. Most geisha are single women, though they may have lovers or boyfriends over time, and are allowed to pursue these relationships outside of having a patron. In the present day, some geisha are married and continue to work in their capacity as geisha, despite it being uncommon; these geisha are likely to be based in regions outside of Kyoto, as its ultra-traditionalist geisha districts would be unlikely to allow a married geisha to work. =Geisha and prostitution= Geisha have historically been conflated with prostitution and commonly confused with prostitutes, despite the profession being mostly forbidden from receiving payment for sex since its inception. Despite this, some geisha have historically engaged in prostitution, either through personal choice, or through coercion and at times force. In 1872, shortly after the Meiji Restoration, the new government passed a law liberating \\"prostitutes () and geisha ()\\", ambiguously grouping both professions together. The terms of the law caused controversy, due to the unclear differentiation between each profession, with some officials claiming that prostitutes and geisha worked different ends of the same profession, and that there would be little difference in calling all prostitutes \\"geisha\\". Nonetheless, the government maintained an official distinction between both professions, arguing that geisha should not be conflated with or confused for prostitutes. Though the law officially maintained a distance between geisha and prostitutes, some geisha still engaged in prostitution. Writing in 1956, former geisha wrote of her experiences in the town of , where she was sold for her virginity a number of times by the mother of her . Such practices could be common in less reputable geisha districts, with towns in particular being known for their so- called \\"double registered\\" geisha (a term for an entertainer registered as both a geisha and a prostitute). A geisha working to pay off her incumbent debts to the mother of the house often had little choice but to engage in prostitution, whether forced to by her occupational \\"mother\\", or coerced to do it in order to pay off her debts. In 1956, and following its implementation in 1958, the Prostitution Prevention Law criminalised the vast majority of prostitution, essentially leading to the outlawing of practices such as for geisha. In the present day, does not exist, and apprentices mark their graduation to geisha status with a series of ceremonies and events. Despite this, the modern conflation between geisha and prostitutes continues as a pervasive idea, particularly in Western culture. Sheridan Prasso wrote that Americans had \\"an incorrect impression of the real geisha world ... geisha means 'arts person' trained in music and dance, not in the art of sexual pleasure\\".Prasso (2006), p. 52 in electronic binding (ISBN 978-0-78673-632-4). Similarly, K.G. Henshall stated that the job of a geisha included \\"[entertaining] their customer, be it by dancing, reciting verse, playing musical instruments, or engaging in light conversation. Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful innuendos; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected. In a social style that is common in Japan, men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be.\\" = partnership= In the past, it had been unspoken tradition for an established geisha to take a , or patron, who would pay for her expenses, buy her gifts, and engage her on a more personal level ‚Äì at times involving sex ‚Äì than a banquet or party would allow. This would be seen as a sign of the man's generosity, wealth and status, as the expenses associated with being a geisha were relatively high; as such, a was typically a wealthy man, sometimes married, who may have been financially supporting the geisha in question through company expenses. In the present day, it is less common for a geisha to take a , purely due to the expenses involved and the unlikelihood that a modern man could support both his household and the cost of a geisha's living. Nonetheless, it was still common for geisha to retire from the profession in their mid-twenties to live off the support of their patron following the Second World War. The practice continues today, though geisha do not take anywhere as commonly, and though intimacy in a partnership was in previous decades not seen as essential, in modern times it is valued to a much greater degree, due to the formal nature of the commitment and the awareness by both parties of how expensive it can be. The taking of a patron by a geisha is the closest thing to paid compensation for a personal partnership ‚Äì whatever that partnership might entail ‚Äì that a geisha officially engages in today. =\\"Geisha (Gee-sha) girls\\"= During the Allied occupation of Japan, some prostitutes, almost exclusively working for the occupying forces in Japan, began to advertise themselves as \\"geisha girls\\", due in part to the fact that many foreign soldiers could not tell the difference between a geisha and a woman dressed in a kimono. These women came to be known commonly as \\"geesha girls\\", a misnomer originating from the language barrier between the armed forces and the prostitutes themselves; the term spread quickly, as evidenced by the fact that shortly after their arrival in 1945, it was said that some occupying American GIs congregated in and shouted \\"We want geesha girls!\\". The English term \\"geisha girl\\" soon became a byword for any female Japanese prostitute, whether actually selling sex or not; the term was applied to bar hostesses (who occupy the role of entertaining men through conversation, not necessarily sex) and streetwalkers alike.Prasso (2006), p. 206 in hardcover binding (ISBN 978-1-58648-214-5). The term \\"geisha girls\\", its quick spread to Western culture, and the accompanying mental image of a woman in a kimono offering sex and entertainment, is largely speculated as responsible for the continuing misconception in the West that all geisha are engaged in prostitution.  ‚Äì lit., \\"raising the waters\\" ‚Äì was a ceremony undergone by junior and some as part of the process of promotion to senior status. Originally meaning the unloading of a ship's cargo of fish, over time, the term became an innuendo for money earned in the , another name for the entertainment business being the ‚Äì literally, \\"the water business\\". Alongside changes in appearance ‚Äì such as from the junior hairstyle to the more senior style, ‚Äì and visits paid to businesses and places of importance around the , an apprentice would occasionally have their virginity sold to a patron, who ostensibly supported their graduation to geisha status ‚Äì usually through the exorbitant fee charged for the privilege. Unscrupulous owners would not uncommonly sell an apprentice's virginity more than once to different customers, pocketing the entire fee for themselves with the apprentice herself remaining an apprentice. During WW2, some prostitutes would use this term to refer to their acts with customers, leading to some confusion ‚Äì particularly when referring to themselves as \\"geisha\\" when in the company of foreign soldiers, and sometimes amongst Japanese customers. Post-1956, prostitution was criminalised in Japan, and is no longer practiced within the .Dalby (2000), p. 115. Non-Japanese geisha Since the 1970s, non-Japanese have also become geisha. Liza Dalby, an American national, worked briefly with geisha in the district of Kyoto as part of her doctorate research, although she did not formally debut as a geisha herself.Dalby (2000), pp. 106‚Äì109. Some foreign nationals who have completed training and worked as geisha in Japan include: * ‚Äì (Isabella), a Romanian national who worked in the district of .

In February 2011, she left the Geisha Association, and is currently working as a geisha in the district. Public performances While traditionally geisha led a cloistered existence, in recent years they have become more publicly visible, and entertainment is available without requiring the traditional introduction and connections. The most visible form of this are public dances, or (generally written in traditional kana spelling as , rather than modern ), featuring both and geisha. All the Kyoto hold these annually (mostly in spring, with one exclusively in autumn), dating to the Kyoto exhibition of 1872, and there are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around 1500 yen to 4500 yen ‚Äì top-price tickets also include an optional tea ceremony (tea and served by ) before the performance. Other also hold public dances, including some in Tokyo, but have fewer performances. from the district of Kyoto serving tea at , the plum blossom festival, at . At the shrine there is an annual open-air tea ceremony () during the plum-blossom festival () every February 25. During this ceremony, geisha and from the district in northwest Kyoto serve tea to 3,000 guests. , they also serve beer in a beer garden at the Theatre during the summer months. Another geisha beer garden is available at the in the district. These beer gardens also feature traditional dances by the geisha in the evenings. Arts Geisha are skilled artists, trained in and performing music and dance. Geisha and from playing Geisha entertain their guests with a combination of both their hostessing and conversational skills, and their skills in traditional Japanese art forms of dance, music and singing. Before deciding to begin a career as a geisha, new recruits are generally expected to have an interest in the arts, as well as some experience; however, as geisha numbers have fallen throughout the decades, this is no longer a strict prerequisite. Some will take on recruits with no previous experience, with some young geisha, despite having existing experience, expected to begin their lessons from the beginning. The style of dance practiced by geisha today evolved from dance styles used in both and kabuki theatre. Over time, the more exaggerated theatrical styles evolved into the subtle and more stylised form of dancing used today; despite the difference, elements of traditional Japanese dance, such as the use of gestures to tell a story and the symbolism used to represent this, run throughout both as a common feature. These dances are accompanied by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument used by geisha to accompany dance is the , a banjo-like three-stringed instrument played with a plectrum. Originating in China as the , it was introduced to Japan through firstly Korea, and then the Islands in the 1560s, obtaining its current form within a century. The soon became the mainstay instrument of geisha entertainment in the 1750s. It is described as having a distinct and melancholic sound, with traditional music using only minor thirds and sixths in its composition. All geisha must learn to play the , alongside additional instruments that often accompany the , such as the (small shoulder drum) and (flute), during their apprenticeship, as well as learning traditional Japanese dance; however, after graduation to geisha status, geisha are free to choose which art form they wish to pursue primarily. Geisha who pursue musicianship are known as geisha (, lit., \\"ground [seated, when playing instruments and singing] person\\"), whereas geisha who pursue dance are known as geisha (, lit., \\"standing person\\"). Some geisha not only dance and play music, but also write poems, paint pictures, or compose music. Appearance Mature geisha (center) ordinarily wear subdued clothing, makeup, and hair, contrasting with the more colourful clothing, heavy makeup, and elaborate hair of (apprentices; left and right). A geisha's appearance changes symbolically throughout her career, representing her training and seniority. These constitute changes in hairstyle, hair accessories, and kimono style. =Makeup= The in the district. Notice the green pin on the mid-left known as : this identifies her as a of under 18. Both and geisha wear traditional white foundation known as ; this is worn with red and black eye and eyebrow makeup, red lips and light pink blusher. Both and geisha underpaint their lips with a red lipstick known as , but first-year apprentice geisha paint only the lower lip, and wear less black around the eyes and eyebrows than senior . Younger apprentices may also paint their eyebrows slightly shorter or rounder to emphasise a youthful appearance.Prasso (2006). wear noticeably more blush ‚Äì known as ‚Äì than geisha. Young apprentices may have the mother of the house or their \\"older sister\\" mentors help them apply makeup. Geisha wear more black around the eyes and eyebrows than , and older geisha tend only to wear a full face of traditional white makeup during stage performances or on special occasions; older geisha generally stop wearing around the same time they stop wearing to parties. For a short period before becoming a geisha, in some geisha districts colour their teeth black, usually accompanied by wearing the hairstyle and a decorated black formal kimono. Teeth blackening was once a common practice amongst married women in Japan and the imperial court in earlier times, but is now an extremely uncommon practice. =Dress= A senior (left) wearing a long and a geisha (right) wearing an in the style Geisha and always wear kimono while working, and typically wear kimono outside of work. However, the type of kimono varies based on age, occasion, region and season of the year.

During the 17th century, the hairstyle developed, which became the basis for the hairstyles worn by both geisha and . When the profession of geisha first came into existence, dress edicts prevented geisha from wearing the dramatic hairstyles worn by courtesans, leading to the subdued nature of most geisha hairstyles. Following WW2, many of the hairstylists who had previously served the had been lost as war casualties, leading to the redevelopment of hairstyles for geisha and . Geisha, unable to reliably book in with a hairstylist once a week to maintain their hair, began to wear human hair wigs in the style that required restyling far less. The hairstyles of , still utilising the apprentice's own hair, became wider, placed higher upon the head, and shorter in length. There are five different hairstyles that a wears, which mark the different stages of her apprenticeship. The hairstyle with hair ornaments are most closely associated with , who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on special pillows () to preserve the elaborate styling. can develop a bald spot on their crown caused by the stress of wearing these hairstyles almost every day, but in the present day, this is less likely to happen due to the later age at which begin their apprenticeship. in certain districts of Kyoto may also wear additional, differing hairstyles in the run up to graduating as a geisha. In the present day, geisha wear a variety of the known as the ‚Äì a flattened, sleeker version of the worn as a bridal wig in traditional weddings. Though geisha also wear this hairstyle as a wig, it is usually shaped specifically to their face by a wig stylist.

The style and colour of hair accessories worn with some hairstyles can signify the stage of an apprentice's training.

Now hailed as a \\"pioneer of fieldwork\\"Vinigi Grottanelli, et al. \\"Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Development. Current Anthropology 18.4 (1977): 593‚Äì614, p. 595 in Italian ethnology, he was ritually killed by natives in 1902. Early years, Italy Guido Boggiani was born on 20 September 1861 in Omegna (Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola) to Giuseppe Boggiani and Clelia Gen√©. From his father, Giuseppe inherited a passion for the arts, especially painting. When he was 17, and after studying general culture, Boggiani went to the Brera Academy (Milan) to study painting. He was taught by Filippo Carcano, becoming a prominent landscape painter. In 1883 Boggiani exhibited six paintings for the first time in Palazzo delle Belle Arti (Rome). Among these were La raccolta delle castagne (Gathering of Chesnuts) and Scogli di Sant'Anna. Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 62. His painting La raccolta delle castagne was acquired by the National Museum of Modern Art in Rome for about 6,000 pounds, a price considered high at that time.De Gubernatis states the work was sold at the Exhibition. At the 1887 Exhibition in Venice, he displayed Gli ulivi a Francavilla al Mare; Sentiero a Lago Maggiore, Villaggio sul Lago Maggiore, and Ortensie. In 1887, when 26, Boggiani undertook a journey to Argentina to show his paintings. In Buenos Aires he met several Italians who lived in Paraguay, and through the comments made, especially on the areas of Chaco and indigenous peoples, his fascination with Paraguay started. Later years, Paraguay In 1888 Boggiani went to Asunci√≥n intending to trade in cattle and hides, then began his first expedition in the Gran Chaco. With the efforts of Don Juan De Cominges he reached Puerto Casado. Here he made his first contact with the Chamacoco Indians. He returned to Italy in 1893, bringing a collection of artifacts of great anthropological value, and started writing books based on his experiences. In 1896 he returned to Asunci√≥n. This time equipped with a camera, tripod and all the elements for the development of glass plates, he was convinced that photography was the only way to study these peoples living in their little huts. In the end, besides his many books, his photographs (more than 500 were made from 1896 to 1901) earned him and the subjects of his art the interest and admiration of a wider audience; part of his collection was subsequently acquired by the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Boggiani was last seen by urban society on 24 October 1901, along with his assistant F√©lix Gavilan, when he left Asunci√≥n towards the Gran Chaco. In October 1902 Boggiani wrote for the last time to his brother Oliveira, writing of details of the expedition. It wasn't until 1904 that the Italian community of Asunci√≥n organized an expedition, led by the Spanish explorer Jos√© Fernandez Cancio, and on 20 October 1904 found the remains of Boggiani with his skull destroyed. It is supposed that the Chamacoco had split his head to prevent Boggiani and his camera from exerting more harm to their souls; in 1902 the American Anthropologist reported he had been killed \\"presumably at the hands of the Tobas Indians.\\"\\"Guido Boggiani\\", American Anthropologist n.s. 4 (1902): 568 His camera was found buried, and it is assumed many negatives too are buried. The actual remains of Boggiani are in a tomb in the Italian cemetery of Asunci√≥n. Boggiani's work could be saved thanks to the Czech explorer and botanist Alberto Vojtƒõch Friƒç (1882‚Äì1944), who went to Paraguay a few years later and was able to recover all his belongings, thanks to his good relations with the natives. His grandson, Pavel Friƒç, later succeeded in developing all of the photographs, and the collection is reproduced in Guido Boggiani, Photographer (1997). Awards, honors In Italy Boggiani was awarded, among others, the gold medal \\"Monaco di Bavaria.\\" A museum in the town of San Lorenzo (Paraguay) bears his name, the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography Guido Boggiani. A street in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay is also named after him. Bibliography=Works by Boggiani= *Notizie etnografiche sulla trib√π dei Ciamacoco, etc. Atti della Societ√† Romana di Antropologia. vol. 2.

History  The Rio Santiago Shipyard started its activities on June 15 of 1953, by the Decree N¬∞ 10.627 that established the creation of \\"Astilleros y F√°bricas Navales del Estado (AFNE)\\", a company integrated by the \\"Astillero R√≠o Santiago (ARS)\\" and by the \\"F√°brica Naval de Explosivos Azul (FANAZUL)\\", dependent of the Admiralty (Spanish: \\"Ministerio de Marina\\"). When the construction was completed, the Rio Santiago Shipyard had many workshops that produced essential elements. These include a machine shop for bolts and adjustments, furnaces for iron and copper, electronics, and sections for carpentry and paint. It had a sustained growth during its first years. In 1969 it modified its legal status and became a State Anonymous Society. Between 1970 and 1976, the shipyard signed and started the construction of five cargo ships each of 9,000 tons built for the Empresa L√≠neas Mar√≠timas Argentinas (ELMA), two tankers of 60,000 tons each for YPF, two bulk-carriers with 23,700 tons of displacement and four cargo ships with 14,450 tons of displacement, also for ELMA. It constructed diesel motors and cranes for its ships and other shipyards and train motors for Ferrocarriles Argentinos (Argentinian Railroads). It also constructed elements for hydraulic turbines, nuclear components (through a license with Atomic Energy of Canada), and bogies for railroads (through a license with American Steel Foundry). In the mid-1970s it employed approximately 5,500 employees and nearly 3,000 employees hired by distant client companies that directly affected production. This factory, the largest in Latin America, suffered its worst crisis in the 1990s when it almost became private, finally ending up as a part of the Buenos Aires province. = Recently = Shipyard seen from river Santiago, April 2006 After suffering the third change of direction in two years, the Rio Santiago Shipyard is back to work at full capacity for the first time in two decades. The new contracts signed with Venezuela are not the only ones that will revive the naval factory, there are also numerous projects already started, that require the immediate incorporation of 250 new workers. In March 2006, the \\"Madrisa\\" was launched, a cargo ship, technically called bulk carrier, built for a German customer. After that the construction of a new ship with similar characteristics was started and finally began on February 2007, the first of four tanker ships for Venezuela. The shipyard has been given offers to build oil platforms that will require, in case the job is acquired, that it share part of the work with another shipyard that is currently closed. The Corrientes Shipyard is being kept in mind for this job, since it already has experience building offshore platforms for Thailand. Construction of the first block of the \\"Eva Per√≥n\\" started 18 January, one of the two platforms being built for PDVSA.usar√° barcos ‚Äúmade in Argentina‚Äù On September 2010, signed a preliminary agreement with Ukrainian shipyard Chernomorsky Shipbuilding in order to gain experience in the construction of ice class ships Astillero construir√° buque de la Armada In November 2015 it was announced that the ARS shipyard will build 2 small ships for the Argentine Navy, the first ones after 32 years. The design, named LICA ( Lancha de Instrucci√≥n de Cadetes de la Armada) was developed by the shipyard's engineering team. It was expected that construction will start in early 2016. In August 2018, the company suffered multiple dismissals and, faced with the possible closure of the R√≠o Santiago Shipyard plant, the workers mobilized in the city of La Plata to defend their jobs.

The archaeological site is located in Tin√∫m Municipality, Yucat√°n State, Mexico.Gobierno del Estado de Yucat√°n 2007. Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600‚Äì900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800‚Äì900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900‚Äì1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site. The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucat√°n.Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, \\"Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization\\". Regarding ongoing conflicts over the ownership of Chichen Itza, see Casta√±eda (2005). Regarding purchase, see \\"Yucat√°n: paga gobierno 220 mdp por terrenos de Chich√©n Itz√°,\\" La Jornada, 30 March 2010, retrieved 30 March 2010 from jornada.unam.mx Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.  Name and orthography  A feathered serpent sculpture at the base of one of the stairways of Kukulc√°n (El Castillo) The Maya name \\"Chichen Itza\\" means \\"At the mouth of the well of the Itza.\\" This derives from chi', meaning \\"mouth\\" or \\"edge\\", and ch ºen or ch ºe ºen, meaning \\"well\\". Itz√° is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is \\"enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,\\" from its, \\"sorcerer\\", and ha, \\"water\\". The name is spelled Chich√©n Itz√° in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chich ºen Itza º (pronounced ). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between ch º and ch, since the base word ch ºe ºen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. The word \\"Itza º\\" has a high tone on the \\"a\\" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe). Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucat√°n. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal (\\"Seven Great House\\"), Uuc Hab Nal (\\"Seven Bushy Places\\"), Uucyabnal (\\"Seven Great Rulers\\") or Uc Abnal (\\"Seven Lines of Abnal\\").Uuc Yabnal becomes Uc Abnal, meaning the \\"Seven Abnals\\" or \\"Seven Lines of Abnal\\" where Abnal is a family name, according to Ralph L. Roys (). This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins. Location Aerial view of a small portion of Chichen Itza Chichen Itza is located in the eastern portion of Yucat√°n state in Mexico. The northern Yucat√°n Peninsula is karst, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called cenotes, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the \\"Cenote Sagrado\\" or Sacred Cenote (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous. In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under Kukulkan, which has never been seen by archaeologists. According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery and incense, as well as human remains. A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice. Political organization Columns in the Temple of a Thousand Warriors Several archaeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a \\"multepal\\" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages.; This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the \\"multepal\\" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period southern lowlands in Mexico. Economy Chichen Itza was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America. Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucat√°n. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port. History The Grand Ballcourt structures The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucat√°n to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998. =Establishment= The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built. = Ascendancy = Chichen Itza rose to regional prominence toward the end of the Early Classic period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, toward the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands. As Chichen Itza rose to prominence, the cities of Yaxuna (to the south) and Coba (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities. = Decline = According to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, ruler of Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension. While there is some archaeological evidence that indicates Chich√©n Itz√° was at one time looted and sacked, there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chich√©n Itz√° was an active urban center. Archaeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1100, before the rise of Mayapan. Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum. After Chich√©n Itz√° elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there. According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the Cenote Sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage.; =Spanish conquest= In 1526 Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cort√©s expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucat√°n. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at Xaman Ha º, south of what is today Canc√∫n. Montejo returned to Yucat√°n in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at Campeche on the west coast. He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucat√°n Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chich√©n Itz√° and establish a capital. Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chich√©n Itz√° in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Montejo eventually returned to Yucat√°n and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula. The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch. =Modern history= A photograph of Chichen Itza in 1859‚Äì1860 by D√©sir√© Charnay, before vegetation was removed Chichen Itza entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens (with illustrations by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucat√°n and his tour of Maya cities, including Chich√©n Itz√°. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, D√©sir√© Charnay surveyed Chich√©n Itz√° and took numerous photographs that he published in Cit√©s et ruines am√©ricaines (1863). Visitors to Chich√©n Itz√° during the 1870s and 1880s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings.Cobos, Rafael. \\"Chich√©n Itz√°.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. In 1875, Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife Alice Dixon Le Plongeon visited Chich√©n, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it \\"Chaacmol\\" (later renamed \\"Chac Mool\\", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). Teobert Maler and Alfred Maudslay explored Chich√©n in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, Biologia Centrali-Americana. The Kukulc√°n Temple, photograph by Teobert Maler, 1892 In 1894 the United States Consul to Yucat√°n, Edward Herbert Thompson, purchased the Hacienda Chich√©n, which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. In 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archaeologist Sylvanus G. Morley and committed to conduct long-term archaeological research at Chichen Itza. The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade. In 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archaeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza.; Weeks and Hill 2006, p.111. Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo (Temple of Kukulc√°n) and the Great Ball Court.; Weeks and Hill 2006, pp.577‚Äì653. Excavations next to the Temple of Kukulc√°n (\\"El Castillo\\") began in 2009 In 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chich√©n. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucat√°n. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book People of the Serpent published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon. There have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archaeological zone, including the Osario, Akab Dzib, and several buildings in Chich√©n Viejo (Old Chichen). In 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archaeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.  Site description  A map of central Chichen Itza Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least . Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this. The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups. The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.From , meaning \\"white way/road\\". Plural form is sacbeob (or in modern Maya orthography, sakb ºeob º). Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings. The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula. The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of the Temple of Kukulc√°n (El Castillo), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib. South of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chich√©n Viejo (Old Chich√©n) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle. =Architectural styles= The Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure. The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper fa√ßades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper. At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate fa√ßade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centred upon a region in the north of Campeche state, lying between the Puuc and R√≠o Bec regions. Those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group. =Architectural groups=Great North Platform = Temple of Kukulc√°n (El Castillo) = The Jaguar Throne inside the Temple of Kukulc√°n (\\"El Castillo\\") pyramid is red and inlaid with jade Dominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the Temple of Kukulc√°n (a Maya feathered serpent deity similar to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl). The temple was identified by the first Spaniards to see it, as El Castillo (\\"the castle\\"), and it regularly is referred to as such. This step pyramid stands about high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately high, with a high temple upon the summit. The sides of the pyramid are approximately at the base and rise at an angle of 53¬∞, although that varies slightly for each side. The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45¬∞. The talud walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72¬∞ and 74¬∞. At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent. Mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones, and the Temple of Kukulc√°n is one such example. In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of the temple. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one. Inside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade. The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.Diario de Yucatan, 3 March 2006. Around the Spring and Autumn equinoxes, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent deity, Kukulc√°n. It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making it impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone. =Great Ball Court= The Great Ball Court Archaeologists have identified thirteen ballcourts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame in Chichen Itza, but the Great Ball Court about to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica. It measures . The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each long. The walls of these platforms stand high; set high up in the centre of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.A popular explanation is that the objective of the game was to pass a ball through one of the rings, however in other, smaller ball courts there is no ring, only a post. At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players. In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes. At one end of the Great Ball Court is the North Temple, also known as the Temple of the Bearded Man (Templo del Hombre Barbado). This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair. At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins. Built into the east wall are the Temples of the Jaguar. The Upper Temple of the Jaguar overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene. In the entrance to the Lower Temple of the Jaguar, which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings. =Additional structures= The Tzompantli, or Skull Platform (Plataforma de los Cr√°neos), shows the clear cultural influence of the central Mexican Plateau. Unlike the tzompantli of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at Tenochtitlan. The Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars (Plataforma de √Åguilas y Jaguares) is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt. It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides. The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts. This Platform of Venus is dedicated to the planet Venus. In its interior archaeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone, the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado. The Temple of the Tables is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called \\"atlantes.\\" The Steam Bath is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones. Sacbe Number One is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This \\"white road\\" is long with an average width of . It begins at a low wall a few metres from the Platform of Venus. According to archaeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road. =Sacred Cenote= The Sacred Cenote The Yucat√°n Peninsula is a limestone plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes, called cenotes, which expose the water table to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is in diameter and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some below. The Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought. Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men. =Temple of the Warriors= Temple of the Warriors (Templo de los Guerreros) Detail of the Temple of the Warriors, showing a statue of Chacmool The Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading toward the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool. This temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris, who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled Temple of the Warriors. Watercolors were made of murals in the Temple of the Warriors that were deteriorating rapidly following exposure to the elements after enduring for centuries in the protected enclosures being discovered. Many depict battle scenes and some even have tantalizing images that lend themselves to speculation and debate by prominent Maya scholars, such as Michael D. Coe and Mary Miller, regarding possible contact with Viking sailors.Hansen, Valerie, Vikings in America, Newsletter, Aeon, September 22, 2020 =Group of a Thousand Columns= Along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief; A northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some away to a rejollada, a former cenote. To the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The Temple of the Carved Columns is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages. A section of the upper fa√ßade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The Temple of the Small Tables which is an unrestored mound. And the Thompson's Temple (referred to in some sources as Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (balam in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil. =El Mercado= This square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial. Osario Group South of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc. The Osario pyramid The Osario staircase The Osario itself, like the Temple of Kukulkan, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike Kukulkan, at the center is an opening into the pyramid that leads to a natural cave below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure The High Priests' Temple. Archaeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests. The Temple of Xtoloc is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, \\"Xtoloc.\\" The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds, and mythological scenes. Between the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The Platform of Venus, which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to Kukulkan (El Castillo), the Platform of the Tombs, and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple. South of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archaeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the House of the Metates and the House of the Mestizas. Casa Colorada Group South of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archaeological zone. The Casa Colorada (Spanish for \\"Red House\\") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Its Maya name is Chichanchob, which according to INAH may mean \\"small holes\\". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza. In 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada. While the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named La Casa del Venado (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.El Chich√°n Chob y la Casa del Venado, Chich√©n Itz√°, Yucat√°n. William J. Folan Central Group A small temple bearing many masks in the Las Monjas complex (\\"La Iglesia\\") The observatory temple (\\"El Caracol\\") Las Monjas is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex Las Monjas (\\"The Nuns\\" or \\"The Nunnery\\"), but it was a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the La Iglesia, \\"The Church\\") decorated with elaborate masks. The Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of K ºak ºupakal. El Caracol (\\"The Snail\\") is located to the north of Las Monjas. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens. Akab Dzib is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, \\"Dark Writing\\"; \\"dark\\" in the sense of \\"mysterious\\". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na, \\"the flat house with the excessive number of chambers\\", and it was the home of the administrator of Chich√©n Itz√°, kokom Yahawal Cho º K ºak º. INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only high, and is in length and wide. The long, western-facing fa√ßade has seven doorways. The eastern fa√ßade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote. The southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs‚Äîthe \\"mysterious\\" or \\"obscure\\" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print. Old Chichen laser scan image of Chichen Itza's Cave of Balankanche, showing how the shape of its great limestone column is strongly evocative of the World Tree in Maya mythological belief systems, data from a National Science Foundation/CyArk research partnership Old Chichen (or Chich√©n Viejo in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated. It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys. Other structures Chichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about and several outlying subsidiary sites. Caves of Balankanche Approximately south east of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as Balankanche (), Balamka ºanche º in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times. The location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and Alfred Tozzer visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. Edwin Shook and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the Carnegie Institution in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era. On 15 September 1959, Jos√© Humberto G√≥mez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them in situ.  Tourism  1938 painting of one of the reliefs found on lower terrace columns of the Temple of the Warriors, by Octavio Medellin Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico; in 2017 it was estimated to have received 2.1 million visitors. Tourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucat√°n in the public's imagination with his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chich√©n Itz√°. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype. After Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chich√©n, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution. In the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucat√°n. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucat√°n and the ruins. Gomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucat√°n Governor Miguel Barbachano), started Yucat√°n's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of M√©rida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucat√°n, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chich√©n, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution. In 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chich√©n, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson. Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chich√©n, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel. In 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueol√≥gicas, Art√≠sticas e Hist√≥ricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership. There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Canc√∫n resort area to the east. In the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulc√°n during which the feathered serpent appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid.See Quetzil Castaneda (1996) In The Museum of Maya Culture (University of Minnesota Press) for a book length study of tourism at Chichen, including a chapter on the equinox ritual. For a 90-minute ethnographic documentary of new age spiritualism at the Equinox see Jeff Himpele and Castaneda (1997)[Incidents of Travel in Chichen Itza] (Documentary Educational Resources). Tour guides will also demonstrate a unique the acoustical effect at Chichen Itza: a handclap before the in front of the staircase the El Castillo pyramid will produce by an echo that resembles the chirp of a bird, similar to that of the quetzal as investigated by Declercq. Chichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the second-most visited of Mexico's archaeological sites. The archaeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Canc√∫n, who make a day trip on tour buses. In 2007, Chichen Itza's Temple of Kukulc√°n (El Castillo) was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to Chichen would double by 2012.Figure is attributed to Francisco L√≥pez Mena, director of the Consejo de Promoci√≥n Tur√≠stica de M√©xico (CPTM ‚Äì Council for the Promotion of Mexican Tourism). The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucat√°n purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano. INAH, which manages the site, has closed a number of monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. Climbing access to El Castillo was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.

Marc was taught by Miss Ethel Kerkin of Durban North, South Africa. She was a true genius of the art and it was she who mentored Marc throughout his life. Marc was fortunate to have teaching from many performing pianists including Alicia de la Roche who took a very special interest in Marc's musical career, and was a good friend. Of Miss Kerkin, Marc is remembered to have said that when he needed a \\"proper lesson\\" he came back to Ethel Kerkin. We who knew him, remember that he memorized the 24 Bach Preludes and Fugues over a weekend as financial constraints forced him to borrow the music on short loan (Prof A. Linegar, Cape Town, South Africa). Later, a disciple of Friedrich Gulda in Munich, he graduated in London, debuting at the Wigmore Hall in 1978. For the next years he settled in London and took part in its musical scene while he made headway to the American scene, debuting in Carnegie Hall. He extended his concerts through Austria, Germany and Switzerland and performed regularly in his homeland, where he was awarded the South African Radio prize. Raubenheimer was the first guest soloist who performed with the then newly formed KwaZulu Natal Philharmonic Orchestra (South Africa) from September 1983. In a busy opening season he played 2 concerts a week for 3 weeks, in the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, performing the five Beethoven piano concertos, conducted by David Tidboald. His discographical debut (Decca), a Schumann monographic, was arranged for Spring 1984. Marc's performance of Schumann repertoire was described by critics as sublime, and one of the best interpretations heard at the time. In 1982 Raubenheimer won the Paloma O'Shea Santander International Piano Competition. As he traveled to the final recital entailed by the prize he was tragically killed (on 7 December 1983) in a collision of airliners at Madrid, Spain.

Norman, the son of an early Sears & Roebuck entrepreneur. They lived in New York City, where Mrs. Norman immersed herself in social- activism groups: as a researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union; with Planned Parenthood, the National Urban League, and the Group Theatre. In the meantime, they had two children together, Andrew and Nancy. Education She attended Smith College, then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, remaining there from 1922 until her 1925 marriage. Arts patron and Stieglitz devotee Her life was motivated by \\"a desire to advance both art and action\\". She actively cultivated an interest in people who were involved with either the artistic arena or efforts at increasing social equity. In this role, she became acquainted with photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who was already a towering influence in the nascent field of art photography when they met in 1927. Although both were married at that time ‚Äî she to Norman and he to modern artist Georgia O'Keeffe ‚Äî Stieglitz became her mentor.Norman also had an impressive talent in photography. However, her reputation has been obscured by her role as an ardent devotee of Stieglitz (\\" . . . her enormous, if relatively unknown, talents as a photographer.\\" Brown University) Their relationship continued until his death in 1946. Her marriage to Edward Norman ended in divorce in 1951. Photographer Norman never worked as a professional photographer; instead, she captured images of friends, loved ones and prominent figures in the arts and in politics. People she photographed included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Thomas Mann (with his wife Katia, or Katy), John Cage, Marcel Duchamp, Bernard Berenson, Albert Einstein, Theodore Dreiser, Elia Kazan, Lewis Mumford and Sherwood Anderson. She also photographed special sites, trees, harbors, churches and buildings. She detailed the interior of An American Place, Stieglitz's last gallery, in photographs included in America and Alfred Stieglitz, A Collective Portrait, published in I934. She created an extended portrait study of Stieglitz (he returned the favour by creating a similar study of Norman).Stewart, Doug. (2002).

In order to draw attention to these causes, such as Racial discrimination in America, Supreme Court decisions, and Nazi medical atrocities, she wrote different publications. She was a founding member of New York City's Liberal Party and a member of the Americans for Democratic Action, and served on the boards of both the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. Writing career Norman was a productive author. She wrote a weekly column for the New York Post (1942-1949) and for ten years (1938-1948) edited and published the literary and social activist journal Twice a Year, whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Norman chose provocative aphorisms by contemporary and historical writers, male and female, and from various cultures, to accompany the thematic groups of photographs in sections of MoMA's world-touring exhibition The Family of Man for its curator Edward Steichen, a long-term associate of Alfred Stieglitz. She wrote or edited numerous books, including The Selected Writings of John Marin (1949); Nehru: The First Sixty Years (1965), a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings; Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer (1970), the first full-length biography of the American modernist; and Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend (1985).

Between 1853-1859, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, and then on a scholarship for six years in Paris as the pupil of the French Orientalist painter Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. Chlebowski traveled to Spain, Italy, Germany, and Belgium. His first success was selling his painting Joanne d‚ÄôArc in Amiens Prison to Napoleon III of France. In the years 1864-1876 Chlebowski was the master painter under the service of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz and took up residence in Constantinople. Chlebowski became popular in the empire. During his services, he had obtained permission to bring with him a large icon of Mother of God Leading Our Way having been rescued from the Hodegon Monastery in 1453. He had come across it in one of the antique stores in Constantinople, untouched by its Turkish conservator. This account is certified in a letter by the , dated June 27, 1938. In 1876 he moved to Paris. In 1881 he returned permanently to Krakow. The subject matter of his watercolours and oil paintings is diverse. He painted images of historical battles related to the history of Turkey and Ottoman Empire, oriental genre scenes, landscapes, and portraits of Ottoman sultans. He died near Posen, in Rundhausen at age 49.

He had an important role in the Chaco War, as a disseminator of information and propaganda, and he also worked with the government to carry out important tasks. Life Born in the city of Asunci√≥n, Chaves was one of the core historians of Paraguay and a transcendental figure of the culture of that country. The work he did gave a major boost to the national historiography. He belonged to the so-called \\"Generation 1925\\", along with other eminent personalities like Efra√≠m Cardozo, Hipolito Sanchez Quell and R. Antonio Ramos. His studies on Doctor Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia eventually became the book The Supreme Dictator, today regarded as the most comprehensive, objective and serious work on the subject. He was also a professor, diplomat and politician. During the Chaco War he played a major role in promoting information and media. He pursued primary and secondary education in San Jos√© and at the National College and earned his doctorate in 1929, after defending his thesis on the Monroe Doctrine. Family Chaves' uncle was Mr. Federico Chaves, who was president between the years 1949 and 1954. His brothers were prominent personalities of national policy, Hugo, Herman and Juan Ramon Chaves. The latter was president of the Colorado Party for many years. Julio C√©sar had membership in the Colorado Party until 1973, when he joined the Liberal Party. National service During the Chaco War, Chaves worked at the \\"Department II\\", first under the command of Tom√°s Romero Pereira and then as chief until the end of the war. In 1934, in mid-July, at the express request of President Eusebio Ayala and General Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia, Chaves organized (as head of Department II) the Directorate Press and Propaganda (popularly known as Radio Press), which was presented in the form of daily bulletins. This work had a great impact nationally and internationally and served to raise troop morale. It was also after the war, the civil fiscal year 1936, and deputy national, 1938. At that time he was an active military in the Liberal Youth Club, along with young people such as Efra√≠m Cardozo, Carlos Pastore, Horacio Fernandez, Juan G. Peroni, Villagra Maffiodo Salvador, Francisco Sapena, Emilio Saguier Aceval, Pedro R. Esp√≠nola, Paul Max Ynsfr√°n, Alejandro Marin Churches, Artemio Mereles, Juan B. Wasmosy, among others. This was the group that launched and supported the presidential candidacy of General Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia in 1939, imposed on the criterion of liberal old guard who wanted a civilian president. In 1939, Chaves was sent as minister to Bolivia and then to Peru as an ambassador in 1940. With the assumption of General Higinio Mor√≠nigo as president of the republic after the death of Estigarribia, who took exile in Buenos Aires from the year 1941. He was perhaps among the more profitable exiles of the country because Chaves began to develop part of his historiography work there. Chaves was also president of the Academy of Paraguayan History from 1956 to 1973 and again from 1984 to 1986, and the Academia de la Lengua Espa√±ola from 1975 until his death. He was also president of the PEN Club and the Paraguayan Institute of Hispanic Culture, as well as a member of academies and institutes from various countries, the American Institute of History of Madrid and the Royal Academy of Arts of the Spanish capital. He was a lecturer in various Latin American capitals and major cultural centers of Europe. Works In 1936 Chaves wrote El Chaco in adjustments for peace (unpublished), and in 1937 edited History of relations between Buenos Aires and Paraguay. His other works include: *El supremo dictador (The supreme dictator). *Castelli, El adalid de mayo (Castelli, the May Champion). *San Mart√≠n y Bol√≠var en Guayaquil (San Mart√≠n and Bol√≠var in Guayaquil). *El presidente L√≥pez (President L√≥pez). *Vida y obra de Don Carlos (Life and work of Don Carlos). *El General D√≠az (General Diaz). *Biograf√≠a del vencedor de Curupayty (Biography of the Curupayty conqueror). *Compendio de historia paraguaya (Compendium of Paraguayan history). *Compendio de historia americana (Compendium of American history). *Unamuno y Am√©rica (Unamuno and America). *Historia del descubrimiento y conquista del R√≠o de la Plata y el Paraguay (History of the discovery and conquest of the Rio de la Plata and Paraguay). *Itinerario de Antonio Machado (Antonio Machado Journey). *T√∫pac Amaru. *La causa de la independencia americana (The cause of Latin American independence). Publishing Dr. Julio Cesar Chaves is the creator of an unpublished monograph, which deals with the important actions that he took in the Chaco War. This is a valuable document on the work that he accomplished in the Department II, his management of Prensa y Propaganda that depended directly on the Commander in Chief of Army Operations. Department II was organized by the then mayor Tom√°s Romero Pereira, supported by Chaves, and its task included military intelligence. Prensa y Propaganda depended directly on Chaves by express order of president Eusebio Ayala, who mandated him to carry out daily bulletins to counter Bolivian propaganda. According to Chaves himself, these bulletins were captured by the main radiotelegraph stations in the country and the following American countries: Bolivia Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru. President Ayala wrote the first three materials as a model. The first alluded to the Chilean mercenaries in the Bolivian army, the second to the superiority of the Paraguayan soldiers' morale over the Bolivian, and the third to the resources expended by Bolivia during the Chaco struggles. Bolivian prisoners were very valuable as sources of information for these bulletins, which led to a deterioration in the minds of the enemy combatants‚Äô side, as acknowledged after the war by Colonel David Toro, a prominent Bolivian leader. Death Chaves died in Asunci√≥n on February 20, 1989, a few months after his 81st birthday. NotesReferences * Biographical Dictionary \\"Forgers of Paraguay\\", First Edition January 2000.

Bound together in a political union, each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty, Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches, each with separate and independent powers: executive, legislative, and judicial. States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state, and states also create other local governments. States, unlike U.S. territories, possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution. States and their citizens are represented in the United States Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors (equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state) to vote in the Electoral College, the body that directly elects the President of the United States. Additionally, each state has the opportunity to ratify constitutional amendments, and, with the consent of Congress, two or more states may enter into interstate compacts with one another. The police power of each state is also recognized. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 by Thirteen British Colonies, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so. States of the United States The 50 U.S. states, in alphabetical order, along with each state's flag: center Background The 13 original states came into existence in July 1776 during the American Revolutionary War, as the successors of the Thirteen Colonies, upon agreeing to the Lee Resolution and signing the United States Declaration of Independence. Prior to these events each state had been a British colony; each then joined the first Union of states between 1777 and 1781, upon ratifying the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitution. Also during this period, the newly independent states developed their own individual state constitutions, among the earliest written constitutions in the world. Although different in detail, these state constitutions shared features that would be important in the American constitutional order: they were republican in form, and separated power among three branches, most had bicameral legislatures, and contained statements of, or a bill of rights. Later, from 1787 to 1790, each of the states also ratified a new federal frame of government in the Constitution of the United States. In relation to the states, the U.S. Constitution elaborated concepts of federalism. Governments States are not mere administrative divisions of the United States, as their powers and responsibilities are not assigned to them from above by federal legislation or federal administrative action or the federal Constitution. Consequently, each of the 50 states reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people, and to exercise all powers of government not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO- CONAN-1992-10-11.pdf A state, unlike the federal government, has un-enumerated police power, that is the right to generally make all necessary laws for the welfare of its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. =Constitutions= The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words ‚Äì more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch frame of government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required). Early on in American history four state governments differentiated themselves from the others in their first constitutions by choosing to self-identify as commonwealths rather than as states: Virginia, in 1776; Pennsylvania, in 1777; Massachusetts, in 1780; and Kentucky, in 1792. Consequently, while these four are states like the other states, each is formally a commonwealth because the term is contained in its constitution. The term, commonwealth, which refers to a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people, was first used in Virginia during the Interregnum, the 1649‚Äì60 period between the reigns of Charles I and Charles II during which parliament's Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector established a republican government known as the Commonwealth of England. Virginia became a royal colony again in 1660, and the word was dropped from the full title; it went unused until reintroduced in 1776. Executive In each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both head of state and head of government. All governors are chosen by direct election. The governor may approve or veto bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party. In 44 states, governors have line item veto power. Most states have a plural executive, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its executive branch. In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials, elected by the people independently of the governor‚Äîsuch as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, and others. The constitutions of 19 states allow for citizens to remove and replace an elected public official before the end of their term of office through a recall election. Each state follows its own procedures for recall elections, and sets its own restrictions on how often, and how soon after a general election, they may be held. In all states, the legislatures can remove state executive branch officials, including governors, who have committed serious abuses of their power from office. The process of doing so includes impeachment (the bringing of specific charges), and a trial, in which legislators act as a jury. Legislative The primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy. In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill), which in most states requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber. In 49 of the 50 states the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (variously called, the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, in all states called, the Senate. The exception is the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, which has only a single chamber. Most states have a part-time legislature (traditionally called a citizen legislature). Ten state legislatures are considered full-time; these bodies are more similar to the U.S. Congress than are the others. Members of each state's legislature are chosen by direct election. In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that all states are required to elect their legislatures in such a way as to afford each citizen the same degree of representation (the one person, one vote standard). In practice, most states elect legislators from single-member districts, each of which has approximately the same population. Some states, such as Maryland and Vermont, divide the state into single- and multi-member districts, in which case multi-member districts must have proportionately larger populations, e.g., a district electing two representatives must have approximately twice the population of a district electing just one. The voting systems used across the nation are: first-past- the-post in single-member districts, and multiple non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. In 2013, there were a total of 7,383 legislators in the 50 state legislative bodies. They earned from $0 annually (New Mexico) to $90,526 (California). There were various per diem and mileage compensation. Judicial States can also organize their judicial systems differently from the federal judiciary, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural due process. Most have a trial level court, generally called a District Court, Superior Court or Circuit Court, a first-level appellate court, generally called a Court of Appeal (or Appeals), and a Supreme Court. However, Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals. In New York State the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals are then taken to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to the Court of Appeals. State court systems provide general courts with broad jurisdiction. The overwhelming majority of criminal and civil cases in the United States are heard in state courts. The annual number of cases filed in state courts are around 30,000,000 and the number of judges in state courts is about 30,000‚Äîby comparison, federal courts see some 1,000,000 filed cases with about 1700 judges. Most states base their legal system on English common law (with substantial indigenous changes and incorporation of certain civil law innovations), with the notable exception of Louisiana, a former French colony, which draws large parts of its legal system from French civil law. Only a few states choose to have the judges on the state's courts serve for life terms. In most of the states the judges, including the justices of the highest court in the state, are either elected or appointed for terms of a limited number of years, and are usually eligible for re-election or reappointment. =States as unitary systems= All states have unitary governments, local governments are created under state law, and ultimately, local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state. State governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation. In a few states, local units of government are permitted a degree of home rule over various matters. The prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments, referred to as Dillon's Rule, holds that, Each state defines for itself what powers it will allow local governments. Generally, four categories of power may be given to local jurisdictions: Relationships=Among states= Each state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects. With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality. With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states. Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights. Under Article IV of the Constitution, which outlines the relationship between the states, each state is required to give full faith and credit to the acts of each other's legislatures and courts, which is generally held to include the recognition of most contracts and criminal judgments, and before 1865, slavery status. Under the Extradition Clause, a state must extradite people located there who have fled charges of \\"treason, felony, or other crimes\\" in another state if the other state so demands. The principle of hot pursuit of a presumed felon and arrest by the law officers of one state in another state are often permitted by a state. The full faith and credit expectation does have exceptions, some legal arrangements, such as professional licensure and marriages, may be state-specific, and until recently states have not been found by the courts to be required to honor such arrangements from other states. Such legal acts are nevertheless often recognized state-to-state according to the common practice of comity. States are prohibited from discriminating against citizens of other states with respect to their basic rights, under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. =With the federal government= Under Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed. This guarantee has long been at the fore- front of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-√†-vis the government. States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot, but was not invoked. The Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. States' rights are understood mainly with reference to the Tenth Amendment. The Constitution delegates some powers to the national government, and it forbids some powers to the states. The Tenth Amendment reserves all other powers to the states, or to the people. Powers of the U.S. Congress are enumerated in Article I, Section 8, for example, the power to declare war. Making treaties is one power forbidden to the states, being listed among other such powers in Article I, Section 10. Among the Article I enumerated powers of Congress is the power to regulate Commerce. Since the early 20th century, the Supreme Court's interpretation of this \\"Commerce Clause\\" has, over time, greatly expanded scope of federal power, at the expense of powers formerly considered purely states' matters. The Cambridge Economic History of the United States says, \\"On the whole, especially after the mid-1880s, the Court construed the Commerce Clause in favor of increased federal power.\\" In 1941, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Darby upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions. Then, one year later, in Wickard v. Filburn, the Court expanded federal power to regulate the economy by holding that federal authority under the commerce clause extends to activities which may appear to be local in nature but in reality effect the entire national economy and are therefore of national concern. For example, Congress can regulate railway traffic across state lines, but it may also regulate rail traffic solely within a state, based on the reality that intrastate traffic still affects interstate commerce. Through such decisions, argues law professor David F. Forte, \\"the Court turned the commerce power into the equivalent of a general regulatory power and undid the Framers' original structure of limited and delegated powers.\\" Subsequently, Congress invoked the Commerce Clause to expand federal criminal legislation, as well as for social reforms such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Only within the past couple of decades, through decisions in cases such as those in U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000), has the Court tried to limit the Commerce Clause power of Congress. Another enumerated congressional power is its taxing and spending power. An example of this is the system of federal aid for highways, which include the Interstate Highway System. The system is mandated and largely funded by the federal government, and also serves the interests of the states. By threatening to withhold federal highway funds, Congress has been able to pressure state legislatures to pass a variety of laws. An example is the nationwide legal drinking age of 21, enacted by each state, brought about by the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. Although some objected that this infringes on states' rights, the Supreme Court upheld the practice as a permissible use of the Constitution's Spending Clause in South Dakota v. Dole . As prescribed by Article I of the Constitution, which establishes the U.S. Congress, each state is represented in the Senate (irrespective of population size) by two senators, and each is guaranteed at least one representative in the House. Both senators and representatives are chosen in direct popular elections in the various states. (Prior to 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures.) There are presently 100 senators, who are elected at-large to staggered terms of six years, with one-third of them being chosen every two years. Representatives are elected at-large or from single-member districts to terms of two years (not staggered). The size of the House‚Äîpresently 435 voting members‚Äîis set by federal statute. Seats in the House are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. The borders of these districts are established by the states individually through a process called redistricting, and within each state all districts are required to have approximately equal populations. Citizens in each state plus those in the District of Columbia indirectly elect the president and vice president. When casting ballots in presidential elections they are voting for presidential electors, who then, using procedures provided in the 12th amendment, elect the president and vice president. There were 538 electors for the most recent presidential election in 2016; the allocation of electoral votes was based on the 2010 census. Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state; the District of Columbia is entitled to three electors. While the Constitution does set parameters for the election of federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including: primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, as well as the running of state and local elections. All elections‚Äîfederal, state and local‚Äîare administered by the individual states, and some voting rules and procedures may differ among them. Article V of the Constitution accords states a key role in the process of amending the U.S. Constitution. Amendments may be proposed either by Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by either‚Äîas determined by Congress‚Äîthe legislatures of three- quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three-quarters of the states. The vote in each state (to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment) carries equal weight, regardless of a state's population or length of time in the Union. Admission into the Union date of statehood: The order in which the original 13 states ratified the Constitution, then the order in which the others were admitted to the Union Article IV also grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. Article IV also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This caveat was designed to give Eastern states that still had Western land claims (including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia), to have a veto over whether their western counties could become states, and has served this same function since, whenever a proposal to partition an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before Congress. Most of the states admitted to the Union after the original 13 were formed from an organized territory established and governed by Congress in accord with its plenary power under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2. The outline for this process was established by the Northwest Ordinance (1787), which predates the ratification of the Constitution. In some cases, an entire territory has become a state; in others some part of a territory has. When the people of a territory make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, Congress may pass an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory to organize a constitutional convention to write a state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. Upon acceptance of that constitution, and upon meeting any additional Congressional stipulations, Congress has always admitted that territory as a state. In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never an organized territory of the federal government, or part of one, before being admitted to the Union. Three were set off from an already existing state, two entered the Union after having been sovereign states, and one was established from unorganized territory: * California, 1850, from land ceded to the United States by Mexico in 1848 under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. * Kentucky, 1792, from Virginia (District of Kentucky: Fayette, Jefferson, and Lincoln counties) * Maine, 1820, from Massachusetts (District of Maine) * Texas, 1845, previously the Republic of Texas * Vermont, 1791, previously the Vermont Republic (also known as the New Hampshire Grants and claimed by New York) * West Virginia, 1863, from Virginia (Trans-Allegheny region counties) during the Civil War Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. Such has been the case numerous times during the nation's history. In one instance, Mormon pioneers in Salt Lake City sought to establish the state of Deseret in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the United States Congress. In another, leaders of the Five Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in Indian Territory proposed to establish the state of Sequoyah in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands. The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory, along with Oklahoma Territory were both incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma in 1907. The first instance occurred while the nation still operated under the Articles of Confederation. The State of Franklin existed for several years, not long after the end of the American Revolution, but was never recognized by the Confederation Congress, which ultimately recognized North Carolina's claim of sovereignty over the area. The territory comprising Franklin later became part of the Southwest Territory, and ultimately of the state of Tennessee. Additionally, the entry of several states into the Union was delayed due to distinctive complicating factors. Among them, Michigan Territory, which petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, was not admitted to the Union until 1837, due to a boundary dispute with the adjoining state of Ohio. The Republic of Texas requested annexation to the United States in 1837, but fears about potential conflict with Mexico delayed the admission of Texas for nine years. Statehood for Kansas Territory was held up for several years (1854‚Äì61) due to a series of internal violent conflicts involving anti-slavery and pro-slavery factions. West Virginia's bid for statehood was also delayed over slavery, and was settled when it agreed to adopt a gradual abolition plan.Oakes, James Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861‚Äì1865, W.W. Norton, 2012, pgs. 296-97 Possible new states=Puerto Rico= Puerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory, refers to itself as the \\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\" in the English version of its constitution, and as \\"Estado Libre Asociado\\" (literally, Associated Free State) in the Spanish version. As with all U.S. territories, its residents do not have full representation in the United States Congress. Puerto Rico has limited representation in the U.S. House of Representatives in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a delegate with limited voting rights in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, but no voting rights otherwise. A non- binding referendum on statehood, independence, or a new option for an associated territory (different from the current status) was held on November 6, 2012. Sixty one percent (61%) of voters chose the statehood option, while one third of the ballots were submitted blank. On December 11, 2012, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico, held on November 6, 2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State. Another status referendum was held on June 11, 2017, in which 97% percent of voters chose statehood. Turnout was low, as only 23% of voters went to the polls, with advocates of both continued territorial status and independence urging voters to boycott it. On June 27, 2018, the H.R. 6246 Act was introduced on the U.S. House with the purpose of respond to, and comply with, the democratic will of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico as expressed in the plebiscites held on November 6, 2012, and June 11, 2017, by setting forth the terms for the admission of the territory of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union. The act has 37 original cosponsors between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. =Washington, D.C.= The intention of the Founding Fathers was that the United States capital should be at a neutral site, not giving favor to any existing state; as a result, the District of Columbia was created in 1800 to serve as the seat of government. As it is not a state, the district does not have representation in the Senate and has a non-voting delegate in the House; neither does it have a sovereign elected government. Additionally, prior to ratification of the 23rd Amendment in 1961, district citizens did not get the right to vote in Presidential elections. Some residents of the District support statehood of some form for that jurisdiction ‚Äì either statehood for the whole district or for the inhabited part, with the remainder remaining under federal jurisdiction. In November 2016, Washington, D.C. residents voted in a statehood referendum in which 86% of voters supported statehood for Washington, D.C. For statehood to be achieved, it must be approved by Congress. =Others= Other possible new states are Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, both of which are unincorporated organized territories of the United States. Also, either the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or American Samoa, an unorganized, unincorporated territory, could seek statehood. Secession from the Union The Constitution is silent on the issue of whether a state can secede from the Union. Its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, stated that the United States \\"shall be perpetual.\\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nations's political discourse from early in its history, and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the American Civil War. In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States, and joined together to form the Confederate States of America (CSA). Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing Reconstruction Era. The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, nor the validity of the ordinances of secession adopted by the seceding states. Following the war, the United States Supreme Court, in Texas v. White (1869), held that states did not have the right to secede and that any act of secession was legally void. Drawing on the Preamble to the Constitution, which states that the Constitution was intended to \\"form a more perfect union\\" and speaks of the people of the United States in effect as a single body politic, as well as the language of the Articles of Confederation, the Supreme Court maintained that states did not have a right to secede. However, the court's reference in the same decision to the possibility of such changes occurring \\"through revolution, or through consent of the States,\\" essentially means that this decision holds that no state has a right to unilaterally decide to leave the Union. Origins of states' names A map showing the source languages of state names The 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages. Twenty-four state names originate from Native American languages. Of these, eight are from Algonquian languages, seven are from Siouan languages, three are from Iroquoian languages, one is from Uto-Aztecan languages and five others are from other indigenous languages. Hawaii's name is derived from the Polynesian Hawaiian language. Of the remaining names, 22 are from European languages: Seven from Latin (mainly Latinized forms of English names), the rest are from English, Spanish and French. Eleven states are named after individual people, including seven named for royalty and one named after a President of the United States. The origins of six state names are unknown or disputed. Several of the states that derive their names from (corrupted) names used for Native peoples, have retained the plural ending of \\"s\\". Geography=Borders= The borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters. Their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the Federal government during the 1780s and 1790s. Many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by Congress as it created territories, divided them, and over time, created states within them. Territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features (such as rivers or mountain range peaks), and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns. At various times, national borders with territories formerly controlled by other countries (British North America, New France, New Spain including Spanish Florida, and Russian America) became institutionalized as the borders of U.S. states. In the West, relatively arbitrary straight lines following latitude and longitude often prevail, due to the sparseness of settlement west of the Mississippi River. Once established, most state borders have, with few exceptions, been generally stable. Only two states, Missouri (Platte Purchase) and Nevada, grew appreciably after statehood. Several of the original states ceded land, over a several year period, to the Federal government, which in turn became the Northwest Territory, Southwest Territory, and Mississippi Territory. In 1791, Maryland and Virginia ceded land to create the District of Columbia (Virginia's portion was returned in 1847). In 1850, Texas ceded a large swath of land to the federal government. Additionally, Massachusetts and Virginia (on two occasions), have lost land, in each instance to form a new state. There have been numerous other minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys, resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions, or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes. Occasionally, either Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court has had to settle state border disputes. One notable example is the case New Jersey v. New York, in which New Jersey won roughly 90% of Ellis Island from New York in 1998. =Regional grouping= States may be grouped in regions; there are many variations and possible groupings. Many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government. For example, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions. The Census Bureau region definition is \\"widely used ‚Ä¶ for data collection and analysis,\\"\\"The National Energy Modeling System: An Overview 2003\\" (Report #:DOE/EIA-0581, October 2009). United States Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. and is the most commonly used classification system.\\"The most widely used regional definitions follow those of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.\\" Seymour Sudman and Norman M. Bradburn, Asking Questions: A Practical Guide to Questionnaire Design (1982). Jossey-Bass: p. 205.\\"Perhaps the most widely used regional classification system is one developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.\\" Dale M. Lewison, Retailing, Prentice Hall (1997): p. 384. \\"(M)ost demographic and food consumption data are presented in this four-region format.\\" Pamela Goyan Kittler, Kathryn P. Sucher, Food and Culture, Cengage Learning (2008): p.475. Other multi-state regions are unofficial, and defined by geography or cultural affinity rather than by state lines.

He was defeated for re-election in 2010 by Republican Daniel Webster and was then elected in 2012 for a second, non-consecutive term in the House of Representatives, defeating Republican Todd Long. In 2016, Grayson decided not to run for re-election to his House seat in order to run for the Senate from Florida in the 2016 election. He was defeated 59%‚Äì18% in the Democratic primary by fellow Representative Patrick Murphy, who went on to lose the general election to incumbent Marco Rubio. In 2018, Grayson entered the race for the 9th district. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by his successor Darren Soto, 66%‚Äì34%. Early life and education Grayson was born in the Bronx, New York City, New York, to Dorothy Ann (n√©e Sabin) and Daniel Franklin Grayson. He graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1975, and also attended the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics program. Grayson worked his way through Harvard College as a janitor and nightwatchman, and also features reporter for Boston Phoenix. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts degree with a Special Concentration in Urban Studies in 1978. After working two years as an economist, he returned to Harvard for graduate studies. In 1983, he earned a J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School and a M.P.P. from the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He also completed all coursework and the comprehensive examination for a Ph.D. in government.U.S. Senate ‚Äì Alan Grayson; Orlando Sentinel; July 27, 2016 Grayson wrote his master's thesis on gerontology. In 1986, he helped found the non-profit Alliance for Aging Research in Washington, D.C. and served as an officer of the organization for more than twenty years. Law career Grayson worked as a law clerk at the Colorado Supreme Court in 1983, and at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals from 1984 to 1985, where he worked with two judges who later joined the U.S. Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia. He was an associate at the Washington, D.C. firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson for five years, where he specialized in contract law. In 1991 he founded the law firm Grayson & Kubli, which concentrated on government contract law. He was a lecturer at the George Washington University government contracts program and a frequent speaker on the topic. In the 2000s, he worked as a plaintiffs' attorney specializing in whistleblower fraud cases aimed at Iraq War contractors. One contractor, Custer Battles, employed individuals who were found guilty of making fraudulent statements and submitting fraudulent invoices on two contracts the company had with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. On behalf of his clients, Grayson filed suit under the False Claims Act and its qui tam provisions. The jury verdict was more than $13 million, which was upheld on appeal in April 2009. The Iraq War contractor fraud case brought Grayson his first national attention. In 2006, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal described Grayson as \\"waging a one-man war against contractor fraud in Iraq\\" and as a \\"fierce critic of the war in Iraq\\" whose car displayed bumper stickers such as \\"Bush lied, people died.\\" President of IDT Corp.

Stuart went on to lose the general election to incumbent Republican Ric Keller. 2008 In late 2007, Grayson announced that he would run again for the 8th district seat, and again faced Stuart in the primary. In the August 26, 2008 Democratic primary, Grayson defeated Stuart, 49%‚Äì28%, with three other candidates splitting the remaining 24%. During the general election campaign, Grayson maintained a consistent lead over Keller, who had only slightly won renomination in the Republican primary over attorney Todd Long. On election day, Grayson defeated Keller, 52%‚Äì48%. 2010 Grayson was challenged by Republican nominee Daniel Webster, Florida Tea Party backed Peg Dunmire, independent George Metcalfe, and write-in Florida Whig Party candidate Steve Gerritzen. Grayson ran a September 2010 commercial calling Webster a \\"draft-dodger\\" (Webster had received student deferments and a draft classification as medically unfit for service), and a later 30-second commercial calling Webster \\"Taliban Dan\\" and warning viewers that \\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom, in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\\" Grayson's ads were criticized for editing video mid- sentence to make Webster appear to say things he did not. Grayson released a toned-down version without the edited video or Taliban references in early October. On Glenn Beck's radio show, Sarah Palin agreed with a co-host's remark, \\"It's okay if the Republicans lose every seat in the Senate and the House except for one. As long as that one is Alan Grayson losing.\\" Conservative Newsweek columnist George Will called Grayson \\"America's worst politician.\\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/10/24/america-s-worst- politician.html \\"America's Worst Politician\\", by George Will Grayson was also heavily targeted in attack ads funded by groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the 60 Plus Association. Grayson was endorsed by 8th district resident and former Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), who characterized Webster as having \\"13th-century views\\" on women's issues. Former DNC Chair and Vermont governor Howard Dean called Grayson a \\"healthcare hero.\\" Grayson received more votes for \\"progressive hero\\" from Democracy for America than any other candidate in the country. On election day, Webster defeated Grayson, 56%‚Äì38%. 2012 On July 11, 2011, Grayson announced in an e-mail to supporters that he planned to run once again for Congress. Grayson ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for the newly created 9th District in Central Florida.Republican Todd Long to face Alan Grayson in November; Orlando Sentinel; August 14, 2012 On November 6, 2012, Grayson defeated Todd Long, 63%‚Äì37%, to return to Congress after a one-term absence. He described his victory as \\"the biggest comeback in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives.\\"2010 losers get their revenge; Politico; November 8, 2012 Although the two districts had different boundaries, Grayson claimed the House historian had told him that the shift from a 56%‚Äì38% loss in 2010 to a 63%‚Äì37% victory in 2012 was the biggest comeback in congressional history. 2014 Grayson was challenged in the Democratic primary by Nick Ruiz, a professor from the University of Florida. He overcame this challenge comfortably, 74%‚Äì26%. The Republican challenger in the general election was Carol Platt, with independent Marko Milakovich also standing. Grayson was returned to Congress with 54% of the vote. =Tenure=2009‚Äì2011 Grayson was the second Democrat to represent Florida's 8th congressional district since its formation after the 1970 census (it was the 5th District from 1973 to 1993 and has been the 8th since 1993). The only other Democrat to represent this district, Bill Gunter, left to run for the United States Senate in 1974 after only one term. Grayson is considered a progressive Democrat. He supported Barack Obama in 2008. He was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which he was vice-chairman. Grayson twice joined Republicans to oppose the raising of the federal debt limit. He said, \\"We need to live within our means. We need to eliminate wasteful spending. If we did those two simple things, we would not need to raise the debt limit.\\" On September 14, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.RES 686, Grayson's \\"Teach the Constitution Week\\" bill. The bill urged high schools to spend one week each September teaching the United States Constitution to high school seniors and also encouraged students to petition the government on an issue of personal importance to them to demonstrate their understanding of their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States. The non- partisan resolution was passed by a voice vote and featured 222 co-sponsors. On the 40th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Grayson's New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009. The bill asked the president to present Congress's highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins, as well as John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. Only about 200 medals have ever been awarded in the country's history. The New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009 passed the House unanimously on July 20, 2009. ;Select legislation sponsored * Pay for Performance Act (H.R. 1664) * Public Option Act (H.R. 4789) * War Is Making You Poor Act (H.R. 5353) * Shareholder Protection Act (H.R. 4790) * Paid Vacation Act of 2009 (H.R. 2564) 2013‚Äì2017 Known in his first term for making incendiary comments about Republicans, Grayson began to tone down his rhetoric and focused on working with Republicans to pass amendments that \\"appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP\\". He lobbied colleagues personally and in July 2013, David Weigel of Slate magazine called him \\"the most effective member of the House\\" and said that he was approaching \\"an unheralded title: The congressman who‚Äôs passed more amendments than any of his 434 peers.\\" In October 2013, his campaign sent out a fundraising email that compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan. It used the image of a burning cross as the \\"T\\" in Tea Party. Matt Gorman of the National Republican Congressional Committee described the e-mail as \\"hateful words and imagery\\". Grayson defended the comparison, saying that \\"here is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.\\" =Political positions= Federal Reserve  During his first term in office, Grayson supported Ron Paul's Audit the Fed legislation. Grayson gained attention for exchanges with Federal Reserve System Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and Inspector General Elizabeth A. Coleman. The 5-minute examination of Coleman in the House Financial Services Committee was posted on Grayson's official YouTube page, and as of December 2010, it has been viewed more than 4 million times. In a September 2009 The Alex Jones Show segment, Grayson criticized Federal Reserve Chair Bernanke's senior adviser Linda Robertson, saying \\"Here I am the only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, this lobbyist, this K-Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics!\\" Robertson had previously worked as a lobbyist for Enron. Grayson's language was widely criticized as inappropriate, and Grayson apologized. Following the AIG bonus payments controversy, Grayson joined fellow freshman Democrat Jim Himes of Connecticut to introduce the Grayson‚ÄìHimes Pay for Performance Act, legislation to require that all bonuses paid by companies that had received funds under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 be \\"based on performance\\". The bill was co-sponsored by eight other members of the House. On March 26, the bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 38‚Äì22 and on April 1, the bill was passed by the full House of Representatives by a vote of 247‚Äì171, although it eventually died in the Senate. Grayson was a co-sponsor of the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, which would provide additional provisions to audit the Federal Reserve, including removing several key exemptions.  Economic stimulus  Grayson made it a priority to increase the amount of federal money returning to his district. He often said that people in his district had been \\"exporting taxes and importing debt.\\" During his first year in office, the amount of federal grant dollars returning to the district nearly doubled. Grayson established a grant notification system that notifies subscribers immediately when a federal grant opportunity in their areas of interest becomes available. He also hired a full-time grants coordinator who focused solely on helping people navigate the federal grants process. Grayson supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and has been outspoken in favor of extending unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their jobs, arguing that the government had never cut off unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate was higher than eight percent. Grayson also voted for FDA oversight of tobacco products, which would give the FDA power to regulate tobacco. Grayson has worked to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of The New York Times, columnist Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top executives at the institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator. In September 2009, Grayson used a parliamentary maneuver called an \\"extension of remarks\\" to provide crucial instruction on H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, a bill that, among other things, included a provision that prohibited funding for ACORN (the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). Grayson's extension of remarks directed that the legislation defund any organization that cheats the federal government, not just ACORN. The defunding measure passed the House with a final vote of 253‚Äì171. Grayson also encouraged the public to report companies covered by the bill and set up a method to report offending companies via his Congressional website.  Health care reform  In response to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred health care bill was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the Public Option Act (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a four-page bill that would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States to buy into the public Medicare program at cost. The bill attracted 82 co-sponsors and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee. Grayson later voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. He voted in support of eliminating adjustments of Medicare rates of payment. He also voted against Republican substitutes for the health care amendment and insurance law amendments. On September 29, 2009, in a late-night speech on the House floor, Grayson presented his impression of the Republicans' health care plan, illustrated by signs. He said the Republicans' plan was \\"don't get sick\\", and \\"if you do get sick, die quickly.\\" After demands from Republicans that he apologize, he defended his comment and in a House floor speech stated, \\"I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.\\" He was then further lambasted for his use of the word holocaust by Jewish spokespersons across the nation. Grayson, who is Jewish, apologized to the Anti-defamation League for those offended by his generic use of holocaust. He also maintained that Congressional Republicans failed to offer a feasible plan. In October 2009, he launched NamesOfTheDead.com, a website to \\"memorialize Americans who die because they don't have health insurance\\". He subsequently read stories of the dead submitted through the Names of the Dead site on the House floor.  Social issues  Grayson is pro-choice and supports increased funding for stem cell research.\\"Alan Grayson on Abortion\\", On the Issues, September 5, 2013 He has always supported same-sex marriage and said in an interviews in 2013, \\"the propaganda that somehow gay marriage makes straight marriage bad for everyone is just farcical to me. I just don‚Äôt understand the logic of it.\\"\\"Rep. Alan Grayson discusses the future of LGBT equality and why he returned to Congress\\", WatermarkOnline, July 18, 2013 Grayson voted in support of the Hate Crimes Expansion Act, which expands the definition of hate crimes and strengthens enforcement of hate crime laws. He also voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Grayson supported the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that allows victims of wage discrimination to sue for punitive damages.  Environment  Grayson voted for the House's 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). The bill would provide for a $50 million \\"Hurricane Research Center\\" in Central Florida, and Grayson claimed it would immediately generate new jobs. Grayson noted after the passage of the ACES Act his concern about our dependence on foreign oil, the need to promote green technologies, renewable energy sources, and the job creation from the bill (an estimated 95,000 jobs in Florida). \\"This bill unleashes American ingenuity to solve the energy crisis. It lets us solve our problems by being Americans and thinking our way out of it. We will become an international energy power,\\" he said in a news release. The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico affected Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf each week. In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled at the same time as any new exploratory well.  Foreign affairs  Grayson has been an outspoken critic of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In May 2010, he introduced the War Is Making You Poor Act. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The bill does not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion. Grayson has tried to combat wasteful spending by government defense contractors by introducing his \\"Gold Plating\\" amendment. The amendment would require that cost or price account for half of the evaluation of bids for defense contracts. The law at the time allowed for cost to account for only 1% of the evaluation. The amendment passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in June 2009. However, the language was stripped from the final bill during the conference committee between Senate and House leaders. Grayson worked successfully to get the amendment inserted into H.R.5013, the IMPROVE Acquisition Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on April 28, 2010. Grayson has been an outspoken opponent of plans for the United States to intervene in the Syrian civil war.\\"Alan Grayson Criticizes Syrian Intervention: U.S. Shouldn't Police The Globe (VIDEO)\\", The Huffington Post, September 5, 2013 He has rejected what he calls \\"warmongering,\\"\\"Rep.

Grayson was ranked as the 11th- wealthiest member of Congress in 2010, based on financial disclosure forms with a net worth of $31.41 million, and a pending claim against the now- defunct Derivium Capital for at least $25 million, according to Roll Call. Grayson disclosed that his attorney fees and costs for the war contractor case had exceeded $4 million. Grayson was married to a woman he met in the early 1980s at a party in Boulder, Colorado. Grayson remarried in 1990 to Lolita Grayson.Alan Grayson's wife files for divorce; Orlando Sentinel; Scott Powers; January 7, 2014 The couple separated in March 2014, and Alan Grayson asked a court in Orlando to annul the marriage a year later.

It was governed by a local dynasty of princes of the Wizlawiden (House of Wizlaw) dynasty. For at least part of this period, R√ºgen was subject to the Holy Roman Empire.  Danish conquest and conversion  Slavic stone embedded in St. Mary's walls, Bergen auf R√ºgen, probably the tombstone of Jaromar I The Danes conquered the Rani stronghold of Arkona in 1168. The rulers of the Rani became vassals of the Danish king, and the Slavic population was gradually Christianized. In the 12th century, the Duchy of R√ºgen not only functioned as a bridgehead for Danish expansions into Vendland, but also Rani forces successfully participated in Danish raids into Circipania and areas conquered by Pomerania's Wartislaw I in the 1120s. After Pomerania became part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1181, it sent out a navy in 1184 to subdue R√ºgen for the empire, too. A Danish and Rani counterattack destroyed the Pomeranian navy in the Bay of Greifswald, granting Danish access to all of the Wendish Baltic coast and making Denmark the predominant power until 1227. In the Battle of Bornh√∂ved in 1227, the Danes again lost all Wendish lands except for R√ºgen. After the Danish conquest, the princes moved their capital from Charenza to nearby Rugard (now incorporated in Bergen auf R√ºgen). While the island of R√ºgen was incorporated into the Danish Archdiocese of Roskilde, the mainland portion was incorporated into the Saxon Bishopric of Schwerin as a compensation for the Duchy of Saxony's aid in the conquest. Rugia as Danish vassal Tetzlav was mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus already in 1164 as a king. After the Danish conquest, he became a prince, and in 1170 was succeeded by his brother, Jaromar I (d. 1218). After Jaromar, the succession of Slavic princes under Danish vassalage was as follows: * 1218‚Äì1221 Barnuta (oldest son of Jaromar I, ancestor of the House of Gristow) * 24 November 1221 ‚Äì 1249 Wizlaw I (Barnuta's brother) * 1249‚Äì1260 Jaromar II (son of Wizlaw I) * 1260‚Äì1302 Wizlaw II (son of Jaromar II) * 1303‚Äì1304 Sambor and Wizlaw III (sons of Wizlaw II, Sambor died in 1304) * 1304‚Äì1325 Wizlaw IIIWerner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.100-101, =Population movements= Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona, by Laurits Tuxen When R√ºgen became a Danish principality, not only religion changed. In the course of the Ostsiedlung, large numbers of German settlers had been encouraged to come to R√ºgen by the Rani prince Jaromar I and his successors. In the early 13th century, the mainland section of the duchy, which in large parts consisted of woodland, was settled by Germans, who established new villages and towns through large scale deforestation campaigns as well as settling in existing Rani dwellings. The first German settlements are recorded in the Ryck valley and the Tribsees area in the Trebel valley. The German settlement on the islands of R√ºgen started only in the 14th century, when the mainland was already densely German settled. In the following centuries, Rani and German population mixed and shared a common fate. As the Rani language, culture and administration was transformed into German in the 13th century, the Rani ceased to exist as a distinguishable ethnic group. Danes and Danish property are recorded also. =Foundation of abbeys= The Dargun Abbey, founded 1272 by the Pomeranian dukes, was also sponsored by the Rugian dukes with land. Ostsiedlung was enhanced by abbeys founded on behalf of the princes of R√ºgen: *1193 Bergen Abbey *1199 Hilda abbey (later Eldena, erected by Danish monks from Esrom Abbey that had been in Dargun Abbey before) *1231 Neuenkamp Abbey (erected by monks from Lower Saxon Altenkamp) *1296 Hiddensee Abbey The abbeys were granted vast lands, in part turned over from the former temple estates. Wittow had been Arkona's temple isle before the Danish conquest, and the other temples, e.g. in Charenza, also had rich possessions. Towns were either built within a clearance or near an older Rani burgh and granted L√ºbeck law when grown to a respective size. The date L√ºbeck law was granted is given in the following list as it is usually seen as the town's anniversary, even if the town itself was projected and built earlier: *1234 Stralsund *1255 Barth *1258 Damgarten *1270 R√ºgenwalde *1285 Grimmen One exception is the town of Greifswald: While projected and built while within the Principality of R√ºgen, the area was claimed by the Griffin Duchy of Pomerania before it was granted market rights in 1241 by the Rugian and Pomeranian dukes in common and granted L√ºbeck law not by the Rugians, but by the Pomeranian duke alone. The other exception is the town of Schadegast: Founded close to Stralsund, the town had to be levelled on behalf of the Stralsund burghers in 1269. =Military expeditions= After the 1168 Danish conquest, the Rugian dukes became a valuable ally to the Danes who participated in many Danish expeditions: *1177 Rugian troops participate in Danish raids of Usedom, Wollin and the County of G√ºtzkow *1178 Rugian troops participate in a Danish raid of the terra Wusterhusen and Wolgast *1184 Battle of the Bay of Greifswald: The Rugian navy encounters the Pomeranian navy on its way to conquer R√ºgen and entirely defeats it. This made way for the Danes to again loot Usedom and Wolgast. *1185 Rugian troops participate in Danish raids of the Peene river estituary and Cammin *1219 Rugian troops participate in Danish conquest of Estonia *1259 Rugian troops raid Seeland aiding Christopher I of Denmark in a civil war with the archbishops of Lund, the Rugians sacked Copenhagen, raided Skane and Lolland *1260 Rugian troops take Lilleborg fortress (Bornholm) = Territorial changes = In 1235, Wizlaw I gained half of the terra Wolgast, yet lost it to the Pomeranian dukes before 1250. Wizlaw II did not succeed in inheriting Schlawe-Stolp from his mother, but gained the terra Loitz in 1275  Princes of R√ºgen = Tetzlav (1168‚Äì1170) = In 1168 after the capture of the fortress and temple on Arkona and Charenza by Valdemar I of Denmark the R√ºgen princes finally had to pay feudal homage to the Danes. In addition to handing over the temple treasure to the Danes and transferring the estates owned by the temple to the Church, the R√ºgen princes were obliged to render knights' service in case of war, to pay annual taxes, to provide hostages and to adopt Christianity. Tetzlav (died 1170) who was described by Saxo Grammaticus in 1164 as king, was from then on titled the Prince of R√ºgen. = Jaromar I (1170‚Äì1218) = His brother and successor, Prince Jaromar I (died 1218), accepted Danish supremacy and promoted the adoption of Christianity. By 1169, the Pope had placed the island of R√ºgen within the bishopric of Roskilde. In 1178, the Bishopric of Schwerin, which was in Henry the Lion's domain and was involved in the R√ºgen campaign under Bishop Berno, was given responsibility for all the mainland territories of R√ºgen apart from Ryck. Donations of estates by the Pomeranian prince, Casimir I from the areas around P√ºtte and Barth to Dargun Abbey, founded in 1172 by Danish monks, show that, at that time, Pomerania extended well into R√ºgen's mainland territories through the region of Borgwallsee to Barth. In 1177, R√ºgen troops supported military campaigns by the Danes to Wollin, Usedom and G√ºtzkow, and, in 1178, to Wusterhusen and Wolgast Jaromar I resided from 1180 on the Rugard near Bergen. In 1182, when the Danish king, Knut VI, refused 1182 to pay feudal homage to the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the Duke of Pomerania, Bogislaw I, is supposed to have contemplated forcing Knut VI to do so. But first he had to conquer R√ºgen. However, in 1184, the Pomeranian navy was defeated in the Bay of Greifswald by the Danish-R√ºgen fleet. The Danes then plundered the areas around Wolgast, Usedom and Wollin. The following year they again ravaged the countryside around the Peene estuary and Cammin and destroyed the castle of Groswin at Stolpe. Finally, Bogislaw I was forced to submit to Danish suzerainty. Two years after Bogislaw I died in 1187, the Danish king appointed the Prince of R√ºgen, Jaromar I, as guardian of Bogislaw's minor sons. Jaromar I was able to use this opportunity to considerably expand his domain, as gifts to Bergen Abbey, founded in 1193, indicate. These estates included both land around Barth and Tribsees as well as around G√ºtzkow and Ziethen. In the border dispute between Jaromar I and the widow of Bogislaw I, Knut VI awarded the estates of Miserez (near Jarmen) and Loitz to G√ºtzkow Castle which was in R√ºgen's hands. Jaromar was given Tribsees and Wusterhusen as a fief. On the founding of the Hilda Abbey at the mouth of the Ryck in 1199, Jaromar I granted large areas of land on both sides of the Ryck to the abbey. The sons of Bogislaw I, who were now of age, confirmed these grants in 1216 and 1219, after they had gained possession of G√ºtzkow. Until 1240, the Ryck marked the boundary between the Principality of R√ºgen and the Duchy of Pomerania. = Barnuta (1218‚Äì1221) = After Jaromar I's death in 1218, his son Barnuta became his successor. However, he stepped down in 1221, leaving the government of the principality to his brother, Vitslav I. = Vitslav I (24 Nov 1221‚Äì1249) = Vitslav I had taken part as early as 1219 in a military campaign by Waldemar II against Estonia. When Valdemar II lost control of Danish possessions on the southern Baltic Sea coast following his defeat in the Battle of Bornh√∂ved, only the Principality of R√ºgen remained under Danish suzerainty. The first new settlements were established north of the Ryck by Eldena Abbey. In the area around Tribsees, too, the first German settlers were had already arrived by 1221. In the years that followed they also settled in the area of Richtenberg. Vitslav I encouraged this development, by enabling Cistercian monks from the Lower Rhine to found Neuenkamp Abbey in the region in 1231. The result was a rising influx of German settlers into an area of forest in the southern part of R√ºgen's mainland territory, 300 hides in area, which had been donated by the monastery with the aim of clearing and cultivating it. Two collateral branches of the princely house, the lords of Gristow and the family of Putbus also encouraged colonization by Germans of their estates in Reinberg and Brandshagen. This period also saw the granting of town rights to Stralsund in 1234, and it evolved into an important trading post. In Loitz Detlef von Gadebusch, who came into the area while Mecklenburg advanced against Pomerania, tried to establish vassal rule similar to that of the Jaczos of Salzwedel with County of G√ºtzkow in Pomerania. It is probably that, in 1244, he also came under the Duchy of Pomerania. On the island of R√ºgen itself, there was no significant German settlement at that time. = Jaromar II (1249‚Äì1260) = From 1246, Jaromar II was co-regent with his father, Vitslav I, who died in 1250. He strove, during his early years in power, to achieve peaceful relations with his Pomeranian neighbours, especially the counts of G√ºtzkow. He encouraged trade, especially with L√ºbeck, and abolished wrecking rights. The destruction of Stralsund in 1249 by an army commissioned by the town of L√ºbeck led to four years of privateering against L√ºbeck-registered ships until L√ºbeck eventually backed down and paid compensation. The estates of the monasteries were greatly expanded under Jaromar II. In 1252, he sold the present-day M√∂nchgut estate of Reddevitz on R√ºgen to Eldena Abbey, and he also promoted the establishment of town-based monasteries in Stralsund. He gave town rights to Barth in 1255 and to Damgarten in 1258. In 1259 he intervened in the conflict between the Danish king, Christopher I and the archbishops of Lund and landed with a R√ºgen army on Zealand. He conquered Copenhagen, routed a peasant army raised by the Queen Dowager, Margaret Sambiria, and devastated large parts of Zeeland, Scania and Lolland. In 1260, he landed on Bornholm and destroyed the fort of Lilleborg. In the same year he was killed by a woman who stabbed him in revenge. = Vitslav II (1260‚Äì1302) and Jaromar III (1260‚Äì1282) = Vitslav II, who came to power at the age of 20 after the violent death of his father, tried to improve the relationship between L√ºbeck and Stralsund by renewing trade agreements. At the behest of Stralsund, he had the nearby town of Schadegard, founded in 1269, razed. In 1270, as a result of his mother's claims, he came into the possession of the fiefdom of Schlawe and founded the city of R√ºgenwalde there. By in 1277 he had sold the estates and town to the margraves of Brandenburg. After the extinction of the line of Detlef von Gadebusch in 1273 he inherited the region of Loitz. In 1283 he formed an alliance with several North German towns and other princes in the Rostock Peace Treaty The investiture of Vitslav II in 1283 by the German king, Rudolf, was probably only related to the mainland territory. The regular participation of Vitslav II in Danish royal councils and attestations indicates the perpetuation of the feudal relationship between R√ºgen and the Kingdom of Denmark. In 1285, Grimmen was given town rights by Vitslav. In 1296, Neuenkamp Abbey founded a daughter monastery on the island of Hiddensee. By granting trade monopoly on the island of R√ºgen and the rights to fish for herring to Wittow, hitherto reserved for L√ºbeck, he supported the town of Stralsund, but at the same time hampered the general development of trade and commerce. Prior to his death in 1282, Vitslav II's younger brother, Jaromar III, often served as regent and co-prince. = Vitslav III (1303‚Äì1325) and Sambor III = After Wizlaw II died during a visit to Norway in 1302, his sons, Vitslav III and Sambor III, became joint princes of R√ºgen. Sambor died, however, in 1304. At the instigation of his mother's relatives, Vitslav III had received a courtly, aristocratic education and was a minnesinger. Since his first marriage turned out to be childless, in 1310 his liege lord, the King of Denmark Erik Menved, agreed a contract of inheritance with Vitslav III, whereby the collateral branches of the princely houses of Putbus and Gristow renounced their succession in favour of the Danish crown. Erik Menved tried to enforce his dominance over the developing trading towns in the southern Baltic region. As a vassal of Erik Menveds, Wizlaw III tried to restrict Stralsund's privileges and L√ºbeck rights. The failure of negotiations eventually led to the siege of Stralsund in 1316 by an army under the leadership of Duke Eric I of Saxe-Lauenburg. A night attack by Stralsund ended in a victory over the besieging army and the duke was taken prisoner. Vitslaw III, who had participated in the siege of the town from the seaward side, had to escape. In 1317, there was a peace treaty between the town and its regional ruler. Vitslav III, whose financial situation had been worsened by the war, awarded numerous privileges to Stralsund, gave them the right to his royal taxes and jurisdiction and sold his mint to the town. = Pomeranian dukes (House of Griffins) = * 1325‚Äì1326 Wartislaw IV * 1326‚Äì1368 Bogislaw V, Wartislaw V and Barnim IV * 1368‚Äì1372 Wartislaw VI and Bogislaw VI * 1372‚Äì1394 Wartislaw VI * 1394‚Äì1415 Wartislaw VIII * 1415‚Äì1432/6 Swietobor II * 1432/6-1451 Barnim VIII * 1451‚Äì1457 Wartislaw IX * 1457‚Äì1478 Wartislaw X  Inheritance by the Dukes of Pomerania  While the main branch of the House of Wizlaw (House of R√ºgen) became extinct with the death of Wizlaw III, two branches remained: *The House of Gristow, ancestors of Barnuta. Barnuta resigned for unknown reasons and was entitled \\"Herr\\" (Lord) of the Rugian terra Gristow north of the Ryck river. His descendants remained at Gristow.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.102, *The House of Putbus, a branch derived from the Rugian princes already in pagan times. The members of this branch were entitled \\"Herr\\" of Putbus in Southeast R√ºgen, and in Prussian times were entitled \\"F√ºrst\\" (prince). This branch still exists. The Principality of R√ºgen was inherited by the Griffins ruling the Duchy of Pomerania, after the last Rugian prince Wizlaw III died in 1325 and two wars were fought with Mecklenburg for R√ºgen inheritance (R√ºgischer Erbfolgekrieg). Later history of the region Denmark at several occasions tried to again acquire the principality, yet without or only with temporary success. In 1625, a Danish offer of 150,000 riksdaler for R√ºgen was rejected. During the Swedish-Brandenburgian War (1675‚Äì79) Christian V of Denmark conquered the principality twice, but was unable to keep it afterwards. The last time the principality was under Danish rule was from 1715 until 1721.Martin Meier, Vorpommern n√∂rdlich der Peene unter d√§nischer Verwaltung 1715 bis 1721: Aufbau einer Verwaltung und Herrschaftssicherung in einem eroberten Gebiet, 2007, , The area of the principality retained some special status within the Duchy and later Province of Pomerania, where it was at times the splinter duchy of Pomerania-Barth, Swedish Pomerania and the Regierungsbezirk Stralsund, then referred to as Neuvorpommern.

Schaffner. It stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. The screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling was loosely based on the 1963 French novel La Plan√®te des Singes by Pierre Boulle. Jerry Goldsmith composed the groundbreaking avant-garde score. It was the first in a series of five films made between 1968 and 1973, all produced by Arthur P. Jacobs and released by 20th Century Fox. The film tells the story of an astronaut crew who crash- lands on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins. The script, originally written by Serling, underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began. Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached, but the film's producer Arthur P. Jacobs, upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston, chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film. Schaffner's changes included an ape society less advanced‚Äîand therefore less expensive to depict‚Äîthan that of the original novel. Filming took place between May 21 and August 10, 1967, in California, Utah and Arizona, with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The film's final \\"closed\\" cost was $5.8 million. The film was released in the United States on February 8, 1968, and was a commercial success, earning a lifetime domestic gross of $32.6 million. The film was groundbreaking for its prosthetic makeup techniques by artist John Chambers and was well received by critics and audiences, launching a film franchise, including four sequels, as well as a short-lived television show, animated series, comic books, and various merchandising. In particular, Roddy McDowall had a long-running relationship with the Apes series, appearing in four of the original five films (absent, from the second film of the series, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, in which he was replaced by David Watson in the role of Cornelius), and also in the television series. The original series was followed by Tim Burton's remake Planet of the Apes in 2001 and the reboot series begun by Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011. In 2001, Planet of the Apes was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Teaser, Planet of the Apes (1968) Astronauts Taylor, Landon and Dodge are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes into a lake on an unknown planet after a light-speed voyage. They discover their fourth crew mate, Stewart, dead due to a malfunction. The three abandon their ship when it starts sinking; Taylor remains on board long enough to see that the date is November 25, 3978, two thousand and six years after their departure in 1972. The astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland and discover an oasis in the desert, ignoring eerie scarecrow-like figures around the edge. Their clothes are stolen while they take a swim. The astronauts pursue the thieves, finding their clothes torn to shreds and their supplies pillaged as the perpetrators, a group of mute primitive humans, raid a cornfield. Taylor is shot in the throat and captured by armed gorillas, along with the primitive humans. Dodge is killed and Landon rendered unconscious in the chaos. Taylor is taken to Ape City where he is saved after a blood transfusion administered by two chimpanzees: animal psychologist Zira and surgeon Galen. However, Taylor's throat injury renders him temporarily unable to speak. Taylor is placed with one of the captive primitive humans, whom he later names Nova. He observes the enhanced society of talking apes and in a strict caste system: the gorillas serving as military forces and labourers; the orangutans overseeing the affairs of government and religion; and intellectual chimpanzees being mostly scientists and doctors. While their society is a theocracy similar to the beginnings of the human Industrial Era, the apes consider the primitive humans as vermin. Humans are hunted, either killed outright, enslaved, or used in scientific experiments. Taylor convinces Zira of his intelligence as she and her fianc√© Cornelius, an archaeologist, take an interest in him. Dr. Zaius, their orangutan superior, learns of this and arranges for Taylor to be castrated. Taylor escapes and finds Dodge's stuffed corpse on display in a museum. When Taylor is recaptured, he suddenly regains his speaking abilities and much to the amazement of the onlookers, he shouts: \\"Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!\\" A hearing to determine Taylor's origins is convened. Taylor mentions his two comrades, learning that Landon was subjected to a lobotomy that has rendered him catatonic and unable to speak. Believing Taylor to be of a human tribe from beyond their borders, Zaius privately threatens to castrate and lobotomize Taylor for the truth about where he came from. With help from Zira's nephew Lucius, Zira and Cornelius free Taylor and Nova and take them to the Forbidden Zone, a taboo region outside Ape City where Taylor's ship crashed that has been ruled out of bounds for centuries by ape law. While Cornelius and Zira are intent to gather proof of an earlier non-simian civilization ‚Äì which the former came upon a year before ‚Äì to be cleared of heresy, Taylor is more focused on the evolution of the ape world and to prove he is not of that world. Arriving at the cave, Cornelius is intercepted by Zaius and his soldiers, with Taylor holding them off while threatening to shoot. Zaius agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira. Inside, Cornelius displays the remnants of a technologically advanced human society pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve, and to the apes' astonishment, a talking children's doll. Zaius admits to Taylor that he always knew of the ancient human civilization. Taylor nonetheless thinks it best to search for answers, despite being warned that he may not like what he finds. Once Taylor and Nova ride off, Dr. Zaius has the gorillas lay explosives to seal off the cave and destroy the evidence while charging Zira, Cornelius and Lucius with heresy. Taylor and Nova follow the shoreline and discover the remains of the Statue of Liberty, revealing that this \\"alien\\" planet is actually Earth long after a nuclear war. Realizing what Zaius meant earlier, Taylor falls to his knees in despair and condemns humanity for destroying the world.

Jacobs bought the rights for the Pierre Boulle novel before its publication in 1963. Jacobs pitched the production to many studios, but was passed over. After Jacobs made a successful debut as a producer doing What a Way to Go! (1964) for 20th Century Fox and begun pre-production of another movie for the studio, Doctor Dolittle, he managed to convince Fox vice-president Richard D. Zanuck to greenlight Planet of the Apes. One script that came close to being made was written by The Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, though it was finally rejected for a number of reasons. A prime concern was cost, as the technologically advanced ape society portrayed by Serling's script would have involved expensive sets, props, and special effects. The previously blacklisted screenwriter Michael Wilson was brought in to rewrite Serling's script and, as suggested by director Franklin J. Schaffner, the ape society was made more primitive as a way of reducing costs. Serling's stylized twist ending was retained, and became one of the most famous movie endings of all time. The exact location and state of decay of the Statue of Liberty changed over several storyboards. One version depicted the statue buried up to its nose in the middle of a jungle while another depicted the statue in pieces. To convince the Fox Studio that a Planet of the Apes film could be made, the producers shot a brief test scene from a Rod Serling draft of the script, using early versions of the ape makeup, on March 8, 1966. Charlton Heston appeared as an early version of Taylor (named Thomas, as he was in the Serling-penned drafts), Edward G. Robinson appeared as Zaius, while two then- unknown Fox contract actors, James Brolin and Linda Harrison, played Cornelius and Zira. This test footage is included on several DVD releases of the film, as well as the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes. Linda Harrison, at the time, the girlfriend of studio chief Richard D. Zanuck, went on to play Nova in the 1968 film and its first sequel, and had a cameo in Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes more than 30 years later, which was also produced by Zanuck. Although Harrison often opined that the producers had always had her in mind for the role of Nova, they had, in fact, considered first Ursula Andress, then Raquel Welch, and Angelique Pettyjohn. When these three women proved unavailable or uninterested, Zanuck gave the part to Harrison. Dr. Zaius was originally to have been played by Robinson, but he backed out due to the heavy makeup and long sessions required to apply it. Robinson's final film, Soylent Green (1973), starred his one-time Ten Commandments (1956) co- star, Heston. Michael Wilson's rewrite kept the basic structure of Serling's screenplay but rewrote all the dialogue and set the script in a more primitive society. According to associate producer Mort Abrahams an additional uncredited writer (his only recollection was that the writer's last name was Kelly) polished the script, rewrote some of the dialogue and included some of the more heavy-handed tongue-in-cheek dialogue (\\"I never met an ape I didn't like\\") which wasn't in either Serling or Wilson's drafts. According to Abraham some scenes, such as the one where the judges imitate the \\"See no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil\\" monkeys, were improvised on the set by director Franklin J. Schaffner and kept in the final film because of the audience reaction during test screenings prior to release. During filming John Chambers, who designed prosthetic make-up in the film, held training sessions at 20th Century-Fox studios, where he mentored other make-up artists of the film. =Filming= The astronauts' journey from their downed ship was filmed along the Colorado River in Glen Canyon. Filming began on May 21, 1967, and ended on August 10, 1967. Most of the early scenes of a desert-like terrain were shot in northern Arizona near the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River, Lake Powell, Glen Canyon and other locations near Page, Arizona Most scenes of the ape village, interiors and exteriors, were filmed on the Fox Ranch in Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles, essentially the backlot of 20th Century Fox. The concluding beach scenes were filmed on a stretch of California seacoast between Malibu and Oxnard with cliffs that towered above the shore. Reaching the beach on foot was virtually impossible, so cast, crew, film equipment, and even horses had to be lowered in by helicopter. The home movies of Roddy McDowall (on YouTube) show makeup, the Ape Village set and the beach site/set - a wooden ramp was built around the point from Westward Beach to Pirates Cove for access to the beach set. The remains of the Statue of Liberty were shot in a secluded cove on the far eastern end of Westward Beach, between Zuma Beach and Point Dume in Malibu. As noted in the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes, the special effect shot of the half-buried statue was achieved by seamlessly blending a matte painting with existing cliffs. The shot looking down at Taylor was done from a scaffold, angled over a 1/2-scale papier-mache model of the Statue. The actors in Planet of the Apes were so affected by their roles and wardrobe that, when not shooting, they automatically segregated themselves with the species they were portraying. =Taylor's spacecraft= The spacecraft onscreen is never actually named in the film; however, for the 40th anniversary release of the Blu-ray edition of the film, in the short film created for the release titled A Public Service Announcement from ANSA, the ship is named Liberty 1. The ship had originally been called \\"Immigrant One\\" in an early draft of the script, and then called \\"Air Force One\\" in a test set of Topps Collectible cards, and dubbed \\"Icarus\\" by a fan; that name gained popularity among Ape fandom. Reception=Critical response= Planet of the Apes was met with critical acclaim and is widely regarded as a classic film and one of the best films of 1968, applauded for its imagination and its commentary on a possible world gone upside down. Pauline Kael called it \\"one of the most entertaining science- fiction fantasies ever to come out of Hollywood.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"much better than I expected it to be. It is quickly paced, completely entertaining, and its philosophical pretensions don't get in the way.\\" Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote, \\"It is no good at all, but fun, at moments, to watch.\\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it \\"an amazing film.\\" He thought the script \\"at times digresses into low comedy,\\" but \\"the totality of the film works very well.\\"Murphy, Arthur D. (February 7, 1968). \\"Film Reviews: Planet of the Apes\\". Variety. 6. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"A triumph of artistry and imagination, it is at once a timely parable and a grand adventure on an epic scale.\\"Thomas, Kevin (March 24, 1968). \\"'Planet of Apes' Out of This World\\". Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 18. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called it an \\"amusing and unusually engrossing picture.\\"Coe, Richard L. (April 12, 1968). \\"The Simians Take a Planet\\". The Washington Post. B6. , the film held an 86% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews with an average rating of 7.63/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Planet of the Apes raises thought- provoking questions about our culture without letting social commentary get in the way of the drama and action.\\" In 2008, the film was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. =Box office= According to Fox records the film required $12,850,000 in theater rentals to break even and made $20,825,000a large profit for the studio. =Accolades= The film won an honorary Academy Award for John Chambers for his outstanding make-up achievement. The film was nominated for Best Costume Design (Morton Haack) and Best Original Score for a Motion Picture (not a Musical) (Jerry Goldsmith). The score is known for its avant-garde compositional techniques, as well as the use of unusual percussion instruments and extended performance techniques, as well as his 12-tone music (the violin part using all 12 chromatic notes) to give an eerie, unsettled feel to the planet, mirroring the sense of placelessness. ;American Film Institute Lists *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies‚ÄîNominated *AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills‚Äî#59 *AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains: **Colonel George Taylor‚ÄîNominated Hero *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: **\\"Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!\\"‚Äî#66 *AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores‚Äî#18 *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)‚ÄîNominated *AFI's 10 Top 10‚ÄîNominated Science Fiction Film National Film Registry Among the 25 Films inducted into the Library of Congress for the year 2001. Legacy=Original series sequels= Writer Rod Serling was brought back to work on an outline for a sequel. Serling's outline was ultimately discarded in favor of a story by associate producer Mort Abrahams and writer Paul Dehn, which became the basis for Beneath the Planet of the Apes. The original film series had four sequels: *Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) *Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) *Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) *Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) =Television series= *Planet of the Apes (1974) *Return to the Planet of the Apes (animated) (1975) =Remake= *Planet of the Apes (2001): The film was a re-imagining of the original film, directed by Tim Burton. =Reboot series= *Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011): A series reboot, directed by Rupert Wyatt, was released on August 5, 2011 to critical and commercial success.

Dark Horse Comics published an adaptation for the 2001 Tim Burton film. Currently Boom! Studios has the licensing rights to Planet of the Apes. Its stories tell the tale of Ape City and its inhabitants before Taylor arrived. In July 2014, Boom! Studios and IDW Publishing published a crossover between Planet of the Apes and the original Star Trek series. In 2018, the original 1968 film's unused screenplay by Rod Serling was adapted into a graphic novel entitled Planet of the Apes: Visionaries. =In popular culture= A parody of the film series titled \\"The Milking of the Planet That Went Ape\\" was published in Mad Magazine. It was illustrated by Mort Drucker and written by Arnie Kogen in regular issue #157, March 1973. The Simpsons parodied the film in the episode \\"A Fish Called Selma\\".

Although it is in Canada, the inn is similar to Grossinger's and the Concord Hotel in the Catskills of New York, which also saw their heyday in the mid-20th century. With playful 16mm home video footage, interviews with people who once worked and vacationed at the family-run inn, and the filmmaker's father's own memories of the family's prized hotel, the film recreates the magic of this spot while telling the history of how the phenomenon came to be, how it flourished, and, finally, why it declined. The documentary shows this unique time period through numerous vacationer's anecdotes. For example, one old man laughs at his young self, recalling the time he and his teenage friends once stirred up trouble by showing up to a formal dining hall wearing dress shirts, ties, and suit jackets ‚Äî but no pants. History of Jewish Resorts in North America In the 1930s, restrictions against Jews were common in the North American hotel industry. When someone with a Jewish-sounding last name called to make a reservation, hotels would often lie and say they had no vacancies. Recognizing that Jews needed a place where they could get away without having to worry about antisemitism, one Canadian-Jewish couple sold their deli and bought a beautiful 150-room hotel on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka, just north of Toronto. The Monteith Inn became a popular vacation spot, where guests could relax in the countryside and enjoy the steady stream of talented entertainers that passed through. Eventually, the government put an end to the antisemitic practices that made Jewish resorts necessary. Social reform and a terrible natural disaster spurred the decline of the Monteith Inn, but it and other hotels like it have left their traces in old family videos and memories.

Born in Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight, he grew up in a radical tradition. His father, Philip William Bagwell (1885-1958), was a conscientious objector in the First World War, and although Bagwell rejected pacifism, he maintained a lifelong commitment to radical social causes associated with Christian socialism, a commitment that infused all his major published work. Bagwell was a lifelong advocate of public transport and especially of the economic, social and cultural virtues of railway travel. He wrote the official history of the National Union of Railwaymen, published in two volumes in 1963 and 1982. His The Transport Revolution became essential reading on university economic and social history courses. He spent most of his career (from 1951) at the Polytechnic of Central London (later the University of Westminster), where in 1972 he was given one of the first professorships created in the polytechnic sector of British higher education. He continued to write influential and impeccably researched books, pamphlets and articles on public and communal issues in transport policy in a period when official opinion in Britain was gradually swinging increasingly towards purely private emphases. A committed Christian and an active Methodist, he also wrote the standard history of the West London Mission, British Methodism's most ambitious and extensive long-term project of service to the poor and disadvantaged in central London, and particularly associated with Donald Soper. A researcher of tireless energy, at the time of his death, aged 92, he was writing a new book on global warming and transport policy, a topic he saw as of crucial moral and social significance for the future.

Tsybikov specialized in ethnography, Buddhist Studies, and after 1917 was an important educator and statesman in Siberia and Mongolia. Tsybikov is mostly credited for being the first photographer of Tibet, including Lhasa. His travelogue, issued in Russian in 1919, 1981, and 1991, and translated into several languages (Chinese, Czech, English, French, and Polish), included a lot of materials from Tibetan sources on Tibetan history and first-hand accounts on Tibetan affairs of the time, making it an important reference source.

Upon the traditional divisions, his family belonged to a Khori Buryat tribe of Kubdut, clan of Nokhoi Kubdut. His father Tsebek Montuyev studied Mongolian and Tibetan written languages and was locally elected to represent his kinsmen. Originally his idea was to send Gombojab to a Buddhist monastery to study, but later he sent his son to Aga (Orthodox Christian) parish school to study Russian, and later to Chita Gymnasium which Gombojab finished with honors. This earned him a Korf scholarship so that he could pursue a university degree. At that time he set his mind on becoming a medical doctor. In mid-1890s in Tomsk University, while studying medicine, Gombojab Tsybikov met Dr Peter Badmayev who offered his support insisting that Tsybikov pursues a career in Asian affairs and studies in St Petersburg University. Preparing for this new major, Tsybikov spent some time in Urga at Badmayev's Buryat school, studying Chinese, Mongolian, and Manchu languages. In 1895 he enrolled at the Oriental Faculty of St Petersburg University with a grant from P. Badmaev. Later he lost Badmaev's support as it required Tsybikov's conversion from Buddhism to Christianity, which Tsybikov declined. He was able to continue studies with funds raised at his native place, and graduated summa cum laude in 1899. = Travel to Tibet = Soon after his graduation, the Academy sent Gombojab Tsybikov to explore Tibet. He left Russia by way of Mongolia, for Lhasa, Tibet, in a group of Buryat and Kalmyk pilgrims. He used experiences of British explorers to hide equipment and notes. The travel started in 1899 and finished in 1902. In Tibet proper, mostly in and around Lhasa, Tsybikov spent 888 days from 1900 to 1901. There, he secretly made around 200 pictures. These, together with pictures made independently on the same pilgrimage by another, less documented Russian explorer, Kalmyk Ovshe Norzunov (Tsybikov arriving in Lhasa in August 1900, and Norzunov in the end of the year),–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤ –ê.–ò. \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–π –¢–∏–±–µ—Ç–∞ –∏ –õ—Ö–∞—Å—ã\\" were later to become the so-called Hallmark for National Geographic.

As the Dalai Lama fled the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and resided for some time in Urga, Mongolia, he had series of talks with variety of Russian representatives. In these talks, Gombojab Tsybikov served as an interpreter. The Dalai Lama also received, with delight, an edition of Tsybikov's and Norzunov's pictures of Tibet issued by Russian Geographic Society. However, after the catastrophic defeat in the Russo-Japanese war, the Russian Empire dismantled its active involvement in Tibetan affairs. Tsybikov's other activities between the traveling and the Russian Revolution (1917) were academical.

British Library Cotton MS Claudius D.vi, f.12v., www.bl.uk>item99771 British Library, London, England. Hadrian's Wall (), also known as the Roman Wall, Picts' Wall, or Vallum Hadriani in Latin, is a former defensive fortification of the Roman province of Britannia, begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor Hadrian. It ran from the banks of the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea, and allowed the Roman Empire to project power some distance to the north, into the lands of the northern Ancient Britons, including the Picts. It had a stone base and a stone wall. There were milecastles with two turrets in between. There was a fort about every five Roman miles. From north to south, the wall comprised a ditch, wall, military way and vallum, another ditch with adjoining mounds. It is thought the milecastles were staffed with static garrisons, whereas the forts had fighting garrisons of infantry and cavalry. In addition to the wall's defensive military role, its gates may have been customs posts. A significant portion of the wall still stands and can be followed on foot along the adjoining Hadrian's Wall Path. The largest Roman archaeological feature in Britain, it runs a total of in northern England. Regarded as a British cultural icon, Hadrian's Wall is one of Britain's major ancient tourist attractions. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. In comparison, the Antonine Wall, thought by some to be based on Hadrian's wall (the Gillam hypothesis), was not declared a World Heritage site until 2008.\\"Wall gains World Heritage status\\" BBC News.

Dimensions Limestone Corner from Bruce's Handbook to the Roman Wall (1885) Hadrian's Wall was 80 Roman miles or long; its width and height varied according to the construction materials available nearby. East of the River Irthing, the wall was made from squared stone and measured wide and high , while west of the river the wall was originally made from turf and measured wide and high; it was later rebuilt in stone. These dimensions do not include the wall's ditches, berms and forts. The central section measured eight Roman feet wide () on a base. Some parts of this section of the wall survive to a height of . Immediately south of the wall, a large ditch was dug, with adjoining parallel mounds, one on either side. This is known today as the Vallum, even though the word vallum in Latin is the origin of the English word wall, and does not refer to a ditch. In many places ‚Äì for example Limestone Corner ‚Äì the Vallum is better preserved than the wall, which has been robbed of much of its stone. Route Route of Hadrian's Wall, almost from coast to coast. Ordnance Survey map of Hadrian's Wall, published in 1964. A revised and updated edition was published in 2010. Sections of Hadrian's Wall still remain, particularly in its hilly central sector. Little remains in lowland regions, where the Wall was previously plundered as a source of free stone for new buildings. Hadrian's Wall extended west from Segedunum at Wallsend on the River Tyne, via Carlisle and Kirkandrews-on-Eden, to the shore of the Solway Firth, ending a short but unknown distance west of the village of Bowness-on- Solway. The A69 and B6318 roads follow the course of the wall from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle, then along the northern coast of Cumbria (south shore of the Solway Firth). Although the curtain wall ends near Bowness-on-Solway, this does not mark the end of the line of defensive structures. The system of milecastles and turrets is known to have continued along the Cumbria coast as far as Risehow, south of Maryport. For classification purposes, the milecastles west of Bowness-on-Solway are referred to as Milefortlets. Purpose of construction Hadrian's Wall facing east towards Crag Lough. The rocky outcrop is the Whin Sill, of volcanic origin. Hadrian's Wall was probably planned before Hadrian's visit to Britain in 122. According to restored sandstone fragments found in Jarrow which date from 118 or 119, it was Hadrian's wish to keep \\"intact the empire\\", which had been imposed on him via \\"divine instruction\\".Anthony Everitt, Hadrian and the Triumph of Rome (2009), Random House, Inc, 448 pages; . Although Hadrian's biographer wrote was the first to build a wall 80 miles long to separate the Romans from the barbarians\\", reasons for the construction of the wall vary, and no recording of an exact explanation survives. Theories have been presented by historians, mostly of an expression of Roman power and Hadrian's policy of defence before expansion. On his accession to the throne in 117, there was unrest and rebellion in Roman Britain and from the peoples of various conquered lands across the Empire, including Egypt, Judea, Libya and Mauretania. These troubles may have influenced Hadrian's plan to construct the wall as well as his construction of frontier boundaries in other areas of the Empire, but to what extent is unknown. Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become Northumberland and the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts. The frontiers of Rome were never expected to stop tribes from migrating or armies from invading, and while a frontier protected by a palisade or stone wall would help curb cattle-raiders and the incursions of other small groups,Stephen Johnson (2004) Hadrian's Wall, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc, 128 pages, the economic viability of constructing and keeping guarded a wall long along a sparsely populated border to stop small-scale raiding is dubious. Another possible explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Frontiers did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond them. People within and beyond the frontier travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check- points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways, patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around. Construction Coria, viewed along the Stanegate road. Construction started in 122 and was largely completed in six years.Wilson, 271. Construction started in the east, between milecastles four and seven, and proceeded westwards, with soldiers from all three of the occupying Roman legions participating in the work. The route chosen largely paralleled the nearby Stanegate road to the south; the Stanegate predated Hadrian's Wall by about thirty years, and would have been a crucial supply route for its construction, as it seems that the Military Way connecting-road alongside Hadrian's Wall was not built until decades later. The Stanegate ran from Luguvalium (Carlisle) to Coria (Corbridge), where there was a bridge over the River Tyne, and a junction with Dere Street which connected with the south. Along Stanegate were situated a series of forts, including Vindolanda, which could have offered protection and supplies during the building of the wall. To the north, the wall in its central and best-preserved section follows a hard, resistant igneous dolerite or diabase rock escarpment, known as the Whin Sill. The initial plan called for a ditch and wall with 80 small gated milecastle fortlets, one placed every Roman mile, holding a few dozen troops each, and pairs of evenly-spaced intermediate turrets used for observation and signalling. However, very few milecastles are actually sited at exact Roman mile divisions: they can be up to east or west because of landscape features or to improve signalling to the Stanegate forts to the south.Woolliscroft, D., 1989, \\"Signalling and the design of Hadrian's Wall\\", Archaeologia Aeliana 5th Series, Vol. XVII, pp. 5‚Äì20. Local limestone was used in the construction, except for the section to the west of the River Irthing where turf was originally used instead, for unknown reasons; it was later rebuilt in stone. Milecastles in this area were also built from timber and earth rather than stone, but turrets were always made from stone. The Broad Wall was initially built with a clay-bonded rubble core and mortared dressed-rubble facing stones, but this seems to have made it vulnerable to collapse, and repair with a mortared core was sometimes necessary. The milecastles and turrets were of three different designs, depending on which Roman legion built them ‚Äì inscriptions of the II Augusta, VI Victrix, and XX Valeria Legions show that all were involved in the construction. The turrets were about apart and measured internally. Construction was divided into lengths of about . One group of each legion would excavate the foundations and build the milecastles and turrets, and then other cohorts would follow with the wall construction. The wall was finished in 128. =\\"Broad Wall\\" and \\"Narrow Wall\\"= Vallum earthwork adjoining Hadrian's Wall near Milecastle 42 (Cawfields) Early in its construction, just after reaching the North Tyne, the width of the wall was narrowed to or even less (sometimes as little as ) (the \\"Narrow Wall\\"). However, Broad Wall foundations had already been laid as far as the River Irthing, where the Turf Wall began, demonstrating that construction worked from east to west. Many turrets and milecastles were optimistically provided with wider stub \\"wing walls\\" in preparation for joining to the Broad Wall, offering a handy reference for archaeologists trying to piece together the construction chronology. Within a few years it was decided to add a total of 14 to 17 (sources disagree) full-sized forts along the length of the wall, including Vercovicium (Housesteads) and Banna (Birdoswald), each holding between 500 and 1,000 auxiliary troops (no legions were posted to the wall). The eastern end of the wall was extended further east from Pons Aelius (Newcastle) to Segedunum (Wallsend) on the Tyne estuary. Some of the larger forts along the wall, such as Cilurnum (Chesters) and Vercovicium (Housesteads), were built on top of the footings of mile castles or turrets, showing the change of plan. An inscription mentioning early governor Aulus Platorius Nepos indicates that the change of plans took place early on. Also, sometime during Hadrian's reign (before 138) the wall west of the Irthing was rebuilt in sandstone to about the same dimensions as the limestone section to the east. Cross section of the completed works After most of the forts had been added, the Vallum was built on the southern side. The wall was thus part of a defensive system which, from north to south, included: * A row of forts built north of the wall, used for scouting and intelligence (e.g. Bewcastle Roman Fort) * a glacis, an upward slope to deter assailants, backed by a deep ditch * a berm, a flat area in front of the wall, with rows of pits concealing stakes or thorns * The curtain wall itself * a later connecting road, known as the Military Way * The Vallum, two embankments with a ditch between them Housesteads fort, showing the Knag Burn Gateway in the valley. The very flat top of the wall at left is a sign of modern consolidation. =Turf wall= From Milecastle 49 to the western terminus of the wall at Bowness-on-Solway, the curtain wall was originally constructed from turf, possibly due to the absence of limestone for the manufacture of mortar. Subsequently, the Turf Wall was demolished and replaced with a stone wall. This took place in two phases; the first (from the River Irthing to a point west of Milecastle 54), during the reign of Hadrian, and the second following the reoccupation of Hadrian's Wall subsequent to the abandonment of the Antonine Wall (though it has also been suggested that this second phase took place during the reign of Septimius Severus). The line of the new stone wall follows the line of the turf wall, apart from the stretch between Milecastle 49 and Milecastle 51, where the line of the stone wall is slightly further to the north. In the stretch around Milecastle 50TW, it was built on a flat base with three to four courses of turf blocks. A basal layer of cobbles was used westwards from Milecastle 72 (at Burgh-by-Sands) and possibly at Milecastle 53. Where the underlying ground was boggy, wooden piles were used. At its base, the now- demolished turf wall was wide, and built in courses of turf blocks measuring long by deep by high, to a height estimated at around . The north face is thought to have had a slope of 75%, whereas the south face is thought to have started vertical above the foundation, quickly becoming much shallower. =Standards= Above the stone curtain wall's foundations, one or more footing courses were laid. Offsets were introduced above these footing courses (on both the north and south faces), which reduced the wall's width. Where the width of the curtain wall is stated, it is in reference to the width above the offset. Two standards of offset have been identified: Standard A, where the offset occurs above the first footing course, and Standard B, where the offset occurs after the third (or sometimes fourth) footing course. Garrison According to Sheppard Frere, the garrison reflected the political rather than military purpose of the wall. The wall provided the soldiers with an elevated platform from which they could safely observe movement of the local population. It had \\"heavy provision of cavalry\\" which could sally out from any of the milestone gates though as mentioned earlier, the garrison was neither expected nor trained to the level necessary to defend a city wall. Overall the fortifications appear to have required additional strengthening after the initial design and were stronger than their equivalent in Germany, probably reflecting local resentment. Frere believes that the milecastles, which would have needed 1,000 to 1,500 men, were held by a patrolling garrison of numeri, though he concedes that there are no inscriptions referring to numeri in Britain at the time. Command headquarters was at Uxelodunum (nowadays called Stanwix) near Carlisle, where the Ala Gallorum Petriana was based. A signalling system allowed communication in minutes between Stanwix and York. Further information on the garrisoning of the wall has been provided by the discovery of the Vindolanda tablets, such as the record of an inspection on 18 May of a year 92 and 97, where only 456 of the full quota of 756 Belgae troops were present, the rest being sick or otherwise absent. After Hadrian Leahill Turret in Cumbria, England is a typical example of the intermediate turrets built into the Wall between the milecastles. In the years after Hadrian's death in 138, the new emperor, Antoninus Pius, left the wall occupied in a support role, essentially abandoning it. He began building a new wall called the Antonine Wall about north, across the isthmus running west- south-west to east-north-east. This turf wall ran 40 Roman miles, or about , and had significantly more forts than Hadrian's Wall. This area later became known as the Scottish Lowlands, sometimes referred to as the Central Belt or Central Lowlands. Antoninus was unable to conquer the northern tribes, so when Marcus Aurelius became emperor, he abandoned the Antonine Wall and reoccupied Hadrian's Wall as the main defensive barrier in 164. In 208‚Äì211, the Emperor Septimius Severus again tried to conquer Caledonia and temporarily reoccupied the Antonine Wall. The campaign ended inconclusively and the Romans eventually withdrew to Hadrian's Wall. The early historian Bede (AD 672/3-735), following Gildas, wrote (circa AD 730): St Paul's Church in Jarrow in 1782, mentioning Hadrian above and the Province of Britannia below. They are possibly from a dedication slab or a victory monument at the very eastern end of the Wall.RIB 1051. Imperial dedication, romaninscriptionsofbritain.org Bede obviously identified Gildas's stone wall as Hadrian's Wall (actually built in the 120s) and he would appear to have believed that the ditch-and-mound barrier known as the Vallum (just to the south of and contemporary with, Hadrian's Wall) was the rampart constructed by Severus. Many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent. In the same passage, Bede describes Hadrian's Wall as follows: \\"It is eight feet in breadth, and twelve in height; and, as can be clearly seen to this day, ran straight from east to west.\\" Bede by his own accountBede, Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Book 5 Chapter 24, \\"I have spent all the remainder of my life in this monastery.\\" lived his whole life at Jarrow, just across the River Tyne from the eastern end of the Wall at Wallsend, so as he indicates, he would have been very familiar with the Wall. What he does not say is whether there was a walkway along the top of the wall. It might be thought likely that there was, but if so it no longer exists. In the late 4th century, barbarian invasions, economic decline and military coups loosened the Empire's hold on Britain. By 410, the estimated end of Roman rule in Britain, the Roman administration and its legions were gone and Britain was left to look to its own defences and government. Archaeologists have revealed that some parts of the wall remained occupied well into the 5th century. It has been suggested that some forts continued to be garrisoned by local Britons under the control of a Coel Hen figure and former dux. Hadrian's Wall fell into ruin and over the centuries the stone was reused in other local buildings. Enough survived in the 7th century for spolia from Hadrian's Wall (illustrated at right) to find its way into the construction of St Paul's Church in Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, where Bede was a monk. It was presumably incorporated before the setting of the church's dedication stone, still to be seen in the church, precisely dated to 23 April 685.The Buildings of England: County Durham by Nikolaus Pevsner and Elizabeth Williamson (1985 edition), p.338. The inscription reads: . This translates as \\"The dedication of the church of St Paul on the ninth before the kalends of May [23 April] in the fifteenth year of King Ecgfrith and the fourth year of Ceolfrith, abbot, and with God's help the founder of this church\\" (St Paul's Church Jarrow, undated guidebook by Peter Hiscock, p.4). Building the Roman Wall by William Bell Scott, at Wallington Hall; the face of the centurion is that of the antiquarian John Clayton. The painting might imply that the Wall was built by slaves, which it was not. The wall fascinated John Speed, who published a set of maps of England and Wales by county at the start of the 17th century. He described it as \\"the Picts Wall\\" (or \\"Pictes\\"; he uses both spellings). A map of Newecastle (sic), drawn in 1610 by William Matthew, described it as \\"Severus' Wall\\", mistakenly giving it the name ascribed by Bede to the Vallum. The maps for Cumberland and Northumberland not only show the wall as a major feature, but are ornamented with drawings of Roman finds, together with, in the case of the Cumberland map, a cartouche in which he sets out a description of the wall itself. =Preservation by John Clayton= Much of the wall has now disappeared. Long sections of it were used for roadbuilding in the 18th century, especially by General Wade to build a military road (most of which lies beneath the present day B6318 \\"Military Road\\") to move troops to crush the Jacobite insurrection. The preservation of much of what remains can be credited to John Clayton. He trained as a lawyer and became town clerk of Newcastle in the 1830s. He became enthusiastic about preserving the wall after a visit to Chesters. To prevent farmers taking stones from the wall, he began buying some of the land on which the wall stood. In 1834, he started purchasing property around Steel Rigg near Crag Lough. Eventually, he controlled land from Brunton to Cawfields. This stretch included the sites of Chesters, Carrawburgh, Housesteads, and Vindolanda. Clayton carried out excavation at the fort at Cilurnum and at Housesteads, and he excavated some milecastles. Clayton managed the farms he had acquired and succeeded in improving both the land and the livestock. He used the profits from his farms for restoration work. Workmen were employed to restore sections of the wall, generally up to a height of seven courses. The best example of the Clayton Wall is at Housesteads. After Clayton's death, the estate passed to relatives and was soon lost at gambling. Eventually, the National Trust began acquiring the land on which the wall stands. At Wallington Hall, near Morpeth, there is a painting by William Bell Scott, which shows a centurion supervising the building of the wall. The centurion has been given the face of John Clayton. =World Heritage Site= Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and in 2005 it became part of the transnational \\"Frontiers of the Roman Empire\\" World Heritage Site, which also includes sites in Germany. =Tourism= In 2010, to commemorate the 1600th anniversary of the end of Roman rule in Britain, a series of 500 beacons were successively lit along the length of the wall. Although Hadrian's Wall was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, it remains unguarded, enabling visitors to climb and stand on the wall, although this is not encouraged, as it could damage the historic structure. On 13 March 2010, a public event Illuminating Hadrian's Wall took place, which saw the route of the wall lit with 500 beacons. On 31 August and 2 September 2012, there was a second illumination of the wall as a digital art installation called \\"Connecting Light\\", which was part of the London 2012 Festival. In 2018, the organisations which manage the Great Wall of China and Hadrian's Wall signed an agreement to collaborate for the growth of tourism and for historical and cultural understanding of the monuments. =Hadrian's Wall Path= In 2003, a National Trail footpath was opened that follows the line of the wall from Wallsend to Bowness-on-Solway. Because of the fragile landscape, walkers are asked to follow the path only in summer. Roman- period names Hadrian's Wall was known in the Roman period as the vallum (wall) and the discovery of the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan in Staffordshire in 2003 has thrown further light on its name. This copper alloy pan (trulla), dating to the 2nd century, is inscribed with a series of names of Roman forts along the western sector of the wall: [Bowness-on-Solway] [Drumburgh] [Stanwix] [Castlesteads]. This is followed by . Hadrian's family name was Aelius, and the most likely reading of the inscription is Valli Aelii (genitive), Hadrian's Wall, suggesting that the wall was called by the same name by contemporaries. However, another possibility is that it refers to the personal name Aelius Draco.Hodgson, Hadrian's Wall, p. 23 =Forts= The Latin and Romano-Celtic names of all of the Hadrian's Wall forts are known, from the Notitia Dignitatum and other evidence such as inscriptions: * Segedunum (Wallsend) * Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne) * Condercum (Benwell Hill) * Vindobala (Rudchester)Note the suffix \\"chester\\", reflecting the presence of a Roman castra. * Hunnum (Halton Chesters) * Cilurnum (Chesters aka Walwick Chesters) * Procolita (Carrowburgh) * Vercovicium (Housesteads) * Aesica (Great Chesters) * Magnis (Carvoran) * Banna (Birdoswald) * Camboglanna (Castlesteads) * Uxelodunum (Stanwix. Also known as Petriana) * Aballava (Burgh-by-Sands) * Coggabata (Drumburgh) * Mais (Bowness-on-Solway) Turrets on the wall include: * Leahill Turret * Denton Hall Turret Outpost forts beyond the wall include: * Habitancum (Risingham) * Bremenium (High Rochester) * Fanum Cocidi (Bewcastle) (north of Birdoswald) * Ad Fines (Chew Green) Supply forts behind the wall include: * Alauna (Maryport) * Arbeia (South Shields) * Coria (Corbridge) * Epiacum (Whitley Castle near Alston) * Vindolanda (Little Chesters or Chesterholm) * Vindomora (Ebchester) In popular culture ; Books * Nobel Prize-winning English author Rudyard Kipling contributed to the popular image of the \\"Great Pict Wall\\" in his short stories about Parnesius, a Roman legionary who defended the Wall against the Picts. These stories are a part of the Puck of Pook's Hill anthology, published in 1906. * The Eagle of the Ninth is a celebrated children's novel by Rosemary Sutcliff, published in 1954. It tells the story of a young Roman officer venturing beyond Hadrian's Wall in search of the missing eagle standard of the lost Ninth Legion. It was inspired by the bronze Silchester eagle found in 1866. * American author George R. R. Martin has acknowledged that Hadrian's Wall was the inspiration for The Wall in his best-selling series A Song of Ice and Fire, dramatised in the fantasy TV series Game of Thrones, in which the Wall is also in the north of its country and stretches from coast to coast. * In M J Trow's fictional Britannia series, Hadrian's Wall is the central location, and Coel Hen and Padarn Beisrudd are portrayed as limitanei (frontier soldiers). * Hadrian's Wall by Adrian Goldsworthy is a short history of the wall (April 2018). Google description and preview. Kirkus review. ; Films * The 1991 American romantic action adventure film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves uses Sycamore Gap as a location. * The wall has also been featured in recent films such as Centurion (2010) and The Eagle (2011), both inspired by the novel The Eagle of the Ninth. The wall was a major focal point of the 2004 film King Arthur in which one of the primary gates is opened for the first time since the wall's construction to allow Arthur and his knights passage into the north for their quest. The climactic Battle of Badon between the Britons led by Arthur and his knights, and the Saxons led by Cerdic and his son Cynric, takes place in the film just inside the wall. * The 2007 action adventure film The Last Legion also features Hadrian's Wall as the place where the final battle takes place. * The 2008 science fiction film Doomsday features Hadrian's Wall rebuilt to quarantine Scotland because of a deadly virus. * The 2015 film Dragonheart 3: The Sorcerer's Curse features Hadrian's Wall as a major dramatic focus between the north and south of the kingdom; the wall is later renamed the Dragon's Gate. * The 2014 action thriller The Prince, in a key scene, features John Cusack telling the story of Hadrian‚Äôs Wall as a cautionary tale in the development of the film‚Äôs main character, portrayed by Jason Patrick. ; Music * The opening track from Maxim's first solo effort Hell's Kitchen is named \\"Hadrian's Wall\\". * The second track on the English-American hard rock band Black Country Communion's second album is called \\"The Battle for Hadrian's Wall\\". The lyrics reference outposts separated by a mile each, such as \\"We sit in waiting every mile on Hadrian's Wall\\". ; Television * The final episode in the Blackadder series is the television film Blackadder: Back & Forth. In this episode, Blackadder and Baldrick attempt to collect significant historical souvenirs in order to win a bet. During their adventures, they take note at their own ancestors, one of whom is a Roman defender of Hadrian's Wall who makes slighting remarks about the wall's unimpressive (modern) height. ; Poetry * The English poet W. H. Auden wrote a script for a BBC radio documentary called Hadrian's Wall, which was broadcast on the BBC's north- eastern Regional Programme in 1937. Auden later published a poem from the script, \\"Roman Wall Blues\\", in his book Another Time. The poem is a brief monologue spoken in the voice of a lonely Roman soldier stationed at the wall.

Nine of his paintings are held in the Wolverhampton Art Gallery. Life and work Niemann was born in Islington, London in 1813. His father, John Diedrich Niemann, was a native of Minden, Westphalia and was a member of Lloyd's, working in the City of London. As a young man, Edmund was employed as a clerk at Lloyd's, but he decided to devote himself to art and in 1839 settled in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, mostly painting out of doors. Though he especially enjoyed painting the scenery of the Thames and of the River Swale, near Richmond in Yorkshire, many other areas of the British Isles are covered in the corpus of his work. Between 1844 and 1872, he exhibited paintings at a wide range of prestigious galleries including the Royal Academy, the British Institution, the Society of British Artists in Suffolk St, the Royal Scottish Academy, the Royal Institute, the Glasgow Institute, the Paris Salon, the Liverpool Academy of Arts and the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts. The first picture exhibited was a view \\"On the Thames, near Great Marlow, Bucks\\" ‚Äì a small canvas shown at the Royal Academy in 1844. Richmond on Thames Niemann and a number of other artists, including Edward Armitage were dissatisfied with the exclusiveness showed by the management of several leading art societies. In 1848 Niemann returned to London for the foundation of the 'Free Exhibition' held in the Chinese Gallery at Hyde Park Corner. This exhibition opened with 500 works of art including sculpture. In 1850 this became the Portland Gallery, Regent Street, and Niemann was chosen as one of the trustees and honorary secretary. The society later assumed the name 'The National Institution'. The existence of the society was short lived with 1861 seeing the last of their exhibitions. Niemann lived at Mount Vernon House in Hampstead in the 1850s. His paintings are characterised by great versatility, natural colours, and visual realism, often in the romantic artistic style of J.M.W. Turner, Corot and Caspar David Friedrich. His son, Edward H.

Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008. , p. 105‚Äì106.Parkkari 1970, p. 138‚Äì142. =Initial period= May Day, 1927 Members of the Kotka Young Workers Study Circle, May Day 1928The work of SKNL was difficult due to the repression by the state machinery. However, in the period 1925-1926 SKNL cells were set up around the country. As of September 1925 the SKNL had cells in the Helsinki, Tampere, Pori, Vaasa, Lappeenranta, Vyborg and Kuopio regions. In total there were 40 cells, with 149 members.Parkkari 1970, p. 149‚Äì150. The SKNL was active in the 1927 parliamentary election, campaigning for the Socialist Electoral Organisation of Workers and Smallholders. The youth activist Toivo Latva was elected to parliament.Parkkari 1970, p. 163. The first conference of SKNL was held in Moscow, August 1927. At that time, the organization had 94 cells and 358 members.Parkkari 1970, p. 161. The second conference, which was attended by eight delegates, took place in connection with the congress of the Communist Youth International in August 1928. By then the membership had reached approximately 600, out of whom 20% were women.Parkkari 1970, p. 169‚Äì170. In early 1928 SKNL experienced setbacks, when police arrested dozens of communists after information had been revealed by the arrested SKP organizer Jalmari Rasi. SKNL cadres such as Jaakko Kivi, V√§in√∂ Vuorio and Emil Paananen were arrested. Eino Lehto and Nestori Parkkari remained at large for a brief period, before going into exile in the Soviet Union.Parkkari 1970, p. 166. In May 1929 the SKNL organizer Matti Dahl was caught by police, and documents seized from him were used to arrest SKNL activists such as Eino Hellfors, Jussi Siltanen, Aino Kallio and Toivo L√•ng.Parkkari 1970, p. 180‚Äì181. The first congress of SKNL was held in Stockholm, Sweden, August 10-August 15, 1929. The delegates from Finland travelled by boat from Helsinki or, clandestinely, by motorboat from Jakobstad. The delegates residing in the Soviet Union travelled via Germany. In total there were 22 delegates at the congress. Initially the Stockholm City Library had been selected as the congress venue, but in order to avoid police infiltration the venue was shifted to a private residence. Whilst the congress reaffirmed its commitment to the legacy of the Communist Youth International, it did also criticize the International for not paying enough attention to the sections working in illegal conditions.Parkkari 1970, p. 185‚Äì193. The congress elected a Central Committee of the SKNL. The new leadership got into trouble as soon as they returned Finland. The police was able to identify several congress participants. In late 1929 the leadership of SKNL included Heikki Ilvesviita, Toivo Karvonen, Tatu V√§√§t√§inen, Paavo Kivikoski, Aatto Sallinen, Aili M√§kinen, Airi Virtanen and Reino Tynkkynen.Parkkari 1970, p. 193-194. 1929 saw a rise in clashes between communists demonstrators and police forces. SKP and SKNL formed special defence groups to engage in street-fights with the police. In response, police raided the offices of various organisations connected to SKP and SKNL in Helsinki. Many SKNL cadres were arrested. SKNL also argued intensely against the so-called vacillators, the Left Group of Finnish Workers, which split from the communist controlled fronts after getting fed up with the Comintern's Third Period policies.Parkkari 1970, pp. 195‚Äì198. =Liquidation= In the mid-1930s the Communist International and the Communist Youth International began to orient themselves towards building popular fronts against fascism. The SKNL was directed to work within the Social Democratic Labour Youth League (STL), the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party of Finland. At the time the activity of STL was very low. The secret SKNL cells became fractional units inside the STL. The STL leadership did not like the infiltration, and they instructed district organizations to be vigilant against communist influences. At the STL congress in May 1937 there were around 20-30 representatives of the leftwing opposition, a grouping indirectly tied to the SKNL. Gradually SKNL ceased to function, but the SKP retained some youth work of its own.Parkkari 1970, pp. 249‚Äì268. In 1944, the Democratic Youth League of Finland was founded as the new SKP youth organization. Organisation The members of SKNL were organised in small cells, under the political direction of district organisations. Due to the conspiratory nature of the SKNL organisation, it never became a mass movement. The organisation itself claimed that the membership peaked at around 2,000, but a more realistic figure is that the total membership never reached much higher than 1,000.Vanamo & Gr√∂nholm 1977, p. 40-41Upton, Anthony F. Kommunismi Suomessa (Kirjayhtym√§ 1970), p. 77Karvonen 1947, p. 109Parkkari 1970, p. 288 In the labour movement the existence of SKNL was known, but most people did not know who belonged to the league and/or how it functioned.Karvonen 1947, p. 100. SKNL organised young people between the ages of 14 to 24. Its constitution stipulated that SKNL was an independent organisation, but under the political leadership of SKP. SKP and SKNL were bound to assist each other in all types of activities.Parkkari 1970, pp. 146‚Äì147. The highest decision- making body of SKNL was the congress and the Central Committee. As of 1928 there were seven district organisations of SKNL; Helsinki, Tampere, Vaasa, Viipuri, Kuopio, Oulu and Turku. In 1926 SKP established a youth bureau in Moscow, in order to assist SKNL. The organisers of the youth bureau included Toivo Antikainen, Pekka Paasonen, Hannes M√§kinen, Kaarlo Kosunen, Hertta Kuusinen, Inkeri Lehtinen, Eino Lehto and Ville Honkanen.Parkkari 1970, pp. 150, 162‚Äì163. In the 1920s, left-wing early youth (under 14) work was organised inside Ty√∂v√§en J√§rjest√∂nuorten Liitto. After the TJN was banned this became responsibility of the SKNL. Pioneer groups were built and in the beginning of 1931 a new national organisation was formed under the guidance of SKNL. The SKNL pioneers had activity in the biggest cities and it published Pioneeri. SKNL decided to close down the pioneer wing in 1934‚Äì1935.Parkkari 1970, p. 229‚Äì230. =Organs= The central organ of SKNL was Nuori Kommunisti, which was published clandestinely in Helsinki. In spite of various arrests, the organization was able to bring out an issue of Nuori Kommunisti almost every month. SKNL also published and distributed documents of the Communist Youth International. The propaganda of SKNL reached almost every corner of the country.Karvonen 1947, s. 106‚Äì107. In 1928 Nuori Kommunisti had a circulation of just 175 copies,Parkkari 1970, s. 170. but by 1932 the number had increased to 1,100 copies. Another publication, Nuori Kaarti was also set up. In the period of 1932-1933 the (tens of different) SKNL publications had a combined circulation of about 15 000.Parkkari 1970, p. 238. Other publications under the influence of SKNL included the literary magazine Liekki (1923‚Äì1930). In 1929 Liekki became a political weekly, and had a circulation of 10 000 copies.Karvonen 1947, s. 104‚Äì106.Parkkari 1970, p. 195. During the 1920s, there were also several local publications of SKNL led youth committees such as Taisteleva Nuoriso (Uusimaa), Aate (Turku), Punainen Nuoriso (Vaasa) and Punainen Pohjola (Oulu). =Relationship with the Communist Youth International= As a section of the Communist Youth International, SKNL had to act according to the decisions taken by the International. SKNL had its own representative of the secretariat of the Communist Youth International. Initially, SKNL was represented by Pekka Paasonen. In the beginning of 1927 he was replaced by Kaarlo Kosunen, who in August 1928 was replaced by Inkeri Lehtinen. The fifth world congress of the CYI which was held in 1928 was attended by SKNL delegation consisting of Eino Lehto, Nestori Parkkari, Toivo Karvonen and Eino Hellfors. By the end of 1927 or in 1928, the programme of the CYI was published in Finnish language. The sixth world congress of the International, held in 1935, was attended by the SKNL delegate Veikko Sippola.Parkkari 1970, pp. 152, 162‚Äì163, 167‚Äì169, 257 References Youth wings of political parties in Finland Youth wings of communist parties 1925 establishments in Finland ","title":"Young Communist League of Finland"},{"id":"18618465","text":"Paul F.

It follows a schoolteacher from San Francisco who relocates to a small town in northern California to spend the summer in a house she inherited from her deceased aunt, only to uncover her aunt's past as a devil worshipper, which seems to trigger a series of supernatural occurrences. Plot Jane Hardy, a schoolteacher in San Francisco, suffers a nervous breakdown following a divorce and the simultaneous death of her mother. To emotionally recover, she decides to spend the summer in the rural town of Blackford in a home left to her by her late aunt, Rebecca. Upon arriving, she is given keys to the house by Walter Pritchard, a local attorney who claims Jane's mother once promised to bestow him the property. Shortly after moving in, Jane begins experiencing supernatural occurrences, including witnessing apparitions of her aunt Rebecca, and a ghostly black hearse driven by a mysterious man that pulls into the driveway before vanishing. Furthermore, she is unsettled by the locals' passive-aggressive reactions to her presence in the town, including from Pritchard, who is deliberately unhurried to place the home in her name. Jane hires Paul, the son of the local hardware store owner, to help her make repairs on the home, and finds a trunk in the attic full of her aunt's personal mementos, including a diary in which she wrote of her life as a minister's wife. Late one night, Jane crashes her car on the way home, and is given a ride by Tom Sullivan, a mysterious but kind man passing by in a vintage black car. Tom pays for a tow truck for Jane, and returns the following night with her car. Jane accepts his invitation to go boating on a nearby lake. Later that night, Jane uncovers more details from her aunt Rebecca's diary that reveal Rebecca was indoctrinated by her minister husband, Robert, who was actually a devil worshipper, and convinced her to join him in a pact with Satan. Shortly after, Jane has a vivid nightmare in which she is taken away by the hearse as her aunt watches from the house, and observes her own funeral. Jane's mental stability is further challenged by other odd goings-on in the home, including the sounds of what she believes are people breaking in at night. She later sees a woman from one of her nightmares at the local church, but her fears are assuaged by the Reverend Winston. Once the house is finally probated to Jane, Pritchard confirms to Jane that her aunt Rebecca worshipped Satan, and that upon her death, the hearse carrying her body crashed on the nearby road, but both the driver of the hearse, along with Rebecca's body and her coffin, inexplicably disappeared. Since this event, locals have been haunted by the image of the hearse. Meanwhile, Jane continues her romance with Tom, and after a date, invites him into her home, where they have sex. Jane's romance with Tom upsets Paul, who expresses that he too is attracted to her. One night, after Tom fails to arrive for a date, a drunken Pritchard begins vandalizing the home, causing Jane to flee in terror. Paul arrives shortly after to leave flowers for Jane, only to be attacked by an unseen assailant. Meanwhile, Jane arrives at Tom's house, but finds it inexplicably abandoned and dilapidated; on a table lay a framed antique photo of a young Rebecca with Tom. Behind the home, Jane finds a gravestone inscribed \\"Robert Thomas Sullivan\\". A terrified Jane returns to her home to pack her belongings, intending to leave. In the bathroom, she finds Pritchard's corpse hanging in the shower, along with Paul's body. Jane is confronted by Tom, who professes his love for her, explaining that Rebecca was \\"too weak\\" and did not fulfill her pact with Satan. Promising Jane eternal life, Tom begins to cast a spell on her, but is interrupted by Reverend Winston, who arrives and begins an exorcism to save Jane. She flees in her car, followed by Tom, who chases her in the hearse. The chase ends in a collision that causes the hearse to topple off a cliff and explode. Back at the home, an apparition of Rebecca appears in the window as the house goes dark. CastProduction Principal photography took place in San Francisco and Bradbury, California, beginning October 29, 1979. Filming was completed by January 1980. Two 1952 Packard Funeral Coaches, converted by Henney Motor Company, were used in the film.https://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_432707-Packard-Funeral-Coach-2413-1952.html One of them is prominently featured on the film's poster. Release The Hearse premiered in New York City on June 6, 1980, and had its Los Angeles premiere on September 12 of that year. =Critical response= Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"The Hearse qualifies as this summer's garage sale of horror movies. It contains all the best clich√©s from recent, more successful horror movies (especially [The] Amityville [Horror] and even The Changeling, which came out last April and starred Van Devere, her husband George C. Scott and, of course, the obligatory self-banging doors and self- playing musical instruments).\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \\"The Hearse was directed by George Bowers, and shot either in a very stylized fashion or without benefit of a light meter ‚Äì many of the film's outdoor scenes feature brilliant blue skies and actors with dim, shadowy faces. As far as the horror goes, Mr. Bowers makes his film moderately scary and pretty unpleasant, too. No one gets a hatchet in the forehead, though, the way one of the actors does in Friday the 13th. Isn't that nice to know?\\" =Home media= Rhino Entertainment released The Hearse on DVD on February 12, 2002. In May 2017, Vinegar Syndrome released the film in a Blu-ray/DVD combination pack, featuring a newly restored 2K scan of the original film elements.

It tells the story of a brother and sister living together in their ancestral home which is being \\"taken over\\" by unknown entities. It starts in a realist manner and it slowly introduces a scene in which natural laws are distorted. The mystery that revolves around what those entities are is largely left up to interpretation, allowing the genre of the story to vary from fantasy to psychological fiction to magic realism, among others. Among the resources that are frequent in Cort√°zar's story, graphic signs (such as parenthesis) are used to reflect censorship. The writer based the house on one located in the city of Chivilcoy in the Province of Buenos Aires, which can still be found in the streets Suipacha and Necochea.  Plot  A male narrator and his sister are introduced, both in their early-forties. Each has faced difficulties in their adult lives, the narrator having lost his fianc√©e long ago, and the sister (Irene) having denied two suitors who sought her hand in marriage. Inheriting their parent's house and wealth, they live a quiet, usually mundane, domestic existence. The narrator describes the estate and the siblings' routine in great detail, describing their chores and interests; Irene knits all day, unraveling her work the moment it does not please her, while the narrator collects French literature and buys Irene wool during his visits to the bookstores. Usually, their home is silent, but when one day the narrator suddenly hears something inside another part of the house, the siblings escape to a smaller section, locked behind a solid oak door. In the intervening days, they become frightened and solemn; on the one hand noting that there is less housecleaning, but regretting that the interlopers have prevented them from retrieving many of their personal belongings. All the while, they can occasionally hear noises from the other side. Eventually, the narrator hears \\"them\\" take over the section of the house he and Irene have been forced into. Hurriedly, the siblings escape the house and find themselves in the street, empty-handed. The narrator locks the front door and tosses the key into the sewer. The source of the noises is never revealed, leaving the reader to wonder who or what has taken over the house and forced the sister and brother out. The story has been viewed as an anti-Peronism work, since Julio Cort√°zar had been forced to resign his professorship the same year the story was written.

Archedictyon (from Greek Arche meaning first, original, ancient, primitive, or most basic Word Info: \\"arche-\\" and dictyo- meaning net or netlike, Word Info: dictyo- plural \\"archedictya\\") is a name given to a hypothetical scheme of wing venation proposed for the common ancestor of all winged insects. Jarmila Kukalov√°. Revisional Study of the Order Palaeodictyoptera in the Upper Carboniferous Shales of Commentry, France. Part III. Psyche 77:1-44, 1970. Description The nature of the archedictyon is an important consideration in the taxonomic classification of the large, primitive Palaeozoic insects known as Palaeodictyoptera and was used by Adolphe-Th√©odore Brongniart for this purpose as early as 1854. Jarmila Kukalov√°. \\"Revisional Study of the Order Palaeodictyoptera in the Upper Carboniferous Shales of Commentry, France\\" Part III. Psyche 77:1-44, 1970. A National Museum of Natural History database for the study of ants, wasps, bees and termites describes the archedictyon as: > ...the primitive original vein network characterizing the wings of many of > the most ancient insect fossils (T-B, after Needham; Mackerras, in CSIRO); > in Mastotermitidae and Hodotermitidae (Isoptera), the complex network or > reticulum of irregular veinlets between the veins in the apical 3 quarters > of both wings, including the anal lobe (Emerson). Museum of Natural History According to a 1999 scientific paper about the evolution of flight in Palaeozoic Palaeoptera, although the archedictyon of some Palaeodictyoptera have long been believed to be generalized plesiomorphic reticulation from which true cross veins developed through evolution, these may actually be an adaptive feature. Cambridge Philosophical Society: Flight adaptations in Palaeozoic Palaeoptera (Insecta) Structure The archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal veins, but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of fossil data and speculation. Archedictyon The \\"Comstock-Needham system\\" designed by entomologists John Henry Comstock and George Needham describes these veins and their branches: :*Costa(C): the leading edge of the wing :*Subcosta(Sc): the second longitudinal vein (behind the costa), typically unbranched :*Radius R): the third longitudinal vein, one to five branches reach the wing margin :*Media(M): the fourth longitudinal vein, one to four branches reach the wing margin :*Cubitus (Cu): fifth longitudinal vein, one to three branches reach the wing margin :*Anal veins (A1, A2, A3): the unbranched veins behind the cubitus North Carolina State University Crossveins are named based on their relative position to the more prominent longitudinal veins: :*C-SC crossveins run between the costa and subcosta :*R crossveins run between adjacent branches of the radius :*R-M crossveins run between the radius and media :*M-CU crossveins run between the media and cubitus Extant species The hypothetical primitive wing venation pattern is often used as a basis for describing the pattern in modern insects. In extant insects, the term implies a retention of primitive characteristics but not necessarily a simplicity of design in comparison to the veinous network of other modern insect wings. Contemporary insects with wings to which the term archedictyon has been applied include the termite Mastotermes darwiniensis from Australia (illustration) and the praying mantis Orthodera novaezealandiae Purkayastha, M. 1999, Orthodera novaezealandiae, University of Michigan Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 27, 2008 from New Zealand. The term is also used in the discussion of phasmids and in such case refers to: > A network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in > the elytron.

The Super NES version was released in Europe under the title Super Strike Gunner and was published by Activision. The player takes control of a high-tech jet, the \\"Strike Gunner\\" of the title. The North American SNES packaging was illustrated by Marc Ericksen. The SNES version also incorporates the used of Mode 7. Plot In the far future A.D. 2008 aliens have invaded the Earth and launched a full-scale war that threatens humankind. Earth's scientists have built two of the ultimate weapons, the Strike Gunner, piloted by Mark McKenzie and Jane Sinclair to repel the invasion and destroy the alien armies. Gameplay The Special Weapon select screen (SNES version) The player goes through various levels and stages, usually based around certain environmental elements and faces numerous types of enemies. The levels feature wave after wave of normal enemies ranging from helicopters to Gun turrets that usually only require one or two hits to destroy. At various points in each level, the player faces a boss vehicle. At certain points, a stealth bomber (or in later levels, a space shuttle or capsule) will appear to airdrop the player laser power-ups, recharge special weapons, or give a speed boost. Using the Strike Gunner, the player is armed with a dual red laser weapon that can be upgraded several times to a more powerful blue laser. In addition to this weapon, the player chooses a second, more powerful \\"special weapon\\" with a limited charge before they begin the mission. There are 10 advanced weapons (15 in the SNES version) to pick from. This allows for a strategic approach to the game because certain weapons are more effective on certain missions. The \\"special weapon\\" has various limitations, depending on which one is being used. The game supports two players as well, with two Strike Gunners facing the same missions as single player. This adds another layer of strategy to the game because each player can choose their own \\"special weapons\\" and utilize a deadly combination of timed special attacks. Players can link their aircraft in two different ways. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Strike Gunner S.T.G. on their May 15, 1991 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Most of the criticism was based on the poor, unvaried graphics, and the gameplay being repetitive, and dull.

On July 26, 2012, after completing a five-year commitment to serve at the institution, Dr. Nelms announced his retirement, effective August 6, 2012. He currently is a contributing writer to The Huffington Post on educational issues and has founded Destination Graduation, a non-profit organization focused on increasing retention and graduation rates at the nation's historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Biography Charlie Nelms, Ed.D., has more than 40 years of experience and leadership in higher education. Nelms served as chancellor of North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in Durham from 2007 to 2012. During his tenure, Nelms intensified the university's emphasis on student success, setting ambitious goals for increasing student retention and graduation rates. A few of his accomplishments included raising the standards for undergraduate admissions and progression; guiding the establishment of the first and only Ph.D. program to be offered at NCCU in 50 years; initiating and completing a comprehensive academic program review, which led to the merging or discontinuation of more than a dozen academic programs; transitioning from NCAA Division II to Division I and membership in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference; and creating the Division of Research and Economic Development which assisted the university in receiving the largest sponsored research grants in its history (more than $100 million flowing to NCCU researchers in five years). During his tenure, U.S. News & World Report ranked NCCU as one of the best public HBCUs in the country for three consecutive years. In 2011, Nelms published \\"A Call to Action\\",\\"Charlie Nelms, Ed.D.\\" at Huffington Post a policy directive intended to spur a national dialogue concerning the revitalization of the historically black colleges and universities as an important sector of American higher education. Indiana University career In 1978, Nelms began his on-again, off-again tenure within the Indiana University system with his appointment as assistant professor of education as well as Director of the University Division and Associate Dean for Student Services at IU Northwest in Gary. Within the year, his administrative title and position changed to Associate Dean Academic Affairs. In 1984, he resigned to accept a position as Vice President for Student Services at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio, but returned to the IU system in 1987 to serve as Chancellor of the IU East campus, where he remained until 1994. He then left IU to lead the University of Michigan-Flint campus, which he felt was more diverse than IU Bloomington and would allow him to go forward with his diversity initiatives. The Indiana University alum was drawn back to Bloomington in 1998 to serve in his final IU position as the Vice President for Institutional Development and Student Affairs, as well as serving in the School of Education as Professor of Higher Education Administration. Major achievements attributed to his work during this period included the establishment of the Honors College (previously just a Division), implementation of the Mission Differentiation Project which focused on the missions of the 8 IU campuses, and system-wide work with university leaders to develop and initiate programs to aid in retention and graduation. Nelms resigned in 2007 to assume the position of chancellor at North Carolina Central University. Personal Nelms is married and has one son.

It appeared as \\"The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean\\" in 1734 4th edition On Commons and as Benjamin Tabart's moralized \\"The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk\\" in 1807.Tabart, The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk. in 1807 introduces a new character, a fairy who explains the moral of the tale to Jack (Matthew Orville Grenby, \\"Tame fairies make good teachers: the popularity of early British fairy tales\\", The Lion and the Unicorn 30.1 (January 20201‚Äì24). Henry Cole, publishing under pen name Felix Summerly, popularized the tale in The Home Treasury (1845),In 1842 and 1844 Elizabeth Rigby, Lady Eastlake, reviewed children's books for the Quarterly \\"The House [sic] Treasury, by Felix Summerly, including The Traditional Nursery Songs of England, Beauty and the Beast, Jack and the Beanstalk, and other old friends, all charmingly done and beautifully illustrated.\\" (noted by Geoffrey Summerfield, \\"The Making of The Home Treasury\\", Children's Literature 8 (1980:35‚Äì52). and Joseph Jacobs rewrote it in English Fairy Tales (1890). Jacobs' version is most commonly reprinted today, and is believed to be closer to the oral versions than Tabart's because it lacks the moralizing.Maria Tatar, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, p. 132. \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is the best known of the \\"Jack tales\\", a series of stories featuring the archetypal Cornish and English hero and stock character Jack. According to researchers at Durham University and Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the story originated more than five millennia ago, based on a wide-spread archaic story form which is now classified by folklorists as ATU 328 The Boy Who Stole Ogre's Treasure. Story Jack, a poor country boy, trades the family cow for a handful of magic beans, which grow into an enormous beanstalk reaching up into the clouds. Jack climbs the beanstalk and finds himself in the castle of an unfriendly giant. The giant senses Jack's presence and cries, \\"Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman! Be he alive, or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread!\\" Outwitting the giant, Jack is able to retrieve many goods once stolen from his family, including an enchanted goose that lays golden eggs. Jack then escapes by chopping down the beanstalk. The giant, who is pursuing him, falls to his death, and Jack and his family prosper. Origins In Walter Crane's woodcut the harp reaches out to cling to the vine. \\"The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean\\" was published in the 1734 second edition of Round About Our Coal-Fire. In 1807, Benjamin Tabart published The History of Jack and the Bean Stalk, but the story is certainly older than these accounts. According to researchers at Durham University and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the tale type (AT 328, The Boy Steals Ogre's Treasure) to which the Jack story belongs may have had a Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) origin (the same tale also has Proto-Indo-Iranian variants), and so some think that the story would have originated millennia ago. (4500 BC to 2500 BC) In some versions of the tale, the giant is unnamed, but many plays based on it name him Blunderbore (one giant of that name appears in the 18th-century tale \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\"). In \\"The Story of Jack Spriggins\\" the giant is named Gogmagog. The giant's catchphrase \\"Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman\\" appears in William Shakespeare's King Lear (c 1606) in the form \\"Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.\\" (Act 3, Scene 4),Tatar, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, p. 136. and something similar also appears in \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\". Analogies \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is an Aarne-Thompson tale-type 328, The Treasures of the Giant, which includes the Italian \\"Thirteenth\\" and the French \\"How the Dragon was Tricked\\" tales. Christine Goldberg argues that the Aarne-Thompson system is inadequate for the tale because the others do not include the beanstalk, which has analogies in other types (a possible reference to the genre anomaly).D. L. Ashliman, ed. \\"Jack and the Bensalk: eight versions of an English fairy tale (Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 328)\\". 2002‚Äì2010. Folklore and Mythology: Electronic Texts. University of Pittsburgh. 1996‚Äì2013. The Brothers Grimm drew an analogy between this tale and a German fairy tale, \\"The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs\\". The devil's mother or grandmother acts much like the giant's wife, a female figure protecting the child from the evil male figure.Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, \\"The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs\\", Grimm's Fairy Tales. \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is unusual in some versions in that the hero, although grown up, does not marry at the end but returns to his mother. In other versions he is said to have married a princess. This is found in few other tales, such as some variants of \\"Vasilisa the Beautiful\\".Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 199. Moral perspectives Jack climbs the beanstalk to the Giant's house. The original story portrays a \\"hero\\" gaining the sympathy of a man's wife, hiding in his house, robbing him, and finally killing him. In Tabart's moralized version, a fairy woman explains to Jack that the giant had robbed and murdered his father justifying Jack's actions as retributionTatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 198. (Andrew Lang follows this version in the Red Fairy Book of 1890). Jacobs gave no justification because there was none in the version he had heard as a child and maintained that children know that robbery and murder are wrong without being told in a fairy tale, but did give a subtle retributive tone to it by making reference to the giant's previous meals of stolen oxen and young children.Joseph Jacobs, Notes to \\"Jack and the Bensalk\\", English Fairy Tales. Many modern interpretations have followed Tabart and made the giant a villain, terrorizing smaller folk and stealing from them, so that Jack becomes a legitimate protagonist. For example, the 1952 film starring Abbott and Costello the giant is blamed for poverty at the foot of the beanstalk, as he has been stealing food and wealth and the hen that lays golden eggs originally belonged to Jack's family. In other versions, it is implied that the giant had stolen both the hen and the harp from Jack's father. Brian Henson's 2001 TV miniseries Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story not only abandons Tabart's additions but vilifies Jack, reflecting Jim Henson's disgust at Jack's unscrupulous actions.Joe Nazzaro, \\"Back to the Beanstalk\\", Starlog Fantasy Worlds, February 2002, pp. 56‚Äì59. Film adaptations Jack and the Beanstalk (1917) * The first film adaptation was made in 1902 by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. * Walt Disney made a short of the same name in 1922, and a separate adaptation titled Mickey and the Beanstalk in 1947 as part of Fun and Fancy Free. This adaptation of the story put Mickey Mouse in the role of Jack, accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy live on a farm in \\"Happy Valley\\", so called because it is always green and prosperous thanks to the magical singing from an enchanted golden harp in a castle, until one day it mysteriously disappears during a dark storm, resulting in the valley being plagued by a severe drought. Times become so hard for Mickey and his friends that soon they have nothing to eat except one loaf of bread. Mickey trades in the cow (which Donald was going to kill for food) for the magic beans. Donald throws the beans on the floor and down a knothole in a fit of rage, and the beanstalk sprouts that night, lifting the three of them into the sky while they sleep. In the magical kingdom, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy help themselves to a sumptuous feast. This rouses the ire of the giant (named \\"Willie\\" in this version), who captures Donald and Goofy and locks them in a box, and it is up to Mickey to find the keys to unlock the box and rescue them as well as the harp which they also find in the giant's possession. The film villainizes the giant by blaming Happy Valley's hard times on Willie's theft of the magic harp, without which song the land withers; unlike the harp of the original tale, this magic harp wants to be rescued from the giant, assists the heroes as best she can, and the hapless heroes return her to her rightful place and Happy Valley to its former glory. This version of the fairy tale was narrated (as a segment of Fun and Fancy Free) by Edgar Bergen, and later (by itself as a short) by Sterling Holloway. **Walt Disney Animation Studios wanted to do another adaptation of the fairy tale called Gigantic. Tangled director Nathan Greno was to direct and it was set to be released in late 2020, however, it was reported on October 10, 2017, that the studio had made the decision to cancel the film after struggling creatively with it. * Warner Bros. adapted the story into three Merrie Melodies cartoons. Friz Freleng directed Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk (1943), Chuck Jones directed Beanstalk Bunny (1955) where Elmer Fudd is the giant, and Freleng directed Tweety and the Beanstalk (1957). * The 1952 Abbott and Costello adaptation was not the only time a comedy team was involved with the story. The Three Stooges had their own five-minute animated retelling, titled Three Jacks and a Beanstalk (1965). * In 1967, Hanna-Barbera produced a live action version of Jack and the Beanstalk, with Gene Kelly as Jeremy the Peddler (who trades his magic beans for Jack's cow), Bobby Riha as Jack, Dick Beals as Jack's singing voice, Ted Cassidy as the voice of the animated giant, Janet Waldo as the voice of the animated Princess Serena, Marni Nixon as Serena's singing voice, and Marian McKnight as Jack's mother.Jack and the Beanstalk (1967 TV Movie), Full Cast & Crew, imdb.com The songs were written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. Kelly also directed the Emmy Award-winning film. * Gisaburo Sugii directed a feature-length anime telling of the story released in 1974, titled Jack to Mame no Ki. The film, a musical, was produced by Group TAC and released by Nippon Herald. The writers introduced a few new characters, including Jack's comic-relief dog, Crosby, and Margaret, a beautiful princess engaged to be married to the giant (named \\"Tulip\\" in this version) due to a spell being cast over her by the giant's mother (an evil witch called Madame Hecuba). Jack, however, develops a crush on Margaret, and one of his aims in returning to the magic kingdom is to rescue her. The film was dubbed into English, with legendary voice talent Billie Lou Watt voicing Jack, and received a very limited run in U.S. theaters in 1976. It was later released on VHS (now out of print) and aired several times on HBO in the 1980s. However, it is now available on DVD with both English and Japanese dialogue. * Michael Davis directed the 1994 adaptation, titled Beanstalk, starring J. D. Daniels as Jack and Stuart Pankin as the giant. The film was released by Moonbeam Entertainment, the children's video division of Full Moon Entertainment. * Wolves, Witches and Giants Episode 9 of Season 1, Jack and the Beanstalk, broadcast on 19 October 1995, has Jack's mother chop down the beanstalk and the giant plummet through the earth to Australia. The hen that Jack has stolen fails to lay any eggs and ends up \\"in the pot by Sunday\\", leaving Jack and his mother to live in reduced circumstances for the rest of their lives. * The Jim Henson Company did a TV miniseries adaptation of the story as Jim Henson's Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story (directed by Brian Henson) which reveals that Jack's theft from the giant was completely unmotivated, with the giant Thunderdell (played by Bill Barretta) being a friendly, welcoming individual, and the giant's subsequent death was caused by Jack's mother cutting the beanstalk down rather than Jack himself. The film focuses on Jack's modern-day descendant Jack Robinson (played by Matthew Modine) who learns the truth after the discovery of the giant's bones and the last of the five magic beans, Jack subsequently returning the goose and harp to the giants' kingdom. * In an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse called \\"Donald and the Beanstalk\\", Donald Duck accidentally swapped his pet chicken with Willie the Giant for a handful of magic beans. * Avalon Family Entertainment's 2009 Jack and the Beanstalk is a low-budget live-action adaptation starring Christopher Lloyd, Chevy Chase, James Earl Jones, Gilbert Gottfried, Katey Sagal, Wallace Shawn and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz. Jack is played by Colin Ford. * The Warner Bros. film directed by Bryan Singer and starring Nicholas Hoult as Jack is titled Jack the Giant Slayer and was released in March 2013.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1351685/ In this tale, which is amalgamated with Jack the Giant Killer, Jack climbs the beanstalk to save a princess. * Warner Bros. Animation's direct-to-DVD film Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure is based on the fairy tale. * In the 2014 film Into the Woods, and the musical of the same name, one of the main characters, Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) climbs a beanstalk, much like in the original version. He acquires a golden harp, a hen that lays golden eggs, and several gold pieces. The story goes on as it does in the original fairy tale, but continues afterwards showing what happens after you get your happy ending. In this adaptation, the giant's vengeful wife (Frances de la Tour) attacks the kingdom to find and kill Jack as revenge for him murdering her husband, where some characters were killed during her rampage. The giant's wife is eventually killed by the surviving characters in the story. Other adaptations * There is a Rugrats: Tales From the Crib episode named \\"Three Jacks and a Beanstalk\\" where Angelica plays the giant. * The story is the basis of the similarly titled traditional British pantomime, wherein the Giant is certainly a villain, Jack's mother the Dame, and Jack the Principal Boy. * Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk is the protagonist of the comic book Jack of Fables, a spin-off of Fables, which also features other elements from the story, such as giant beanstalks and giants living in the clouds. The Cloud Kingdoms first appear in issue #50 and is shown to exist in their own interdimensional way, being a world of their own but at the same time existing over all of the other worlds. * Gilligan's Island did an adaptation/dream sequence in the second-season episode \\"'V' for Vitamins\\" in which Gilligan tries to take oranges from a giant Skipper and fails.

In the 2016 television adaptation of Revolting Rhymes, Jack lives next door to Cinderella and is in love with her. The story of Jack and the Beanstalk is also referenced in Dahl's The BFG, in which the evil giants are all afraid of the \\"giant-killer\\" Jack, who is said to kill giants with his fearsome beanstalk (although none of the giants appear to know how Jack uses it against them, the context of a nightmare that one of the giants has about Jack suggesting that they think that he wields the beanstalk as a weapon). * James Still published Jack and the Wonder Beans (1977, republished 1996) an Appalachian variation on the Jack and the Beanstalk tale.

Tolkien's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. He is leader of the Istari, wizards sent to Middle- earth in human form by the godlike Valar to challenge Sauron, the main antagonist of the novel, but eventually he desires Sauron's power for himself and tries to take over Middle-earth by force from his base at Isengard. His schemes feature prominently in the second volume, The Two Towers, and at the end of the third volume, The Return of the King. His earlier history is given briefly in the posthumously published The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. Saruman is one of several characters in the book illustrating the corruption of power; his desire for knowledge and order leads to his fall, and he rejects the chance of redemption when it is offered. The name Saruman () means \\"man of skill or cunning\\" in the Mercian dialect of Anglo-Saxon; he serves as an example of technology and modernity being overthrown by forces more in tune with nature. Appearances=The Lord of the Rings= Saruman first appears in The Fellowship of the Ring (1954), the first volume of The Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings describes a quest to destroy the One Ring, a powerful and evil talisman created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle- earth (the continent on which Tolkien's story takes place; it loosely represents the Old World in a fictional ancient era). Sauron lost the Ring in battle thousands of years before the beginning of the story, and it is now held in secret in the Shire by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who passes it on to Frodo Baggins, one of the story's main protagonists. Early in The Fellowship of the Ring, the wizard Gandalf describes Saruman as \\"the chief of my order\\"The Fellowship of the Ring Book I Chapter II p. 63 and head of the White Council that forced Sauron from Mirkwood at the end of Tolkien's earlier book The Hobbit. He notes Saruman's great knowledge of the magic rings created by Sauron and by the Elven-smiths. Shortly afterwards, Gandalf breaks an arrangement to meet Frodo and guide him out of the Shire to Rivendell to keep the Ring safe from Sauron's agents. Frodo and Gandalf are reunited at Rivendell midway through The Fellowship of the Ring. The wizard explains why he failed to join Frodo: he had been summoned to consult with Saruman but had been held captive. Saruman initially had proposed that the wizards ally themselves with the rising power of Sauron in order to eventually control him for their own ends. Saruman went on to suggest that they could take the Ring for themselves and challenge Sauron. When Gandalf refused both options, Saruman imprisoned him in the tower of Orthanc at Isengard, hoping to learn from him the location of the Ring. Whilst on the summit of Orthanc, Gandalf observed that Saruman had industrialised the formerly green valley of Isengard and was creating his own army of Half-Orcs/Half-Man fighters and Wargs to rival Sauron.The Fellowship of the Ring Book II Chapter II p. 341 Gandalf's escape from the roof on the back of a Great Eagle left Saruman in a desperate position, as he knew he would now be known as traitor to his former allies, but was unable to procure the Ring directly for himself and therefore could not hope to truly rival Sauron. In The Two Towers (1954), the second volume of the story, Saruman is the main antagonist. Orcs from Saruman's army attack Frodo and his companions, and carry off two of Frodo's closest friends, Merry and Pippin. The two escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ents, protectors of the trees, who are outraged at the widespread felling of trees by Saruman's Orcs.The Two Towers Book III Chapter IV p. 85 Meanwhile, Saruman prepares to invade the kingdom of Rohan, which has lain invitingly exposed ever since he had his servant Gr√≠ma Wormtongue render Th√©oden, Rohan's king, weak and defenceless with \\"subtle poisons\\". Gandalf frees Th√©oden from Wormtongue's spell, however, just as Saruman's army is about to invade. Saruman is ruined when the Riders of Rohan defeat his army and Merry and Pippin prompt the Ents to destroy Isengard. Saruman himself is not directly involved, and only appears again in chapter 10, \\"The Voice of Saruman\\", by which time he is trapped in Orthanc. He fails in his attempt to negotiate with the Rohirrim and with Gandalf, and rejects Gandalf's conditional offer to let him go free. Gandalf casts him out of the White Council and the order of the wizards, and breaks Saruman's staff.The Two Towers Book III Chapter X pp. 222‚Äì230 Saruman makes his final appearance at the end of the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses.The Return of the King, Book VI, Chapter VI, pp. 311‚Äì312 When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents‚Äîboth Hobbits and Men‚Äîhave already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 18 (\\"The Scouring of the Shire\\") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.The Return of the King, Book VI, VII, and VIII, pp. 315‚Äì317 and 360‚Äì363 =Other books= Consistent accounts of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, first published in The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, is one of five 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth some two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict.The Return of the King, Appendix B, \\"The Third Age\\", p. 365 Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels.Letters, No.156, p. 202: \\"[of Gandalf] I would venture to say that he was an incarnate 'angel'-strictly an [angelos]: that is, with the other Istari, wizards, 'those who know', an emissary from the Lords of the West, sent to Middle-earth, as the great crisis of Sauron loomed on the horizon.\\" Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.The Silmarillion 'Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age' pp. 361‚Äì365 Unfinished Tales also contains various drafts not included in The Lord of the Rings that describe Saruman's attempts to frustrate Sauron's chief servants, the Nazg√ªl, in their search for the Ring during the early part of The Fellowship of the Ring; in one version he considers throwing himself on Gandalf's mercy. There is also a description of how Saruman becomes involved with the Shire and of how he gradually becomes jealous of Gandalf.Unfinished Tales Part Three Chapter IV 'The Hunt for the Ring' pp. 436‚Äì459 Another brief account describes how the five Istari were chosen by the Valar for their mission.Unfinished Tales Part Four Chapter II 'The Istari' pp. 508‚Äì509 Creation and development Tolkien had been writing The Lord of the Rings for several years when Saruman came into existence as the solution to a long-unresolved plot development, and his role and characteristics continued to emerge in the course of writing. Tolkien started work on the book in late 1937, but was initially unsure of how the story would develop.Biography Part 5 Chapter II p.247 Unlike some of the other characters in the book, Saruman had not appeared in Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit, or in his then-unpublished Quenta Silmarillion and related mythology, which date back to 1917. When he wrote of Gandalf's failure to meet Frodo, Tolkien did not know what had caused it and later said: \\"Most disquieting of all, Saruman had never been revealed to me, and I was as concerned as Frodo at Gandalf's failure to appear.\\"Letters no.163 p. 217 Tolkien's son, Christopher, has said that the early stages of the creation of The Lord of the Rings proceeded in a series of waves, and that having produced the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien rewrote the tale from the start three times.The Return of the Shadow Foreword p.3 Saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated August 1940. Intended to account for Gandalf's absence, it describes how a wizard titled \\"Saramond the White\\" or \\"Saramund the Grey\\", who has fallen under the influence of Sauron, lures Gandalf to his stronghold and traps him.The Treason of Isengard Chapter IV pp. 70‚Äì73. The outline suggests that Saruman is assisted by the \\"giant\\" Treebeard, an early and evil iteration of the Ent Treebeard from the finished book. The full story of Saruman's betrayal was later added to the existing chapters.The Treason of Isengard Chapter VI pp. 130‚Äì136 Several of Saruman's other appearances in the book emerged in the process of writing. Christopher Tolkien believes that the old man seen by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli at the edge of Fangorn forest near the beginning of The Two Towers is in the original drafts intended to be Gandalf. In the finished version he is Saruman.The Treason of Isengard Chapter XX p. 403 & Chapter XIV p. 428; also, Gandalf says about the incident, \\"You certainly didn't see me, so you must have seen Saruman.\\" Similarly, in the first drafts of the chapter The Scouring of the Shire, Sharkey is successively a ruffian met by the hobbits and then that man's unseen boss. It is only in the second draft of the chapter that, as Christopher Tolkien puts it, his father ‚Äúperceive[d]‚Äù that Sharkey was in fact Saruman.Sauron Defeated Chapter IX 'The Scouring of the Shire' p.93 Saruman did not appear in the first draft of the chapter 'The Scouring of the Shire'. Christopher Tolkien writes: \\"It is striking that here, virtually at the end of the Lord of the Rings and in an element that my father had long meditated [that, among other things,] he did not perceive that it was Saruman who was the real Boss, Sharkey, at Bag End [...]\\" The name used by Saruman's henchmen for their diminished leader is said in a footnote to the final text to be derived from an Orkish term meaning \\"old man\\". Saruman's death scene, in which his body shrivels away to skin and bones revealing \\"long years of death\\" and \\"a pale shrouded figure\\" rises over the corpse,The Return of the King Book VI Chapter VIII p.363 was not added until the page proofs of the completed book were being reviewed by Tolkien.Sauron Defeated Chapter IX p.103 John D. Rateliff and Jared Lobdell are among those to write that the scene shows similarities to the death of the 2000-year-old sorceress Ayesha in H. Rider Haggard's 1887 novel She: A History of Adventure.Reader's Companion (2005) p.264 Characterisation Tolkien described Saruman at the time of The Lord of the Rings as having a long face and a high forehead, \\"...he had deep darkling eyes ... His hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed around his lips and ears.\\"The Two Towers Book III Chapter X p.222 His hair is elsewhere described as having been black when he first arrived in Middle-earth. He is referred to as 'Saruman the White' and is said to have originally worn white robes, but on his first entry in The Fellowship of the Ring they instead appear to be \\"woven from all colours [, they] shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered\\" and he names himself 'Saruman of Many Colours'.The Fellowship of the Ring Book II Chapter II pp. 338‚Äì339 The power of Saruman's voice is noted throughout the book. Jonathan Evans calls the characterization of Saruman in the chapter The Voice of Saruman a \\"tour de force\\".J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia 'Saruman' by Jonathan Evans pp. 589‚Äì590 Roger Sale says of the same chapter that \\"Tolkien valiantly tried to do something worth doing which he simply cannot bring off.\\"Tolkien and the critics 15 'Tolkien and Frodo Baggins' by Roger Sale p.270 Tom Shippey writes that \\"Saruman talks like a politician ... No other character in Middle-earth has Saruman's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved, and none comes out with words as empty as 'deploring', 'ultimate', worst of all, 'real'. What is 'real change'?\\"The Road to Middle-earth Chapter IV 'The Council of Elrond' pp. 135‚Äì138 Shippey refers to \\"Tolkien's Northern 'theory of courage'\\", which appears in Tolkien's 1936 British Academy lecture. Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King D√°in, which Shippey believes represent Tolkien's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf. After the defeat of his armies, having been caught in the betrayal of Sauron, Saruman is offered refuge by Gandalf, in return for his aid, but having chosen his path, is unable to turn from it. Evans has compared the character of Saruman to that of Satan in John Milton's Paradise Lost in his use of rhetoric and in this final refusal of redemption, \\"conquered by pride and hatred\\". Literary themes Saruman has been identified by critics as demonstrating the fall of an originally good character, and has distinctively modern connections with technology. Tolkien writes that The Lord of the Rings was often criticised for portraying all characters as either good or bad, with no shades of grey, a point to which he responds by proposing Saruman, along with Denethor and Boromir, as examples of characters with more nuanced loyalties.Letters no.154 p. 197. Marjorie Burns writes that while Saruman is an \\"imitative and lesser\\" double of Sauron, reinforcing the Dark Lord's character type, he is also a contrasting double of Gandalf, who becomes Saruman as he \\"should have been\\", after Saruman fails in his original purpose.J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia 'Doubles' by Marjorie Burns pp. 127‚Äì128 Saruman \\"was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare raise our hands against\\" but decays as the book goes on.Master of Middle-earth Chapter 4 p.79, Kocher quoting Frodo's speech of The Return of the King Book VI Chapter VIII p.362 Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him \\"one of the main case histories [in the book] of the gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills\\".Tolkien and the critics 6 'Power and meaning in The Lord of the Rings' p. 84‚Äì85 Paul Kocher identifies Saruman's use of a palant√≠r, a seeing-stone, as the immediate cause of his downfall, but also suggests that through his study of \\"the arts of the enemy\\", Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron.Master of Middle-earth Chapter III Cosmic Order p. 51 & Chapter IV Sauron and the nature of evil p. 68 According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks, Saruman succumbs to the lust for power, while Shippey identifies Saruman's devotion to goals of knowledge, organization and control as his weakness. Tolkien writes that the Istari's chief temptation (and that to which Saruman fell) is impatience, leading to a desire to force others to do good, and then to a simple desire for power.Letters no.181 p. 237 Treebeard describes Saruman as having \\"a mind of metal and wheels\\".The Two Towers Book III Chapter IV p. 84. The quote is used as an illustration by Shippey, Spacks and Kocher among many others. Evil in The Lord of the Rings tends to be associated with machinery, whereas good is usually associated with nature. Both Saruman's stronghold of Isengard and his altered Shire demonstrate the negative effects of industrialization and Isengard is overthrown when the forests, in the shape of the Ents, literally rise against it. Patrick Curry says Tolkien is \\"hostile to industrialism\\", linking this to the widespread urban development that took place in the West Midlands where Tolkien grew up in the first decades of the 20th century. He identifies Saruman as one of the key examples given in the book of the evil effects of industrialization, and by extension imperialism.J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia 'Industrialization' by Patrick Curry p. 294 Shippey notes that Saruman's name repeats this view of technology: in the Mercian dialect of Anglo-Saxon used by Tolkien to represent the Language of Rohan in the book, the word searu means \\"clever\\", \\"skilful\\" or \\"ingenious\\" and has associations with both technology and treachery that are fitting for Tolkien's portrayal of Saruman, the \\"cunning man\\".The Road to Middle-earth Chapter 4 'The horses of the Mark' pp. 139‚Äì140 He also writes of Saruman's distinctively modern association with Communism in the way the Shire is run under his control in \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\": goods are taken \\"for fair distribution\\" which, since they are mainly never seen again, Shippey terms an unusually modern piece of hypocrisy in the way evil presents itself in Middle-earth.The Road to Middle-earth Chapter 5 'Interlacements and the Ring' p. 195 Saruman is in part the architect of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions in the first half of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen;The Road to Middle-earth Chapter 5 'Interlacements and the Ring' pp. 186‚Äì188 Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.Master of Middle-earth Chapter III Cosmic Order pp. 44‚Äì46 and Tolkien's World Chapter V 'The structure and aesthetic of The Lord of the Rings pp. 92‚Äì97 In the end, the diminished Saruman is murdered, his throat cut, and Shippey notes that when he dies his spirit \\"dissolved into nothing\\". He identifies Saruman as the best example in the book of \\"wraithing\\", a distinctive 20th-century view of evil that he attributes to Tolkien in which individuals are \\"'eaten up inside' by devotion to some abstraction\\".Author of the Century Chapter IV 'Saruman and Denethor: technologist and reactionary' pp. 121‚Äì128 Referring to Saruman's demise, Kocher says that he is one example of the consistent theme of nothingness as the fate of evil throughout The Lord of the Rings.Master of Middle-earth Chapter IV Sauron and the nature of evil p. 79 Adaptations=Film, radio, and stage= Saruman has appeared in film, radio, and stage adaptations of The Lord of the Rings. BBC Radio produced the first adaptation in 1955, in which Saruman was played by Robert Farquharson, and which has not survived. Tolkien was apparently disappointed by it.The films, the books, the radio series 'Of the beginning of days' pp. 15‚Äì16 In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, which corresponds to The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers, Saruman is voiced by Fraser Kerr. He has only one major scene‚Äîhis attempt to persuade Gandalf to join him. He appears again briefly before the battle of Helm's Deep, speaking to his army. The character is dressed in red and is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest that the use of 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'.The films, the books, the radio series 'JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings' p. 54 The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.The films, the books, the radio series 'JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings' pp. 63‚Äì70 BBC Radio's second adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, from 1981, presents Saruman much as in the books. Smith and Matthews report Peter Howell's performance as Saruman as \\"brilliantly ambiguous ..., drifting from mellifluous to almost bestially savage from moment to moment without either mood seeming to contradict the other\\".The films, the books, the radio series 'An Unexpected Party' p. 83 Saruman is played by Matti Pellonp√§√§ in the 1993 television miniseries Hobitit produced and aired by Finnish broadcaster Yle. Christopher Lee plays Saruman in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit In Peter Jackson's film trilogy (2001‚Äì2003), Saruman is significantly more active in the first two films than in the corresponding books, and he appears in several scenes that are not depicted in Tolkien's work. He was portrayed by Christopher Lee. In the films, Saruman is depicted presenting himself outright as a servant of Sauron. Smith and Matthews suggest that Saruman's role is built up as a substitute for Sauron‚Äîthe story's main antagonist‚Äîwho never appears directly in the book. Jackson confirms this view in the commentary to the DVD. They also suggest that having secured veteran British horror actor Christopher Lee to play Saruman, it made sense to make greater use of his star status.The films, the books, the radio series 'The Return of the King' (2003) p. 177 Despite this increased role in the first two films, the scenes involving Saruman that were shot for use in the third film, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, were not used in the cinematic release, a decision which \\"shocked\\" Lee. Jackson reasoned that it would be anticlimactic to show Saruman's fate in the second movie (after the Battle of Helm's Deep) and too retrospective for the third one. The cut scenes end with Saruman falling to his death from the top of Orthanc after being stabbed by Wormtongue and include material transposed from the chapter The Scouring of the Shire. They are included at the start of the Extended Edition DVD release of the film. In Jackson's film adaptation of The Hobbit, Lee reprises his role as Saruman the White, even though Saruman does not appear in the book. Saruman, Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond appear at a meeting of the White Council in Rivendell, loosely based on material from the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings. =Games= In the 2014 video game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Saruman is voiced by Roger Jackson. Saruman appears as a minor villain in Lego Dimensions, in which he allies himself with main antagonist Lord Vortech.

They were the only German locomotives with a 4-8-4 (Northern) wheel arrangement.  History  The two Class 06 locomotives built by the firm of Krupp in 1939 were the largest, heaviest and most powerful locomotives in the Deutsche Reichsbahn. They were built for heavy express train duties in hilly terrain. The performance requirement was for the transportation of 650 tons at 120 km/h. On ramps of 1:100 it was to still to be capable of maintaining 60 km/h. The Class 06 was give the same boiler as the Class 45 and many of the same components as the Class 41. The running gear, with four coupled axles, had a wheelbase of 6,75 m. In trials, the vehicles confirmed their remarkable capability and running qualities. However the locomotives tended to derail in tight turnout curves. And, like the Class 45s, the boilers developed cracks, leaky tubes and popped stay bolts, so that the locomotives were unconvincing when hauling measurement vehicles or scheduled trains. As a result of the war no more were produced. After the Second World War there was no longer a requirement for a locomotive of this size, so that neither the necessary structural modification of the engines was carried out, nor did any follow-on orders result. Both engines were seen as having a faulty design and were retired by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1951 in Frankfurt am Main and scrapped, because the DB refused to replace their boilers. The two locomotives, which had operating numbers 06 001 and 06 002, were equipped with 2'3 T 38 St tenders.

NPP is dedicated to writing and producing new plays that reflect the standards of a Utah Valley audience. They also aim to give emerging Latter-day Saint writers a place to produce their work while maintaining their standards and values. It primarily produces short play festivals (several short plays bound together by one theme), but occasionally takes on larger projects (as in Really Cool and Smart and Better Than You and Swallow the Sun). It is the first such organization to flourish in the area (which is known for theater performance), and has produced more than 70 original plays (and workshopped more than 200) since its inception in 2006.  Origins  New Play Project was founded April 2006 by Brigham Young University students James Goldberg, Arisael Rivera, Julie Saunders and Jennefer Franklin as an attempt to produce new play scripts they developed. Bianca Dillard almost immediately joined the group and developed the continuing workshop program. In August 2006, sponsored by the BYU Experimental Theatre Group, it held its first production, a 10-minute play festival titled Love Songs and Negotiations. In October 2006 it held another play festival titled Palms, which featured plays revolving around religious themes. At the beginning of December 2006, it held its last play festival of the year titled In Progress.

The workshop functions as a classroom for the attending writers and actors to explore and understand the principles of writing a good story. ;Themed short play festivals: :Approximately every ten weeks, New Play Project produces a collection of short plays centered on a theme. A script selection committee chooses the best plays submitted for the production, directors and actors are found and the plays are rehearsed and performed. Playwrights are allowed to make improvements to their scripts during the rehearsal process. ;Religious plays program: :Twice a year, New Play Project accepts submissions of religious-themed plays, most of which are LDS. NPP feels it is very important there is a place for Mormon playwrights to write their own religious experiences using their own religious terminology.  Recognition  The goal of New Play Project is to not only create positive, uplifting media for local audiences, but to create great writers who can make a difference in the mass media. In 2007, two NPP writers' works were chosen for Specific Gravity Ensemble's Elevator Plays. SGE is a Louisville, KY-based theater company.  Development  Part of New Play Project's goal is education. They work to develop new writers, actors, and directors, and hone their skills. They do this both through play writing workshops and through their short play productions. ;Writing Writing is the most important aspect of New Play Project. The heart of NPP is new work. NPP welcomes submissions from anyone for their themed productions. If submitted early before deadlines, the directors are willing to give feedback, and even have a workshop program for playwrights trying to develop both their short and full-length scripts. ;Acting Because NPP generally produces short plays, actors sometimes only need to spend 2‚Äì5 hours per week in rehearsal and have a much lower memorization burden than in most plays. No previous acting experience is required, and directors work with actors to develop good acting skills. ;Directing As with acting, the ten-minute play format provides opportunities for many beginning and experienced directors without the time-consumption of managing and blocking a full-length production. Previous directing or acting experience is required for directors, and NPP generally gives preference to those who have worked on previous NPP production (in any capacity). ;Dramaturgy NPP also includes dramaturgs in its productions. In NPP, dramaturgs help find additional information and images that help the director and actors better understand the script in terms of its larger context. They also create written and visual aids to help audience members connect the script to issues in their own lives and the world around them. Dramaturgs also help during the script development process to give articulate feedback on scripts to improve them. They are heavily utilized in the play writing workshop program.

Its common names include pink fairhead and pink domecap. Taxonomy Originally described as Agaricus carneus by the French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1792, this small pink mushroom has been through many taxonomical name changes over many years, and as a result has had many binomial names. A few of these are listed in the Synonyms section in the box at right. Its current specific epithet, carnea, is derived from the Latin for \\"flesh-coloured\\". The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms kalos \\"pretty\\", and cubos \\"head\\". Description The cap is in diameter. It is usually pale pink, but can be darker, pinker, or redder. It usually fades with age. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and has a tendency to become wavy. It is smooth and dry. The stem is up to high and the same colour as the cap, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose; often narrowing towards the base, and often misshapen. The gills are adnexed to almost free; sometimes notched and are white, giving a spore print of the same colour. They are quite closely spaced initially. The flesh is white; with very little taste, or smell. A similar species, Rugosomyces persicolor(Fr.) Singer, grows in tufts, has a liking for manured ground, and is sometimes recorded as a variety or variant of R. carneus. Distribution and habitat Rugosomyces carneus appears in spring, summer, and early autumn (usually after rain). It is frequent in Britain, Europe, Asia, and North America, growing in grassy meadows and fields and on lawns. It is very rarely found in woods, unless a grassy clearing is present. It seems to tolerate agricultural practices, because its fruiting bodies often appear on fertilized farmland. Edibility This mushroom is edible, but is unsubstantial, as it is small and thin fleshed. It is also potentially confused with poisonous species.

He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1774 when he was just seventeen years old. Except for a brief period when he fought under General John Sullivan in the American Revolution, he taught school in Londonderry until he became the Congregational minister of Beverly, Massachusetts in 1785. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1796. He remained in that position as minister until 1802, when he became president of Bowdoin. At the time, Massachusetts Hall was the only building available for officers and pupils on campus. In his inaugural address, he famously said that \\"Literary institutions are founded and endowed for the common good, and not for the private advantage of those who resort to them for education.\\" Bowdoin's annual Common Good Day for community service refers to this statement. He remained president until his death in 1807. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Dartmouth in 1803. Most of McKeen's publications were papers in theTransactions of the American Academy of Arts and Science and some occasional sermons. He is buried at Pine Grove Cemetery in Brunswick.

The completion date of the present hall is thought to be 1688. The hall and the adjoining farmhouse, dated to 1691 and originally a smithy, has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. History Mellor Hall was historically the seat of the Mellor family from the 15th century, and afterwards belonged to the Radcliffes. In 1686, James Chetham purchased the Mellor and Botham Hall estates in Mellor from Susanna Radcliffe, daughter of William Radcliffe. It is believed that he ordered a rebuilding of the previous manor house; the year 1688 has been mentioned as the year of completion of the hall and 1691 as the year of completion of the farmhouse, which appears to have been used originally as a smithy. His great-grandson, Thomas Chetham of Highgate, Middlesex, sold the Bothams Hall estate in 1787 to local cotton magnate Samuel Oldknow, and the Mellor Hall estate to Ralph Bridge in about 1797. Bridge's son was using the hall as a farm house as of 1819. On 20 December 1967 the house became a Grade II* listed farmhouse. In 1978, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council established the Mellor/Moorend Conservation Area on the border of Stockport and Derbyshire, which incorporates the hamlet of Moorend and outlying farms Longshaw Clough and Podnor, settlements at the end of Longhurst Lane, including Brook Bottom and Lower Hall and St Thomas‚Äô Church and Mellor Hall. The conservation area was extended in 2007. Architecture The main hall was completed in 1688 according to Nicholas Pevsner, and the adjoining farmhouse is dated \\"IC 1691\\", It is built of grey ashlar, with a graduated stone slate roof. The hall is a 2-storey building, with 7 bays on each floor, and a central door displaying a coat of arms and a steep broken swan-neck pediment. 6 of the ground floor windows are fitted with light ogee mullion and transom windows, with marginal glazing bars and keystones, and all of the 7 first floor windows are sash windows with marginal glazing bars, cyma-moulded surrounds and keystones. On the rear is a wing, with a hipped roof and quoins, mullion and transom windows; the 2 storey farmhouse extends from this wing, with 3 bays on each floor, and a central chimney stack.

Flowers was drafted by the Braves in the 33rd round of the 2005 MLB draft. He previously played for the Chicago White Sox from 2009, when he made his MLB debut, to 2015. Amateur career Flowers attended Blessed Trinity Catholic High School in Roswell, Georgia, where he played American football as a linebacker and fullback. In baseball, Flowers was a catcher, infielder and pitcher. Flowers was inducted into the Blessed Trinity Hall of Fame in January 2015. He then attended Chipola College, a state college in Marianna, Florida, and played first base for the college baseball team. Professional career=Atlanta Braves= Flowers was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 33rd round of the 2005 MLB draft. In 2006 Flowers played 34 games in his first professional season for the Rookie League Danville Braves. He hit .279 with 36 hits, 5 home runs and 16 RBIs, playing 22 games at first and eight as a catcher. In 2007, he was promoted to A-ball with the Rome Braves. Flowers played in 106 games with a batting average of .298 with 116 hits, 12 homers, 70 RBIs and a .488 slugging percentage. He began transitioning to catcher that season, after the starting and substitute catchers suffered injuries in the same game. In 2008 Flowers played for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of Advanced-A. He played 122 games, all at catcher. He had a .288 batting average, .427 on- base percentage, and .494 slugging percentage. He caught 28% of base stealers, as 112 runners stole bases against him and he caught 43. =Chicago White Sox= Flowers with the White Sox in 2011 On December 4, 2008, Flowers and fellow Braves prospects Brent Lillibridge, Jonathan Gilmore and Santos Rodriguez were traded to the Chicago White Sox for Javier V√°zquez and Boone Logan. On September 1, 2009, Flowers was called up from AAA Charlotte Knights after hitting .297 with 15 home runs and 56 RBI between AA Birmingham Barons and AAA Charlotte Knights. He made his major league debut on September 3 and recorded his first major league hit on September 19, against the Kansas City Royals. In 10 games, Flowers finished the 2009 season batting .188 with no home runs and no RBIs. Flowers started the 2010 season at AAA Charlotte. He hit .220 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI in 346 at-bats before getting another September call up. Flowers played in 8 games with the White Sox and only had 1 hit in 11 at-bats. Flowers again started the 2011 season at AAA Charlotte. There he hit .261 with 15 home runs and 32 RBI in 222 at-bats. He was then called up in July to serve as the backup to A. J. Pierzynski after Ram√≥n Castro was placed on the disabled list. Flowers became the starting catcher in mid-August after an injury to Pierzynski. Flowers hit his first Major League home run on August 13, 2011 against Luke Hochevar and the Kansas City Royals. On August 28, 2011, while facing Jason Vargas and the Seattle Mariners, Flowers hit his first Major League grand slam. With the departure of veteran catcher A. J. Pierzynski in the offseason, Flowers became the starting catcher for the White Sox in 2013. An offseason injury adversely affected his offensive production, and Flowers was demoted to backup as the White Sox brought up one of their top prospects, Josh Phegley. Flowers left in early September to have season-ending shoulder surgery. After the season, Flowers signed a one-year deal for $950,000 with Chicago, avoiding arbitration. Flowers was named the starting catcher to begin the 2014 season. On May 26, 2014 Flowers received his first career ejection by Ron Kulpa for arguing a pitch that appeared low. He finished the year with a .241 batting average, 15 home runs and 50 runs batted in. Flowers and the White Sox on January 16, 2015 agreed to a one-year deal for $2.675 million avoiding arbitration. On April 25, 2015, Flowers was fined an undisclosed amount for his role in a brawl against the Kansas City Royals but was not suspended any games. On defense, in 2015 he had the weakest arm strength (77.3) of all major league catchers. The White Sox did not tender Flowers a contract for the 2016 season, making him a free agent. =Second stint with Braves= Kelsey Wingert interviewing Tyler Flowers after a game vs the Rockies e at Coors Field The Atlanta Braves signed Flowers to a two-year contract worth $5.3 million on December 16, 2015. In July 2016, Miami Marlins pitcher A. J. Ramos hit Flowers' left hand with a pitch. The injury was exacerbated in a series against the Chicago White Sox, and it was announced during the All-Star break that Flowers would miss six weeks of the season. He was reactivated on August 17. In 2016, he caught only 5% of base stealers, as 60 runners stole bases against him and he caught 3. Though he was hit by several pitches throughout the course of the 2017 season, Flowers did not miss many games until he was injured by a foul tip on August 30. Shortly after his reinstatement from the 10-day disabled list, Flowers was hit by a pitch in a game against the Washington Nationals on September 13. The incident caused a wrist injury, though Flowers was unaware of its severity until having surgery on October 9.

Plot summary On February 22, 1882, the S.S. Illinois docked at the foot of Federal Street on the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. Among the passengers on board were 225 European Jewish refugees, most of whom settled nearby. By the close of World War I, a little over 40 years later, South Philadelphia was home to over 100,000 Jewish immigrants, making it the second largest Jewish neighborhood in the United States. However, the thriving community didn't last long. Soon after World War II, the Jews began moving to other parts of the city and surrounding suburbs. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Jewish community of South Philadelphia had almost completely vanished. Using a mix of interviews, archival photographs, home movies and present day footage, Echoes from a Ghost Minyan documents a once thriving neighborhood by illuminating the lives and perceptions of those who once lived, worked and worshipped there, including the filmmakers themselves.

Frieden, (1966, Dakar, Senegal) is an author of thrillers and mysteries, including the acclaimed Jonathan Brooks series.  Biography  Novelist A.C. Frieden in Istanbul, Turkey (2011) Frieden spent most of his youth abroad. After leaving his birthplace in West Africa, he spent several years in Asia and Europe before emigrating with his parents to the southern United States in the early 1980s. In the mid-1980s, he returned to his native Switzerland to serve in the Swiss Army, where he trained as a marksman. He later came back to the U.S. to complete undergraduate and graduate studies. As a result of his international experiences, Frieden visited dozens of countries, and what began as short stories, diaries and poems, many written during his travels, soon emerged as ingredients for future novels. Mysteries and thrillers soon became his passion. His first manuscript, Canvas Sunsets Never Fade, a mystery based on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, was written in 2000 and published in 2004. His second novel Tranquility Denied is set in post-Cold War Moscow, Stockholm and Southern Louisiana, and is the first in a series featuring hotshot maritime lawyer Jonathan Brooks. The book was launched in Russia and in the U.S. in late 2006, followed by the sequel, The Serpent's Game, in 2013, and The Pyongyang Option in March, 2019. His publishers, Down & Out Books and Avendia Publishing, recently announced the upcoming release of next Jonathan Brooks thriller, Letter From Istanbul. For his novels, Frieden has extensively researched the most challenging conflicts of the Cold War, including the Tito‚ÄìStalin split, the French Indochina War, the Korean War, the United States intervention in Chile, the Invasion of Panama, CIA activities in Bolivia, and the August Coup in the former Soviet Union. He‚Äôs also researched key events in the changing post-Cold War era, such as the sinking of the K-141 Kursk, the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and the 2011 Libyan civil war. His on-site research has included interviewing key political figures and journalists in Bolivia, Chile, Serbia, Turkey, Uruguay and Venezuela for background information for his upcoming political/espionage novels set in Latin America and Central Europe. His research also led him to witness the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat firsthand, to interview former combatants in Nicaragua and visit the former Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine. Frieden also went to China and Vietnam to research another novel, and he recently published a photography book capturing his journey through North Korea, including Pyongyang, Kaesong and the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Frieden has also written about his globetrotting book research in Thrilleresque¬Æ Magazine. In addition, his non-fiction works have appeared in numerous legal, technology and international business publications worldwide.

It is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN and is listed on CITES appendix II. Taxonomy As the Pteropus genus is quite speciose, it is further divided into species groups. The Aru flying fox is placed in the livingstonii species group. Other members of this species group include: *Livingstone's fruit bat, P. livingstonii *Black-bearded flying fox, P. melanopogon *Kei flying fox, P. keyensisTsang, S. M. (2015).

Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), London, UK. while others believe that it is distinct enough to be considered a species.Bergmans, W. 2001. Notes on distribution and taxonomy of Australasian bats. I. Pteropodinae and Nyctimeninae (Mammalia, Megachiroptera, Pteropodidae). Beaufortia 8(51): 119-152. Description They are similar in appearance to the black-bearded flying fox. The fronts of their heads are a combination of gray, black, and yellowish-white. The backs of their heads are rust-colored, and their chins are a deep red. Their necks are rust or rust-brown in color, creating the appearance of a chestnut collar. Their backs are glossy, yellowish-white, with some black hairs sprinkled throughout. Their lower ventral sides are variable in color, and can be black and rusty yellow, or black and rusty brown. Their upper ventral sides along the sternum are dark brown to black. Their forearms are long. Conservation This species is possibly extinct. In 2017, a statistical model assessed the extinction probability of 23 mammal species that have been missing since the 19th century. The Aru flying fox was one of the five species that the model determined was almost certainly extinct. There has not been a confirmed sighting of this species since 1877.Lee, T. E., Fisher, D.

Global change biology, 23(2), 621-634. The IUCN currently lists this species as critically endangered on the basis that there are most likely fewer than 50 remaining. Expeditions sponsored by the Western Australia Museum in the 1990s were unsuccessful in locating any individuals. However, a toothless jawbone discovered in 1992 \\"probably represents this species.\\" It is a large and colorful bat, so it is speculated that hunting played a role in its decline and possible extinction.

The measurement is done by counting crossings of the curve with grid lines. The number of crossings is the approximate length of the curve in millimetres. The design of the Steinhaus longimeter can be seen as an application of the Crofton formula, according to which the length of a curve equals the expected number of times it is crossed by a random line.

He was known for compositions such as \\"Soul and Violin\\", \\"Night Whistle\\", \\"Go Albirroja Go\\" - the most popular song dedicated to the Paraguayan football team  and several symphonic poems. In addition to his musical career, he took a Bachelor's degree in journalism at the National University of Asunci√≥n. He has now been playing the violin professionally for about seventy years. His parents were Turiano √Ålvarez and Ramona Florent√≠n. Childhood and Youth His musical bent was evident to his parents at an early stage, since at the age of 8 he had already made himself a violin and taught himself to play it. The young Lorenzo soon decided that he wanted to become a musician, as music was a passion for him and he was aware of his talent for the violin. At the age of 11 he moved to the departmental capital, Encarnaci√≥n, to begin his musical studies in a culturally important centre under teachers who would help him to improve himself. It was the Molinas brothers who gave him the first impulse in the field of musical studies. He made his debut as a musician as a member of their band. Career He stayed for more than a decade in the region where he was born, and then in 1950 he moved to Asunci√≥n to try for success there, offering his talent as a violinist in any band that needed his skills while he was completing his higher-level studies with the most recognized and renowned teachers. In 1952, Leonardo Alarc√≥n formed a big band that bore his name and invited Lorenzo to be one of its members. Alarc√≥n was a musician and composer, trumpeter in the Band of Police Musicians of the capital, and a former pupil of Salvador D√©ntice. From then on the young Lorenzo √Ålvarez had the opportunity to work professionally with true musical artists. After staying for a year in Alarc√≥n's ensemble, √Ålvarez took an important step in his career when the renowned composer and conductor Florent√≠n Gim√©nez invited him to be first violin in his \\"Traditional and Modern\\" group, which in the mid-fifties had a reputation hard to match. Its 14 members included well-known figures such as Oscar Escobar, Carlos Centurion, Juan Carlos Miranda, and Jorge Alonso, and the group performed at the most important social events throughout Paraguay. His priorities for continuing his musical education included improvements in his violin playing and studies of theory and sight-reading. He studied under Alfredo Kamprad at the Normal School of Music, where in 1955 he was appointed senior teacher of violin. He studied theory and sight-reading with Rodolfo Bagnati and harmony with Juan Carlos Moreno Gonz√°lez, and a year later he completed his training studying composition with Florent√≠n Gim√©nez. In 1959 he won first prize in a composition contest organized by the Municipality of Asunci√≥n. In the early 1960s √Ålvarez started the \\"International Rhythm Band\\", refreshing the Paraguayan dance repertoire with selections of polkas and foreign hits over more than a decade. New directions For several decades he concentrated on violin performance, joining well-known bands and later directing bands of his own. Then in 1970 he reduced his professional playing in order to deepen his violin studies and expand his knowledge of harmony and composition. He remained as a performer in the Symphony Orchestra of the City of Asunci√≥n (OSCA), of which he had been a member since its beginning in 1957, and stayed on until his retirement in 1992. His works Among his most famous works are: \\"Soul and Violin\\", a joyful piece whose interpretation requires great skill in violin performance, \\"Night Whistle\\", \\"Sweet Melody\\", \\"Cirilo R. Zayas‚Äù, and most of all the march \\"La Albirroja\\" composed with √Ångel Peralta Arellano. Other works by him include \\"Madrecita M√≠a\\", \\"Che hait√©ma lo mit√¢\\", \\"Purah√©i\\", \\"Gustav√≠\\", \\"Mirtha Elizabeth\\", \\"Luisito\\", \\"Maria Victoria\\" and \\"Gladys Sunilda\\", all with Rudi Torga, dedicated to his children, in addition to the symphonic poems: \\"Jasy Ret√¢\\", \\"Sailor on the High Seas\\", \\"Malec√≥n del Puerto\\", \\"Journey to the Horizon\\", among others. At the age of 78 he was still very active musically: at that time he was conducting the Jos√© Asunci√≥n Flores folk orchestra at the National Conservatory of Music. In this institution he was teaching the violin, and also giving special performances, either with his son Lu√≠s, with Juan Cancio Barreto or with Berta Rojas. He died of a heart attack on July 9, 2014.

Her voice, though thin, was extremely sweet, of extraordinary compass upwards, and so flexible as to lead her to indulge in a flowery style of singing which had then the merit of considerable novelty. She was also a good actress. But it was soon found that there was a great sameness in her manner and embellishments, and she became gradually so disregarded, by the end of her second season, that she went to Dresden, where the Elector engaged her at a salary of a thousand ducats. She came a second time to London, many years later, and reappeared in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto. Never was a more pitiable attempt; she had scarcely a thread of voice remaining nor the power to sing a note in tune: her figure and acting were equally altered for the worse, and after a few nights she was obliged to retire, and quit the stage for ever.

History = Opening = The first survey of the London and Birmingham Railway's main line to London plotted a course which ran through Buckingham where a large locomotive and carriage works would have been built. The route was however altered in the face of opposition from the Duke of Buckingham who feared for the future of the town, and the line took a new course through Wolverton, opening in 1838. It was to be a further twelve years before Buckingham was connected to the railway, this time on the initiative of the second Duke of Buckingham together with local landowner Sir Harry Verney who formed the Buckinghamshire Railway to construct a line between Banbury and Bletchley. After three years of construction, the single track line opened to passengers on 1 May 1850. The line was initially worked by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) which laid on a service of four trains each way daily. At Buckingham, a temporary rudimentary wooden station fronting on to Lenborough Road was used which initially suffered from poor access, being situated almost in the middle of a field along a footpath. This was improved when, in 1853, the station was reached by Chandos Road. The Buckingham Corporation petitioned the railway company to construct a better station which it eventually did in 1861. Designed by John William Livock, the new station was constructed in a doric style with cornice moulding and pediment. A new road named \\"Station Road\\" was laid from Chandos Road to connect with Gawcott Road to allow passengers to reach the new booking office. = Early years = A number of railway excursions were organised in the early years, taking passengers to destinations such as Crystal Palace via Euston. Initial regular services consisted of five daily trains each way on weekdays and one afternoon service on Sundays. Passengers could travel to London via Verney Junction and Bletchley in around 2.5 hours, the service then continuing on to Liverpool and Birmingham via Rugby. The completion of the new line south from Verney Junction to Aylesbury in 1868 opened up the possibility of further destinations. In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died leaving no male issue meaning that the Dukedom of Buckingham and Chandos became extinct. The family seat at Stowe House was subsequently let to the Comte de Paris, the royalist pretender to the French throne. His residence at Stowe House led the railway company to install bilingual signage at the station as an aid to his staff.The University of Buckingham, \\"Buckingham then: Mid 18th to 20th century\\". In 1898, W H Smith installed a book stall on the platform, this was subsequently replaced by a Wyman's stall when a change in contract resulted in Smith's moving their business to the town centre. Milk trade was becoming an important source of railway income at the turn of the twentieth century, so much so that a creamery and milk processing factory was constructed opposite the station to handle the milk train traffic. The factory's owners changed names several times, being variously known as the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., the Condensed and Peptonised Milk Co., Thew, Hook and Gilbey and then later as United Dairies. In 1915, the LNWR made a number of economies to the line, one of which included the closure of the small signal box in the goods yard, 750 yards to the north of the station. The double-track section between the station and signal box - the only doubled section on the line - was severed at the station and a buffer stop installed on the down line. The up and down lines were then reconnected by slewing a section of track across. = Decline and closure = Passenger traffic over the line was never particularly heavy, although it was a useful goods route. In the face of increased competition from buses and the private motor car in the 1920s and 1930s, passenger levels declined. By the late 1940s, Sunday passenger services were withdrawn and there were now only four services each way on weekdays. The line was also hit hard by the ASLEF strike of 1955 which saw much of the milk traffic lost to road. A form of reprieve came in 1956 when British Rail attempted to reduce losses by introducing lightweight single unit diesel cars (9 up and down daily) in 1956 between Banbury and Buckingham as part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. Although this experiment was rewarded by an increase in traffic of over 400%, British Rail nevertheless claimed that the line was uneconomic. The section between Banbury and Buckingham closed on 2 January 1961, leaving Buckingham as the terminus for the branch passenger traffic. Proposals to close the remainder of the line surfaced in September 1963 and a public hearing was held the following October. Passenger services were subsequently withdrawn as from 7 September 1964, leaving the line to Verney Junction open for freight. Woolworths opened a store in Buckingham in February 1964 and operated a policy of moving their goods by rail. The station's goods yard was soon full of vans carrying the company's merchandise. British Rail nonetheless announced the closure of the branch to Verney Junction as from 11 March 1966, with the line remaining open until 4 April for the purposes of a visit from the Queen. The station did eventually close in December 1966. In its last full year of service, the line between Bletchley and Buckingham carried 6,600 passengers, with receipts of ¬£4,000.

Life He joined the Order of St. Benedict when he was seventeen years of age, and made his solemn profession at the Abbey of St. Allire, 2 May 1656. He was a student of the Fathers of the Church and the history of the councils. When the Congregation of St. Maur in 1670 determined to undertake a critical edition of the works of Augustine of Hippo, Delfau was commissioned by his superiors to prepare it. Together with six other members of the order, among them his intimate friend Dom Robert Gu√©rard, he began the task. In 1671 he prepared an elaborate prospectus, setting forth the general scope and character of the new edition and the principles by which the editors were to be guided. Manuscripts came to the Maurists from various countries, and Pope Clement X sent them codices from the Vatican Library, together with all the materials that had been gathered there under Pope Clement VIII for a projected edition of the Opera Augustini. When the first two volumes were about to be printed, the work was suddenly arrested, 18 Sept., 1675, by two lettres de cachet from Louis XIV, decreeing the banishment of both Delfau and Gu√©rard from Paris. The occasion for this drastic measure seems to have been Delfau's book \\"L'abb√© commendataire\\", published at Cologne, 1673, in which the young monk had commented on the abuses connected with the system of commendatory abbots as it was then in France. Delfau was obliged to withdraw to the monastery of Landevenec; he lived there but little more than a year when, at the early age of thirty-eight, he was drowned as he was crossing to the Carmelite convent at Brest, where he was to deliver a eulogy on the feast-day of St. Teresa. Works Delfau's works are: *\\"Apologia Cardinalis F√ºrstenbergii\\"; an epitaph on Casimir, King of Poland, who died as Abbot of St. Germain des Pr√©s; *a dissertation on the authorship of the Imitatio Christi, in his edition of that book (Paris, 1673).

She was elected as one of the original members of the Council of the District of Columbia in 1974 when D.C. gained home rule. She represented Ward 3 on the council from 1975 to 1987. Early life and career Shackleton was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. Before moving to Washington, D.C. in 1939, she worked on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidential campaign, giving her a first taste of politics. Her early career included being an editor for Who's Who in American Art, as well as the American Art Annual. During World War II, Shackleton worked as an information specialist and researcher for the Office of War Information. She also held a position at the American Institute of Architects from 1951 to 1962.Guide to the Polly Shackleton Papers, 1894-1997, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University Political career Shackleton first participated in D.C. politics during the 1950s. When Adlai Stevenson ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1952, she was actively involved in his campaign. Once Stevenson received the nomination, she became a member of the Democratic Central Committee, as well as an alternate Democratic National Committeewoman. In 1956, her political involvement expanded when she became a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and served on the platform committee. Eleven years later in 1967, President Johnson appointed Shackleton to the first D.C. City Council. When the District held its first elected Council in 1974, Shackleton received one of the seats. After being elected to additional terms in 1978 and 1982, she retired from public office in 1986. During her tenure on the Council, Shackleton served on various committees dedicated to health and welfare, citizen's rights, and childcare. She was well known for her social efforts for the poor, children, elderly, and infirm. Shackleton also advocated for District Home Rule and National Representation. When it came to issues surrounding transportation, she supported METRO legislation and the building of bicycle paths. In addition, she was an active supporter of Project Pride, a D.C. summer program involving youth who built community while beautifying various parts of the city. Her efforts in office aided in the passing of 60 pieces of legislation that later became D.C. law.

She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. Bloody Mary appearances are mostly \\"witnessed\\" in group participation play. Ritual An early 20th century Halloween greeting card depicts a divination ritual in which a woman stares into a mirror in a darkened room to catch a glimpse of the face of her future husband. The shadow of a witch is cast onto the wall at left. Historically, the divination ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry. In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of catoptromancy. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions, the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times). The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost that can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes seen covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,Bloody Mary at Urban Legends or scratching their eyes out.Bloody Mary; www.Halloween‚ÄìWebsite.com; retrieved November 15, 2018.

Phenomenon explanations Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate. Facial features may appear to \\"melt\\", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the \\"strange-face illusion\\", is believed to be a consequence of a \\"dissociative identity effect\\", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way. Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of Troxler's fading,An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters; accessed December 2013. and possibly self-hypnosis.

Frontier Adventure Sports has established an international reputation for solid logistics and challenging racecourses. FAST hosts events under several banners: the Frontier Adventure Challenge, Raid the North and Raid the North Extreme. These non-stop races range in length from 8 hours to six days and require coed teams of three or four to hike, mountain bike, paddle and negotiate fixed ropes, while navigating an unmarked racecourse through the wilderness.  Adventure racing  Adventure racing can be defined as a non- stop, multi-day, multi-discipline, team event. In many ways it can be likened to an expedition with a stopwatch. The goal of the competition is to be the first team to get all members across the finish line together. Adventure racing requires teamwork, perseverance, and strong navigation and wilderness survival skills. The most common disciplines involved in an adventure race are mountain biking, hiking, paddling and rappelling. There are many different lengths and formats of events, ranging from off-road triathlons, to month-long expeditions. The course should take competitors through remote wilderness where they must travel without outside assistance. Each team must use strategy to determine the best route, equipment, food and pace to maintain to win.  Raid the North  Team The Big Fish, Penticton B.C. Since 1997, Raid the North events have been designed to highlight the natural elements of the host region environment. The Raid the North Race Series consists of a national series of 36-hour races in various locations across Canada, during which teams will cover between 130 and 150 kilometers. A Raid the North Team is a co-ed group of four people with a variety of sport, outdoor and wilderness backgrounds. Unlike RTNX, Raid the North events are geared towards the prepared first time adventure racer.  Raid the North Extreme  Raid the North Extreme (RTNX) is a 6-day expedition-style adventure race. It was held once per year from 1999 to 2004, and since then has been held every three years.Explore Magazine, April 11, 2007 Strong navigation skills and wilderness experience are required as the course covers roughly 500 kilometers of unmarked terrain. Each year the race travels to a different region in Canada that provides rugged wilderness challenges for competitors.Explore Newfoundland Raid the North Extreme was one of the original founding members of the Adventure Racing World Series and a qualifier race for the AR World Championship.XtremeSport4U website story, Raid the North Extreme, Nov 2008 Raid the North Extreme was selected as the Adventure Racing World Championships in 2004. RTNX was included in the 2011 World Series. Raid the North Extreme is designed for experienced adventure racers, or those with significant wilderness experience, as there are significantly long sections of remote wilderness where rescue is difficult. Mixed gender teams of four have up to 6 days (non-stop) to cover 450 kilometres by trekking, mountain biking, paddling, and mountaineering. Competitors must navigate their own route through checkpoints throughout the racecourse. It is the only expedition-style event longer than 48 hrs in Canada. Raid the North Extreme competitors come from across Canada and the United States and tend to have a broad multi-sport experience and/or extensive outdoor skills. International race competitors have come from Mexico, Argentina, Spain, France, Finland, New Zealand and Singapore.

Although it is hunted for both food and as a pest, it is not known if this has a significant impact on the species. It has been seen roosting in tall, well-established trees in urban areas and will fly several kilometres to eat wild and cultivated fruits. The species was named after Knud Christian Andersen. It was last recorded in Thailand in 1970 and, presumably, there is still a small viable population in Myanmar. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1908 by Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen. The holotype had been collected by William Ruxton Davison and presented to Andersen by Allan Octavian Hume. There is taxonomic uncertainty regarding this species: some have published that it is likely synonymous with the Indian flying fox while other have published that it is synonymous with the large flying fox. Its species name \\"intermedius\\" is Latin for \\"intermediate;\\" Andersen may have chosen that name because he compared it to both the Indian flying fox and the large flying fox. Description Andersen wrote that it was \\"scarcely distinguishable\\" from the Indian flying fox based on its skull morphology, dentition, and external characters. He distinguished it as a new species based by the color of its breast and belly, which he described as seal brown. Its forearm is approximately long. Range and habitat The holotype was collected in Moulmein, Myanmar. Its range includes Myanmar and Thailand. Conservation It is currently evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN. The IUCN refers to its validity as a species as \\"dubious,\\" citing their belief that future research will synonymize it with the Indian flying fox. It meets the criteria for data deficient because there is a scarcity of information on its population size and trend, as well as any threats it may be facing.

In 1782 Zubov joined the Horse Guards Regiment where he became known for his gigantic height, physical strength and fiery temper. When his younger brother Platon became Catherine II's lover, the \\"colossus\\" was made a count and general. He helped Alexander Suvorov fend off Prince Potemkin's intrigues, courted his only daughter, the Suvorochka (1775‚Äì1844), and eventually married her towards the end of 1794. Although Catherine II's death spelled the end of his career, Nicholas mustered courage and rushed to the Gatchina Palace, where her son Paul was residing. He hoped to become the first to congratulate Paul on his prospective accession to the throne. On hearing the news of his arrival, Paul refused to see the courtier. He had heard the rumor that the Zubovs persuaded the Empress to sign a testament transferring the throne to her grandson Alexander and was afraid that Zubov had come to arrest him. In short order, the Zubov brothers were exiled from court and little was heard about them until November 1800, when Nicholas was permitted to return to St. Petersburg. The connections of his sister Olga Zherebtsova and the funds provided by her lover Lord Whitworth allowed him and Count Pahlen to form a conspiracy. On the night of 11 March 1801 the plotters broke into Paul's bedroom in Saint Michael's Castle, and Zubov struck the emperor down with a heavy snuffbox, whereupon he was strangled by his accomplices. Zubov died four years after the regicide. Among his descendants was Count Valentin Platonovich Zubov (1884‚Äì1969) who founded the Gatchina museum and authored several books about Tsar Paul and his reign.

Its name comes from the Vietnamese words chanh (meaning \\"lime\\" or \\"lemon\\") and mu·ªëi (meaning \\"salt\\"). To make the chanh mu·ªëi, many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled.

Despite his youth, his first symphony is an impressive piece of orchestral music for both its time and size. The first movement opens with a stately Adagio introduction, reminiscent of Joseph Haydn's 104th symphony in its format. The short Adagio sets off a lively Allegro vivace. The symphony is scored for 1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in D, 2 trumpets in D, timpani and strings. The orchestration, which is balanced between strings and winds, lends itself to small chamber orchestras, as well as larger ensembles. The trumpets are scored particularly high, as in many of Schubert's early works. Trumpet players will find, in general, the tessitura sitting between D4 and A5 (as sounded) for most of the first and fourth movements. In the fourth movement, Schubert pushes them up to a high D6, in a repeated fashion. Some careful planning is needed to balance the multiple doublings between horns and trumpets.

It tells the story of two sisters and their estranged grandmother. The novel was a New York Times bestseller.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E1D61230F93AA35753C1A9639C8B63 The two sisters happen to wear the same size shoes - the only common ground that they have besides a mutual hatred of their step-mother. Plot summary Rose and Maggie Feller are two young sisters who share little in common except their shoe size. Rose is the eldest and has been watching after Maggie since they were young children and their mother Caroline died in a car accident. They were raised by their father Michael (perpetually in mourning for Caroline) and stepmother Sydelle (who resents them both). Rose is a thirty- year-old single, successful lawyer who struggles with her weight, and who resents her younger sister's beauty and sexual attractiveness and lack of stability. Rose feels responsible for her sister and is frustrated with how each attempt to help Maggie backfires on her. Maggie, a twenty-eight-year-old who uses her beauty and charming nature to hide the obstacles she faces due to dyslexia and related learning difficulties, resents Rose's academic success and consequent wealth. Maggie is resentful of only ever holding a series of minimum wage jobs that leave her dependent on the charity of others especially her father and Rose. After middle school, standardized testing sets them on different paths in high school: Rose's success on the exams leads to Princeton University and University of Pennsylvania Law School; Maggie is unable to take the exams and is consequently sidelined in high school and due to her inability to cope with school work, she drops out of high school. She is unable to hold on to any job for long and struggles to manage her money so much so that she is evicted from her flat. Rose offers to support Maggie until her life gets sorted out by giving her a place to stay. Both are nearing the age of their mother when she died, Rose and Maggie each feel as if there is a vacuum in their lives which they are unable to fill. After wearing out her welcome with Rose (by sleeping with Rose's boyfriend in Rose's bed) and being evicted from her father's home by her stepmother, Maggie runs away, choosing to hide in Princeton University, which she had visited when Rose was a student. Finding shelter in a lower level of the library (with a fully equipped bathroom/shower), Maggie fills her free time doing something that she had avoided her entire life: reading. She also accepts a part-time position as a care-taker for a nearby elderly woman. Maggie is surprised to find that when reading in her own way at her own pace, she enjoys the activity and even begins to attend a poetry class. Eventually, however, a boy (whose wallet she had stolen) discovers her belongings in the library. Realizing her charade at Princeton is over, Maggie runs away. She travels to find her long-lost grandmother, whose old letters she had discovered previously in her father's desk. Rose, meanwhile, leaves her career in law in order to avoid the boyfriend who betrayed her. As a result of this break she accidentally discovers what life as a dog-walker would be like. She also begins to date Simon Stein, a colleague at the law firm. Grandma Ella had been forced out of the lives of the girls by their father. He had blamed her for Caroline's death ‚Äî she had been mentally ill and not taking her medication at the time of her death. Grandma Ella had previously tried to track the girls via the Internet (only finding information on Rose) is delighted to see Maggie and invites her to stay in her home. Gradually Maggie, Ella, and eventually Rose reconcile with each other, and in the process come to terms with both the life and death of Caroline. Maggie finds her true calling: being a personal shopper to the old people in the community that Grandma Ella lives in. Eventually she is successful enough to open her own shop. She shows Rose that she has become a better person and proves her love by making Rose's wedding dress for her.

The word slug is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell). Various taxonomic families of land slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages, which also include snails. Thus, the various families of slugs are not closely related, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category \\"slug\\" is a polyphyletic one. Taxonomy Of the six orders of Pulmonata, two ‚Äì the Onchidiacea and Soleolifera ‚Äì solely comprise slugs. A third family, the Sigmurethra, contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs. The taxonomy of this group is in the process of being revised in light of DNA sequencing. It appears that pulmonates are paraphyletic and basal to the opisthobranchs, which are a terminal branch of the tree. The family Ellobiidae are also polyphyletic. *Subinfraorder Orthurethra **Superfamily Achatinelloidea Gulick, 1873 **Superfamily Cochlicopoidea Pilsbry, 1900 **Superfamily Partuloidea Pilsbry, 1900 **Superfamily Pupilloidea Turton, 1831 *Subinfraorder Sigmurethra **Superfamily Acavoidea Pilsbry, 1895 **Superfamily Achatinoidea Swainson, 1840 **Superfamily Aillyoidea Baker, 1960 **Superfamily Arionoidea J.E.

The upper pair is light sensing and has eyespots at the ends, while the lower pair provides the sense of smell. Both pairs are retractable. Mantle On top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped mantle, and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a respiratory opening, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. This opening is known as the pneumostome. Tail The part of a slug behind the mantle is called the 'tail'. Keel Some species of slugs, for example Tandonia budapestensis, have a prominent ridge running over their back along the middle of the tail (sometimes along the whole tail, sometimes only the final part). This ridge is called a 'keel'. Foot The bottom side of a slug, which is flat, is called the 'foot'. Like almost all gastropods, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscular contraction on the underside of its foot. It simultaneously secretes a layer of mucus that it travels on, which helps prevent damage to the foot tissues. Around the edge of the foot in some slugs is a structure called the 'foot fringe'. Vestigial shell Most slugs retain a remnant of their shell, which is usually internalized. This organ generally serves as storage for calcium salts, often in conjunction with the digestive glands. An internal shell is present in the Limacidae and Parmacellidae. Adult Philomycidae, Onchidiidae and Veronicellidae lack shells. Physiology An active Ambigolimax slug in Fremont, California Slugs' bodies are made up mostly of water and, without a full-sized shell, their soft tissues are prone to desiccation. They must generate protective mucus to survive. Many species are most active just after rain because of the moist ground. In drier conditions, they hide in damp places such as under tree bark, fallen logs, rocks and man-made structures, such as planters, to help retain body moisture. Like all other gastropods, they undergo torsion (a 180¬∞ twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation‚Äîbut externally, the bodies of slugs appear more or less symmetrical, except the pneumostome, which is on one side of the animal, normally the right-hand side. Slugs produce two types of mucus: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. Both kinds are hygroscopic. The thin mucus spreads from the foot's centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats the whole body of the animal. The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces. The \\"slime trail\\" a slug leaves behind has some secondary effects: other slugs coming across a slime trail can recognise the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which is useful in finding a mate. Following a slime trail is also part of the hunting behaviour of some carnivorous slugs. Body mucus provides some protection against predators, as it can make the slug hard to pick up and hold by a bird's beak, for example, and the mucus itself can be distasteful. Some species of slug, such as Limax maximus, secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation. Reproduction Deroceras juvenile with eggs of another (larger) slug species, most likely Arionidae Pair of mating slugs, suspended by mucous thread and pad on wall. Slugs are hermaphrodites, having both female and male reproductive organs. Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later, the slugs lay approximately thirty eggs in a hole in the ground, or beneath the cover of an object such as a fallen log. Apophallation has been reported only in some species of banana slug (Ariolimax) and one species of Deroceras. In the banana slugs, the penis sometimes becomes trapped inside the body of the partner. Apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves by one or both of the slugs chewing off the other's or its own penis. Once the penis has been discarded, banana slugs are still able to mate using only the female parts of the reproductive system. Ecology Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem by eating decaying plant material and fungi. Most carnivorous slugs on occasion also eat dead specimens of their own kind. =Feeding habits= Large Slug near Manali, India Most species of slugs are generalists, feeding on a broad spectrum of organic materials, including leaves from living plants, lichens, mushrooms, and even carrion. Some slugs are predators and eat other slugs and snails, or earthworms. Lehmannia feeding on a small fruit in Mexico City Slugs can feed on a wide variety of vegetables and herbs, including flowers such as petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies, daffodils, narcissus, gentians, primroses, tuberous begonias, hollyhocks, irises, and fruits such as strawberries. They also feed on carrots, peas, apples, and cabbage that are offered as a sole food source. Slugs from different families are fungivores. It is the case in the Philomycidae (e. g. Philomycus carolinianus and Phylomicus flexuolaris) and Ariolimacidae (Ariolimax californianus), which respectively feed on slime molds (myxomycetes) and mushrooms (basidiomycetes). Species of mushroom producing fungi used as food source by slugs include milk- caps, Lactarius spp., the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus and the penny bun, Boletus edulis. Other species pertaining to different genera, such as Agaricus, Pleurocybella and Russula, are also eaten by slugs. Slime molds used as food source by slugs include Stemonitis axifera and Symphytocarpus flaccidus. Some slugs are selective towards certain parts or developmental stages of the fungi they eat, though this is very variable. Depending on the species and other factors, slugs eat only fungi at specific stages of development. Moreover, in other cases, whole mushrooms can be eaten, without any selection or bias towards ontogenetic stages. =Predators= Slugs are preyed upon by myriad vertebrates and invertebrates. The predation of slugs has been the subject of studies for at least a century. Because some species of slugs are considered agricultural pests, research investments have been made to comprehend and investigate potential predators. This is a necessary knowledge to establish biological control strategies. Vertebrates Slugs are preyed upon by virtually every major vertebrate group. With many examples among reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians and fish, vertebrates can occasionally feed on, or be specialised predators of slugs. Fish that feed on slugs include the brown trout (Salmo trutta), which occasionally feeds on Arion circumscriptus, an arionid slug. Similarly, the shortjaw kokopu (Galaxias postvectis) includes slugs in its diet. Amphibians such as frogs and toads have long been regarded as important predators of slugs. Among them are species in the genus Bufo (e. g. Bufo marinus) and Ceratophrys. Reptiles that feed on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some colubrid snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal populations of the garter snake, Thamnophis elegans, have a specialised diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feeds on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This is the case in the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), the bobtail lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), the she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara). Birds that prey upon slugs include common blackbirds (Turdus merula), starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), jackdaws (Corvus monedula), owls, vultures and ducks. Studies on slug predation also cite fieldfares (feeding on Deroceras reticulatum), redwings (feeding on Limax and Arion), thrushes (on Limax and Arion ater), red grouse (on Deroceras and Arion hortensis), game birds, wrynecks (on Limax flavus), rock doves and charadriiform birds as slug predators. Mammals that eat slugs include foxes, badgers and hedgehogs. Invertebrates Beetles in the family Carabidae, such as Carabus violaceus and Pterostichus melanarius, are known to feed on slugs. =Parasites and parasitoids= Slugs are parasitised by several organisms, including acari and a wide variety of nematodes. The slug mite, Riccardoella limacum, is known to parasitise several dozen species of mollusks, including many slugs, such as Agriolimax agrestis, Arianta arbustrum, Arion ater, Arion hortensis, Limax maximus, Milax budapestensis, Milax gagates, and Milax sowerbyi. R. limacum can often be seen swarming about their host's body, and live in its respiratory cavity. Several species of nematodes are known to parasitise slugs. The nematode worms Agfa flexilis and Angiostoma limacis respectively live in the salivary glands and rectum of Limax maximus.Taylor J. W. (1902). Part 8, pages 1‚Äì52. Monograph of the land and freshwater Mollusca of the British Isles. Testacellidae. Limacidae. Arionidae. Taylor Brothers, Leeds. Introduction page XV., pages 34-52. Species of widely known medical importance pertaining to the genus Angiostrongylus are also parasites of slugs. Both Angiostrongylus costaricensis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a meningitis-causing nematode, have larval stages that can only live in mollusks, including slugs, such as Limax maximus. Insects such as dipterans are known parasitoids of mollusks. To complete their development, many dipterans use slugs as hosts during their ontogeny. Some species of blow-flies (Calliphoridae) in the genus Melinda are known parasitoids of Arionidae, Limacidae and Philomycidae. Flies in the family Phoridae, specially those in the genus Megaselia, are parasitoids of Agriolimacidae, including many species of Deroceras. House flies in the family Muscidae, mainly those in the genus Sarcophaga, are facultative parasitoids of Arionidae. Behavior Slug contracts itself and retracts its tentacles when attacked The alarm response posture of the Kerry slug, which is found only in this species When attacked, slugs can contract their body, making themselves harder and more compact and more still and round. By doing this, they become firmly attached to the substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general behavioral pattern, the Kerry slug retracts its head, lets go of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape. 9 pp. This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae, and among most other slugs. Some slugs can self-amputate (autotomy) a portion of their tail to help the slug escape from a predator. Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn. Intra- and inter-specific agonistic behavior is documented, but varies greatly among slug species. Slugs often resort to aggression, attacking both conspecifics and individuals from other species when competing for resources. This aggressiveness is also influenced by seasonality, because the availability of resources such as shelter and food may be compromised due to climatic conditions. Slugs are prone to attack during the summer, when the availability of resources is reduced. During winter, the aggressive responses are substituted by a gregarious behavior. Human relevance The great majority of slug species are harmless to humans and to their interests, but a small number of species are serious pests of agriculture and horticulture. They can destroy foliage faster than plants can grow, thus killing even fairly large plants. They also feed on fruits and vegetables prior to harvest, making holes in the crop, which can make individual items unsuitable to sell for aesthetic reasons, and can make the crop more vulnerable to rot and disease. Excessive buildup of slugs within some wastewater treatment plants with inadequate screening have been found to cause process issues resulting in increased energy and chemical use.Thompson, M. (2018) 'Evaluating Opportunities and Barriers to Improving the Energy Efficiency of Small Nebraska Wastewater Treatment Plants', pp.83 As control measures, baits are the norm in both agriculture and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may be exposed to the bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate has been shown to be at least as effective as baits. Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops. In a few rare cases, humans have developed Angiostrongylus cantonensis-induced meningitis from eating raw slugs. Live slugs that are accidentally eaten with improperly cleaned vegetables (such as lettuce), or improperly cooked slugs (for use in recipes requiring larger slugs such as banana slugs), can act as a vector for a parasitic infection in humans.Senanayake, S.

It is an endangered species risking extinction. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1929 by Australian mammalogist Ellis Le Geyt Troughton. As the genus Pteropus is speciose, it is divided into closely related species groups. The Rennell flying fox is in the \\"samoensis\\" species group. Its species name \\"rennelli\\" comes from Rennell Island, which is part of the Solomon Islands. Rennell Island was where the holotype was collected, and remains the only known location of this species. In 1962, Hill published that he considered Rennell's flying fox as a subspecies of the Solomons flying fox, with a trinomen of Pteropus rayneri rennelli. Description The forearm of the holotype was long. The fur of its back is uniformly brownish, with the fur of its neck and face lighter. Biology Females give birth to one offspring per litter, with the young called a \\"pup.\\" Its lifespan is estimated at 8-9 years. It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places such as trees during the day. Individuals roost by themselves. Range and habitat It is only known from Rennell Island, which is part of the Solomon Islands. Conservation The holotype was the only known individual of these species until 1958, when two more were collected. It is currently listed as an endangered species by the IUCN; its 2017 assessment uplisted it from its 2008 status of vulnerable.

Biography Born in the rural parish of Auchterhouse in Angus, Scotland, into a farming family, Bell chose to study divinity at the University of St Andrews. He was Carmyllie parish minister from 1843 until his death. The Reaping Machine 1851 illustration showing two horses pushing a Bell reaper Bell invented the reaping machine while working on his father's farm. His interest in mechanics led him to work on a horse powered mechanical reaper for speeding up the harvest. In 1828 his machine was used with success on his father's farm and others in the district. This reaping machine used a revolving 12 vane reel to pull the crop over the cutting knife, that was made from triangular reciprocating blades over fixed triangular blades. A canvas conveyor moved the grain and stalks to the side in a windrow. This machine was pushed by livestock and ran on 2 wheels. Bell never sought a patent for his reaping machine. Being a man of God, he believed his invention should benefit all mankind. Therefore he never made any financial gain from its success throughout the world. On May 3, 1831, a patent was issued in the United States to William Manning for the reaper of essentially the same design. On December 31, 1833, a similar cutter patent was issued to Obed Hussey. A vibrating cutter was patented by Cyrus McCormick on June 21, 1834. McCormick with his brothers mass-produced the machines and developed what became the International Harvester Company.

For many years, the band was a bona fide, and separate, military unit unto itself, with a separate Unit Identification Code within the CF. Today, the band has been reduced to volunteer status but officially maintains an establishment of eight paid military musicians on its rolls. The band has had mixed success in competitions,2nd place standing result, 2001 Grade III competition, Red Deer, 2006 Victoria Games 3rd place finish but under the direction of Pipe Major Michael Giles had become successful in the Grade Three circuit in Alberta in the years leading up to the regimental centennial in 2010.The band placed first in High River in 2006. The band published a recording to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Regiment in 1990, titled Eighty Years of Glory and commemorated its centennial in 2010 by releasing a second CD entitled Onward.Calgary Highlanders webpage with details on recording History The first pipe band was recruited for the regiment in the early 1920s, drawing on the musical talents in the Calgary area, including many civilian pipers playing with the Calgary Scottish Pipe Band. The band thrived through the donations of interested citizens and fund-raising; interested benefactors including Honorary Colonel R.B. Bennett who donated uniforms to the band in 1923, though the choice of tartan later proved controversial as noted below. During the Second World War, two pipe bands were in existence, one for each battalion of the regiment. Members of the 1st Battalion Pipe Band were trained soldiers. At Hill 67, pipers were assigned to each of the four rifle companies and played the battalion into their first combat action in Normandy - the only time in the war they were permitted to do so.[Bercuson, David. Battalion of Heroes: The Calgary Highlanders in World War II] In 1945, the Calgary Highlanders reverted to a one-battalion Militia unit again. The Pipes and Drums continued their role of support to regimental functions, recruiting, and after the reorganizations of Unification of the three services in 1968, became a separate unit of the Canadian Forces. The Pipes and Drums' membership declined in the 1970s, as military service became increasingly unpopular due to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The band was officially de-activated in 1975, after having been reduced to nil-strength in 1969. Under the direction of Pipe Major Don Maxwell, the band was rebuilt into a successful competition band, and Maxwell received admittance to the Order of Military Merit in the rank of Member in 1983 for reviving the Pipes and Drums.Pipe Major bios The band went into another period of decline following Maxwell's departure to form his own band in the 1980s, concentrating its efforts on regimental functions and street parades and performing poorly in competition. All members were required to complete basic military training, attend military musical courses, and take part in other unit training as deemed fit by the commanding officer. Civilian volunteers were, however, still permitted to augment the band's membership. It was during this time that the band lost access to a dedicated practice space. Officially a lodger unit in the garrison at Mewata Armouries, the band was assigned offices and a large practice room on the second floor. In 1991, the band was relocated to a series of unfinished rooms in the armoury basement, with an abandoned coal storage room expected to serve as a pipe practice room. In the mid-1990s, official funding as a separate unit was cut to military pipe bands throughout Canada, as the end of the Cold War caused a major reassessment of defence spending in NATO countries. The Highlanders were reduced to just two paid positions, with the remaining vacancies being filled by civilian and military volunteers. Several experienced pipers and drummers left the band for other duties within the military. As a military band, the Pipes and Drums have been recognized for their dress and deportment at civilian competitions as well.2007 Canmore Highland Games results Uniform The Pipes and Drums erroneously adopted the Royal Stewart tartan in 1923. The drummers switched to Government tartan Calgary Highlanders tartan page in 1929 to reflect the regiment's alliance with The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In 1939, the regiment mobilized a battalion for overseas service in the Second World War; eventually two battalions of Calgary Highlanders came into existence, one in Europe and one in Canada, each with its own Pipe Band. The 1st Battalion band in the United Kingdom was told it was not permitted to wear the Royal Stewart tartan; the 2nd Battalion continued to wear the tartan in Calgary. After 1945, the overseas battalion was disbanded, and the one-battalion regiment reverted to having just one band, clad in Government tartan. Dress regulations have generally followed that of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of the British Army in most respects; in 1992, tartan ribbons were added to the bagpipes to pay homage to both the appointment of Queen Elizabeth II as Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment (by wearing a Royal Stewart tartan on the front) and the contributions of the Calgary Scottish Pipe Band in the formative years of the band (by adopting Gordon tartan ribbons on the back). In the 1990s, piper and kilt-maker David Hongisto provided the band with its first white doublets for use as summer full dress; patterned after similar jackets worn by the British Army, this style of uniform had not been employed previously in the band's history. Less formal orders of dress have generally been a mix of standard military service dress (either battle dress, DEU or shirtsleeves) and Highland dress as appropriate. Style The band is properly styled as The Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders. The word \\"The\\" is always capitalized when it prefixes \\"Calgary Highlanders\\" as it forms part of the proper name of the regiment. An accepted short form is \\"Pipes and Drums\\". While reference to \\"the Band\\" is usually clearly understood, use of same is officially discouraged because in military parlance, a \\"band\\" consists of brass/reed instruments, as distinct from a pipe and drum band. In the 1920s, The Calgary Highlanders in fact did have a brass/reed band in addition to a pipe band; this brass band disappeared before the Second World War. Notable public appearances *The Pipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion were active throughout Europe during the Second World War, notably in the many victory parades in 1944-45, for example the triumphant march of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division through the streets of Dieppe on 3 September 1944. *The Pipes and Drums appeared in the Nova Scotia International Tattoo in 1988 and the Edinburgh Tattoo in 2000. The band has also performed on a regular basis in smaller festivals, such as tattoos in Lethbridge, Edmonton and Estes Park. Members of the Pipes and Drums formed part of a composite band of Canadian musicians from regiments for whom Queen Elizabeth II is Colonel-in-chief at the 2012 Edinburgh Tattoo, in honour of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee. *The Pipes and Drums are second to the Glenmore Temple Band of the Salvation Army as the longest serving recurring musical act in the Calgary Stampede Parade.Regimental websiteSalvation Army article referencing longevity Schedule The Pipes and Drums have maintained regular attendance at several key events in their annual schedule, including: *1 January: musical support to New Year's Levee *1 April: Regimental birthday *22 April: annual commemoration of the Battle of Kitcheners' Wood *1 July: Canada Day *July: Calgary Stampede Parade *31 October: annual commemoration of the Battle of Walcheren Causeway *11 November: Remembrance Day *25 December: Men's Christmas Dinner Not all observances are made directly on the dates indicated; as a reserve unit many regimental parades are scheduled for the Wednesday or weekend closest to the date in question instead.

Moore (1928 ‚Äì August 22, 2019) was a Methodist minister who organized the 1957 Royal Ice Cream Sit-in in Durham, North Carolina. Moore entered the ministry at a young age. After finding himself dissatisfied with what he perceived as a lack of action among his divinity peers, he decided to take a more activist course. Shortly after becoming a pastor in Durham, Moore decided to challenge the city's power structure via the Royal Ice Cream Sit- in, a protest in which he and several others sat down in the white section of an ice cream parlor and asked to be served. The sit-in failed to challenge segregation in the short run, and Moore's actions provoked a myriad of negative reactions from many white and African-American leaders, who considered his efforts far too radical. Nevertheless, Moore continued to press forward with his agenda of activism. Ultimately, however, Moore's plan of using the sit-in to challenge Durham's power structure proved successful. A new wave of young African-American students, inspired by the actions of the Royal Ice Cream protestors, adopted Moore's agenda, helping to bring about the desegregation of the city's public facilities. His actions also had effects that stretched far beyond the boundaries of Durham. Working with activist leaders he had once spurned, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and inspired by the actions of students in places such as Greensboro, North Carolina, Moore was able to organize additional sit-ins during the sit-in movement that spread all across the South. His work with the sit-in helped to spur the creation of ‚Äúlocal movement centers‚Äù, which facilitated the collective actions of African- Americans seeking to bring about an end to segregation throughout North Carolina and the region in years to come.Aldon Morris, ‚ÄúBlack Southern Student Sit-In Movement: An Indigenous Perspective,‚Äù CSRO Working Paper 234 (1981): 15, accessed April 13, 2014, doi: 2027.42/51008. In addition, Moore's idea of a group that used the power of nonviolence, using Christianity as an ideological base, ultimately became the symbol of a new era of activism and civil rights in the United States. Early life and education Douglas Elaine Moore was born in 1928 in Hickory, North Carolina. At an early age, he decided to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and enter the Methodist ministry. Shortly after earning a Bachelor of Arts from North Carolina College in 1949, Moore enrolled at Boston University as a divinity student in 1951. His political leanings were evident early on, as he joined a radical leftist group on campus and participated in protests of social ills. Moore also temporarily joined a student group called the Dialectical Society, which met every week for dinner and a discussion.Osha Gray Davidson, The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007), 87. However, he found the talks largely dissatisfying, viewing them as far too passive and abstract. In addition, he was not too fond of the leader of the Dialectical Society, the then-unknown Martin Luther King, Jr. Referring to him as ‚Äújust another Baptist preacher‚Äù, Moore invited King to join his student group.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 88. However, King declined to do so, likely put off by its radicalness and activist agenda. Moore soon parted ways with the Dialectical Society. He earned his Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1953 and his Master of Sacred Theology in 1958.Ralph Luker and Penny A. Russell, The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Birth of a New Age, December 1955-December 1956 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 393. Move to Durham After graduating, Moore moved back to the American South. He served as the minister for two small-town Methodist churches before becoming the pastor of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church in 1956. Soon after arriving in the city, Moore began to look for ways to challenge its power structure. Despite the fact that Durham was known for having better-than-average race relations for the region, Moore quickly concluded that it was the ‚Äúsame as any other place: They [the whites] wouldn‚Äôt give up nothing‚Äù. He made several attempts to desegregate the city's public facilities. After his family was denied admission to the then all-white Long Meadow Park swimming pool in 1957, Moore appealed to Durham recreation officers, to no avail. Other efforts included petitions to the city council to end segregation at the Carolina Theatre and the Durham Public Library.‚ÄúNegroes Fined In Dairy Bar Case,‚Äù The Durham Morning Herald, June 24, 1957. While these also resulted in little to no changes, Moore would make headlines later that year via what came to be known as the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in. Royal Ice Cream Sit-in On June 23, 1957, the 28-year-old Moore led three African-American men and three African-American women into the segregated Royal Ice Cream Parlor. They all sat down in the white section and asked to be served.Christina Greene, Our Separate Ways: Women and the Black Freedom Movement in Durham, North Carolina (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 65-66. Moore later told a reporter, ‚ÄúWe just decided we wanted to cool off, to get some ice cream or milk shakes.‚Äù The truth, however, was much more far-reaching than that. Moore later said that the parlor was chosen in advance because of its location in a predominantly-African-American neighborhood. He also indicated that he intended the sit-in to serve as a barometer ‚Äì a way to see how much progress African-American protestors could make, as well as what they needed to achieve more in the future.Interview of Douglas E. Moore by Elyse Gallo, January 28, 1978, Box 6, Duke University Oral History Program Collection, David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Duke University. In the end, after being asked to leave by the owner of the parlor and refusing to do so, all of the protestors, including Moore, were arrested. They were all convicted of trespassing and fined $10 plus court costs.‚ÄúColor Line Cracking Attempt Nets Fines,‚Äù The Durham Morning Herald, June 25, 1957. The sit-in soon turned into a protracted court battle: seeking an ally in his fight for the desegregation of public facilities, Moore hired Floyd McKissick, a prominent African-American attorney, to sue Royal Ice Cream.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 91. At the same time, he and the other protestors appealed their convictions. The case eventually made its way to the North Carolina Supreme Court, but the defendants ultimately lost.‚ÄúNegroes Lose In Trespass Case Appeal,‚Äù The Durham Morning Herald, January 11, 1958. The Royal Ice Cream Sit-in produced much controversy from the start. Moore failed to communicate to the sit-in participants all of the possible consequences of their actions: Virginia Williams and Mary Clyburn, two of the protestors, claimed in later interviews that they had not expected to be arrested.Greene, Our Separate Ways, 66. Nevertheless, the sit-in was carried out anyway, and there was immediate backlash from African-American groups in Durham. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs and the Durham Ministerial Alliance heavily criticized Moore, calling his efforts ‚Äúradical‚Äù.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 89. Indeed, Moore's call for immediate change directly opposed the practices of the African-American community in Durham. Previously, it had relied on backroom talks with the white elite to bring about concessions in a deliberate manner. Moore's actions came as a surprise to many and threatened to upset the delicate balance that existed in Durham, resulting in a backlash against the protestors from the city's African-American community. The vitriol shocked the sit-in participants, as they had only expected hostile reactions from Durham's white citizens. Mary Clyburn later recalled, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear nobody being happy about what we‚Äôve done‚Äù.Greene, Our Separate Ways, 67. Durham movement Despite the initial backlash to the sit-in, Moore ultimately helped to bring about much change to Durham. He soon found himself some powerful allies in the city's community, including McKissick and outspoken African-American newspaperman and Carolina Times editor Louis Austin, who just one week prior to the sit-in had run an editorial denouncing Durham's elite African-American institutions.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 89-90. With support from these new allies, Moore was able to drum up support for a Durham-wide movement. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs‚Äô Economic Committee, headed by McKissick, debated whether or not to boycott Royal Ice Cream Parlor. As Moore himself later revealed, there was doubt as to whether or not this would be a good idea, due to the fact that the parlor's owner, Louis Coletta, was a Greek American and a minority himself. Nevertheless, the mere presence of such a discussion symbolized the growing activist movement in Durham, which was fueled primarily by the city's young African-Americans. Challenging the conservatism of the African-American elite, the Durham youth embraced Moore's activist agenda. For instance, a group of young girls held regular pickets outside of the parlor under the direction of McKissick, despite being members of the Durham NAACP, which had refused to publicly support Moore.Greene, Our Separate Ways, 69. The Durham movement eventually began to pick up steam, leading to a rapid series of reforms in the coming years. In 1960, the city became just the seventh one in North Carolina to desegregate its lunch counter service.‚ÄúDurham Counters Integrated,‚Äù High Point Enterprise, August 2, 1960. After several years of legal action, the Royal Ice Cream Parlor finally desegregated along with the rest of the city's public facilities in 1963. The pace of the Durham movement surprised even Moore himself. In 1960, four African-American students held their own sit-in at the Woolworth's Department Store in neighboring Greensboro, North Carolina. At the time, Moore and McKissick had been organizing a nationwide sit-in that would begin in Durham. Originally, they felt that the Greensboro students had acted too soon.Richard A. Hughes, ‚ÄúBoston University School of Theology and the Civil Rights Movement,‚Äù Methodist History 47 (2009): 149, accessed April 13, 2014, doi: 10516/210. When McKissick heard about the sit-in, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúOh my God, these kids have jumped the gun!‚ÄùDavidson, The Best of Enemies, 99. Nevertheless, Moore and his allies soon realized that the time had come to take action, realizing that the student activists in Durham wanted to emulate their Greensboro counterparts. Exactly one week after the Greensboro sit-in, Moore and McKissick led one of their own. They led dozens of college students into the heart of Durham, where they sat down at the lunch counters of Woolworth's. When the manager closed the counter, the students moved on the counters at S.H. Kress and Walgreens, which were also shut down. However, the message had been sent, and by the end of the week, students in Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem, and Fayetteville had joined in the sit-in movement, frightening white store owners by dressing well and staying dignified.Greene, Our Separate Ways, 76. The Durham movement had finally begun to spread beyond the city limits. Work with King and regional civil rights activists The inspiration behind the Durham movement and the ones it inspired came from an unlikely source. Back in 1955, Moore heard the news that his former classmate at Boston University, Martin Luther King Jr., was leading the Montgomery bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. Surprised at the change in the once-timid King, Moore decided to write him a letter. In it, he detailed his own experiences with the desegregation of buses in North Carolina and Virginia, noting that by relying ‚Äúcompletely upon the force of love and Christian witness‚Äù, he was able to achieve his goals. Moore went on to suggest ‚Äúa regional group which uses the power of nonviolence‚Äù, hinting that such a group, were it well-disciplined, could ‚Äúbreak the backbone of segregated travel in North Carolina in less than a year‚Äù. King, however, continued to display reluctance to partake in Moore's radical agenda. In the end, Moore received only a polite thank-you note from King's secretary. However, he continued to let his faith play a role in his actions.Hughes, ‚ÄúBoston University School of Theology and the Civil Rights Movement,‚Äù 146. Moore led a group of young Durham activists called ‚ÄúACT‚Äù, which met at church every Sunday to talk about how to test the limits of the South's Jim Crow laws. When the student activism movement began to take flight in Durham, it was backed by the city's African-American churches, especially the female members of the congregations. Moore also became a board member of King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. With his new-found power, he was able to find new ways to get his message of a nonviolent regional group across the South. For instance, Moore supported the efforts of McKissick to spread the gospel of direct action to African-American students in North Carolina.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 94. In addition, the organizers of the SCLC sent out a call for clergyman to organize their congregations for a widespread protest in 1957.Morris, ‚ÄúBlack Southern Student Sit-in Movement: An Indigenous Perspective,‚Äù 20-21. The growing movement in the South soon became impossible for King to ignore. A week after the Durham sit-ins, he received an invitation from Moore to come to the city, which he accepted. The two visited the lunch counters that had been open just a few days earlier and spoke at White Rock Baptist Church. King gave the sit-in movement his blessing, saying that the student activists had made the sit-in action itself ‚Äúa creative protest that is destined to be one of the glowing epics of our time‚Äù.Hughes, ‚ÄúBoston University School of Theology and the Civil Rights Movement,‚Äù 149-150. With the support of King, the movement continued to grow. Moore enlisted the help of other regional leaders such as James M. Lawson, Jr., another Methodist minister. Lawson, like Moore, taught college students at his church in Nashville how to resist violence and employ the power of love to fight against segregation. Right after the Greensboro sit-ins, Moore urged Lawson to take action and organize a sit-in at his local Woolworth's, which he did. Activists around the South were soon making similar moves, thanks to networks set up by Moore and his allies, whose work also helped to popularize what became known as ‚Äúlocal movement centers‚Äù. These centers can be conceptualized as ‚Äúmicro- social structures‚Äù that facilitated the collective actions of African-American activists, especially students, across North Carolina and the rest of the South.Morris, ‚ÄúBlack Southern Student Sit-in Movement: An Indigenous Perspective,‚Äù 15. As a result, during the spring of 1960, sit-ins spread through these networks and centers to every Southern state except Mississippi.Hughes, ‚ÄúBoston University School of Theology and the Civil Rights Movement,‚Äù 151. Moore's tireless efforts had paid off, and the era of civil rights in America had begun in full force. Later life in Washington, D.C. At the height of the Durham movement he had fostered for so long, Moore suddenly left the city. Along with Lawson, he was forced out of King's SCLC after several of the organization's members began to regard him as too radical and a threat.Branch, Taylor. Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-1963 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988). Disillusioned, Moore resigned as pastor of Asbury Temple Methodist Church and moved to Central Africa.Davidson, The Best of Enemies, 297. Spending several years as a missionary in the Belgian Congo, he gradually underwent a change in his political views, adopting an even more radical, anti-colonial stance. When he returned to the United States, Moore settled down in Washington, D.C. He demonstrated the change in his political ideology by becoming the leader of the D.C. Black United Front, a black nationalist organization.Johnson, Cedric. Revolutionaries to Race Leaders: Black Power and the Making of African American Politics (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007), 115. Moore also ran for ‚Äì and won ‚Äì a position on the Council of the District of Columbia in 1974.‚ÄúAt-Large Member of the Council of the District of Columbia,‚Äù DC Board of Elections, accessed April 13, 2014, http://www.dcboee.org/candidate_info/historic_officials/at_large.asp. His uncompromising attitude won him many friends and enemies alike. During his term, Moore ran into trouble with the law. Exhibiting behavior that contradicted his peaceful teachings of the past, Moore was convicted in 1976 of assaulting a white tow truck driver and put under probation. In 1981, he violated one of its conditions and served six months in jail after refusing to take a court-ordered psychiatric exam.Yolanda Woodlee, \\"Oh So Briefly the Candidate to Beat,\\" The Washington Post, September 7, 2002, B01. Soon after his run-in with the law, Moore concluded that the key to African-American success in America was economics, not politics. He began a career as a ‚Äúcorporate gadfly‚Äù and constantly badgered stockholders with questions about the racial biases present in their hiring practices. Later, Moore decided to enter the business world himself. He now owns an energy company that regularly receives multimillion-dollar contracts from the Potomac Electric Power Company and Washington Gas Light Company. Moore served as the pastor of Elijah Methodist Church in Poolesville, Maryland. In 2002, he made a brief return to the political scene by running against Anthony A. Williams for mayor of Washington, D.C. He failed to drum up the widespread support necessary to mount a serious challenge in the race, however, and did not win.Woodlee, \\"Oh So Briefly the Candidate to Beat\\", B01. Reverend Douglas E. Moore died August 22 after brief hospitalization in Clinton, Maryland. He was 91. The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia.Bart Barnes, \\"Obituary: Douglas Moore, provocative presence in civil rights and D.C. politics, dies at 91\\", 'The Washington Post', September 4, 2019. Legacy Douglas Moore's legacy is one of an influential civil rights leader in North Carolina and Washington, D.C. Rarely budging from his agenda of activism, which was often perceived as radical, Moore received plenty of criticism from whites and African-Americans alike, especially after the short-term failure that came to be known as the Royal Ice Cream Sit-in. However, his persistence enabled him to help bring about the desegregation of the city of Durham, a cause to which he devoted many years of his life. Moore achieved many successes in his fight against segregation by allying with other prominent civil rights activists and inspiring a new generation of young, African-American student protestors. His efforts as a champion of the sit-in movement helped to popularize its use throughout North Carolina and the South. The sit-in movements had ideological roots in nonviolence and Christian ideology, ideas that Moore also circulated throughout the region. Although he rejected some of the causes he had once espoused so fervently later on in his life, by combining his faith with strong leadership, he was able to help bring about much progress in the area of civil rights during a turbulent time in the history of the United States.

The Commons is a part of the Indiana University Libraries system and modeled on the successful implementation of the commons concept in library management both at IU and major university libraries. The Business/SPEA Information Commons provides a welcoming environment for research and study not only for its core constituency of Business School and SPEA students and faculty, but also to all students of the university and the residents of the state. The Business/SPEA Information Commons provides access to a wide variety of electronic databases and print resources in a setting that promotes collaborative research. The Business/SPEA Information Commons is centrally located between the Schools of Business and SPEA. In addition to the circulating print collection, there is a reference room which includes print materials and electronic databases such as Bloomberg, Valueline, and Datastream. The Business/SPEA Information Commons includes a staff of three librarians, professional assistants, support staff, and part-time student employees.  History  The current combined library for the School of Business and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs dates back to 1935 when Herman B Wells, then Dean of the School of Business appointed a library committee to investigate the establishment of a departmental library. There were several reasons in favor of establishing a library. The first was the distance of the School of Business (then located in the Social Science Building) from the University Library (then located in Franklin Hall). Instead of using the time between classes to study, students would do everything but study rather than walk two blocks to the University Library. Secondly, the University Library reading rooms were always crowded. Third, faculty members needed a convenient location to store the supplementary texts which they had placed on reserve for their students. Faculty members thought these texts should be located in close proximity to where students attended class. Fourth, business and economics students needed specialized help which the generalists at the University Library could not provide. Finally, faculty members believed that student study habits would be improved if they had a reading room near their classrooms. Several steps were taken prior to the establishment of the Library. A supervised study hall was set up in 1936 to see whether students would use it. Proving successful, the Board of Trustees authorized a Business Administration Reading Room with an appropriation of $600 to furnish the room. The first books in the library were delivered by Harold Lusk, Chairman of the Library committee which established the Library delivered the Library's first books in his car! The reading room had 61 seats and was open from 7:45 a.m. to 9:50 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7:45 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and 2 p.m. to 9:50 p.m. on Sunday. Library rules directed that overdue books were to be returned to the Dean's office and that fines should be paid there. Located in the west corner of the second floor of the Social Science Building, the reading room was originally staffed by participants in the National Youth Administration, one of the New Deal agencies established by Franklin Roosevelt. A consensus soon developed that the Business School must hire a professionally trained librarian with experience in acquiring new materials, managing the reading room, and organizing the collection. When Geraldine Bariani was hired, her first move was to compile a card catalog for the Reading Room's materials. Perhaps the most important acquisition was a complete set of Listing Statements of the New York Stock Exchange from 1884-1930. Bariani believed that the Business Library was the only library except for the NYSE to own the complete set. In 1940, a survey by the American Library Association of IU's branch libraries found that the Business and Economics Library was used more than any other branch. So it was propitious that when the Business School moved into a new building (now named Woodburn Hall) in 1940, of course the Library moved along with it and received several benefits, including more space for a larger collection. A new assistant librarian was hired in accordance with the faculty's wish that the reading room should be staffed at all hours that the Library was open. While serving as Business School Librarian, Bariani wrote her master's thesis in which she outlined her objectives for the Business and Economics Library: * Provide adequate materials of instruction for faculty members, researchers, and undergraduates as each may need them for his individual instruction; * To supply the materials of instruction which cover the descriptive, analytical, and technical aspects of business, as these are presented for the enlightenment of the student and for the continued study of the faculty members; * To collect the raw data and source materials of instruction which enable the researcher to prove or disprove his theories; * To furnish instructional materials of a general and browsing nature which the student may turn to in his leisure time, acquaintance with which is expected of the educated citizen; * To make all these materials conveniently and easily available to users and to assist in their location if they are not; * To offer a comfortable and attractive location for the consultation of materials conducive to quiet reflection and to productive study. In 1942, IU's library system was reorganized and the Business and Economics Library's status changed from an independent library to a reserve library. The periodical collection was limited to current copies of business periodicals and the older bound copies of business journals were kept in the central library. The Rawles Reading Room, named in honor of the first Dean of the School of Business was dedicated in May 1942 and planned as a browsing room for cultural reading. There were works by Shakespeare, Aristotle, Homer and Plato and more recent books such as Bellamy's Looking Backward and Pearl Buck's The Good Earth. It was Rawles' intention to \\"provide for the Students in his School cultural books which would broaden and enrich their background.\\" In 1966, the School of Business and its Library moved from Woodburn Hall to 10th Street across from the Main Library which was then under construction. In 1973, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA) was established in the Poplars Research Center. In 1982, a new complex of buildings was dedicated connecting the Schools of Business and of Public and Environmental Affairs. The School of Business' building was renovated and a new building was put up for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, which was then housed in the Poplars Research and Conference Center. The two schools were linked by a spacious outdoor plaza and a new Business/SPEA Library with holdings of 120,000 volumes, including 2400 periodical volumes. The library cost $16 million to build. The new library's design won a 1983 National Exhibit Award from the American Association of School Administrators, a 1983 Design Award from the National School Boards Association, and a 1984 Merit Award from the Minnesota Society of Landscape Architects. The design successfully expanded the Business School Library's space and created an entirely new facility for SPEA.  References  LOWELL, MILDRED HAWKSWORTH INDIANA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES, 1829-1942.

Written in the form of a novel, by Italian authors Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini, the book explores the Dickens mystery from the perspective of many famous literary detectives, such as C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot, all of whom come to their own conclusions regarding how the tale might possibly have ended. The novel presents the criticism in a postmodern style by alternating between chapters of the Fruttero and Lucentini work and the original unfinished story by Dickens. This is established under the setting of a convention that has been organized by affluent Japanese patrons to finish unfinished works of art. The chapters of The Mystery of Edwin Drood are presented in the frame of this story as being read to those in attendance of this seminar. In the alternating chapters written by Fruttero and Lucentini, the aforementioned literary detectives discuss their theories and ask questions regarding the possible clues to the story's conclusion. The conclusion that the book ultimately comes to does not offer any serious answer to the story's possible ending; however, the preceding chapters offer criticism that examines the text in a way that is both accessible and academic.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon was released on June 7, 1941, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. The film is set in a closed book store at night, when the many characters and elements featured within the books come to life,. similar to Frank Tashlin's own shorts Speaking of the Weather, Have You Got Any Castles? and You're an Education. The idea would later be reworked five years later into Book Revue, although only Daffy features in that. Plot The film begins with Ludwig van Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" playing as the scene descends on a book store. The camera pans across an array of various books (including a gag in which Uncle Tom's Cabin now has a Federal Housing Administration sign in front). Porky Pig, featured on the cover of The Westerner, comes to life and sings \\"Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride.\\" Across the way, Daffy Duck, featured on the cover of The Ugly Duckling, comes to life and sings \\"Git Along, Little Dogies.\\" Daffy finds his way to Black Beauty and comes out riding not a horse, but a big black woman, whom he rides to The Lake. A wolf emerges from the screenplay of The Wolf of Wall Street, sneaks behind The Green Bay Tree and lures Daffy to him using a female duck decoy from the book Toys. Daffy follows and grabs what he thinks is the decoy but is actually the wolf's nose. Once he realizes he is in danger, Daffy tells the wolf that he is not worth eating (he claims to have so many diseases that even the draft rejected him) and runs away. Daffy uses the books to defeat the wolf. He opens a copy of The Hurricane to blow the wolf away, and lightning from the book Lightning strikes the wolf. The wolf surrenders, fittingly under Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. Daffy returns to the decoy. Porky enters the scene addresses in derision of Daffy, saying that Daffy and the decoy could never \\"mean anything to each other.\\" Daffy sticks up his nose and swims away with the decoy, followed by four tiny decoys that look like Daffy.

Club career Walton began his footballing career with his local North East club Ashlington. After a year at the club, he was offered his first professional contract by Sheffield United at the age of eighteen. He failed to break into the first team at Bramall Lane and after two years in the team youth and reserve sides he was transferred to Shropshire club Shrewsbury Town on his first of two spells at the club. The Englishman enjoyed three years at Gay Meadow making over 100 appearances, scoring twelve goals in all competitions and achieving a Third Division title win with the club during his first year. In 1997, Walton was signed by Crewe Alexandra for ¬£500,000, making him the most expensive player in the Railwaymen's history only for it to be broken a year later when Rodney Jack was signed for ¬£650,000 from Torquay United. The defender spent six seasons at the club, the longest time he had spent at a club in his career, where he made over 150 league appearances for the south Cheshire club despite a number of injuries. In his last season at the club, Walton helped Crewe to the runners-up spot and promotion in Division Two after making 41 league appearances. Manager Dario Gradi made his feelings clear that he wished to keep Walton at the club and offered him a new contract. The defender rejected and instead signed a two-year deal with Derby County. However, an injury during pre‚Äìseason left the Englishman out until October where he made his d√©but in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Norwich City. Walton failed to establish himself in George Burley's first team and was soon loaned out to Stockport County where he made seven league appearances. After a year at Pride Park, the defender had his contract cancelled by mutual consent. He was soon picked up by his old club Shrewsbury. He added a further 38 league appearances and helped his side survive relegation from the football league. At the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season, he was given the role of club captain. Unfortunately, Walton's campaign of marred by injuries and in December 2005 he was forced to retire after sustaining a knee problem.

The story is set in Allahabad during the British rule in India. The story has four main characters: Chandar, Sudha, Vinti and Pammi. Over time, the novel gained historical importance and a cult following of readers. The story is about a young student, Chander, who falls in love with Sudha, the daughter of his college professor. It was published by Bhartiya Jnanpith Trust and its 55th edition was published in 2009.Gunahon Ka Devta p. 4. This is Dharamvir Bharati's most famous work, and it earned him a huge fan-following especially in the contemporary youth, as well as several awards and accolades, thus making him one of the most recognised names in Hindi Literature following Munshi Premchand. Overview It is primarily the story of \\"non expressive love and romance between two characters (Chandar and Sudha)\\" showing various trappings of love in urban middle-class, pre- independence India and the emotional conflicts of enthusiastic, ambitious and idealistic youth. In the novels foreword, the author says, \\"While writing this novel I experienced the feeling one has during depressing moments when he prays fervently, with full faith.... It appears as if the very same prayer has been ingrained in my heart and I am still repeating it...\\" The novel tells the passionate love story of Chander and Sudha and is set in Allahabad just after Partition. Chandrakumar Kapoor \\"Chander\\", an orphan, is a young researcher and has a mentor in Dr. Shukla, a widower and a professor. Chander is close to Sudha, Dr. Shukla's daughter. The two share a relationship that is deep and strong, and their attraction for each other increases with the passage of time. That Sudha is in love with Chander is clear to Sudha's best friend, Gesu, and Sudha's cousin Binti. Chander is from a lower caste than Sudha and so he doesn't dare ask for Sudha's hand in marriage from her father. While Sudha seems to be fairly 'modern', she cannot stand up to the social pressure of having to agree to marry the man of her father's choice; Chander also forces her to abide by the wishes of her father. The writer uses this love story to hold a mirror to society's socioeconomic divide. Bharati highlights an important point here; while children are taught to follow the values of the society they are born in, and are judged on their ability to make choices according to those standards, it is sometimes psychologically corrosive for people to keep following those ideals. In those moments, resistance against such ideas becomes not only the pragmatic choice for an individual but it is also the only way for societies to move forward. Chandar has a choice: should he snatch Sudha from the clutches of social taboos or should he let her go and sacrifice his love at the altar of ‚Äògood‚Äô behaviour? Chandar makes the socially acceptable choice and the consequences of this result in him becoming fully aware of his feelings for Sudha. The agony of an unattainable love burns him up slowly. His calm and rational outlook towards life is replaced by a longing to untie the jumble of his emotions. At this point he turns to Pammi, a Christian girl, to explore the physical aspect of love which was hitherto unknown to him. When even the physical expression of love cannot alleviate his agony he turns to Binti in search of an emotional connection that really isn't there. With the passage of time, it becomes abundantly clear that his heart longs only for Sudha and no one can replace her in his life. The writer also suggests that in such a restrictive society, young adults are bound to develop romantic feelings for anyone from the opposite sex whom they get a chance to interact with on a regular basis because they have limited options. While they have been exposed to the modern concept of a loving relationship between two adults, society still considers marriage a sort of bond of compromise rather than a fulfilling relationship. Adaptations In 2015, Garima Productions produced a television adaptation of the novel. The show was titled Ek Tha Chander Ek Thi Sudha aired on Life OK and became available on web portal Hotstar. The show starred actor Rahil Azim and Umang Jain in lead roles. Publication * Gunaho Ka Devta, by Dharmveer Bharti published by Bhartiya Jnanpith. .

Nickerson was born in South Dennis, Barnstable County, Massachusetts. He moved to Vermont in 1800 and shortly after that married Huldah Chapman. During the War of 1812 he served as a lieutenant in the United States military. After the war, Nickerson moved to Springville, Pennsylvania. In 1824, Nickerson moved to what was then part of Perrysburgh, New York (in what is now the village of South Dayton). He later worked on the construction of the Erie Canal. Nickerson was baptized a member of the Latter Day Saint church in April 1833 by Zerubbabel Snow. That fall, he served a mission in western New York and Upper Canada with Joseph Smith, Jr. and Sidney Rigdon. On 12 October 1833, Smith received a revelation at Nickerson's home in Perrysburgh, New York.Doctrine and Covenants section 100 (LDS Church edition). The revelation is section 97 in the Community of Christ edition. A manuscript copy in the handwriting of Sidney Rigdon is housed at Brigham Young University. In 1834, Nickerson was a member of Zion's Camp. In 1835, he served as branch president in Perrysburgh, New York. In the winter of 1835‚Äì1836 Nickerson served as a missionary on Cape Cod. In 1839 he and his family moved west: they spent the winter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he baptized about 40 people and established the first branch of the church in that city. In 1840 he settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1841, he served a mission to Peoria, Illinois. In 1842 he served a mission in Boston. One of his converts, Abijah Tewkesbury, offered his shipping office located at 82 Commercial St to be used as the meeting place of the first branch of Mormons in Boston, which had about 30 members. Nickerson died in 1847 along the banks of the Chariton River in Iowa as the Latter-day Saints were moving west.

NPRI seeks to promote private, rather than government solutions to issues facing Nevada and the western region of the United States. History In 1990, Judy Cresanta supported Soviet pro-democracy leaders, educating them in the principles of the free market economy and free elections. The next year, she founded the Nevada Policy Research Institute, which addresses public problems through solutions that foster freedom and introducenew ways of problem solving in fields such as government spending, taxation, the restriction of union powers, federal ownership of state owned land, energy policy, and education policy. Since 2013, the NPRI's \\"Solutions\\" publication for lawmakers has been published every two years. The NPRI supports lawmakers in an advisory capacity and through assessment of legislation. Their staff is often asked to give evidence before legislative committees. The national press relies on their advice and evaluations on breaking news and reports on their research, campaigns and litigation attempts. The Institute works towards increased transparency in government publishing records of government employee compensation and retirement data on TransparentNevada.com and has successfully campaigned for public-sector workers and school district employees to make use of their opt-out rights of their union membership. This led to the inauguration of the National Employee Freedom Week, establishing priority of workers' rights over the preferences of unions. The Institute forged an alliance with more than 100 national and state-based organizations, including the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, the Buckeye Institute, and The Heritage Foundation. Public policy research NPRI researches education, tax and fiscal policy, and labor issues related to Nevada public policy. = Education = NPRI opposes efforts to halt the opening of new charter schools and favors expanding charter school options, tuition tax credits, school voucher programs, and merit pay for teachers.\\"Quality and Quantity\\" by Dr. Matthew Ladner, Nevada Policy Research Institute NPRI has been critical of the Nevada System of Higher Education, specifically the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the University of Nevada, Reno for low graduation rates, despite spending above average per full-time student on education and education related higher education expenditures. = Tax and fiscal policy = NPRI supports a balanced budget with controlled growth in government spending, such as a TABOR's or TASC amendment. NPRI claims Nevada's 2008-2009 budget deficit was the result of excessive growth in government spending. NPRI has also argued that Nevada's history as a low-tax state has been slowly eroded by a growing number of fees on Nevada's residents. NPRI opposes tax hikes on individual taxpayers and corporations within Nevada, including a tax hike on the gaming industry. = Labor issues = NPRI supports protecting secret ballot boxes and paycheck protection and opposes defined benefit plans for union and government workers.\\"New approach needed on public pensions\\" by Doug French, Nevada Policy Research Institute = LVCVA = On November 30, 2008 the Las Vegas Review Journal published an article regarding some investigative journalism conducted by the Nevada Policy Research Institute on the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. According to NPRI's investigation it appears the LVCVA has an inappropriate relationship with a private marketing firm, R&R;, that has overbilled the LVCVA but the LVCVA has never attempted to recoup these losses. Through public records request NPRI found that the LVCVA not only knew about these irregularities but literally gave R&R; the rubber stamp to approve expenditures above $5,000 without any oversight from the LVCVA.

The early years  The Wednesday' at Olive Grove. The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in Church, Lancashire on 11 December 1875. On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879 the club played in the FA Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5‚Äì1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6‚Äì0 defeat by Nottingham Forest. During the 1881‚Äì82 season, the club continued to rent the facilities at Alexandra Meadows, but began to look towards a move elsewhere. As the leading club in the area, it was felt that Rovers needed its own ground. A ground was leased at Leamington Street and ¬£500 was spent on a new grandstand capable of seating 600‚Äì700 spectators. Boards were placed around the pitch to help prevent a repeat of the crowd troubles with Darwen, and a large ornate entrance arch was erected bearing the name of the club and ground.

In 1882 they lost in the FA Cup final against the Old Etonians. Rovers won the FA Cup in 1884 with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Queens Park (Glasgow). The same teams met in the final the next season, with Blackburn Rovers winning 2‚Äì0. Rovers won the FA Cup again in 1886, defeating West Bromwich Albion after a replay.  The Football League and Ewood Park  On 2 March 1888, William McGregor, a Birmingham shopkeeper and a committee member of Aston Villa Football Club, sent a letter to five clubs -- Blackburn Rovers among them -- suggesting that twelve of the leading clubs should organise a series of home and away matches between themselves. With the introduction of professional players, it seemed natural that better organisation should be brought to the complex and chaotic system of friendly and competitive matches prevalent at the time. On 22 March 1888 John Birtwistle represented Blackburn Rovers at a meeting of a number of clubs at the Anderton Hotel in London. This meeting, and subsequent ones, led to the creation of the Football League, with Blackburn Rovers as part of it. Rovers finished the inaugural season of the league in fourth place, and unbeaten at home. Blackburn Rovers again reached the FA Cup final on 29 March 1890 at the Kennington Oval. The club claimed the trophy, for the fourth time, by beating Sheffield Wednesday 6‚Äì1. FA Cup winning side of the 1890‚Äì91 season The 1890-1891 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for fifth time against Notts County F.C. with a 3‚Äì1 victory.  Early 20th century  They were league champions in 1912 and 1914, and FA Cup winners in 1928.  Mid 20th century  When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947‚Äì48) and remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy ‚Äî although they did reach the 1960 FA Cup final when managed by Scot Dally Duncan. Rovers lost this game 3‚Äì0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field. Full back Dave Whelan was lost during the game to a broken leg, the game being played in the days before substitutes were allowed. Despite losing, cup final man of the match was future Scotland manager Ally MacLeod (left winger MacLeod scored 47 goals in 193 appearances for Rovers). During the 1960s Blackburn Rovers had several players who made it into national teams. They were again relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.  1970s and 1980s  They won the Third Division title in 1975. They were promoted as runners up in the Third Division in 1980. In 1988‚Äì89 they reached the Second Division playoff final in its last-ever season of the home-away two-legged format ‚Äî but lost to Crystal Palace. In 1989‚Äì90 they lost in the Second Division play-off semi-finals, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker.  1990s In 1991‚Äì92, they reached the play-off final at Wembley where they beat Leicester City 1‚Äì0 thanks to a Mike Newell penalty. Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of ¬£3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward Alan Shearer. They remained in the title challenge for most of the season before finishing fourth in the final table. In 1993‚Äì94, they were Premiership runners-up to Manchester United. Rovers broke the English transfer fee record again a few weeks later when paying Norwich City ¬£5million for 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton. Blackburn won the Premier League in 1995 with rivals Manchester United finishing runners up. Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the championship season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford (1945‚Äì2003). Alan Shearer was sold to hometown club Newcastle United for a then world record fee of ¬£15million in the summer of 1996. Rovers failed to win in their opening 10 games of the 1996‚Äì97 Premiership and Harford resigned. They were relegated in 1998‚Äì99.  The new millennium  They were promoted back to the Premier League in 2000‚Äì01. In 2001‚Äì02 they won their first-ever League Cup by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2‚Äì1 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In 2004‚Äì05 they reached the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. After qualifying for Europe, Rovers signed South African striker Benni McCarthy from Porto as a replacement for the departed Craig Bellamy. Rovers finished top of their European group and were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen, losing 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. The club was busy during the January transfer window, signing David Dunn, Stephen Warnock, Christopher Samba and Bruno Berner. Leaving the squad were Dominic Matteo, Andy Taylor (loan), Joe Garner (loan), Lucas Neill and Jay McEveley. In cup competitions, Rovers were knocked out of the Carling Cup in the Third Round. They defeated Everton, Luton, Arsenal (after replay) and Manchester City in the FA Cup. Thereafter, they faced Chelsea for a place in the final, losing 2‚Äì1 when Michael Ballack scored Chelsea's winner in extra time. Rovers finished the season 10th in the league, with McCarthy netting 18 league goals. The club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup and drew Lithuanian side FK VetraBlackburn Rovers - Vetra: 4 - 0 Match report from ScoresPro.com of Vilnius. To prepare for the 2007‚Äì08 season Rovers bought Roque Santa Cruz, Maceo Rigters and Gunnar Nielsen. In the January 2008 transfer window, Robbie Savage left for Derby in a ¬£1.5m (rising to ¬£2m) transfer to seek first team football. Rovers were never at any stage during the season outside the top ten and made their best start to a campaign for 10 years and Santa Cruz brilliantly shone scoring 23 goals in all competitions.http://www.premierleague.com/page/blackburn-rovers On 22 June 2008, it was announced by the club that Paul Ince had been brought in to manage Rovers after MArk Hughes left, signing a three-year deal. Ince was presented to the media on Tuesday 24 June. Ince's first job though as the Blackburn Manager is to persuade some of the players who wanted to follow Hughes or pursue other teams, to stay . Ince's reign as Blackburn Rovers manager got off to the perfect start, with a 3‚Äì2 away win against Everton FC in the first game to the 2008‚Äì09 season. Blackburn drew 1‚Äì1 at home to Hull City before two heavy defeats to West Ham and Arsenal. They bounced back well and recorded back-to-back wins against Fulham and Newcastle United, but faded drastically: three draws and seven defeats, including five defeats in a row to saw Blackburn slip to 19th in the table after 16 games. This led to Ince coming under increasing pressure: he enjoyed some success in the Carling Cup, with wins over Everton and Sunderland. Eventually Ince paid the price for poor results, and a 3‚Äì0 defeat away to Wigan saw him sacked a few days later. He was replaced by the former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce secured Premier League survival, and despite a difficult start to the 2009‚Äì10 season Rovers recovered well in the second half of the campaign to secure a comfortable 10th-place finish with 50 points ‚Äî placing them 20 points clear of the relegation zone. =2010 onwards= In November 2010, the Indian company V H Group bought Blackburn Rovers under the name of Venky's London Limited for ¬£23 million. The new owners immediately sacked manager Sam Allardyce and replaced him with first-team coach Steve Kean, initially on a temporary basis, but by January 2011 he had been awarded a full-time contract until June 2013. Kean's appointment was shrouded in a great deal of controversy since his agent Jerome Anderson had earlier played a major role in advising Venky's during the takeover of the club in the preceding months.Conn, David. \\"How an agent came to hold so much power at Blackburn Rovers\\", The Guardian, 21 December 2010. Retrieved 19 August 2016.Hytner, David. \\"Steve Kean finds value of friends in high places at Blackburn Rovers\\", The Guardian, 16 December 2010. Retrieved 19 August 2016. In December 2011, Blackburn Rovers posted an annual pre-tax loss of ¬£18.6m for the year ending 30 June 2011. Despite this, the owners of Blackburn Rovers provided assurances over the continued funding of the club, even if they were relegated. On 7 May 2012, the club was relegated to the Championship after being defeated at home by Wigan Athletic in the penultimate game of the season, ending eleven years in the Premier League. At the start of the 2012‚Äì2013 season, Steve Kean, the manager in charge for the previous relegation season, was given a chance by owners to win promotion and kept his job as the manager. Ultimately though, pressure from the supporters who had been calling for the managers removal for months resulted in his resignation as manager on 29 September 2012.

Some of Lauffensteiner's compositions for lute have survived. Lauffensteiner was born in Steyr. Only his baptism date is known - 28 April 1676. He died in Munich on 26 March 1754. His father, who bore the same name, was the towerkeeper in Steyr. About 1709 he had obtained a position of a lutenist in Graz, and from 1712 he was in the service of the Bavarian court. In 1715 he entered the private service of the Duke Ferdinand. In 1739, on the duke's death, he was granted a pension. He was later appointed a chamber counsellor (Hofkammerrat) by the Duke Clemens August, Archbishop of Cologne, for his services to the electoral House of Bavaria. Lauffensteiner's extant works for both solo lute and chamber ensembles typically take the forms of suite or partita. His music is generally highly idiomatic for the lute, in the German style (i.e. uniting traditional French forms, textures and ornaments with Italianate cantabile melody over a basso continuo line). In total over 100 movements survive. Lauffensteiner is seen as a stylistic precursor to Silvius Leopold Weiss, to whom his music is frequently misattributed in manuscript sources ‚Äì illustrative of its high quality in the estimation of his contemporaries.

With effort they managed to succeed in a different society from their culture. The immigration of the Lebanese to Paraguay can be divided into two eras: ancient and modern. Among the reasons which prompted the uprooting are included both the political reason, and also the economic one. The political reason responds to the need to escape the troubled relations that have emerged during the Ottoman Empire in the region. The economic reason lies in the many disappointments and poverty, the consequences of World War I. The strategic position of Lebanon in the Mediterranean Sea has meant ongoing invasions. It was part of Syria and the Ottoman Empire until 1918. In a second term after the Second World War, where thousands of people, mostly men, took the decision to leave the mother homeland because of the havoc that the war had caused. In this journey towards finding a better future, they had to undertake long voyages in boats, often without knowing where they embark and disembark where it was even worse. In these trips they had to deal with many troubles, diseases and nostalgia. They were forced to withstand natural disasters of all kinds in the middle of the sea. =Arrival to Paraguay (1960‚Äì1970)= Group of Lebanese immigrants Their first destination was the harbour of Buenos Aires Argentina where they arrived without even speaking Spanish and without knowing its customs. But they did not take much to adapt and strive to rebuild a decent life, forming households and having children without forgetting their roots. They were organized in groups and communities, in order to find the best place to settle. Following trips by rivers or on trains until they came to Paraguay and then distributed in various places of the country where trade could be a prominent occupation. They settle in Asuncion, the country's capital, and also in Concepcion, Puerto Rosario, Villarrica, Itacurubi del Rosario, Encarnacion, San Estanislao, Pedro Juan Caballero, Caraguatay and other cities. Mixing with Paraguayan society and after much effort and work they could open shops, factories or cultivate the land. They dedicated not only learn the Castilian but also the Guaran√≠, they fought in the Chaco War, participated with their civilization and helped build the country. They joined their lives in marriage to men and women of Paraguay and respected the cultural identity of the country that hosted them. They taught their children the values of love for the two cultures, which created clubs and associations that still preserve their traditions. The last major contingent of immigrants arrived in Paraguay in the late 60s and early 70s. =1970‚Äìonwards= The majority of Lebanese-Paraguayans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Melkite Catholic. A scant number are Muslims. In addition to being of Lebanese descent, there are Paraguayans of Syrian and Palestinian origin as well.John Tofik Karam, \\"On the Trail and Trial of a Palestinian Diaspora: Mapping South America in the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967-1972\\" http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid;=9070730 From the 1970s, Sunni Muslim Arabs moved to the Ciudad del Este.

They are best known today for their single \\"Only One Woman\\", a cover of a Marbles song, and \\"Brave New Love\\", which was featured in the end credits of the 1988 remake of The Blob. History=Early success (1986‚Äì88)= Borg and Jidhed's original lineup included Ken Sandin on bass guitar, Jimmy Wandroph on keyboards, and Toby Tarrach on drums. This group released the single \\"Only One Woman\\" in 1988, a cover of a song written by the Bee Gees and first recorded by The Marbles in 1968. The Alien cover reached #1 in Sweden and remained there for six weeks. Later in 1988, Alien released their first, eponymous album, including \\"Only One Woman\\" as well as \\"Brave New Love\\" and \\"Tears Don't Put Out the Fire\\", which was released as a single later that year. In 1989, the band released a re-worked version of it for the US/international market, again titled Alien. This album included eight out of the twelve tracks released in the 1988 album, five of which were remixed. Two new tracks were added, \\"Now Love\\" being one and a cover of \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" the other, both sung by new vocalist Peter \\"Pete\\" Sandberg. =Shiftin' Gear (1988‚Äì93)= In the fall of 1988, Jidhed left the band to spend more time with family and pursue a solo career and was replaced by Peter Sandberg, formerly frontman for the bands Madison and Von Rosen. In 1990 the band also made other changes, such as replacing Wandroph and Tarrach with Bert Andersson on keyboards and Imre Duan on drums. This was the lineup for the band's release of its third album, Shiftin' Gear. However, the album was not the success it was predicted to be and another major lineup change occurred. Andersson was replaced by Richard Andre on keyboards and Stefan Ridderstrale replaced Duan on drums. Former Madison bassist Conny Payne also joined Alien in 1993. Finally, lead singer Peter Sandberg departed the band and later pursued a solo career. To replace him, Alien recruited Daniel Zangger Borch. =Band stability (1993‚Äì2005)= Alien returned to the studios to record their fourth album, again titled Alien. Ridderstrale, although performing on tour, did not participate in the recording sessions and Michael Wilkman stood in as drummer. Production was weak and the band lost much of its following. This can also be attributed to the numerous band member changes between 1990 and 1993. Ridderstrale officially left the band in 1995 and Staffan Scharrin became the drummer, thus completing the band's present lineup. This new formation released the band's fifth album, Crash in 1995. This album featured heavier metal songs than previously recorded by Alien. Since then, Alien released three more albums, Best and Rare (1997, compilation), Live in Stockholm 1990 (2001) and Dark Eyes (2005). Dark Eyes was the first album to feature all new recordings and marked the return of Jim Jidhed to the band now composed of him, Mats Sandborgh on keyboards, Berndt Ek on bass, Jan Lundberg on drums alongside Tony Borg. =Reunion (2010‚Äìpresent)= Alien has finally reunited with the complete and original line up. They toured in 2010 for the first time since 1989 at Monsters of Rock in Eskilstuna, Sweden, and released their first new single in October 2010 - Ready to Fly. The band released their long-awaited new studio album Eternity on April 25, 2014 through the German-based label AOR HEaven. The band will tour again on August 16, 2014 in Falun, Sweden and again on October 25 at the HEAT festival in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Summary According to local tradition, the first Jews settled on Jerba in the wake of the first Temple's destruction in Jerusalem in 566 BCE. A community with true foundations in the Jewish life of the ancients, island tradition holds that its synagogue -‚Äì known as El Ghriba (‚Äúthe miraculous‚Äù) ‚Äî is built with a stone from the ruins of the First Temple, and houses the oldest known Sefer Torah in its sanctuary. Waves of Jewish immigrants from around the Mediterranean flocked to it as a haven from persecution in the millennia that followed the original settlement. Upon arrival, they were greeted with a Jewish community that existed in surprising harmony with its local Muslim Berber neighbors. Along their valued status as fully Tunisian, Jerba's Jews maintain a strong pride in their Judaism, and they revel in showing it. The film captures a yearly festival held just outside El Ghriba, commemorating two famous rabbis. The occasion is one of music and dancing, and helps continue the tradition of drawing Jews from around the world to Jerba ‚Äì- if only for a visit. Such visitors have the reputation of leaving the island with a future husband or wife in tow. And yet, the Jewish community is so utterly suffused with its Tunisian culture, that it is outwardly almost indistinguishable. Repeated shots of the wide variety of Jerba's residents reveal just how much both Jew and non-Jew in this millennia-old community share similarities in both physical appearance and their shared Arabic and French language. But they retain individualizing brands of orthodoxy when it comes to their respective religions. Even though both communities share a love for couscous, vegetable dumplings and potato soup, because many of Jerba's Jews keep strictly kosher, they rarely share meals with Muslim neighbors.

The main concern in working with hydrogen is flammability. Hydrogen possesses the NFPA 704's highest rating of 4 on the flammability scale because it is flammable when mixed even in small amounts with ordinary air; ignition can occur at a volumetric ratio of hydrogen to air as low as 4% due to the oxygen in the air and the simplicity and chemical properties of the reaction. However, hydrogen has no rating for innate hazard for reactivity or toxicity. The storage and use of hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking as a gaseous fuel, low-energy ignition, wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, buoyancy, and its ability to embrittle metals that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. Liquid hydrogen poses additional challenges due to its increased density and the extremely low temperatures needed to keep it in liquid form. Summary * For over 40 years, industry has used hydrogen in vast quantities as an industrial chemical and fuel for space exploration. During that time, industry has developed an infrastructure to produce, store, transport and utilize hydrogen safely. *Hydrogen gas is an extremely high- powered fuel. It burns with incredible speed and can produce incredible force and is used mostly for applications that require vast amounts of instantaneous power - such as rocketry and spaceflight. For instance, it was used to power the Space Shuttle. *Liquid hydrogen is sometimes used as an extremely condensed hydrogen fuel. *Gaseous hydrogen can be used as a coolant for electric generators in power stations. This is because of its high thermal conductivity and low \\"windage\\", so reducing frictional and turbulence losses. *Hydrogen is also used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of ammonia and methanol. Hydrogen codes and standards Hydrogen codes and standards are codes and standards (RCS) for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications. Additional to the codes and standards for hydrogen technology products, there are codes and standards for hydrogen safety, for the safe handling of hydrogenHySafe Initial Guidance for Using Hydrogen in Confined Spaces. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-07-13. and the storage of hydrogen. *Standard for the installation of stationary fuel cell power systems (National Fire Protection Association) = Guidelines = The current ANSI/AIAA standard for hydrogen safety guidelines is AIAA G-095-2004, Guide to Safety of Hydrogen and Hydrogen Systems. As NASA has been one of the world's largest users of hydrogen, this evolved from NASA's earlier guidelines, NSS 1740.16 (8719.16). These documents cover both the risks posed by hydrogen in its different forms and how to ameliorate them. = Ignition = * \\"Hydrogen-air mixtures can ignite with very low energy input, 1/10 that required igniting a gasoline-air mixture. For reference, an invisible spark or a static spark from a person can cause ignition.\\" * \\"Although the autoignition temperature of hydrogen is higher than those for most hydrocarbons, hydrogen's lower ignition energy makes the ignition of hydrogen‚Äìair mixtures more likely. The minimum energy for spark ignition at atmospheric pressure is about 0.02 millijoules.\\" =Mixtures= * \\"The flammability limits based on the volume percent of hydrogen in air at 14.7 psia (1 atm, 101 kPa) are 4.0 and 75.0. The flammability limits based on the volume percent of hydrogen in oxygen at 14.7 psia (1 atm, 101 kPa) are 4.0 and 94.0.\\" * \\"The limits of detonability of hydrogen in air are 18.3 to 59 percent by volume\\" * \\"Flames in and around a collection of pipes or structures can create turbulence that causes a deflagration to evolve into a detonation, even in the absence of gross confinement.\\" (For comparison: Deflagration limit of gasoline in air: 1.4‚Äì7.6%; of acetylene in air,MSHA ‚Äì Safety Hazard Information ‚Äì Special Hazards of Acetylene .

By comparison, natural gas is also odorless, colorless and tasteless, but industry adds a sulfur-containing odorant called a mercaptan to make it detectable by people. Currently, all known odorants contaminate fuel cells (a popular application for hydrogen). However, given hydrogen's tendency to rise quickly, a hydrogen leak indoors would briefly collect on the ceiling and eventually move towards the corners and away from places where people might be exposed to it. For that and other reasons, industry often uses hydrogen sensors to help detect hydrogen leaks and has maintained a high safety record using them for decades. Researchers are investigating other methods that might be used for hydrogen detection: tracers, new odorant technology, advanced sensors and others.http://www.arhab.org/pdfs/h2_safety_fsheet.pdf * Hydrogen leaks can support combustion at very low flow rates, as low as 4 micrograms/s.M.S. Butler, C.W. Moran, Peter B. Sunderland, R.L. Axelbaum, Limits for Hydrogen Leaks that Can Support Stable Flames, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy 34 (2009) 5174‚Äì5182. =Liquid hydrogen= * \\"Condensed and solidified atmospheric air, or trace air accumulated in manufacturing, contaminates liquid hydrogen, thereby forming an unstable mixture. This mixture may detonate with effects similar to those produced by trinitrotoluene (TNT) and other highly explosive materials\\" Liquid Hydrogen requires complex storage technology such as the special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all cryogenic substances. This is similar to, but more severe than liquid oxygen. Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away. (Typically it will evaporate at a rate of 1% per day.Peter Kushnir. Hydrogen As an Alternative Fuel . PB 700-00-3. Vol. 32, Issue 3, May‚ÄìJune 2000. almc.army.mil.)  Prevention  Hydrogen collects under roofs and overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building that contains a potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away from the rest of the structure in an explosion. It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations. Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence. Hydrogen sensors allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down. As in natural gas, an odorant can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR flame detectors. More recently Multi IR detectors have been developed, which have even faster detection on hydrogen- flames.12 Chemo-chromic indicators can be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes.  Incidents  Hydrogen is extremely flammable. However this is mitigated by the fact that hydrogen rapidly rises and often disperses before ignition, unless the escape is in an enclosed, unventilated area. Demonstrations have shown that a fuel fire in a hydrogen-powered vehicle can burn out completely with little damage to the vehicle, in contrast to the expected result in a gasoline-fueled vehicle. Ahlhorn disaster. On the 5th of January 1918, a fire detonated a hydrogen zeppelin inside a hangar in Germany. The resulting blast was felt 40 km away, and destroyed several neighbouring hangars and zeppelins within. Hindenburg disaster. May 6, 1937. As the zeppelin Hindenburg was approaching landing at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, a fire detonated one of the aft hydrogen cells rupturing neighbouring cells and causing the airship to fall to the ground aft-first. The inferno then travelled towards the stern, bursting and igniting the remaining cells. Despite 4 news stations recording the disaster on film and surviving eyewitness testimonies from crew and people on the ground, the cause of the initial fire was never conclusively determined. In January 2007 an explosion of compressed hydrogen during delivery at the Muskingum River Coal Plant (owned and operated by AEP) caused significant damage and killed one person. For more information on incidents involving hydrogen, visit the US DOE's Hydrogen Incident Reporting and Lessons Learned page. During the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, three reactor buildings were damaged by hydrogen explosions. Exposed Zircaloy cladded fuel rods became very hot and reacted with steam, releasing hydrogen.Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened? . Hyer.eu. Retrieved on 2012-07-13. The containments were filled with inert nitrogen, which prevented hydrogen from burning in the containment. However, the hydrogen leaked from the containment to the reactor building where it mixed with air and exploded. To prevent further explosions, vent holes were opened in the top of the remaining reactor buildings. In February 2018, on the way to an FCV hydrogen station, a truck carrying about 24 compressed hydrogen tanks caught fire. This caused the evacuation initially of a one-mile radius area of Diamond Bar, a suburb of Los Angeles, CA. The fire broke out on the truck at about 1:20 p.m. at the intersection of South Brea Canyon Road and Golden Springs Drive, according to a Los Angeles County Fire Department dispatcher. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation. In August 2018 a delivery truck carrying liquid hydrogen caught fire at Veridam http://www.veridiam.com/ in El Cajon CA. In May 2019 leaking hydrogen led to an explosion at AB Specialty Silicones in Waukegan, Illinois, that killed four workers and seriously injured a fifth. Also in May 2019 a hydrogen tank exploded killing 2 and injuring 6 in Gangneung, South Korea at the Gangwon Technopark. In June 2019 Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in Santa Clara CA. The hydrogen transfill facility had an explosion during the loading of a tanker truck that was being fueled. This resulted in the temporary shutdown of multiple hydrogen fueling stations in the San Francisco area.Woodrow, Melanie. \\"Bay Area experiences hydrogen shortage after explosion\\", ABC news, June 3, 2019 In June 2019 Uno-X fueling station in Norway experienced an explosion, resulting in the shutdown of all Uno-X hydrogen fueling stations and a temporary halt in sales of fuel cell vehicles in Norway. Based on preliminary investigation findings neither the electrolyzer or the dispenser used by customers had anything to do with this incident. Therefore, the electrolyzer division will now return to business as usual. June 27, 2019 Nel ASA announces the root cause of the incident has been identified as an assembly error of a specific plug in a hydrogen tank in the high-pressure storage unit. In December 2019 a gas explosion at an Airgas facility in Waukesha, Wisconsin injured one worker and caused 2 hydrogen storage tanks to leak. On 7 April 2020 an explosion at the OneH2 Hydrogen Fuel plant in Long View, North Carolina, caused significant damage to surrounding buildings. The blast was felt several miles away, damaging about 60 homes. No injuries from the explosion were reported. The incident is under investigation.

He was an untrained, yet highly gifted photographer who created hundreds of images documenting the new arrivals to America. Fascinated by the diverse origins and cultural backgrounds of his subjects, Sherman created a riveting series of portraits, offering viewers a compelling perspective on this dynamic period in American history. Very little is known about Sherman. Born on July 9, 1865, in Lynn, Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Hired by the Bureau of Immigration to work as a clerk at Ellis Island in 1892, eight years after having moved to New York City, he rose through the clerical ranks. \\"When he died in 1925, he was chief clerk of Ellis Island, in charge of the Immigration Bureau's extensive correspondence.\\" Sherman took photographs from about 1904 until 1924. Considering the state of the art of photography in that era, with long exposures and huge box cameras, the fact he was able to capture so many images during his working life is amazing. Sherman took photographs of families, groups, and individuals who were being detained either for medical reasons or for further interrogation. In some cases, such as his images of a gypsy family, the subjects of photographs were deported. Over the course of his career at Ellis Island, Sherman took more than 200 pictures, often encouraging his subjects to open their suitcases and put on their elaborate national costumes or folk dress. He captured images of Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, circus performers and women from Guadeloupe. Sherman's photographs were not taken in an official capacity, but they were used by immigration officials to promote the work of Ellis Island. They were published in some of the annual reports of the Commissioner General of Immigration and provided by Ellis Island Commissioner William Williams to the New York Times to promote William's work at Ellis Island. Sherman's photograph collections are housed at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and the New York Public Library. On July 4, 2008, the Minnesota History Center opened a new exhibit celebrating the human story of the more than twelve million immigrants who entered the United States through the federal immigration station. The exhibit features 75 framed black-and-white photographs reflecting the cultural and ethnic diversity of people arriving at the beginning of the 20th century.

Plot Porky Pig presides as judge over divorce proceedings at the \\"Court of Inhuman Relations.\\" He calls the case of \\"Duck vs. Duck.\\" Daffy and Mrs. Duck approach the judge's stand. Mrs. Duck shouts over and over: \\"I want a divorce!\\" Porky asks her to relate to the court what happened. She explains that she had left Daffy in charge of keeping their egg warm while she visited her mother. Daffy grew bored, so he took the egg and performed a magic trick, causing the egg to disappear and then reappear. Impressed with himself, he tried the trick a second time but was unable to make the egg reappear. Despite countless frantic attempts with his trick, the egg never reappeared. When Mrs. Duck returned home, Daffy had replaced the egg with a door knob, hoping to fool her. She discovers this, and ends her story by shouting \\"I want a divorce!\\" once more, but this time, not in a blind rage, but extremely close to tears. Porky then sternly asks Daffy what he has to say for himself. Daffy pleads for one more chance, and Porky grants his request. In tears, he tries the trick again and the egg reappears, much to the court's shock. The egg immediately hatches and the ducks reconcile their differences.

The squadron is a geographically separated unit assigned to the 943d Rescue Group at Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base, Arizona, and the 920th Rescue Wing at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Mission The peacetime mission of the 304th is to train and maintain rescue capability for Department of Defense personnel, humanitarian and disaster relief activities. The 304th's wartime mission is to provide combat rescue capabilities to recover downed aircrew members and isolated personnel. They can provide this capability under the harshest of circumstances to include, day/night, inclement weather and all terrain rescue conditions. = Astronaut recovery = The 304th will also be responsible for recovery of astronauts landed in US spaceships off American shore. For that mission, the squadron will have 3 teams ready. During ascent for Starliner, Dragon, and Orion, the 304th Rescue Squadron will have two teams stationed along the east coast of the United States, one at Patrick Air Force Base (just South of the Cape) and the other in Charleston, South Carolina. The Patrick team, Rescue 1, will be responsible for on-pad aborts that place a capsule in the water or for aborts in the first couple minutes of flight that place the capsule within a 200 nautical mile zone from the Cape. After that distance is exceeded, the Charleston crew (Rescue 2) would be responsible for rescue of a launch-aborting crew vehicle anywhere else across the Atlantic.The third team, stationed in Hawai‚Äôi, (also part of Rescue 2) would be responsible for any after-launch immediate landing need or off-nominal Station return contingency that places a Starliner or Dragon in the Pacific. If an off-nominal from orbit return occurred with splashdown in the Atlantic, an emergency ocean return within 200 nautical miles of Cape Canaveral would fall to Rescue 1. Any other Atlantic splashdown would fall to Rescue 2 from Charleston because they have more powerful aircraft that could reach Starliner or Dragon or Orion quicker than the Patrick support craft. Rescue 1 carries a requirement to have a crew en route back to land within 6 hours of splashdown. Rescue 2 carries a requirement to have the hatch on a capsule opened within 24 hours of splashdown and a crew evacuated (via helicopter or ship) from the sea landing area within 72 hours of hatch open. History The 304th trained for combat search and rescue (CSAR) capability from its inception. The 304th was activated in the Reserves on 16 November 1957 at Portland IAP. In 1961, Pararescuemen (PJs) were added to the unit. Since then, the 304th has been training, equipping and employing Combat Rescue Officers, PJs, and support personnel worldwide in support of U.S. national security interests. It performed search, rescue, and medical evacuation missions primarily in the Northwestern United States, including over 100 missions immediately following the Mt. St. Helens volcanic eruption in May 1980. The unit responded to the crash of United Flight 173 in 1978.

He produced the first description of the terminal stria. Life Foville was born in Pontoise, France and received his medical doctorate in 1824, after studying medicine under L√©on Louis Rostan and Jean √âtienne Dominique Esquirol at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital. His medical thesis argued mental illness may be curable, discussing some treatments of the day and their apparent effectiveness. The next year, he was made the medical superintendent of the Saint-Yon asylum in Rouen. During his time there he published several papers on disorders of the nervous system which were well received. His son Achille-Louis-Fran√ßois Foville was born in 1831. He remained at the asylum until 1833, when ill health forced his resignation. Foville spent time travelling abroad, to Africa and America. He returned to France, settling in Paris. After the death of his former teacher Esquirol in 1840, Foville was made a professor at Charenton. Until the appointment Thomas Hodgkin had been attempting to open a facility for the treatment of mental illnesses to compete with the York Retreat. With Foville's appointment to Charenton, he was no longer willing to relocate to England, and Hodgkin dropped the project, feeling no other doctors were suitable to run the facility. The French Revolution of 1848 cost him his job at Charenton, and Foville took up private practice in Paris. He practised medicine in Paris, treating mental disorders, until 1868, when he retired. He moved to Toulouse after his retirement, where he died in 1878.

The last family member to work for the company was Tim Sainsbury who retired as a non-executive director in 1999. The last family chairman was David Sainsbury who retired as chairman of the company in 1998. This brought to an end 129 years of management of the group by the Sainsbury family. As a government minister since 1998, his shares were held in a blind trust until 2007. =Family shareholding in Sainsbury's= The equity interest in Sainsbury's held by the family as of May 2011 is 15%. The family sold down their stake from 35% in 2005. The largest family shareholders are Lord Sainsbury of Turville with 4.99% and Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, who controls just under 3% of the company, and benefits from 1.6% of the equity included in the above. The Sunday Times reported in September 2006 that \\"The Sainsbury family continues to [sell] shares in the ¬£6.2 billion retailer... and for the first time their combined holding has fallen below 20%.‚Äù The largest shareholder is the Qatar Investment Authority, the investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family of the Gulf Kingdom, who as of May 2011 holds 25.999% of the company. Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover's decision to split his 3.89% holding in Sainsbury's between other members of his family in December 2006 suggests that the family may not have sold as many shares as previously thought. The other theory could be that the most senior members of the family, with previous stakes of over 3% (the reportable stock exchange shareholding threshold), could have simply transferred some of their shares to their children (who previously held few shares), rather than having sold shares onto the open market. However, some shares which have been sold were definitely sold to the open market (according to Miss Judith Portrait, the trustee for many Sainsbury family settlements). This fall from around 35% increases the possibility of any takeover attempt succeeding. However, the Sainsbury family have managed to use their remaining stake to block takeover bids in the past, as demonstrated by the two failed takeover bids in 2007. A hostile bid for the company may encounter difficulties, without the full support of the Sainsbury family. The halving of the generous dividend yield in recent years may have been a significant factor regarding the family's decision to reduce their shareholdings. Buildings set up by the Sainsbury family The Sainsbury family has also set up a number of buildings, to house their various interests. These are: *Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts Arts Centre *Sainsbury Laboratory Science Laboratory *Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University *Sainsbury Wing Wing of the National Gallery (London) *Sainsbury Library in the Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford *Sainsbury African Galleries at the British Museum *Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery at the British Museum *The Timothy Sainsbury Gallery at the Victoria and Albert Museum *The Robert and Lisa Sainsbury Wing of Hammersmith Hospital *Sainsbury-Wellcome Centre *Linbury Galleries at Tate Britain *Linbury Gallery at the Museum of London *Linbury Gallery at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff *Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden *Linbury Studio at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art *Headley Lecture Theatre in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford *Raven Row Art Gallery in Spitalfields *Centre for Mental Health Centre to improve the quality of lives for people with mental health problems *National STEM Centre *Centre for Justice Innovation *Astor Community Theatre in Deal, Kent The Sainsbury family charitable interests Eighteen of the grant-making trusts set up by members of the Sainsbury family, are known collectively as the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts.

The Sainsbury family are also major benefactors to English Heritage and the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. Sainsbury family interests in politics The Sainsbury family also has varying political interests. *Alan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury was originally a Liberal, but joined the Labour Party in 1945 and sat on the party benches when appointed to the House of Lords in 1962. He defected to become a founder member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981, and remained with the 'continuing' SDP faction, led by David Owen, following the creation of the Liberal Democrats in 1988. *John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover takes the Conservative whip *David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville also supported the SDP, but has taken the Labour whip since 1997, and was Science and Innovation Minister in the Blair government (1998‚Äì2006) *Tim Sainsbury was Conservative MP for Hove, 1973‚Äì97 *Camilla Sainsbury, daughter of Tim, is married to former MP Shaun Woodward, who started as a Conservative but defected to Labour in 1999.

It markets a range of models with a diversity of CPU-types, structures, features, and operating systems. Commentators have observed that Cherrypal arguably beat the heralded and much-better financed one Laptop per Child (OLPC) project to its goal of a $100 \\"laptop\\" (such units are physically small: a Cherrypal unit for general purchase at $99 plus shipping has a 7\\" screen, an OLPC provided to a child in developing world at $199 has a 7.5\\"). The company's business practices have generated controversy and antipathy from some vocally dissatisfied customers, while others are marginally satisfied. Its practices pertaining to merchandise returns and communication have been repeatedly faulted. The U.S. Better Business Bureau rating for Cherrypal is an \\"F\\", indicating that the BBB strongly questions the company‚Äôs reliability. Cherrypal claims a commitment to environmental concerns and the needs of impoverished countries and in particular key sponsorship of a learning center in Ghana. It supports a \\"One Laptop per Teacher\\" pilot program in Nigeria. In order, the company has marketed the \\"C114\\" PPC-processor-based nettop, the \\"Cherrypal Bing\\" x86-based netbook, the \\"Cherrypal Africa\\" XBurst-CPU-based netbook, the \\"Cherrypal Asia\\" ARM-processor-based netbooks, and the \\"CherryPad America\\" ARM-processor-based tablet computer.

The device launches Firefox Minefield web-browser, AbiWord word- processor, and other apps via icon double-click. An article in The Register noted that Cherrypal's producers asserted that the computer will consume only 2 watts of power. Independent, informal testing has shown a wattage consumption of still low 6.9 watts while booting.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmF20N9HPGo The CherryPal C114 was a rebadged version of the LimePC D1 mini-desktop computer developed as part of a broader Freescale PowerPC chip-based product line by THTF's Shenzhen R&D; center and shown to the public at the 2008 CES in Las Vegas in January 2008.http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/01/09/limepc-little-linux-big- possibilities/ Bing The \\"Cherrypal Bing\\" is a slim x86-based netbook that ships with Windows XP. Africa Cherrypal's $99 netbook, the Africa, is aimed primarily at the developing world but also available for sale to consumers. According to a blog post by Max Seybold, the device's specs in Cherrypal's web store are kept intentionally vague, because the Africa is not built to a set design. Instead, Cherrypal either purchases pre-made netbook systems or buys odd lots of whatever inexpensive components are available and builds netbooks out of these. It then rebrands these netbooks as Africas. The $99 computer was named Africa in honor of PAAJAF, a humanitarian services group based in Ghana, West-Africa. Seybold states that the resulting device will at a minimum meet the specs listed on the website, but could also exceed them. It could also end up having an ARM, MIPS, or x86-based CPU architecture depending on what chips are available. In an interview, Seybold stated that the Africa is not meant to be sold as a \\"computer\\" in the traditional sense, but as an \\"appliance\\" to provide Internet access to people who could not afford to buy a traditional computer. He said that with the number of government services (such as unemployment or disability) that are encouraging access by Internet, lack of such access is becoming more and more of a disability. The only thing Cherrypal promises for $99 is the ability to access the Internet. Asia The \\"Cherrypal Asia\\" is a low cost ARM-based netbook that uses Android OS version 1.7. America The \\"Cherrypal America\\" also known as Cherrypad is an Android tablet based upon Telechips TCC89xx ARM11 processors. Cherrypal initially sold the tablet with the promise of an upgrade to Android 2.2 by November and support for Android market. The market support has been officially removed because the tablet does not conform to the market requirements by Google. Also the Android 2.2 upgrade has been canceled, instead Cherrypal now promises an update to Android 2.3. The hardware of the Cherrypal America as listed by Cherrypal comprises an 800 MHz ARM11 CPU by Telechips, 256 MB DDR2 RAM, 2 GB Flash Memory and an 800x480 resistive touchscreen. However, there is a user report arguing some less powerful specifications according to the boot-log dumped via dmesg. According to various Android news magazines Cherrypal has announced a successor for their current Cherrypad. History Cherrypal was founded by Max Seybold based in Palo Alto. The C114 (and following C120) desktop computers were originally developed by Tsinghua Tongfang (THTF) in its Shenzhen R&D; center by an engineering team led by American electronics industry veterans Jack Campbell and Ryan Quinn. An extended line of handheld, desktop, and TV-based PCs using the Freescale MPC5121e PowerPC microprocessor was shown at CES 2008 by THTF, with the desktop product picked up thereafter as an OEM purchase by CherryPal. Cloud computing plans Cherrypal's marketers planned to use Firefox not only as its web-browser but also as its user interface to launch other applications such as OpenOffice.org. They planned that the Cherrypal would make use of cloud computing in which applications and storage would be wholly or in part Internet-based. These plans have not yet been implemented. The company's president asserted the cloud (Green Maraschino) would be launched in February 2010, however it is not known to have occurred.

It is a stand-alone sequel to Red Steel. The game was released in North America on March 23, 2010, in Australia on March 25, 2010, in Europe the next day. The trailer was premiered at the Los Angeles video game E3 2009 starring the actor Karl E. Landler. Plot The game begins as an unnamed Hero, the last member of the Kusagari Clan, is being dragged across the desert, tied to the back of a motorcycle. He manages to break free, but Payne, the leader of the Jackals - a vast gang of thugs, murderers and thieves - steals the Hero's katana. While running from the Jackals, the Hero rescues his old swordsmaster Jian who was to soon be executed by the Jackals. After the rescue, Jian allows the Hero to borrow his sword until the Hero can recover his own from Payne. The Hero meets up with Tamiko, a member of his clan's research division, as well as Caldera's sheriff and Tamiko's father, Judd. They provide information for the Hero to help him track down Payne, while sabotaging the Jackals' operations in the Upper City, as well as meeting a fight club-operating businessman named Songan. The Hero eventually locates and defeats Payne in the Jackals' hideout, Rojo House, recovering his katana during the battle. He interrogates Payne and, before killing him by throwing him off a ledge, learns that his entire clan had been annihilated by a man named Shinjiro. The Hero travels to the Lower City, encountering another rival clan called the Katakara. He finds Shinjiro in the Kusagari Temple and the two swordsmen fight. After a fierce battle, the Hero breaks Shinjiro's katana and pushes him to the edge of the Temple's roof. However, before the Hero can strike his foe down, a mysterious ninja saves Shinjiro. Jian then tells the Hero that the katanas of the Kusagari, called Sora Katanas, have great unpredictable power and that the method to make these is known only to them, and Shinjiro, who trained with the Kusagari as a child, plans to make more of them. Following a tip from Judd, the Hero discovers Shinjiro trying to escape the city on a train and manages to board it before it leaves. After the Hero fights his way through the train, which is full of ninjas and Katakara, he finds Shinjiro atop the front car; however, the \\"escape attempt\\" is revealed to be a trap. As the Hero approaches the front car, Shinjiro detaches the front car from the rest of the train. Shinjiro then throws a grenade to kill the Hero and destroy the rest of the train. The Hero survives, but is forced to walk through the desert for three days before finding a deserted town. While exploring the town, however, the Hero discovers Songan, who explains that the ghost town is a Jackal ammo dump. The Hero drives off the Jackals and survives an attack by a Katakara force, led by the lieutenant Calhoun. After reestablishing communications with Tamiko, Judd, and Jian, the Hero learns that the trio have tracked Shinjiro to the isolated mining community of Rattlesnake Canyon. The Hero then takes Songan's advice and uses an old locomotive in the town's deserted train depot to travel there. While exploring the Canyon, the Hero is attacked by the leader of the Katakara, Okaji, but manages to defeat him, only for him to return from the dead, ready for the Hero to fight at a later time. Following Tamiko's plan, the Hero then uses explosives stolen from the mining quarry to destroy the gate protecting Shinjiro's hideout, the Tiger's Nest. However, Songan then betrays the hero and his allies, Tamiko, Judd, and Jian, are captured. Shinjiro demands the Hero's katana in exchange for his friends. As the Hero is about to give it to him, the two engage in a gun duel, where Tamiko is shot. The Hero pursues and confronts Shinjiro who now has created a new katana. After a fierce battle, Shinjiro is defeated. As he is weakened, Shinjiro tells the hero that other clans will fight him for that katana. The Hero then thrusts his katana through Shinjiro's chest and breaks it in half, killing Shinjiro in the process. The game ends as the hero throws the other half of the katana off a cliff and looks out into the distance with Shinjiro's dead body behind him. Gameplay Red Steel 2 is played in a first-person perspective where players can alternate between shooting and sword fighting. Players are able to fight up to six enemies on-screen, though enemy packs can go up to twenty, and can deflect opponents' bullets with their swords. As the player progresses through the main missions, new techniques, armor, and weapons become available for purchase, while additional side missions are available to play, earning the player a monetary reward upon their completion. Red Steel 2 is the first game besides Wii Sports Resort to use the Wii Motion Plus Accessory, as well as the only third-party Wii game to require it. The game features an expansive amount of movement with the Wii Motion Plus allowing it to be quite an interactive game. Development predecessor Development of Red Steel 2 began in the summer of 2008. On July 28 of the same year, Red Steel 2 was announced by Ubisoft executive director, Alain Corre. It was also confirmed to use Nintendo's new accessory, Wii MotionPlus and would be included in a bundle. It was developed using the proprietary LyN game engine. Red Steel 2 features stylized, cel-shaded graphics, in contrast to its predecessor's more realistic aesthetic. The visual style is similar to Ubisoft Paris' own XIII, released in 2003. The game does not include gore or excess amount of bloodshed, which resulted with Red Steel 2 getting a rating of T. Enemies disappear in a cloud of dust as they die. Players will have at their disposal both a gun and a katana, which they can switch between at any time. Commenting on the mix of East and West in the game creative director Jason Vandenberghe explained: \\"What doesn't work is to take those Western and Eastern elements, and sort of mix them into one thing. What does work is to say: here's Joe's bar and grill and here is Ming Pow's sushi's place. It's not a Western-looking cowboy katana; it's a katana, and a revolver, and they're clearly in their own place.\\" In April 2009, Ubisoft announced that Red Steel 2 would not feature a multiplayer mode. Creative director Jason Vandenberghe later explained that they did explore the possibilities of a multiplayer mode, but that it would never fit in the development time window, and that they preferred to deliver a great single player experience over a mediocre multiplayer game. Reception Red Steel 2 received favorable reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. IGN praised the \\"awesome style and energetic gameplay\\" and called it \\"one of the top titles on Wii.\\" Official Nintendo Magazine praised the MotionPlus controls, visuals and audio, but criticised the mission design, referring to it as being \\"average.\\" Eurogamer praised the \\"thrilling set pieces\\" but called the game's character \\"flawed, certainly, but entirely honorable with it.\\" 1UP.com were considerably less impressed, stating that while \\"occasionally exhilarating\\" the game was \\"mostly unremarkable.\\" GamesRadar praised the controls and \\"the engaging, intuitive combat.\\" GamesRadar also noted that the game was drastically superior to Red Steel, noting that there was \\"no comparison between the two.\\" Classic Game Room received the game well. Bussler claimed that this was the best motion controlled first person shooter that \\"I ever played\\". Not all non- video game publications gave the game moderate success. The Escapist gave it four stars out of five and said, \\"Over three years after the Wii hit store shelves, Red Steel 2 finally delivers the motion-controlled swordplay we expected from the original Red Steel, and it more than makes up for any niggling flaws in the level design.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave it seven out of ten and called it \\"effortlessly likable\\". Wired also gave it seven stars out of ten, saying, \\"I've never played anything quite like Red Steel 2, which lets you use swords and guns simultaneously, switching back and forth between wild swinging and precise aiming.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a C+, saying, \\"Though the pesky lag is largely gone, all too often, gameplay still devolves into breathless, embarrassing exercises in flailing.\\" Ubisoft originally expected to sell 1 million copies of Red Steel 2, but after poor sales of their game Avatar, they slashed their sales predictions in half. According to Jason VendenBerghe at his keynote speech at the 2010 European game developers conference, Red Steel 2 has sold approximately 270,000 copies worldwide.  Future  In April 2010, a French website spread a rumor that a sequel was in development, according to a Nintendo magazine. Jason VandenBerghe feels enthusiastic about making a sequel, but said that the current state of the motion control market does not yet justify making a sequel. It was reported by rumors that a sequel would likely be a Wii exclusive and make use of the Wii Vitality Sensor. However, since the launch of the Wii U, no further news of a sequel has surfaced.

His artwork incorporates influence from urban landscapes, sporting events, and modern celebrities. As described in the book about Fazzino titled The Master of 3-D Pop Art, \\"An innovative and imaginative storyteller, Charles Fazzino serves up a bevy of details in his unique three- dimensional creations. His collectors marvel as much at his ability to capture the entire essence of his subject matter in one statement, as they do at his use of vibrant colors, his whimsical sense of humor, and his hand-assembled multi-layered artistic style. Although, the snappy titled often gives a clue to the content of each painting, it can take years of careful observation to discern all of the details in a single Fazzino image. One of Fazzino's greatest joys is to observe visitors at exhibition of his work. 'I love to watch the smiles form as people begin to recognize elements of my paintings,' comments Fazzino. 'They point at the images as if inserting themselves into the stories. I watch that and I'm reminded of why i paint. It's all about celebrating the joy and fun we have as human beings on this planet.\\" Julie Maner, Charles Fazzino: Charles Fazzino, The Master of 3-D pop art. Distributed by Te Neues Publishing Company, NY, Charles Fazzino in his Studio in New Rochelle Background Front view of \\"Raining Going d\\" by Charles Fazzino Side view of \\"Raining Gold\\", showing the 3D design of the artwork Born in 1955, Charles Fazzino is the son of a Finnish sculptor (Irene) and an Italian mode shoe designer (Salvatore). He took his first formal art class as a 7th grader in 1967 and later graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan in 1977 with a degree in bachelor of arts. Today, Fazzino's artwork is sold and exhibited in galleries, museums, and art shows in more than 20 countries worldwide. A majority of his event-specific artwork for major events represents The Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards, The Pori Jazz Festival, Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and the Daytime Emmy Awards. Fazzino is most well known for the three-dimensionality of his silkscreen serigraphs. While exhibiting in the juried arts fairs in Florida in 1980, Fazzino attended a 3-D paper tole class in an arts supply store. He experimented with the technique and showed his first three-dimensional print at the Greenwich Village Art Show in New York City that May. Fazzino entered the gallery circuit when he sold his first 3D offset lithographs to a gallery in Michigan. He began using the silkscreen printing process in 1986. The Fazzino 3D process  Fazzino's three-dimensional creations are labor-intensive, which require several stages to complete. The artist begins with a flat drawing that is worked and re- worked for weeks or even months before the limited edition process even begins. The flat artwork is sent to a silkscreen printer who spends months hand-printing the flat fine art reproductions. The flat sheets return to Fazzino's studio where more than 40 artists work under his direction, all by hand, to cut out the elements from cutout sheets and mount them onto heavier boards to create the 3D layered effect. Fazzino often equates the process of building up the layers of artwork to \\"layering it like a lasagna.\\" The 3D artworks are finished off by hand with glitter and Swarovski crystals.  Special Event Commissions  NFL Super Bowl Charles Fazzino's art has been featured in every Super Bowl for the National Football League since the 2001 Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa Bay, Florida. Fazzino was profiled by CBS News Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood on Charles Osgood Sunday in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 3, 2013. He also created a painting for Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014, where the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Denver Broncos at MetLife Stadium, as well as The New England Patriots 2015 win in Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix, Arizona. Fazzino's licensed commemorative painting for Super Bowl LI in Houston, Texas, valued at $15,000 UDS, was unveiled at a private reception. The painting was later auctioned off and proceeds were donated to the WithMerci Foundation. During the week leading up to Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, Charles Fazzino appeared in a segment for Inside Edition.com during which he was interviewed by the program's guest Super Bowl correspondent Kelleth Cuthbert, aka the Fiji Water Girl. Fazzino commemorated his twentieth Super Bowl for the National Football League during Super Bowl LIV in Miami. The artist appeared at The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and at the Super Bowl Experience in the Miami Beach Convention Center alongside former NY Giant Mathias Kiwanuka and Miami Dolphin Davon Godchaux. https://www.nbcmiami.com/entertainment/6-in-the-mix/art-of-the-game-meet-the- super-bowls-official-artist/2182861/ Major League Baseball All-Star Game Fazzino has created artwork for more thirteen Major League Baseball All-Star Games.

When we're all gone and many years have passed, I hope that our descendants will look at one of my paintings and say 'that's a Fazzino'.

There exist two types of top-hat transform: the white top-hat transform is defined as the difference between the input image and its opening by some structuring element, while the black top-hat transform is defined dually as the difference between the closing and the input image. Top-hat transforms are used for various image processing tasks, such as feature extraction, background equalization, image enhancement, and others. Mathematical definitions Let f:E\\\\mapsto R be a grayscale image, mapping points from a Euclidean space or discrete grid E (such as R2 or Z2) into the real line. Let b(x) be a structuring element of grayscale. Then, the white top-hat transform of f is given by: :T_w(f)=f-f \\\\circ b, where \\\\circ denotes the opening operation. The black top-hat transform of f (sometimes called the bottom-hat transform ) is given by: :T_b(f)=f\\\\bullet b-f, where \\\\bullet is the closing operation. Properties The white top-hat transform returns an image, containing those \\"objects\\" or \\"elements\\" of an input image that: * Are \\"smaller\\" than the structuring element (i.e., places where the structuring element does not fit in), and * are brighter than their surroundings. The black top-hat returns an image, containing the \\"objects\\" or \\"elements\\" that: * Are \\"smaller\\" than the structuring element, and * are darker than their surroundings. The size, or width, of the elements that are extracted by the top-hat transforms can be controlled by the choice of the structuring element b. The bigger the latter, the larger the elements extracted. Both top-hat transforms are images that contain only non-negative values at all pixels. One of its most important uses in image segmentation is to adjust nonuniform lighting conditions on an image and provide a better threshold value for separating objects.  Example  Assume we are only interested in small blobs on the image and we want to remove the larger bright objects. In this case, the white top-hat transform can remove larger bright objects and retain small blobs by selecting the size of the structuring element that is between removed objects and objects of interest. The radius of six largest bright objects are approximately 50 to 100 pixels whereas the radius of objects of interest are around 2 to 4 pixels. In addition, the objects of interest are circular shapes so we choose a disk shaped structuring element with radius 5. However, selecting different shapes and sizes for the structuring element result in different images depending on whether objects fit in the structuring element or not. The other example is that you have an image under nonuniform illumination and you want to extract objects separately from background. The common method for image segmentation is to threshold the input image based on intensity value. However, if the image under nonuniform lighting, it is possible that segmentation errors might present since some objects in darker area have close intensity values as background intensity values and would not be extracted by only utilizing threshold method. In this case, before Otsu's method is applied to input image, white top-hat transform should be implemented to correct nonuniform lighting condition and make obvious contrast between background and objects. Therefore, the objects can be extracted entirely from background without segmentation errors. The threshold values are 0.5216 and 0.2 and normalized to [0,1] for original image and applied white top-hat transform respectively.

The film discusses a series of personalities, including Asher Levy, Louis Moses Gomez, Rebecca Gratz, Uriah Phillips Levy, Levi Strauss, Isaac Leeser, Isaac Mayer Wise, Judah Benjamin, the Warburgs, the Schiffs, and Emma Lazarus. Summary They Came for Good is a two-part documentary series of critical acclaim. Part I focuses on the contributions of Sephardic Jews in early America and their hard-fought struggle for equality that eventually brought them presidential respect. Unlike any national leader before his time President George Washington, made history by embracing the Jewish community upon his election and asserting their equality. The pioneering Jews of early America came to the New World to practice their religion openly, and once they arrived they began to shape the budding nation. Part II examines the people and personalities who shaped the critical time of the mid-18th century, from the creators of the Orthodox and Reform movements to the Ashkenazi entrepreneurs who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Midwestern prairie to create new American identities. In 1820, most took a subdued approach to demonstrating their Jewishness. They were a shadow of a population, numbering less than 3,000 nationwide ‚Äî a minority in a nation of minorities. In the years that followed, however, a massive influx of immigrant Ashkenazi Jewry from Europe arrived to cause a spiritual and economic sea change. The film covers American Jew's entrepreneurial spirit from the mostly-Jewish peddlers selling goods on the back roads of the South to those who run the general stores that will one day grow into nationwide chains like Macy‚Äôs, Sears, Gimbels, Sterns and Filene's, Jews were major purveyors of commercial good in this country and, thus, major contributors to popular culture.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Norman McCabe. The cartoon was released on September 5, 1942, and stars Daffy Duck. The film is set in a mad scientist's laboratory. This cartoon was colorized in 1968 (just after Seven Arts Productions, successor to Guild Films, to whom the TV distribution rights to the black-and-white cartoon library had been sold some time before, acquired Warner Bros.) by having every other frame traced over onto a cel. Each redrawn cel was painted in color and then photographed over a colored reproduction of each original background. The animation quality dropped considerably from the original version with this method. The cartoon was colorized again in 1992, this time with a computer adding color to a new print of the original black and white cartoon. This preserved the quality of the original animation (the end result also resembled the actual color cartoons released around the same time). Adding to the medical theme, the signatures of those responsible (McCabe, Christensen, Risto and Stalling) were featured in the opening credits. Plot summary While traipsing through the Ookaboochie Swamps, Daffy Duck seeks to deliver a telegram to \\"Chloe\\". Unable to find the telegram's recipient, and suffering from a severe case of hiccups, he stumbles upon the home of \\"Dr. Jerkyl\\" and hopes that the physician can cure his condition. Daffy's hiccups are so severe that they cause him to damage or destroy everything around him. Dr. Jerkyl captures Daffy and restrains him to a doctor's chair. Hoping to scare Daffy in order to cure his hiccups, Dr. Jerkyl created and drinks a potion that turns him into Chloe, a grotesque yet effeminate ogre. Daffy, realizing he has reached his destination, then reads Chloe the telegram: the lyrics to \\"Happy Birthday To You,\\" sent to her by a Mr. Frank N. Stein. Chloe, who is enamored with Daffy (who in turn is now cured of his hiccups), chases the duck around the laboratory until the radio is accidentally switched on, prompting him/her to dance. Once the music ends, the chase resumes. Daffy scrambles to the lab table and mixes a potion, which turns Chloe into an infant.

Though treatment was not free, unlike NHS Scotland which succeeded it, fees were set at minimal levels and people could still get treated even if they were unable to pay. Foundation The service came into being as a direct result of the publication of the Report of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service Committee or \\"Dewar Report\\" in 1912. This report exposed inadequate medical and nursing services across large parts of the crofting counties and recommended a new way of delivering state funded medical services. Doctors would be guaranteed a minimum salary and cost of travel would be reimbursed. In return they would be expected to visit all those requesting help, be involved in public health and school work, attend midwifery cases and provide themselves with adequate transport. The service also planned an expansion of nursing services with associated nursing accommodation, provide state support to the hospitals and specialists and purchase ambulances. The service was administered by a Board of between 5 & 9 with the first Chair being Sir John Dewar. After an initial survey they predicted an increase in doctors from 170 to 185 and an additional 100 new houses. They requested and were granted an annual treasury grant of ¬£42,000. Early years The service had an uncertain start. An early achievement was the posting of a nurse to St Kilda but the First World War held back developments and was used merely to support the doctors salaries and provide travel expenses. In 1919 administration moved to the Scottish Board of Health and in due course it was seen to be having the desired effect of providing adequate medical services to the population and supporting doctors to live and work in the area. Eventually other aspects of the service were developed including support for specialist surgeons and physicians, a laboratory in Inverness and even the first air ambulance service to the outer isles in 1936. The Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky, United States, was built on the HIMS model., as was Newfoundland's Cottage Hospital System.

A veterinary by education, he was a mayor and State Secretary during his political career, and has since made his mark as general director of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities. He is a veterinarian by education. He is currently CEO of The Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization's clinics.Olav Ulleren ny administrerende direkt√∏r i LHL Helse Career=Early career= Ulleren was born in Tinn, and finished his secondary education in 1973. He took the cand.med.vet. degree at the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science in 1978, was a research assistant in 1979 and acting municipal veterinary in Tinn in 1980. He then held two substitute jobs before doing his compulsory military service. From 1983 to 1991 he worked as the municipal veterinary in Tinn. He later took a master's degree in Knowledge Management from the Norwegian School of Management. =Political career= Ulleren was a member of Tinn municipal council from 1983 to 1987, was not re-elected in 1987 but then returned in 1991. In 1991 he was elected deputy mayor, and in 1994 he became mayor of Tinn municipality. Representing the Centre Party, he became the first non-Labour mayor of Tinn since 1945. With Ulleren at the helm, the Centre Party almost reached 45% in polls. Ulleren was re-elected in 1995 for a second four-year term, but on 10 May 1999, some months before the 1999 election, he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as a part of the first cabinet Bondevik.Kjell Magne Bondevik's First Government. 17 October 1997-17 March 2000 -- Government.no Subsequently, the Centre Party in Tinn plummeted with 27.3 percentage points. Ulleren lost his State Secretary position when the first cabinet Bondevik lost a vote of no confidence on 17 March 2000. During his time in politics, Ulleren was a member of the central committee of the Centre Party for ten years, and also chaired the county chapter in Telemark for six years. He ran as a candidate for the position as vice party leader on multiple occasions, but was never chosen. Among his non-political assignments during this period was the contribution to the Norwegian Official Report 1998: 11.NOU 1998: 11 He was also chairman of the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Tinn Sparebank and a board member of Telemark University College during the 1990s. =Leaving politics= When his tenure as State Secretary ended, Ulleren did not return to local politics. Instead, he was hired as director in Bioparken. He also served as chair of Akvaforsk, and later as a member of the board of the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority and of Blefjell Hospital Trust. He was also a member of the Norwegian Council for Quality Improvement and Priority Setting in Health Care. Ulleren stopped paying the membership fee for the Centre Party in 2001, and in 2006 he described himself as \\"without a political attachment\\". In 2002 Ulleren was hired as general director of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS). In addition to the usual task of negotiating wages with the trade unions of employees in the municipal sector, Ulleren marked himself as more politically involved than several of his predecessors. Notably, in 2006 Ulleren proposed that a Norwegian municipal reform be considered. In light of the recent reform in Denmark, it has been suggested that the number of municipalities of Norway be reduced, through mergers, from the current tally at around 430. Ulleren stated while a direct import of the Danish model was undesirable, something should be done in the way of merging some municipalities. Ulleren has also supported a regional reform. In 2003 he predicted the future abolishment of the county municipality and the county council, though at the end of his term in 2009, both still existed. =Civil servant= In late 2008, it was announced that Ulleren would become the new permanent under-secretary of State in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in 2009, succeeding Per Harald Grue who was due to retire. The permanent under-secretary of State is the highest-ranking position in a Ministry, except for the partisan positions of Minister and State Secretary. Among the tasks in the Ministry of Agriculture is to represent the state party in the annual general price settlement on agricultural produce. The decision to appoint Ulleren was criticized by Hans Frode Asmyhr of the Progress Party for being a perceived consolidation of the Centre Party. First, the Minister who was responsible for the appointment, Lars Peder Brekk, represents the Centre Party. Second, Asmyhr insinuated that the other parties in the agricultural settlement also represented the Centre Party.Quote: In English: \\"Now, sympathizers of the Centre Party will be seated on all sides of the table.\\" (remark made by Asmyhr, written by the journalist in Nynorsk) While both leaders of the main farmers' interest organizations, P√•l Haugstad of the Norwegian Agrarian Association and Ole-Anton Teigen of the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union, did support the appointment, Teigen is an active politician for the Socialist Left Party. Lars Peder Brekk deemed Asmyhr's allegations to be \\"clear-cut piffle\\", citing that Ulleren had the necessary qualifications for the position. In addition, other politicians from opposition parties, including Leif Helge Kongshaug (Liberal) and Torbj√∏rn Hansen (Conservative), defended the appointment of Ulleren. Personal life After leaving Tinn in 1999, Ulleren has lived in B√¶rum and Oslo. He still owns 20,000 decares of land in Tinn, which includes fields, forest and freshwater. Although he owns two dozen sheep, and sells licenses for fishing and Lagopus hunting on his estate, he uses the land mainly for recreation. Ulleren's hobbies include telemark skiing.

The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492‚Äì500. It promotes an evidence-based understanding of horse- rider interactions. The goal is to apply valid, quantitative scientific methods to identify what training techniques are ineffective or painful, and to improve the horse-rider relationship by explaining horse training from a learning theory perspective that removes anthropomorphism and emotiveness. It can aid the training process by clarifying the roles of positive versus negative reinforcement, punishment, and by identifying stimuli that provoke unwanted responses or pain in horses. Equitation science uses psychological principles such as learning theory as well as equine ethology and biomechanics. It uses objective measures to score performance during training and competitions and identifies techniques that may result in equine suffering.McGreevy, P.D. (2007). The advent of equitation science. The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492‚Äì500. Recent technological advances have now made it possible to measure the strength of a rider‚Äôs signals. Thus, riding concepts such as ‚Äòcontact‚Äô and ‚Äòlightness‚Äô can now be evaluated with calibrated rein tension gauges, or via spurs and riding boots made from pressure-sensitive material. Radiographic studies can give insights into the horse‚Äôs mouth ‚Äì the position of different bit types and positional changes in response to rein tension. Measuring pressures beneath the saddle on the horse‚Äôs back is valuable for assessing saddle fit and to circumvent back problems caused by ill-fitting saddles. Equitation science uses physiological measurements such as heart rate, blood, urine and saliva analyses to evaluate the comfort and stress level of the horse. It also evaluates behavioural indicators of ineffective horse-rider communication and conflict such as teeth grinding, tail swishing, rearing or bucking.McGreevy, P.D. (2007). The advent of equitation science. The Veterinary Journal. 174, 492‚Äì500. Using a multidisciplinary scientific approach that involves veterinarians, animal and behavioural scientists, psychologists, engineers, and professional riders and trainers, equitation science encourages the use of appropriate training techniques that result in fewer injuries and behavioural problems, enhance the horses‚Äô lifespan and the safety of both horse and rider.McGreevy, P.D. , McLean, A.N.(2010). Equitation science. Wiley, Oxon. International Society for Equitation Science (ISES) The International Society for Equitation Science (ISES) unites academics and practitioners. Its mission is to promote and encourage the application of objective research and advanced practice which will ultimately improve the welfare of horses in their associations with humans. During discussions following the Havemeyer Foundation Workshop on Horse Behavior and Welfare in Iceland in 2002, the idea of establishing a society devoted to equitation science was first raised. In 2007, the ISES was founded by individuals with expertise in various equine fields of knowledge from around the world.McGreevy, P.D. , McLean, A.N.(2010). Equitation science. Wiley, Oxon.

The Revoluci√≥n Argentina and the \\"authoritarian-bureaucratic state\\" The June 1966 coup established General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a as de facto president, supported by several leaders of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), including the general secretary Augusto Vandor. This was followed by a series of military-appointed presidents and the implementation of liberal economic policies, supported by multinational companies, employers' federations, part of the more-or-less corrupt workers' movement, and the press. While preceding military coups were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional juntas, the Revoluci√≥n Argentina headed by Ongan√≠a aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and to Communism, which would give the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading political and economic role. Political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell named this type of regime \\"authoritarian-bureaucratic state\\",Guillermo O'Donnell, El Estado Burocr√°tico Autoritario, (1982) in reference to the Revoluci√≥n Argentina, the 1964‚Äì1985 Brazilian military regime and Augusto Pinochet's regime (starting in 1973). Ongan√≠a's rule (1966‚Äì70) Ongan√≠a implemented corporatist policies, experimenting in particular in C√≥rdoba under the governance of Carlos Caballero. The new Minister of Economy, Adalbert Krieger Vasena, decreed a wage freeze and a 40% devaluation, which weakened the economy - in particular the agricultural sector - and favored foreign capital. Vasena suspended collective labour conventions, reformed the \\"hydrocarbons law\\" which had established a partial monopoly of the Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales (YPF) state firm, and passed a law facilitating the eviction of tenants over their non-payment of domestic rent. Finally, the right to strike was suspended (Law 16,936) and several other laws passed reversing previous progressive labor legislation (reducing retirement age, etc.). The workers' movement divided itself between Vandoristas, who supported a \\"Peronism without Per√≥n\\" line (Augusto Vandor, leader of the General Confederation of Labour, declared that \\"to save Per√≥n, one has to be against Per√≥n\\") and advocated negotiation with the junta, alongside \\"Participationists\\" headed by Jos√© Alonso, and Peronists, who formed the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentines (CGTA) in 1968 and were opposed to any kind of participation with the military junta. Per√≥n himself, from his exile in Francoist Spain, maintained a cautious and ambiguous line of opposition to the regime, rejecting both endorsement and open confrontation. =Cultural and education policies= The Night of the Long Batons, an Ongan√≠a police action against University of Buenos Aires students and faculty came to be known. Ongan√≠a ended university autonomy, which had been achieved by the University Reform of 1918.Carmen Bernand, ¬´ D‚Äôune rive √† l‚Äôautre ¬ª, Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Materiales de seminarios, 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the EHESS), Put on line on 15 June 2008. URL : http://nuevomundo.revues.org//index35983.html Accessed on 28 July 2008. He was responsible for the July 1966 La Noche de los Bastones Largos (\\"The Night of the Long Truncheons\\"), where university autonomy was violated, in which he ordered police to invade the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. They beat up and arrested students and professors. The university repression led to the exile of 301 university professors, among whom were Manuel Sadosky, Tulio Halper√≠n Donghi, Sergio Bag√∫ and Risieri Frondizi.Marta Slemenson et al., Emigraci√≥n de cient√≠ficos argentinos. Organizaci√≥n de un √©xodo a Am√©rica Latina (?, Buenos Aires, 1970:118) Ongan√≠a also ordered repression on all forms of \\"immoralism\\", proscribing miniskirts, long hair for young men, and all avant-garde artistic movements. This moral campaign alienated the middle classes, who were massively present in universities. =Change of direction of the Armed Forces= Towards the end of May 1968, General Julio Alsogaray dissented from Ongan√≠a, and rumors spread about a possible coup d'√©tat, with Algosaray leading the opposition to Ongan√≠a. At the end of the month Ongan√≠a dismissed the leaders of the Armed Forces: Alejandro Lanusse replaced Julio Alsogaray, Pedro Gnavi replaced Benigno Varela, and Jorge Mart√≠nez Zuvir√≠a replaced Adolfo Alvarez. =Increasing protests= On 19 September 1968, two important events affected Revolutionary Peronism. John William Cooke, former personal delegate of Per√≥n, an ideologist of the Peronist Left and friend of Fidel Castro, died from natural causes. On the same day a group of 13 men and one woman who aimed at establishing a foco in Tucum√°n Province, in order to head the resistance against the junta, was captured;Oscar R. Anzorena, Tiempo de violencia y utop√≠a (1966-1976), Editorial Contrapunto, 1987, p.48 among them was Envar El Kadre, then a leader of the Peronist Youth. Images of the Cordobazo, May‚ÄìJune 1969 In 1969, the CGT de los Argentinos (led by Raimundo Ongaro) headed protest movements, in particular the Cordobazo, as well as other movements in Tucum√°n, Santa Fe and Rosario (Rosariazo). While Per√≥n managed a reconciliation with Augusto Vandor, he followed, in particular through the voice of his delegate Jorge Paladino, a cautious line of opposition to the military junta, criticizing with moderation the neoliberal policies of the junta but waiting for discontent inside the government (\\"hay que desensillar hasta que aclare\\", said Per√≥n, advocating patience). Thus, Ongan√≠a had an interview with 46 CGT delegates, among them Vandor, who agreed on \\"participationism\\" with the military junta, thus uniting themselves with the Nueva Corriente de Opini√≥n headed by Jos√© Alonso and Rogelio Coria. In December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the Movement of Priests for the Third World (MSTM), marched on the Casa Rosada to present to Ongan√≠a a petition pleading him to abandon the eradication plan of villas miserias (shanty towns).Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.49 The same year, the MSTM issued a declaration supporting Socialist revolutionary movements, which led the Catholic hierarchy, by the voice of Juan Carlos Aramburu, coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires, to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.53 Various armed actions, headed by the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n (FAL), composed by former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, occurred in April 1969, leading to several arrests among FAL members. These were the first left-wing urban guerrilla actions in Argentina. Beside these isolated actions, the Cordobazo uprising of 1969, called forth by the CGT de los Argentinos, and its Cordobese leader, Agust√≠n Tosco, prompted demonstrations in the entire country. The same year, the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) was formed as the military branch of the Trotskyist Workers' Revolutionary Party, leading an armed struggle against the dictatorship. Levingston's rule (1970‚Äì71) Faced with increasing opposition, in particular following the Cordobazo, General Ongan√≠a was forced to resign by the military junta, composed of the chiefs of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. He was replaced by General Roberto Marcelo Levingston, who, far from calling free elections, decided to deepen the Revoluci√≥n Argentina. Levingston expressed the nationalist-developmentist sector of the Armed Forces, and was supported by the most intransigent military elements. He named the radical economist Aldo Ferrer as Minister of Economy. A coalition of political parties issued the statement known as La Hora del Pueblo, calling for free and democratic elections which would include the Justicialist Party. Under this pressure, Levingston was ousted by an internal coup headed by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and strongman of the Revoluci√≥n Argentina, General Alejandro Agust√≠n Lanusse. Lanusse's rule (1971‚Äì73) The last of the military presidents de facto of this period, Alejandro Lanusse, was appointed in March 1971. He was as unpopular as his predecessors. His administration started building infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, etc.) necessary for the development of the country, without responding to popular demands concerning social and economic policies. General Lanusse tried to respond to the Hora del Pueblo declaration by calling elections but excluding Peronists from them, in the so-called Gran Acuerdo Nacional (Great National Agreement). He nominated Arturo Mor Roig (Radical Civic Union) as Minister of Interior, who enjoyed the support of the Hora del pueblo coalition of parties, to supervise the coming elections. There had been no elections since 1966, and armed struggle groups came into existence, such as the Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP, the armed wing of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, PRT), the Catholic nationalist Peronists Montoneros and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR). In August 1972, an attempt by several revolutionary members to escape from prison, headed by Mario Roberto Santucho (PRT), was followed by what became known as the Trelew massacre. Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Roberto Quieto, Enrique Gorriar√°n Merlo and Domingo Menna managed to complete their escape, but 19 others were re-captured. 16 of them, members of the Montoneros, the FAR, and the ERP, were killed, and 3 managed to survive. On the same night of August 22, 1972, the junta approved law 19,797, which proscribed any information concerning guerrilla organizations. The massacre led to demonstrations in various cities. Finally, Lanusse lifted the proscription of the Justicialist Party, although he maintained it concerning Juan Per√≥n by increasing the number of years of residency required of presidential candidates, thus excluding de facto Per√≥n from the elections since he had been in exile since the 1955 Revoluci√≥n Libertadora. Henceforth, Per√≥n decided to appoint as his candidate his personal secretary H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora, a leftist Peronist, as representative of the FreJuLi (Frente Justicialista de Liberaci√≥n, Justicialist Liberation Front), composed of the Justicialist Party and minor, allied parties. The FreJuLi's electoral slogan was \\"C√°mpora in Government, Per√≥n in power\\" (C√°mpora al Gobierno, Per√≥n al poder). See also *History of Argentina NotesReferences *Oscar R.

It is similar to the wall of death, but in this act riders can loop vertically as well as horizontally. There have been three performance-related deaths recorded between 1949-1997.http://www.globeofdeath.com/top_10_questions.htm Retrieved 2010-05-24. The only Globe of Death World Record officially recognized by the Guinness World Records is six riders and one person in the center by the Infernal Varanne team on the set of Lo Show Dei Record, in Milan, Italy, on 13 April 2011. It is sometimes the finale of the circus. For its 2008 touring edition, Ringling Bros. started using the name Globe of Steel, as the word death was not seen as family friendly from a public relations perspective. Notable instances Leo Garcia of the Garcia Family Thrill Riders designed and built the very first (horizontal) Triple Splitting Globe of Death in 2006. This Globe is the only one of its kind that hydraulically lifts 5 feet off the ground and splits/separates into three sections while the Garcia Thrill Riders race their motorcycles in the center piece with a 4-foot gap underneath them. During this operation, the entire sphere lifts at over 23 feet high. In the 134th Edition of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Crazy Wilson Dominguez (who normally performs on the Wheel of Death) is the first person to split the Globe of Death apart from the top. During this stunt, four sections of the globe are split apart, with three members of his family on motorcycles staying in the parts of the globe which are still welded together. The youngest recorded person to ride a motorcycle in the Globe of Death is Maximus Garcia, who was four years, six months, and 28 days old on August 16, 2006.http://urdb.org/Content/RecordDetail.aspx?id=1691&attempt;=3155 Retrieved 2010-05-24 In June 2015 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the largest outdoor Globe of Death was constructed, standing at tall. A total of 12 consecutive loops were performed in the Globe with a car. In 2014 in Belgium, Johnny Strange became the first person to swallow a sword inside the Globe of Death when he teamed up with Vesko Lesev of Globe of Death EU to combine the two dangerous arts.Johnny Strange performs worlds first sword swallow inside a Globe of Death.  Construction of the globe  The globe of death is produced using several segmented, bowed portions of welded mesh where sections of material are fitted together and riveted. One panel of steel at the bottom of the globe acts as a trap door where riders and their bikes can enter and exit. While there are standards, many groups of riders use their own globes of various sizes. While the 5,300 pound 16 foot globe is most common, some performers use smaller sizes, and even 17 foot globes.  Motorcycles  The most commonly used bike in the globe of death act are dirtbikes. The majority of riders use single cylinder dirt bikes to traverse the globe. Often made from mass market manufacturers such as Suzuki or Honda, riders tend to choose bikes that are lightweight and with high torque so that they can quickly achieve the speed required to complete loops within the sphere. Many riders may also have to go from high speeds to a dead stop very quickly. While mass market bikes are cheaper to use in the globe many riders customize their bikes to their liking; this is because the globe of death stunt does not require a bike with a powerful engine, suspension, and drive train as they require a top speed of only 40 to 65 miles per hour or 65 to 105 kilometres per hour. Stock dirt bikes are limited and so performers modify the bikes in order to make the stunt safer and easier.  Physics  The physics of the trick are centered around the manipulation of centripetal force. This is the force that acts on an object as it moves around in a circular path. All forces have a direction in which they push, and centripetal force is directed towards the center of the circular path. It can be calculated using the following formula: F_c=\\\\frac{m\\\\times v^2}r Where: F_c is the centripetal force m is the mass of the object v is the speed at which the object is moving r is the radius of the circular path. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to the outer edge. It is half the length of the diameter. For a rider wanting to complete a vertical loop, the minimum speed required of the rider is: v=\\\\sqrt{g\\\\times r} Where r is the radius of the sphere.  Performance  This 5-8 minute long spectacle can have quite a physical impact on the riders as 3.5‚Äì5.5gs are put on the surface of the globe. At the apex, many riders \\"grey-out\\", which is a transient loss of vision, not as severe as a total blackout. In addition to grey-outs, for many riders vertigo and nausea is a huge problem as the act is inducing to such symptoms. Because of this, physical fitness of the riders is extremely important. In addition to fitness keeping a healthy diet is just as important because the rider's body mass completely affects the entire act. Some riders will say that they try to concentrate on a particular point in order to \\"reverse\\" the effects of the g-forces. These experienced riders say the right way to counteract greying-out is to use peripheral vision, and to choose particularly the center of the globe towards the bottom.  History  Prior to the Globe of Death came what is known as the Basket of Death. Little is known about this Corbeille de la Mort (which translates to ‚ÄòBasket of Death‚Äô) other than that these extended cycle whirl tracks were impetus for fully enclosed metal globes. The basket has paltry bracing, making it incredibly dangerous for two people to ride together in tandem in the basket. The circus act now known as the Globe of Death first started to appear in 1901 as the cycle whirl, which had slatted vertical columns instead of a complete sphere. Several carnival historians, including A.W. Stencell, attribute the premier Globe of Death act to Thomas Eck in 1903; however, others consider Arthur Rosenthal of Grand Rapids, Michigan the first as he patented the ‚ÄúBicyclist‚Äôs Globe‚Äù in 1904. This patent claims to have invented ‚Äúcertain new and useful improvements in Bicyclists Globes‚Äù: these new and useful improvements delve into the specifications for the creation of a latticed globe so the bicyclists could attain sufficient momentum to perform the act. The popularization of the act began with Arthur Rosenthal, the man who patented the globe, and Frank Lemon. Together they were known in the area as ‚ÄúRose and Lemon,‚Äù a trick bicycle and motorcycle duo, who performed in the globe as the climax of their act. Their show was said to perform routines of skill and nerve guaranteed to deliver laughs and roars at fairs, amusement parks, and shows across the land. Although Arthur Rosenthal is known for patenting what became known as the ‚ÄúGlobe of Death,‚Äù several other performers started to use similar globes around this time, including Guido Consi, an Italian daredevil who introduced his ‚ÄúSphere of Fear‚Äù to European audiences in Rome; a German engineer who built and operated his own globe; and the act ‚ÄúCedero and his Golden Globe,‚Äù which arrived in New York City and was the first of many Brazilian globes and globe riders to migrate to the United States. One of the most successful shows was the Hazardous Globe Of Death where ‚ÄúMr. and Mrs. Charles Clark‚Äù both employed Indian motorcycles inside a 16-foot sphere. Another well-known motorglobe act was the Mendoza family from Australia who began each of their shows using bicycles and finished on motorcycles; their climax was the ‚ÄúGlobe of Fate‚Äù, which they kept covered by a canvas tent so as to compel paid entry. A Young Greek woman, who went by the stage name CeDora, gained much notoriety since women riders presented a special attraction in the Globe of Death. Because of the cage‚Äôs tighter radius and slight bracing, lightweight motorcycles with a short wheelbase are required for the performances. Two-stroke engines weigh less and provide a better acceleration. Many riders equipped their bikes with working headlights that added a dramatic effect. There were a small number of operators who handled, and performed in, globes; among those that did were Louis ‚ÄúSpeedy‚Äù Babbs, Zeke Shumway, and Jack Hatcher. Babbs claimed that because riding in a globe required a different technique than riding in a motordrome, it was difficult to operate and perform the routines. In 1947, after nearly 20 years of riding motordromes, Babbs acquired a globe and booked it with carnivals across the eastern United States, marketing himself as the ‚ÄúMan from Mars‚Äù, and on several occasions, he fell during the job and was almost killed, situations like this were not as frequent while he rode the motordrome. Despite arguments between both parties over which is more dangerous for the performer, because of the visual obstruction created by the lattice and the distance at which the audience usually viewed, the presentation of the globe is more limited than that of the motordrome. Some performers found themselves in a situation like George ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù Thibeault who was a motordrome operator and performer in the Boston area but acquired a Globe of Death in 1966. While searching for places to perform his newfound attraction, he found that some carnivals were reluctant to sign such an attraction when they already had a motordrome. Thus, instead, he performed at shopping center promotions, stock car races, and other fundraisers.  Notable accidents  The Globe of Death, as its name implies, is a very dangerous stunt. There have been many accidents involving this act. Some have occurred due to the globe breaking or otherwise failing, causing the riders to lose control and crash. Others have been due to rider error. Some recent incidents are listed below: May 24, 2014: Five motorcyclists were injured when performing stunts in the \\"Globe of Death\\", during a function in Circus Rhodes in Argentina. They were injured when the roof of the globe burst, sparking a multiple collision. One of the riders suffered a broken clavicle and others had burns and minor injuries from the motorcycles. May 25, 2015: Two motorcycle riders crashed in midair while performing the stunt at Uncle Sam's Great American Circus in Chantry Park, Ipswich, England. One rider sustained head injuries while the other was injured in the leg and upper body, but both riders recovered without any permanent injuries. April 6, 2015: Three riders collided and crashed to the ground while performing at the Jordan World Circus at the Washington State Fair in Puyallup, Washington. One motorcyclist suffered a broken leg and another a broken rib. July 7, 2015: Stunt riders from the Great Moscow Circus crashed while performing the Globe of Death at Munro Martin Park in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Six riders were reported injured, with two suffering arm fractures with one also reporting neck tenderness. December 9, 2016: In Colombia, stunt rider Cristian Camilo Hern√°ndez S√°enz was killed while riding with three other riders. The 20-year- old performer fell and later died in hospital, apparently of an internal hemorrhage.

She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement while Bacon's The New Atlantis portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians.

This had been his boyhood home in London next to the Queen's York Place before the Bacon family had moved to Gorhambury in the countryside. After Lord Egerton (Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England) died, it became available for Bacon to lease. During the next four years, this mansion on the Strand (so large that it had 40 fireplaces) served as the home for Francis and Alice Bacon. Over the next four years, Bacon would host banquets at York House that were attended by the leading men of the time, including poets, scholars, authors, scientists, lawyers, diplomats, and foreign dignitaries. Within the banquet hall, Francis gathered the greatest leaders in literature, art, law, education, and social reform. On 22 January 1621, in honour of Sir Francis Bacon's sixtieth birthday, a select group of men assembled in the large banquet hall in York House without fanfare for what has been described as a Masonic banquet.Helene H. Armstrong, Francis Bacon - The Spear Shaker, San Francisco, California: Golden Gate Press, 1985 This banquet was to pay tribute to Sir Francis Bacon. Only those of the Rosicrosse (Rosicrucians) and the Masons who were already aware of Bacon's leadership role were invited.Alfred Dodd, Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story', Volume 2 - The Age of James, England: Rider & Co., 1949, 1986. pages 157 - 158, 425, 502 - 503, 518 - 532 The tables were T-tables with gleaming white drapery, silver, and decorations of flowers. The poet Ben Jonson, a long-time friend of Bacon, gave a Masonic ode to Bacon that day. There was a depth of love by a large body of men toward Bacon, similar to some degree in the manner that disciples love a Master.Helen Veale, Son of England, India: Indo Polish Library, 1950 This is especially true when taking into account his membership (and some say leadership) of secret societies such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. In the inner esoteric membership, which included Francis Bacon, vows of celibacy for spiritual reasons were encouraged.Peter Dawkins, Dedication to the Light, England: Francis Bacon Research Trust, 1984Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1964 Faked death theory Various authorsMrs. Henry Pott Francis Bacon and His Secret Society, (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997)William T. Smedley Mystery of Francis Bacon, London, 1912 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) have written that there were indications that Francis Bacon had gone into debt while secretly funding the publishing of materials for the Freemasons, Rosicrucians, \\"Spear-Shakers\\", \\"Knights of the Helmet\\", as well as publishing, with the assistance of Ben Jonson, a selection of the plays that they believe he had written under the pen name of \\"Shake-Speare\\" in a \\"First Folio\\" in 1623.C.

The shores, like those of Ombla, are populated with a great many stone homes and former summer palaces that are surrounded by cultivated grounds. Starting in December, 1910, Gru≈æ was the terminus point for the now defunct Dubrovnik tramhttp://www.inet.hr/~dfejzagi/povijest.htm that ceased running in 1970 following a deadly accident where the tram slipped off its rails and landed in the park in front of Pile Gate.http://www.inet.hr/~dfejzagi/p5.htm The line has since been replaced by bus routes. Located in a naturally protected bay, the port was used an Austro-Hungarian naval facility until the end of 1918 and today is able to accommodate large passenger cruise ships. Ferries run from the port to the Elaphiti Islands and Mljet regularly. There is also a customs building for ferries that are international arrivals, specifically from Bari. Gru≈æ sits right at the entrance to Port Ombla. It is directly across the water from Cantafigo point, which lacks anchorage points due to the shores and the bottom of the inlet being immersed by banks of mud, deposited during heavy rains.

Pittman was the CEO of MTV Networks and the cofounder and programmer who led the team that created MTV. Pittman joined the predecessor company Clear Channel in November 2010 as an investor and the company‚Äôs Chairman of Media and Entertainment Platforms, was named CEO in 2011 and Chairman in 2013. Clear Channel became iHeartMedia, Inc. in September 2014 to reflect its new multiplatform business. Pittman has also been the former Chairman and CEO of Clear Channel Outdoor, CEO of AOL Networks, Six Flags Theme Parks, Quantum Media, Century 21 Real Estate and Time Warner Enterprises, and COO of America Online, Inc. and AOL Time Warner. Pittman has also been a radio and TV programmer, marketer, investor and media entrepreneur who has had multiple careers in a number of consumer-focused industries. According to Sean Parker, Pittman is the only media mogul who‚Äôs genuinely an entrepreneur. In giving him its first 'Media Visionary\\" award, advertising publication Adweek referred to him as a \\"jack of all media\\" and former MTV executive Tom Freston referred to him as \\"the wonder boy of branding.\\" Biography=Early life= Son of a Methodist minister, Pittman was born in Jackson, Mississippi, but raised in Hattiesburg and Brookhaven where he attended Brookhaven High School and became a radio announcer at the age of 15 to earn money for flying lessons. He was an announcer in a number of cities and then successfully programmed radio stations in Pittsburgh, Chicago (WMAQ AM 670 and WKQX FM) and finally at the NBC flagship station, WNBC (AM), in New York when he was 23 years old. He also produced and co-hosted a music video and news show in 1978 that ran on NBC's O&O; Television stations. He did learn to fly and has been a pilot for almost 40 years: He now has over 6,000 flight hours; currently holds an Airline Transport Pilot's license for airplanes; and is rated for helicopters and 3 types of jets. =MTV Years= At MTV, he oversaw the creation and growth of MTV and the transition of Nickelodeon from a failing network geared to preschoolers to the highest-rated channel aimed at older kids as well as overseeing the launches of VH-1 and Nick at Nite, and led the initial public offering for MTV Networks and its expansion into international markets. Under Pittman's leadership, MTV became the first profitable cable network; then-Time Warner Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ross also noted that MTV became the most profitable basic cable network during Pittman's tenure there. During his tenure at MTV, the network was criticized harshly for its initial reluctance to play videos from African American artists.. For his development of the MTV brand, Advertising Age selected Pittman in 2010 as one of the ten most influential marketers who transformed American Culture. =Quantum Media and Time Warner= After MTV, Pittman founded Quantum Media with MCA (one of the company's ventures was the Morton Downey Jr. show, an early television shock talk show), and in 1989, he bought out MCA, sold the assets to Warner Communications and became senior advisor to Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross just as Warner was merging with Time Inc. to create Time Warner. In 1990, Pittman was appointed President and CEO of Time Warner Enterprises, the new business group of Time Warner, and in 1991 became Chairman and CEO of Six Flags Theme Parks where his team oversaw the revitalization of the Six Flags brand, taking attendance from 17 million to 25 million using a ‚Äúclassic second-place strategy‚Äù with their ‚ÄúBigger than Disneyland, closer to home‚Äù positioning of the brand. =Century 21 Real Estate= After Pittman led a process that led to Time Warner selling a controlling interest in Six Flags to Boston Ventures in 1995, he left to join Century 21 Real Estate as CEO. Pittman and his team grew Century 21 Real Estate through a strategy that included brand-building and national marketing, a new franchise sales organization, and the early adoption of the Internet as a lead-generating tool. =America Online and AOL Time Warner= While at Century 21, Pittman met Steve Case and joined the board of directors of America Online, Inc.; he joined the company as President and CEO of AOL Networks in 1996 and later became President and COO of America Online Inc. While at AOL, Pittman led the operating team that moved AOL from 6 million members to over 30 million; took the company profitable; and continued the mission of making the Internet as easy for consumers to use as the telephone or television. During Pittman's tenure, AOL had almost 50% of all Internet traffic in the U.S. and pioneered the development of digital advertising. The company‚Äôs most memorable ad of that time had the tagline ‚ÄúAmerica Online: So easy to use, no wonder it‚Äôs number one‚Äù. After AOL merged with Time Warner in 2001, Pittman became the Co-COO (and eventually COO) of the combined AOL Time Warner before leaving the company in 2002. =Pilot Group= Pittman joined a number of his longtime operating team colleagues when he co-founded Pilot Group LLC, a private investment firm based New York in 2003. Pilot Group previously owned and sold investments including Thrillist, which is now part of Group Nine and in which Pilot Group is still a minority investor; DailyCandy, sold to Comcast Ventures for a reported $125 million; IdealBite, which was sold to the Walt Disney Company; and entertainment research company OTX (sold to Ipsos America). Pilot also owned and sold significant minority investments in David's Bridal and Nutrisystem, and owned and sold the Barrington Broadcasting television group to Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013 for $370 million and its radio station group Double O Radio to a variety of regional radio station groups including Town Square Media. Pilot and Pittman have also held various minority positions in digital content and technology venture companies including social gaming company Zynga, in which Pilot was an early investor; Huffington Post and Facebook. In April 2018, Pilot Group sold its stake in Casa Dragones Tequila to BDT Capital Partners LLC ‚Äî Warren Buffett's banker -- which is taking the lead investor role and providing capital to take Casa Dragones to the next level -- although Pittman, as the co-founder, maintained his personal stake and remains on the board. =Clear Channel Media Holdings, Inc. and iHeartMedia, Inc. = In November 2010, Pittman took on the role of Chairman of Media and Entertainment Platforms for Clear Channel, and made a personal equity investment in the Company. In this role, Pittman worked to leverage the Company's media assets and spearhead the further development of a digital strategy for Clear Channel Radio, particularly with regard to its iHeartRadio digital radio platform. At this time, the company was burdened with $20 billion in debt as the result of a 2008 leveraged buyout. In September 2014, the company transformed to iHeartMedia, Inc. to better reflect the company's multi-platform focus. Today Pittman is Chairman and CEO of iHeartMedia, Inc., with multi-platform assets across broadcast radio; digital; podcasting; mobile; social; outdoor; data; and live events. Under Pittman's leadership the company's debt was significantly reduced -- from $16.1 billion to $5.75 billion -- and the company emerged from restructuring in May 2019. At that time, T. Rowe Price referenced the company as one that had been revived by disruptive change. iHeartMedia, Inc. is now the No. 1 commercial podcast publisher globally, and in October 2018 closed its acquisition of podcasting pioneer Stuff Media, LLC, the leading for-profit publisher of entertaining and informative podcast content, which includes the HowStuffWorks (HSW) brand and content. Pittman played a pivotal role in developing the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the biggest live concert festival in radio history, the first of which took place in Las Vegas on September 23‚Äì24, 2011 in conjunction with the launch of the New iHeartRadio. The company has since expanded its national tentpole live events platform to include the nationally televised iHeartRadio Music Awards; the iHeartRadio Country Festival; iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina; the iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party; and the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour. In December 2016, the company launched its two new on demand subscription platforms, iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access. In conjunction with this position, Pittman also maintains his role as Founding Member of Pilot Group and continues his activities as a venture investor; in an indication of his continued interest in emerging technologies and businesses, he also serves on the board of live social video company Airtime. With his return to radio, Huffington Post‚Äôs media business expert Charles Warner dubbed him ‚Äúbest radio programmer ever‚Äù and in 2011 he was ranked by Radio Ink magazine as the \\"Most Powerful Man in Radio.\\" \\"Never before has anyone taken the number one slot on the list in their inaugural year,\\" stated Radio Ink Publisher/CEO B. Eric Rhoads. Pittman retained that designation in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and was also named Radio Ink's 2019 Radio Executive of the Year. =Recent years= Pittman is a philanthropist, building community and philanthropic projects into businesses he managed from Live Aid at MTV to educational efforts using the Internet at AOL. He is former chairman of the non-profit Robin Hood Foundation, which fights poverty in New York City, and still serves on the board; and is former chairman of the New York Public Theater. He is also on the boards of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and is a former board member of the non-profit Lupus Research Alliance, the New York City Ballet and NYU Medical Center. Pittman has also served on the boards of companies including Electronic Arts, Atari Games, Excite, 3DO, MTV Networks, America Online, HFS/Cendant/Realogy and AOL Time Warner. Pittman is one of the minority owners of the New York Mets, holding a 4% stake in the baseball team. =Awards and honors= Pittman's many honors include: Robert F. Kennedy Memorial‚Äôs 2000 ‚ÄúRipple of Hope Award‚Äù for his commitment to civic and community affairs and his contributions to the advancement of education; receiving the Broadcasters Foundation of America's 2016 'Golden Mike Award'; induction into the Advertising Hall of Fame and the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame; received AdWeek's first Media Visionary award in 2013 and Cablevision Magazine's \\"20/20 Vision\\" award for the 20 people who have had the greatest impact on the cable industry; selection as one of Advertising Age's \\"10 Marketers Who Changed American Culture‚Äù and \\"50 Pioneers and Visionaries of TV\\" and recognition as one of Business Week magazine's Top 25 Executives of 1998. He was also named one of Life Magazine's \\"Five Original Thinkers of the '80s\\"; recognized as the eighth of Life Magazine's \\"50 Most Influential Boomers\\"; included in Time Magazine's 1984 Man-of-the-Year issue \\"Seven Others who Succeeded\\"; received the \\"Star of Hope Award‚Äù in January 2014 from the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi; was named Success Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúPioneer of the New American Start-Up‚Äù in 1989; received the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence and the 1984 Council of Fashion Designers of America award; Performance Magazine‚Äôs 1982 ‚ÄúInnovator of the Year‚Äù award for his work developing MTV and Billboard Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúRadio Program Manager of the Year‚Äù in 1977.

The taxon has approximately forty species, including some flightless species. BayScience Foundation, Inc. Adults Although some Agrotis species occur at very high altitudes in Hawaii and female Agrotis from New Zealand are sometimes brachypterous, brachyptery in both sexes of Lepidoptera species is rare and is usually limited to wind-battered habitats, often southern oceanic islands and sparsely vegetated areas where the moths locomote by jumping. Thyrocopa includes the only species of flightless alpine moth in the Hawaiian Islands. Having studied males and females of two different species (Thyrocopa apatela and Thyrocopa kikaelekea), researchers at University of California, Berkeley concluded that they had not evolved from a flightless common ancestor nor had they dispersed to new habitats after becoming flightless. Rather, each was descended from a flying ancestor but had separately undergone wing reduction and evolved flightlessness in a case of parallel evolution occurring in less than 1 million years. The adaptation is thought to be a response to specific environmental pressures such as scattered food resources, lack of predation, high winds, and low temperatures that elicit loss of flight. Their hypothesis is supported by both molecular and morphological evidence. Entomological Society of America Larvae An entomologist at the University of Bristol described most larvae of this genus as generalist feeders that eat decaying leaf tissue and generally hide in webby frass structures they make themselves. The larva of an undescribed species has a slightly different appearance from the generalist species and seems to be a specialist borer in Broussaisia arguta, a perennial native-Hawaiian relative of the hydrangea. At 20 ¬∞C in the laboratory, specimens stayed larvae for 2‚Äì20 weeks and remained in pupa form for 2-8, a range in development time indicative of a number of species being kept together in the study. The larvae have been collected on a wide variety of host plants (most of them endemic to Hawaii) including maile (Alyxia oliviformis), painiu (Astelia argyrocoma), ƒÅk≈çlea (Athyrium microphyllum), Carex spp., lapalapa (Cheirodendron platyphyllum), pilo (Coprosma elliptica), koi (Coprosma kauensis), ukiuki (Dianella sandwicensis), uluhe (Dicranopteris linearis), Dryopteris spp., naenae ula (Dubautia raillardioides), Elaphoglossum spp., manono (Hedyotis terminalis), kakaemoa (Melicope clusiifolia), ≈çhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), k≈çlea (Myrsine punctata), k≈çpiko (Psychotria spp.), sawtooth blackberry (Rubus argutus), hoi kuahiwi (Smilax melastomifolia), p≈´kiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), and ohelo kau laau (Vaccinium calycinum).

It served on nearly all the fronts in the European Theatre where the German Luftwaffe operated. KG 54 was formed in May 1939. The bomber wing was equipped with two of the major German medium bomber types; the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. It was given the insignia of a human skull and crossbones, with the bones significantly crossed behind the skull. This insignia for the entire bomber wing was sometimes displayed on a shield-like device, but more often depicted over a normal camouflage pattern. It bore a strikingly close graphic resemblance to that of the 3rd SS Panzer Division, known as the \\"Death's Head Division\\". The Totenkopf motif was inspired by the Braunschweiger Black Hussars.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 177. KG 54 began its first campaign in September 1939 when German forces invaded Poland, which began World War II. It spent the Phoney War resting and refitting though it did carry out leaflet-dropping over France. In April 1940, briefly supported the Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasions of Denmark and Norway. In May 1940, played a critical and controversial role in Fall Gelb, the German offensive into Western Europe. On 14 May 1940, as the Battle of the Netherlands reached a climax, KG 54 carried out the Rotterdam Blitz, which destroyed the centre of the city and killed many civilians. The attack played a role in the surrender of the Dutch Army.Buckley 1999, p. 129. KG 54 continued to support German forces in the Battle of Belgium and Battle of France through to the surrender of the latter in June 1940. From July 1940 it fought in the Battle of Britain sustaining considerable losses and thereafter in The Blitz. also provided tertiary support to the Kriegsmarine, German Navy, the Battle of the Atlantic. From June 1941 to October 1942 it fought on the Eastern Front after Operation Barbarossa and the invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1943 it served in the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of war. fought on the Italian Front and participated in Operation Steinbock over England. It supported German forces in the night intruder role over the beachheads in June 1944 and served on the Western Front until October 1944, when the last of its bomber groups was disbanded. Some were converted into fighter groups, and continued to operate into 1945. KG 54's attack on Rotterdam in May 1940 has occasioned accusations of war crimes but no criminal charges were ever filed against the wing's officers or any senior officer commander at corps or air fleet level. The bombing was discussed at the Nuremberg trials in relation to the conduct of senior Luftwaffe commanders, particularly Hermann G√∂ring, commander in chief of the Luftwaffe and Albert Kesselring, commander of Luftflotte 2, to which KG 54 was attached.Air Power History, Volumes 44-45, p. 71. The decision to bomb the city remains controversial. The Dutch decision not to declare Rotterdam an open city played a part in the attack. Although KG 54 was used as an offensive tool supporting a war of aggression, the city was a combat zone and the bombing did not violate the then valid Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1907.Boog, Krebs, Vogel 2006, p. 362. History Kampfgeschwader 54 was formed on 1 May 1939 at Fritzlar by reforming Stab./KG 254. The new Geschwader (wing) was placed under the command of Luftflotte 3. Oberst Walter Lackner became KG 54's first Geschwaderkommodore. The medium bomber unit was allotted the Heinkel He 111. I Gruppe was created the same day at Fritzlar with the He 111P. The late creation of KG 54 necessitated intensive training in the spring and summer 1939. I./KG 54 was placed under the command of Gruppenkommandeur Major Otto H√∂hne. The Gruppe undertook long-range flights at high altitudes for crews to gain experience. Flights were made to Seville, Spain and Tripoli in Libya.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 178.Radtke 1990, p. 14, 19‚Äì22. II Gruppe was not formed until 15 December 1939 near Hoya, southeast of Bremen after the war had started. The group was formed from II./KG 28 and was handed the former's He 111Ps. It transferred from Hoya to Oldenburg for training in January 1940. It may have some contribution, or transfer of personnel to III./KG 54 prior to 1 February. The Gruppe was training under Luftflotte 2 during the winter and relocated to Celle in March 1940.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 183. III Gruppe was formed on 1 February 1940 at Wiener Neustadt, Austria. The He 111P was used to equip the group and received aircraft and crews from I. and II./KG 54 as well and crews from training programs. By mid-March the Gruppe was fully formed and was training at Celle from 18‚Äì31 March 1940, as Bissel 1‚Äì7 April, at Vechta from 8 April‚Äì16 May 1940. Part of the operational training exercise was to fly airborne leaflet propaganda over northeastern France. Major Adolf H√§ring was the group's first commanding officer.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 188. Wartime service=Poland, Denmark, Norway and the Phoney War= On 1 September 1939, Operation Weiss, the invasion of Poland, beginning the war in Europe. I./KG 54 was based at Fritzlar with 30 operational aircraft from 33. It was placed under the command of the 3rd Fliegerdivision, subordinated to Luftflotte 2. Only 2 Staffel participated in the invasion. Stab./KG 54 had eight of nine bombers operational but took no active role either. 2 staffel was moved to Seerappen, East Prussia on 8 September and to K√∂nigsberg sometime in September. It supported Army Group North, the advance to Warsaw (8‚Äì20 September), and the participated in the attacks on the city. On 10 September 1939 it was engaged in attacks on troop concentrations north of Praha, and bombed Polish Army forces east of Brze≈õƒá Litewski on 15 September as the Battle of Brze≈õƒá Litewski raged. The rest of the unit did not participate during the campaign. I./KG 54 was withdrawn on 20 September and put on standby in western Germany, in case of Western Allied attacks, which aside from a token advance into German territory, did not materialise. Poland capitulated in the first week of October 1939. II./KG 54 had been sitting idle since formation. It transferred to Celle and was put under the command of X. Fliegerkorps, which was in turn, subordinated to Luftflotte 2. The Gruppe began Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway, on the eleventh day. On 20 April 1940 it was hastily redeployed to Aalborg in northern Denmark. From here it flew armed reconnaissance in the battle for Namsos and Steinkjer. In Namsos fjord it attack to warships. The Royal New Zealand Navy sloop Auckland, the Royal Navy destroyer Nubian and cruiser Birmingham and Calcutta, plus the French Navy destroyers Bison and Foudroyant with the troopship Ville D'Alger, were present in the harbour this day. The following day, bombed the Trondheim to Steinkjer rail line. On 23 April II./KG 54 persisted with targeting rail links at Domb√•s-√Öndalsnes-Vaalebru. From 25 April‚Äì1 May 1940 it flew armed reconnaissance against rail communications in Central Norway. √Öndalsnes was subjected to two attacks on 27 and 28 April. The Gruppe also attacked Domb√•s railway station on 26 May, and retreating British forces at Namos on 1 May. II./KG 54 returned to Germany on 2 May 1940. I. and III./KG 54 spent the spring in training as the Phoney War continued. was sent to Albert Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 as reinforcement for Fall Gelb, the German western offensive. Kesselring was given KG 54 with LG 1 to act as support to Army Group B.Hooton 1994, p. 208. Stab./KG 54 was based at Quakenbr√ºck on 15 February 1940. It was here the Totenkopf of the Braunschweiger Black Hussars was chosen for the Geschwader motif. By May 1940, could muster three Gruppen and a stab unit. Stab./KG 54 had on strength six He 111Ps, with four operational, and a single He 111D, not operational at Quakenbr√ºck. It was subordinated to Albert Kesselring and Luftflotte 2. I./KG 54 was based at Quakenbr√ºck also. The Gruppe fielded 36 (33 operational) He 111Ps. II./KG 54 had 29 bombers with all but three operational at Varrelbusch. III./KG 54 was stationed at Cologne and Ostheim. It was given 35 bombers for the offensive and 27 were combat ready on A-Day, 10 May 1940.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, pp. 178, 183, 188. =France and the Low Countries= Operation Fall Gelb began on 9 May 1940, with preliminary minelaying operations beginning before midnight. was committed to the invasion of Belgium, in support of the German 6th Army. The immediate goal was to suppress enemy air power. I./KG 54 bombed the A√©ronautique Militaire Belge (Belgian Air Force ‚Äì A√©MI) air base at Antwerp-Deurne. A second operation was carried out and elements of it bombed ships in the Scheldt Estuary. II./KG 54 attacked Marck airfield and Calais harbour, the first operation carried out by KG 54 in the Battle of France. III./KG 54 carried out strikes against airfields at Courtrai, Belgium and Saint-Omer-en-Chauss√©e, France. III./KG 54 was intercepted by Royal Air Force (RAF) 607 Squadron which claimed three He 111s destroyed and another damaged over Roeselare‚ÄîGerman losses are unknown in this battle.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, pp 43‚Äì44. In the afternoon III./KG 54 bombed rail targets in the Ghent‚ÄìAntwerp‚ÄìBrussels area. The bombers were intercepted near Lille by 3, 85 and 607 Squadrons. 8 Staffel was suffered heavily, losing six He 111s. Staffelkapit√§n Fritz Stadelmayr was lost; two of his crew were killed, one was captured by the Belgians and two by the British.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, pp. 47, 49. This effort was part of an effort to achieve air superiority on the first day. On 10 May 47 French, 15 Belgian and 10 Dutch airfields were attacked. Despite claiming between 579 and 829 aircraft destroyed, only 210 were in fact eliminated. Most of this number were destroyed in the Low Countries by Kesselring's command. Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3, claimed 240 to 490 which was grossly inaccurate.Hooton 1994, pp. 240‚Äì241. III./KG 54 carried out interdiction operations along the Belgian and Dutch border on 11 May. II./KG 54 spent the 11‚Äì13 May attacking rail targets in the Ghent‚ÄìAntwerp‚ÄìBrussels area and bridges along the Franco and Belgian border. On 12 May it bombed the airfield at Het Zoute north of Brussels. I./KG 54 repeated operations along the Dutch and Belgian border on 11 May, rail targets in the Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp area on 12 May, and rail targets on the French and Belgian border on 13 May. The stab unit was also involved in bombing Belgian Army columns near Ghent and Brugge and ships near the coast on 10 May. It is known to have operated near Zandhoven on 11 May. III./KG 54 bombed Allied armour at Andenne and Hasselt on 13 May. The Stab./KG 54 suffered a rare loss when one of its number was shot down by 3 Squadron's Frank Reginald Carey.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, p. 76. KG 54 were also instrumental in driving the French 7th Army from the Moerdijk bridgeheads.Hooton 2007b, p. 51. Rotterdam's burning city centre after the bombing. On 14 May 1940, the Dutch Army, deprived or air cover, was still holding out. The Battle for The Hague had ended in a reverse for the Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger, commanded by Kurt Student. The Battle of Rotterdam was also still ongoing. A furious Hitler ordered Dutch resistance to be broken immediately. Hermann G√∂ring, who had factored the Netherlands into Fall Gelb because it offered airbases useful in a war against Great Britain, instructed Kesselring to bomb the city.Dupuy 1962, p. 21.Frieser 2005, p. 74. Rudolf Schmidt's XXXIX Corps were prepared to storm Rotterdam the next morning.Hooton 1994, p. 249. Surrender negotiations had already begun and Student radioed General der Flieger Richard Putzier to cancel the attack. When the message reached KG 54's command post, the Geschwaderkommodore Walter Lackner, was already approaching Rotterdam and his aircraft had reeled in their long-range aerials. Haze and smoke obscured the target; to ensure that Dutch defences were hit Lackner brought his formation down to 2,300 ft (700 m). The first group unloaded their bombs on the centre of Altstadt where it was thought Dutch artillery was concentrated.Jackson 1974, pp. 44‚Äì45. The larger formation came from the north-east, out of position to spot red flares launched from the south side of the city, and proceeded with their attack. Two Gruppen, II. and III., with 54 He 111s dropped low to release 97 tonnes (213,848 lb) of bombs, mostly in the heart of the city. Only Otto H√∂hne's I./KG 54 aborted the attack with his group.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 182. H√∂hne made wide detour to attack from the southwest. As the bombardier prepared to release the bombs, H√∂hne spotted a red flare near the Maas Island, and u-turned with his formation with their bombs still aboard.Jackson 1974, p. 45. The city centre was destroyed. Bombs struck vegetable oil storage tanks causing uncontrollable fires. Some 800 Dutch civilians were killed and 78,000 made homeless. Another source gives a figure of 814 deaths.Jackson 1974, p. 44. In the immediate aftermath, Rotterdam surrendered. Faced with air-dropped leaflets threatening the destruction of Utrecht, the Dutch surrendered on 15 May. I./KG 54 targeted rail junctions, bridges, troops in western Belgium and carried out these operations on 16 May near Brussels. II./KG 54 moved to G√ºtersloh on 17 May and began more interdiction of rail and road traffic west and south of Brussels. III./KG 54 concentrated on bridges in Belgium on 15 and 16 May. I./KG 54 extended its area of operations into France on 17 May when it bombed the train station at Valenciennes, and troop concentrations near Cambrai, attacking the city before transferring to Werl the same day. On 18 May I./KG 54 bombed Arras, Calais and Dunkirk, before battles began in those cities. III./KG 54 bombed Valenciennes station, Mauberge and Cambrai on 17 and 18 May. On the latter date, I. and II./KG 54 were escorted by I./ZG 26 which protected them from attacks by No. 111 Squadron RAF at a cost to themselves.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, p. 205. Beginning with 19 May, KG 54 sustained particularly high losses necessitating the entire wing's removal from the front line nine days later. KG 54 was ordered to support Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist and his 1st Panzer Army as it closed on the English Channel. The attacks were focused around Lens, Arras and Lille. By the end of the day, the wing was ordered to fly at dusk or night to avoid further losses prior to withdrawing to Cologne and Ostheim. Geschwaderkommodore Lackner was shot down and became a prisoner of war on the 19th and replaced by Oberstleutnant Otto H√∂hne. The bombers were escorted by II./ZG 26 and I./JG 27 but a large formation was intercepted by RAF 145 and 601 Squadrons over Cambrai.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, p. 266. KG 54 lost 14 bombers on 19 May because it was heavily committed. 4 staffel suffered the most, losing four bombers and 3 staffel lost another three, its commanding officer Hans Widmann survived. The losses were a severe blow to KG 54.Cull, Lander and Weiss 1999, pp 269‚Äì270. The German fighter units were able to claim 37 French and 24 British aircraft in their defence.Hooton 1997, p. 254. KG 4's wing insignia. From 20‚Äì26 May I Gruppe bombed airfields at Norrent-Fontes and St. Omer and French Army positions at Abbeville and Tournai. was also involved in the Battle of Dunkirk and Siege of Calais, with particularly heavy attacks on Dunkirk from 27 May‚Äì2 June. II Gruppe bombed Calais on 21 May, but focused on the northern flank, bombing ports and airfields from Zeebrugge to Calais. It intensified attacks on Dunkirk from 24 May‚Äì2 June losing six aircraft in that time. On 3 June it was withdrawn to Celle to rest and refit while crews also converted to the Junkers Ju 88. KG 54 sank the 8,000-ton French Navy steamer Aden on 27 May.Jackson 1974, p. 116. III./KG 54 also centred bombing operations over Dunkirk claiming a destroyer damaged on 1 June before transferring to Germany Adolf H√§ring was replaced as group commander Kurt Leonhardy. III./KG 54 was the only one of the three Gruppen to take part in Fall Rot, the final phase of the Battle for France. On 3 June 1940 it participated in Operation Paula, around Paris and supported the advance to the French capital which was captured on 14 June after being declared an open city. It then proceeded to support the advance into Normandy and Brittany from 5‚Äì19 June. It attacked troop and communication targets as well as airfields at Abbeville, St Omer and Norrent-Fontes from the 5‚Äì15 June in the Orl√©ans area on 16 June. By this time III./KG 54 was operating at the limits of its range, from bases in Germany, and were forced to stage to forward airfields in France to operate.Hooton 2007b, p. 87. By the time of the Armistice of 22 June 1940, III./KG 54 had lost nine aircraft, 12 men killed in action and one wounded in action. KG 54 lost 46 bombers. Human losses amounted to 130 personnel killed, 10 missing, 60 wounded and 188 as POW (some were later released). It dropped 409 tons of bombs in 1,200 sorties. 118 captured crew members were released.Hooton 1994, p. 267. =Battle of Britain and The Blitz= After the Armistice of 22 June 1940, the Luftwaffe settled into airfields along the French, Belgian and Dutch coasts. The British refusal to surrender or come to terms with Germany, precipitated Adolf Hitler's order for Operation Sealion, an amphibious invasion of Britain which was to take place after Luftwaffe had secured air superiority over the English Channel. The German Air Staff, Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL), was ordered by Hermann G√∂ring, to begin attacks on targets in southern England after the publication of his 30 June directive.Hooton 1997, p. 17. I. and II./KG 54 relocated to Coulommiers ‚Äì Voisins Aerodrome for the offensive over Britain. On 19 July III./KG 54 was disbanded with some crews going to night fighters. The group was reactivated on 1 September 1942. On 11 July IV.(Erg)/KG 54 was created at Lechfeld using some personnel from III./KG 54. Equipped with Ju 88As and He 111Ps the Staffel was renamed 10.(Erg)/54 to assist with the training of personnel. The previous day, the Luftwaffe had begun operations that were known to them as the Kanalkampf and escalated into the Battle of Britain. suffered its first combat losses, when it lost two Ju 88s, one destroyed and one damaged, to 609 Squadron near a convoy off Swanage.Mason 1969, p. 177. KG 54 attacked convoys Booty and Agent. Gruppenkommandeur of II./KG 54, Major Leonhardy was shot down and killed by 601 Squadron along with two others. Two I./KG 54 Ju 88s were shot down by 87 Squadron. Another of the group's Ju 88s was damaged by a night fighter.Mason 1969, pp. 226, 228‚Äì229. Leonhardy was replaced by Karl-Bernhard Schlaeger. On 13 August 1940, the Luftwaffe began an all-out attack on RAF Fighter Command. attacked the Fleet Air Arm base at Gosportde Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 179.RAF Croydonde Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 184.

At 05:00, 20 Junkers Ju 88s of I./KG 54 took off to bomb the Royal Aircraft Establishment's airfield at 'RAF Farnborough' (RAE Farnborough). At 05:05, 18 Ju 88s from II./KG 54 took off for RAF Odiham. At 05:50, 88 Junkers Ju 87s of StG 77 began heading for Portland Harbour. The raids were escorted by about 60 Bf 110s of ZG 2, and V./LG 1 and 173 Bf 109s from JG 27, JG 53 and JG 3, which all flew ahead of the bomber stream to clear the airspace of enemy fighters. StG 77's target was obscured by cloud, but KG 54 continued to their target. RAF fighters from RAF Northolt, RAF Tangmere and RAF Middle Wallop intercepted. Four Ju 88s and one Bf 109 from JG 2 was shot down. The German fighters claimed six RAF fighters and the bombers another 14. In reality, the bombers only damaged five. The Bf 109s destroyed only one and damaged another. Of the five RAF fighters damaged by the bombers, two were write-offs. Of the 20 claimed, just three fighters were lost and three pilots were wounded. None were killed.Bungay 2000, p. 208.MacKay 2001, p. 31.Mason 1969, pp. 236‚Äì240. Junkers Ju 88 of Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54) in France, November 1940 Further missions by II./KG 54 to RAF Croydon were cancelled. I./KG 54 struck at the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) base at Gosport. ZG 2 was supposed to provide escort during one these attacks, and in a breakdown of communications, arrived over the target without their Ju 88s, which had been ordered to stand down. One Bf 110 was shot down by No. 238 Squadron RAF. 40 Ju 88s of KG 54 attempted a feint against Portland to facilitate StG 77's attack. No. 152, 213 and 601 Squadron intercepted and disrupted the bomb run. Three defending Bf 110s were shot down.Mason 1969, pp. 238‚Äì239. KG 54 lost four Ju 88s destroyed and nine damaged on 13 August.Mason 1969, pp. 241‚Äì242. Two crashed in England.Parker 2013, p. 119. On the 18 August 1940 I. and II./KG 54 attacked Gosport with 25 Ju 88s, apparently without loss.Mason 1969, p. 278. Three days later I./KG 54 bombed the Abingdon aerodrome, II. Gruppe attacked shipping off the Isle of Wight and Southampton. First group lost one Ju 88 and II./KG 54 lost two in combat with 17 and 234 Squadron.Mason 1969, p. 290. II,/KG 54 bombed Portland, Weymouth and RAF Warmwell on 25 August.Mason 1969, p. 302. Both groups attack an aluminum factory at Banbury while II./KG 54 bombed airfields at Exeter and a troop training camp at Farnham. On 5/6 September 1940 I./KG 54 made single- aircraft attacks on Southampton, Brighton and Shoreham. II./KG 54 also bombed Southampton. On 6 September the battle over Fighter Commands airfields receded, and attrition had taken a toll of KG 54. First group had only 18 operational bombers from 30. II Gruppe had only 14 operational Ju 88s from 24. KG 54 then commenced the night Blitz against British cities. Both groups took part in the London Blitz on the night 7/8, 8/9 and 11/12 September. did not take part in the 15 September battle. On the night of 15/16 September it bombed the factory at Banbury again. From 17‚Äì30 September KG 54 too part in nightly attacks on London. KG 54 was consistently bombed the British capital until May 1941, including the 20 April attack on Adolf Hitler's birthday in which 712 aircraft, the largest deployment of the month, began an enormous bombardment. It surpassed the 685 aircraft used on the 16/17 April attack, in which KG 54 was also present.Wakefield 1999, p. 130. It attacked the Rolls Royce plant at Crewe on 7 October but mainly supported the attacks on major industrial cities: the Plymouth Blitz, Southampton Blitz, Cardiff Blitz, Manchester Blitz, Liverpool Blitz, Coventry Blitz, Birmingham Blitz, Sheffield Blitz, Portsmouth Blitz, Glasgow Blitz, Manchester Blitz, Bristol Blitz, Hull Blitz and Belfast Blitz. On 29/30 May 1941, flew a last nuisance raid against Portland, which ended the wing's participation in operations over Britain for nearly two years. KG 54 also struck at towns alongside major industrial centres: Daventry, Rugby, White Waltham (possibly to attack White Waltham Airfield), Newton Abbott, Cropredy, Peterborough, Aylesbury, Selsey Bill, Leicester, Northampton, Oxford, Bournemouth, Brighton, Eastbourne, Aldershot, Birkenhead, Avonmouth, Greenock, Minehead, Newcastle upon Tyne, Yeovil, Warrington, Honington, Andover, Blackpool, Reading, Nottingham, Warmwell, Dartmouth, Holyhead, Shoreham, Dover, Torquay, Exmouth, Mullion, Falmouth, Andover, Bicester, Harwell, Boscombe Down and Swansea.Goss 2010, pp. 212‚Äì248. The unit lost 265 killed, 121 missing, 63 as POWs and 65 wounded as well as 62 aircraft during operations over Britain. A further 62 were damaged. I./KG 54 flew 1,189 missions, and lost 27 aircraft and another 27 damaged in July 1940 ‚Äì May 1941.

From October 1942 to February 1943 was heavily involved in convoy escort, anti-submarine warfare, and relentless attacks on Allied-held ports in Algeria, Libya and Tunisia as it attempted to overcome the effects of Operation Flax and Operation Retribution. I./KG 54 left Sicily for Piacenza from 22 December 1942 to 15 February 1943. It returned to Catania on 17 February and carried out 169 escort sorties for convoys in March 1943 as well as anti-shipping and attacks against harbours. On 5 March I./KG 54 and I./KG 77 attacked the convoys MW.22 and XT.4, sinking the steamer Yorba Linda (6,900 grt).Smith, Kindell and Bertke 2012, p. 67.

The last of the losses over African occurred on the 3 May 1943 when III./KG 54 lost two Ju 88s.Shores, Ring and Hess 1975, pp. 55, 57, 64, 219, 233, 235, 237, 259, 266, 303, 323, 332, 351 (I./KG 54); 76, 101, 114, 117, 132, 135, 154, 201, 271, 272, 353 (II./KG 54); 132, 42, 67, 71, 90, 101, 132, 156, 190, 214, 278, 282, 351, 362 (III./KG 54); 76 (IV./kg 54). III./KG 54 remained active for longer. It had only 8 operational Ju 88s from 21 on 10 April. The group attacked the landings resulting from Operation Corkscrew, on Pantelleria, on 11 June. It was the only group involved in fighting the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). It bombed the Allied landing forces by day and night before withdrawing to Foggia, Italy. On 6 September it contested the Allied invasion of Italy, bombing the landing forces at Salerno and attacking Allied landing forces in the Gulf of Naples, on 30 September, its last mission in Italy. From 30 September to 26 October 1943, it was inactive at Bergamo, where it rested and rebuilt until 31 March 1944.Radtke 1990, p. 188‚Äì193.

It began the offensive on 21/22 January 1944, and all Gruppen were involved in the first wave. That first night KG 54 lost four aircraft.Mackay 2011, pp. 98‚Äì105. On 3 and 4 February 1944 were involved in another attack on London. One of the 15 bombers lost that night belonged to KG 54. 2./KG 54, code B3+EK piloted by Unteroffizier Helmut Friedrich Weihs was discovered with its crew in the Zuiderzee in the 1970s when the Dutch Air Force drained the area.Mackay 2011, pp. 109‚Äì112. On 18/19 February KG 54 lost two bombers over their air bases from RAF night fighter intruders.Mackay 2011, pp. 134‚Äì138. On 20/21 February it lost another four.Mackay 2011, pp. 144‚Äì155.

I Gruppe lost 15 Ju 88s over the course of February and March. By 20 March it had only nine operational from 17. From 1 to 12 May it was ordered to √âvreux and Saint-Andr√©-de-l'Eure Airport to rest and refit. II./KG 54 had 14 from 19 operational on 20 March. On 25 April it was dissolved at Flensburg to form II./KG 66 which did not take place. I and III./KG 54 mined the sea lanes off Portland, Portsmouth. Torquay, Weymouth and Falmouth in April and May 1944. The Gruppen were rushed to Juvincourt Airfield on 6 June 1944, due to the Normandy landings. I./KG 54 operated against the British beachheads with Butterfly Bombs and mined the Orne and Vire estuaries on 7/8 June 1944. It mined the Seine bay on 8/9 June. I./KG 54 used fragmentation bombs against Arromanches and Lion-sur-Mer on 9/10 June.It bombed Sainte-M√®re-√âglise on 10/11 June and had lost 13 machines by the 11 June. It flew some air drop missions on 12 June, but until 18 flew attacks against invasion shipping using PC 1000s, BM 1000s, and LT 350s. Subordinated to IX Fliegerkorps, it had only nine combat ready aircraft from 16 on 15 June. On 26 June it was moved to Orl√©ans-Bricy to avoid Allied tactical aviation. It was moved to Eindhoven on 10 July and flew mainly mining operations from 25 July to 14 August 1944. It reported 13 bombers in July. It flew some long-range operations to support the German Army in the Battle of Saint-L√¥ on 27/28, and 29/30 July. From 4‚Äì10 August it flew support operations in the Avranches area to assist the 5th Panzer Army. From 11‚Äì19 August, the Gruppe flew attacks against Allied forces breaking out of Normandy (beginning with Operation Cobra) and more mining operations. It suffered 11 losses in August. I./KG 54 was withdrawn to Giebelstadt on 22 August and began conversion into a fighter group, to use the Messerschmitt Me 262A. It was redesignated I./KG (J) 54 on 1 October 1944. III./KG 54 carried out similar operations against the landings with withdrew to Eindhoven with I Gruppe. From 16 to 20 July if flew night attacks over Saint-Lo and in support of the German forces in the Battle of Caen. Over the 21 to 31 July it lost five aircraft in night operations. In August it flew mining operations over Le Havre and supported the 5th Panzer Division. On 15 August Allied air forces dropped 566 tons on the German base at Soesterberg but it did not effect the group. Another five bombers lost over Normandy in August brought bomber operations to a close. The group transferred to Neuburg by rail and was formally renamed III./KG (J) 54 on 1 October 1944.de Zeng, Stankey, Creek 2007, p. 190. =Jet operations= KG(J) 54 was close to full-strength in February 1945‚ÄîIII/KG(J) 54 never became operational. The Stabsschwarm and I Gruppe flew an intercept mission on 9 February 1945 with III/JG 7. Some 67 Messerschmitt Me 262s were sent to engage 1,296 US heavy bombers attacking viaducts, road and communication targets in Central Germany. The more experienced JG 7 pilots aggressively engaged the escorts, but the former bomber pilots of KG(J) 54 could only claim four bombers (at least one confirmed) from the US 447th Bombardment Group before losing five Me 262s to the 357th Fighter Group. Geschwaderkommodore Volprecht Riedesel Freiherr Zu Eisenbach was killed in a collision with a US fighter while the Stabsschwarm was destroyed.Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 270 Major Hansgeorg B√§tcher, replaced him. G√∂ring refused to accept the explanation that KG(J) 54s failure had been because the bomber pilots could not cope with the speed of the aircraft or react like fighter pilots. He proposed, that since the jets were to begin firing from 1,000 metres instead of 600; the flaws in his thinking were evident in the fact the fighters were lost to US escorts, not the bombers, and the muzzle velocity of the MK 108 cannon was too low to fire from that range, which necessitated the pilot to pitch up the nose at a steep angle to lob a few shells onto the target.Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 270 On 16 February III Gruppe lost 16 Me 262s on the ground as the US Eighth Air Force struck at airfields in the Munich area and the Regensburg factory. KG(J) 55 was hit harder, losing 23, and never became operational..Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 271 War crime allegations KG 54's attack on Rotterdam was subject to examination and debate at the Nuremberg Trials. G√∂ring and Kesselring both refused to take any responsibility for the attacks.Murray 1983, pp. 37‚Äì38. Richard Overy contends the attack, like the bombing of Warsaw, occurred because the Dutch Army refused to abandon the city or declare it an open city. Overy suggests that the possibility that the bombing took place because G√∂ring was attracted to the idea of displaying the ruthlessness of German military power to the World, but acknowledges that cannot, and has not, been proven.Overy 2013 G√∂ring was cross-examined on the issue on the third and last day of his testimony, in which he defended himself on a host of war crimes and crimes against humanity charges. He refused to accept culpability and argued he ordered the bombing because heavy fighting was occurring there. He also argued that the dynamics of modern warfare eclipsed the policies established at the Geneva and Hague conventions.Rice 1997, p. 66. At Nuremberg Prosecutor Maxwell Fyfe accused Kesselring of ordering the bombing as surrender negotiations were being carried out. Kesselring had admitted in a previous interrogation that the real purpose in bombing Rotterdam was to \\"present a firm attitude and secure an immediate peace\\" - in other words a war-winning attack. Kesselring denied using those words but admitted to having used the words \\"severe measures\\" to overcome Dutch resistance. When presented with evidence the negotiations had begun at 10:30 and the attack order had been given at 13:00, Kesselring replied that he was merely complying with Kurt Student's request and was unaware the Dutch intended to surrender.Goldensohn 2007, p. 325. The German official historians Horst Boog Gerhart Krebs and Detlef Vogel argued the city was a combat zone and the bombing did not violate the then valid Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1907. Otto Hohne, who was in command of I./KG 54 during the attack was also called on to testify and contended that because of the heavy smoke and haze which hung over the city, it had been something of a miracle that he saw the red signal flare and was able to abort the last phase of the bombing. All flying officers involved in the actual attack noted the dense smoke and haze which hung over the city before the bombing commenced. For his actions that day, Hohne earned the curious distinction of receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for calling off his last wave of bombers.Bekker, Luftwaffe War DiariesHohne, Glory Refused: The Memoirs of a Teenage Rocket Pilot of the Third Reich  Commanding officers  *Oberst Walter Lackner, 1 May 1939 ‚Äì 19 May 1940 (POW) *Oberstleutnant Otto H√∂hne, 22 June 1940 ‚Äì 23 November 1941 *Oberstleutnant Walter Marienfeld, 23 November 1941 ‚Äì 1 April 1943 *Oberstleutnant Volprecht Riedesel Freiherr zu Eisenbach, 1 April 1943 ‚Äì 27 February 1945 *Major Hansgeorg B√§tcher, 27 February 1945 ‚Äì 8 May 1945 ReferencesBibliography * Air Power History, Volumes 44‚Äì45, 1997. * Bergstrom, Christer (2007a).

Partnership The pipeline is operated by Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC, a partnership between Tallgrass Energy Partners, Phillips 66 and Sempra Energy. In February 2006, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Sempra Energy acquired Entrega Gas Pipeline Inc., from EnCana Corporation. In June 2006, ConocoPhillips acquired 24% of the project. ConocoPhillips spun off the downstream part of its business in May 2012. Environmental concerns The pipeline project has raised some environmental concerns. Ohio officials have asked to avoid crossing the Big Darby Creek in Pickaway County and the Little Miami River in Warren County within Caesar Creek State Park because of the risk of harming fish and other wildlife posed by drilling the pipeline beneath the rivers. A Lawsuit by American Energy Corporation was filed against REX over the disruption of coal mine owned by AEC beneath REX. In light of past pipeline accidents, where subsiding abandoned mines have caused pipelines to fail, the wisdom of the location of that part of the REX pipeline is of concern to pipeline industry critics.

It is considered the area with a large petroglyphs concentration. The art is embodied in many hills of the area known as the ‚ÄúProveedora‚Äù, an old copper mine. It remains impossible to establish their age, origin, meaning and all needed to know. Assumptions and deductions can be made, but there are no scientifically proven conclusions. For now these can only be admiring and imagining. The Trincheras culture site is located between two mountain massifs west of Caborca. It is the most spectacular sites with pre-Hispanic, as engravings practically cover the slopes of two hills. The number of petroglyphs is not known, there are thousands. There are a variety of motifs: animal groups, geometric designs, suns and moons astronomical representations of, bows, arrows, hunting scenes, etc. There is also an interesting diversity headdresses and head ornaments. Archeology in Sonora The Sonora archaeological heritage has a huge time depth, as demonstrated by evidence left by groups that 13,000 years ago populated this region. Towards northern Sinaloa and the coastal plains of the Fuerte, Mayo and Yaqui rivers, to the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental, developed the Huatabampo tradition, formed by communities that farmed cotton, corn, beans and pumpkin, by taking advantage of a large variety of coastal resources. Towards the east is the ‚ÄúSerrana Tradici√≥n‚Äù, on which after 1,000 A.D., changes in housing types are seen, these are built on surface, with walls resting on stone foundations. The best known site of this tradition is in Bavi√°cora, in the municipality with the same name. Towards the northeastern end of the state, in the river Bavispe, Bacerac, Huachinera and Sahuaripa basins, are communities very similar to prehispanic sites as Casas Grandes, although it seems to constitute a different tradition which might be termed Carretas. These little hierarchical settlement societies combined occupation of villages on river terraces with adobe houses in caves, possibly for winter use. Towards the Northwest of Sonora in the basins of the rivers Magdalena, Concepci√≥n, Imuris, altar and Cucurpe, there are trinchera culture communities, whose villages with hole houses became more numerous after 700 AD. Sonora has numerous sites with engraved or painted rock designs, the best known are ‚ÄúLa Proveedora‚Äù in the trinchera tradition region and ‚ÄúLa Pintada‚Äù, in the Central Coast area. The Site There are many animal shapes, mainly Pronghorn and bighorn sheep (typical of the region), almost always in herds and sometimes depicting pregnant bellies. There is a coyote figure, a bird of prey (eagle) type face and turtles. There are solitary human figures and family groups with man, woman and children clearly distinguished. The human silhouette is made with lines, round heads and elongated necks. Also are many geometric figures representing circular spirals or square, tribal and Suns figures. A very interesting figure representing a sea shell necklace, an ornamental element widely used by civilizations inhabiting the Gulf of California coast and also coincides with the commercial and cultural trade in the Trincheras culture. There are several scientific studies that some anthropologists and higher education institutions have made of the evidence of these ancient civilizations. Nonetheless, there are some contradictions and disagreements among some of the data -such as the age and meaning of these carvings- that do not allow us to make a reliable judgment about them. At a local level, however, those of us who live here and have very close and constant contact and personal experience with these drawings find it more comfortable, logical, and acceptable to give a simple and basic interpretation of the drawings, such as: goats, turtles, hunts, dances, moons, suns, directions, dates, and also artistic expression. Professor Manuel Jorge Gonz√°lez Montesinos from the University of Sonora has published a short easy to understand essay about the carvings. This work helps us sustain the following thesis: the region was inhabited by the Mogollon culture civilizations from the year 600 BC to 1400 AD.; by the Anasazi Culture from the year 100 BC., to 1450 AD.; by the Hohokam Culture from 300 BC., to 1400 AD., and also from 800 to 1200 AD. Settlers were hunter-gatherer desert people with agricultural knowledge; established important irrigation systems for maize cultivation; developed the ability to design and use solar calendars engraved in stone, which indicated the beginning of the seasons of the year. These three cultures established a large communications network and roads that allowed them to develop a far-reaching commercial, cultural and social trade agreements among them. Trade products were baskets and woven objects, ceramics, corn, ritual ornaments, turquoise, seashells, salt, and even knowhow and production technical. The Trincheras civilization is located in the village of Trincheras, Sonora, actually owes its name to the peculiar type of constructions, placed at different levels on the hill that is close to the village. It seems to be a center for gathering and trade used often by these ancient settlers; which is why it was inhabited almost permanently. The constructions in the shape of trenches, in addition to being the place of dwelling for the settlers -because of the security the height afforded and their design geared for defense- were also places for observation and the celebration of ritual ceremonies. Abundance of water during springtime due to the fact that the river was very near, made it a wise choice for long stays, as can be seen by plenty of indigenous tombs, remains of ceramic and stone artifacts that are found in the village's surrounding area. Studies made for dating these settlements have been made -among other methods- by the tree-ring dating method on tree trunks. It has been concluded that Trincheras, Sonora as well as Snaketown, Arizona (south of Phoenix) are contemporary, dating back to 800 and 1200A.D. It is probable that the site was a commercial trade center among the dwellers of the north and those from the south, this is evidenced by the discovery of quetzal feathers in native tombs of those days. This type of bird could only be found in places like Oaxaca hundreds of miles away on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico. These feathers were highly priced by the Anasazi as well as by the Hohokam. The Hohokam from southwest Arizona and northwest Sonora, constantly traveled to the sea to gather seashells and salt. The sites near Caborca which show traces of their passage and very probably flourished from the center of Trincheras, and it is almost certain that these sites were used only on temporary stays during those journeys to the sea. A great quantity of pieces of broken pots painted in the characteristic colors of those civilizations: red, ocher, purple, and brown can be easily found; seashells, grinding stones (Metate), axes, and other stone tools are not as easily found. Rock Art The figures carved on the rocks were made by direct percussion -very similar to chiseling- and they represent animals, human figures, frets, mazes, geometric shapes, heavenly bodies, and probably waves of the sea or aquatic symbols. The possible interpretations of these artistic manifestations made by the Hohokam could be any of the following: ritual scenes or ceremonies, retelling of a hunt, desert plants and animals, names of groups or tribes, calendars or dates, indicators of routes, changes in seasons or weather, or just plain art for its own sake. The Hohokam civilization probably declined because of illnesses or prolonged droughts that greatly reduced the tribal groups. But they definitely are the ancestors of the current inhabitants of the Tohono O'odham Nation (people of the desert) more commonly known as p√°pagos. Although it is well known that they do not like being given that name.

While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake-resistant construction is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts. According to building codes, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones. To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively stiff and strong. Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum. Trends and projects  Some of the new trends and/or projects in the field of earthquake engineering structures are presented. =Building materials= Based on studies in New Zealand, relating to Christchurch earthquakes, precast concrete designed and installed in accordance with modern codes performed well.Precast New Zealand Inc: Precast concrete and seismic issues According to the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, precast panel buildings had good durability during the earthquake in Armenia, compared to precast frame-panels. =Earthquake shelter= One Japanese construction company has developed a six-foot cubical shelter, presented as an alternative to earthquake-proofing an entire building. =Concurrent shake-table testing = Concurrent shake-table testing of two or more building models is a vivid, persuasive and effective way to validate earthquake engineering solutions experimentally. Thus, two wooden houses built before adoption of the 1981 Japanese Building Code were moved to E-Defense for testing (see both pictures aside). The left house was reinforced to enhance its seismic resistance, while the other one was not. These two models were set on E-Defense platform and tested simultaneously. =Combined vibration control solution= seismically retrofitted Municipal Services Building in Glendale, California Seismically retrofitted Municipal Services Building in Glendale Designed by architect Merrill W. Baird of Glendale, working in collaboration with A. C. Martin Architects of Los Angeles, the Municipal Services Building at 633 East Broadway, Glendale was completed in 1966. Prominently sited at the corner of East Broadway and Glendale Avenue, this civic building serves as a heraldic element of Glendale's civic center. In October 2004 Architectural Resources Group (ARG) was contracted by Nabih Youssef & Associates, Structural Engineers, to provide services regarding a historic resource assessment of the building due to a proposed seismic retrofit. In 2008, the Municipal Services Building of the City of Glendale, California was seismically retrofitted using an innovative combined vibration control solution: the existing elevated building foundation of the building was put on high damping rubber bearings. =Steel plate walls system= Coupled steel plate shear walls, SeattleThe Ritz-Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building engaging the advanced steel plate shear walls system, Los AngelesA steel plate shear wall (SPSW) consists of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system. When such infill plates occupy each level within a framed bay of a structure, they constitute a SPSW system.Kharrazi, M.H.K., 2005, \\"Rational Method for Analysis and Design of Steel Plate Walls,\\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, Whereas most earthquake resistant construction methods are adapted from older systems, SPSW was invented entirely to withstand seismic activity. SPSW behavior is analogous to a vertical plate girder cantilevered from its base. Similar to plate girders, the SPSW system optimizes component performance by taking advantage of the post-buckling behavior of the steel infill panels. The Ritz- Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building, a part of the LA Live development in Los Angeles, California, is the first building in Los Angeles that uses an advanced steel plate shear wall system to resist the lateral loads of strong earthquakes and winds. =Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is partially upgraded = The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear generating station in the world by net electrical power rating, happened to be near the epicenter of the strongest Mw 6.6 July 2007 Ch≈´etsu offshore earthquake. This initiated an extended shutdown for structural inspection which indicated that a greater earthquake-proofing was needed before operation could be resumed.Asahi.com. Quake exposes nuke-plant danger. July 18, 2007. On May 9, 2009, one unit (Unit 7) was restarted, after the seismic upgrades. The test run had to continue for 50 days. The plant had been completely shut down for almost 22 months following the earthquake. =Seismic test of seven-story building= A destructive earthquake struck a lone, wooden condominium in Japan. The experiment was webcast live on July 14, 2009 to yield insight on how to make wooden structures stronger and better able to withstand major earthquakes. The Miki shake at the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center is the capstone experiment of the four-year NEESWood project, which receives its primary support from the U.S. National Science Foundation Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program. \\"NEESWood aims to develop a new seismic design philosophy that will provide the necessary mechanisms to safely increase the height of wood-frame structures in active seismic zones of the United States, as well as mitigate earthquake damage to low-rise wood-frame structures,\\" said Rosowsky, Department of Civil Engineering at Texas A&M; University. This philosophy is based on the application of seismic damping systems for wooden buildings. The systems, which can be installed inside the walls of most wooden buildings, include strong metal frame, bracing and dampers filled with viscous fluid. =Superframe earthquake proof structure= The proposed system is composed of core walls, hat beams incorporated into the top level, outer columns and viscous dampers vertically installed between the tips of the hat beams and the outer columns. During an earthquake, the hat beams and outer columns act as outriggers and reduce the overturning moment in the core, and the installed dampers also reduce the moment and the lateral deflection of the structure. This innovative system can eliminate inner beams and inner columns on each floor, and thereby provide buildings with column-free floor space even in highly seismic regions.\\"A Survey on concepts of design and executing of Superframe RC Earthquake proof Structures\\" (2016) by Kiarash Khodabakhshi See also * Earthquake Baroque * Emergency management * Geotechnical engineering * Seismic response of landfill * Seismic retrofit * Tsunami-proof building References Building Building codes Earthquake engineering Seismic vibration control Structural engineering Sustainable building ","title":"Earthquake-resistant structures"},{"id":"18621297","text":"The Mississippi Blues Marathon is an annual marathon and half-marathon foot- race run in Jackson, Mississippi, United States.

The Helsinki harbour rail line () was a side rail track in Helsinki, Finland, built in the 1890s, and dismantled in 2009. Originally it led from the Helsinki Central railway station, via the city's coastline, to Katajanokka. Its original length was , but in its final stage, its length was only about . In the final phase the track had two level crossings and a railyard in the L√§nsisatama (West Harbour). Near the start of the track were the former VR warehouses. It was used only by trains going to the harbour and Hietalahti shipyard, but special request trains have also travelled the track. A view of a former railyard near Mary's Hospital in 2007, facing south. Early history and expansion to maximum extent Diesel engines were used to haul cargo from the harbour. The construction of the harbour rail began in 1891, although the first plans for the track had been made in 1870. The first train to Etel√§satama ran in December 1893 and the line was inaugurated in the next spring, on 8 April 1894, when it reached the old sales hall. The extension of the rails to Katajanokka was completed in September 1895. The length of the new track was and it included of side tracks. The track also included Finland's first, long, railway tunnel to Kaivopuisto, and the bridge under Mannerheimintie was Finland's first concrete bridge. Originally, the track began at Helsinki rail depot and warehouses, then ran under Heikinkatu (after Winter War called Mannerheimintie) and continued in a chasm to Ruoholahti. From Ruoholahti the track went via Hietalahti to Merisatama in the middle of Telakkakatu and from there onwards along the edge of Kaivopuisto to the tip of Katajanokka. It was then around long. There were five locations with sidings: Ruoholahti, L√§nsisatama, Merisatama, Etel√§satama and Katajanokka. Katajanokka, Etel√§satama and Merisatama were built when the line was built, the other two were built as L√§nsisatama developed later on. The track had a tunnel south of the Olympiaterminaali, and at the Market Square there were two turning bridges at the Cholera basin and at the Katajanokka canal, and one in Hietalahti. The first were without level crossings because of running in a chasm, but there were several level crossings between Ruoholahti and Katajanokka. The most famous level crossing was the one for pedestrians in Kaivopuisto. Two children were involved in a level crossing accident in May 1913 and died. For decades, even until 1980's, someone made crosses in the ballast sand between sleepers on the site of the accident. There are lots of preserved pictures of the crosses. It is not known to date who made the crosses. In the 1950s, it was possible that some week's last train, carrying a heavy load of coal cargo, was pulled from J√§tk√§saari to Pasila by two Vr3 engines, causing even the windows of Eduskuntatalo to shake and the chasm between the two parallel Rautatienkatu (Railway Street) streets to fill with black coal smoke. Even in the middle 1970s one could see the supervisor engine of the harbour in the middle of the Market Square going to fetch cargo cars from Katajanokka, or pushing a long line of cars over the Market Square turning bridge in either direction. The track did not have official stations or stops, because its main use was cargo traffic, passenger traffic was agreed separately each time, including a separate train sender; most of the time the place of agreement was in Katajanokka. The sidings in Merisatama before dismantling in 2007. The end of Etel√§satama branch After Etel√§satama was assigned solely to passenger traffic, the harbour cranes and the track were dismantled in 1972. When the Finnjet was built, there was a public presentation of a plan to put the harbour rail to passenger use in a similar way as in Turku, where passenger trains go to the harbour. These plans were not realised, as the first part of this line was dismantled from the front of the Finnjet terminal in Katajanokka in 1977. The cargo traffic to Katajanokka finally ended on 1 May 1980. The Etel√§satama branch was closed with a stop disc at the eastern end of Merisatama railyard, but the track leading to Etel√§satama remained in place, disused, for several years. The track to Katajanokka was dismantled by 1985, and in 1989 the turning bridge crossing the Katajanokka canal was replaced by a light traffic bridge. At the same time, the part of the track on the edge of Kaivopuisto was dismantled. The tunnel still exists, but Merisatama end of it has been filled in. The last passenger train to visit Katajanokka was a Dm9 unit, travelling on request. Despite the dismantling of the track from Merisatama onwards, a short spur of track has survived in the Market Square. Commemorating the track is a water supply crane in Katajanokka, adored with a memorial plaque. Also the swing bridge of Cholera basin is preserved. It is closed during winter and open all time during ice-free season. The end of Salmisaari and shipyard branches The part of the track leading from Ruoholahti to the Merisatama sidings, and the spur track from there to the Hietalahti shipyard, were in use until 2005. This track was lifted in July 2008. The swing bridge in Hietalahti has been preserved. It is open all time during ice-free season as the Hietalahti basin has a harbour for small craft. In 1925, there was also a side track from Ruoholahti to Salmisaari. It was used for cargo traffic for the Alko factories and the Nokia cable factory. These side tracks were dismantled from 1990 to 1993. Also the harbour tracks on the eastern edge of J√§tk√§saari were dismantled in the 1990s. The end of the rest of the harbour rail In the last years the harbour rail served only L√§nsisatama and consisted mostly of container traffic. The number of sidings near Mary's Hospital was reduced and during final years there was only one through track in use (see the picture above). The surviving part of the track was dismantled in May 2009, after the harbour facilities were moved from L√§nsisatama to the Vuosaari harbour. There were many plans for future use for the chasm between Pohjoinen Rautatienkatu and Etel√§inen Rautatienkatu (Northern Railway Street and Southern Railway Street). The chasm was included in plan of Helsinki Center Tunnel for vehicle traffic, but construction of the tunnel has been postponed. Other plans were a bicycle and pedestrian corridor or a light rail line. The line in Eira from shipyard junction to mainline junction remained in place until entire line was lifted. The rail path from Hietalahti to Eiranranta was for the most part converted to bike and pedestrian use and the site of former sidings in Merisatama has been turned into a park. It was used for boat winter storage before dismantling of last rails. Baana For the chasm, of the three plans, the bicycle and pedestrian alternative prevailed in the end. The modification to bike and pedestrian use took several years. The name Baana (Finnish slang word for (rail)way coming from Swedish bana and German Bahn) for the new route was obtained through a naming competition. Baana was opened to the public on Helsinki Day, 12 June 2012. Baana begins between Helsinki Music Centre and Kiasma. It runs to a new separated-grade vehicle/bicycle junction called L√§nsilinkki (Western Link) near former level crossing of Hietalahdenranta street with a total length of and an average depth of . There are several staircase exits for pedestrians and a sloped exit in Lepp√§suo for bikes. The pedestrian lane has chairs fixed to asphalt. In the wide part near Ruoholahdenkatu sports-related facilities have been provided for skateboarding and table tennis. Baana provides a speedy way to bike through western Helsinki downtown and adds to non-commercial space in heart of downtown. It has been very popular especially during prime biking season. There is a bike counter in Lepp√§suo district which shows bike count for today and for this year. It can also be viewed online. Baana chasm has been used for performances during annual festival Night of the Arts. Baana received a special mention in European Prize for Urban Public Space competition in 2014.

Agriculture Pig slaughter is an activity performed to obtain pig meat (pork). It regularly happens as part of traditional and intensive pig farming. Pigs are slaughtered at different ages. Generally they can be divided into piglets, which are 1.5 to 3 months old; the fattening pigs, intended for pork and bacon, which are 4 months to one year old; and finally the older pigs, such as sows (female pigs) and boars (uncastrated male pigs). The meat obtained from piglets is subdivided into more meaty or more fatty, determined by the thickness of bacon. Male hogs are usually castrated a month before slaughter. Their meat quality is determined on the mass of halves and the thickness of bacon on the back. The Humane Slaughter Association states that the transport of pigs to slaughter and all the other procedures and circumstances leading up to the actual act of stunning and killing the pig are, in modern times, often carefully arranged in order to avoid excessive suffering of animals, which both has a humane rationale as well as helping provide for a higher quality of meat.Humane Slaughter of Pigs , by the Humane Slaughter Association, United Kingdom Animal rights groups have recorded images of pigs being transported to slaughter in cramped and unhygienic conditions. They state that the transportation does cause suffering, which has economic rationale. Typically, pigs are first rendered unconscious using one of the following means: stunning using electric current applied with electrodes, or stunning using captive bolt pistol, and inhalation of CO2, then in some cases a .22 pistol/rifle which is shot directly into the brain. They are then hoisted on a rail, after which they are exsanguinated, usually via the carotid artery and the jugular vein. After the blood is gone, the carcass is drenched in hot water in a device called a pig scalder which helps in the removal of hair, which is subsequently completed by using scissor-like devices and then if necessary with a torch. However, in many countries across the world, rendering the pig unconscious is not standard practice and exsanguination occurs whilst the pigs are fully conscious. The pig is then eviscerated, the head is usually removed, and the body is cut into two-halves. The remaining halves are washed to remove any remaining blood, bacteria or remains of bone, and then cooled down in order to help with the process of cutting and deboning. In the European Union, the Regulation (EC) of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004 cover various aspects of hygiene of foodstuffs that includes pig slaughter.Food hygieneHygiene for food of animal originOfficial controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption European tradition The process of making a sausage in a traditional Hungarian household Pig slaughter is a tradition known in numerous European countries and regions: Albania, Bulgaria (–∫–æ–ª–µ–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∞—Å–µ, kolene na prase), North Macedonia (–∫–æ–ª–µ—ö–µ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∞—Å–µ, kolenje na prase), Croatia (kolinje), the Czech Republic (zabijaƒçka), Greece, Hungary (diszn√≥v√°g√°s), Italy (maialata), Moldova, Poland (≈õwiniobicie), Portugal (matan√ßa), Romania (tƒÉiatul porcului, Ignat), Russia, Serbia (see below), Slovakia (zab√≠jaƒçka), Slovenia (koline), Spain (matanza), Ukraine, Corsica and others. Family hog pens have also existed in the United States on small family farms, but in recent decades has become rare. =Traditional autumn activity= The slaughter traditionally takes place in the autumn and early winter, and the timing has several practical considerations. It can start as soon as it gets cold, as the cold is required as a natural method of preserving the relatively large quantities of meat during the butchering. Yet, because people often do the work in the open, it is preferable that the temperatures aren't too much below freezing during this time, hence the slaughter rarely extends into winter. Also, slaughter activities typically need to produce results before the Christmas season, to provide for the festive cuisine. In the past, this was also the only time of the year when people could afford to eat larger amounts of meat. In modern times, almost any family in Europe that is so inclined can afford to slaughter, yet there is also an abundance of pre-processed meat in the shops, so the traditional method of slaughtering is becoming more and more of a folk custom rather than a necessity. The slaughter requires numerous preparations, including troughs, large quantities of boiling water, large wooden barrels for storing meat, pots, sharp knives, and in modern times also artificial intestines (hoses for various sausages). Historically, butchering was a trade passed from father to son. Today the initial slaughter is normally performed by a professional butcher. After that, the meat is butchered by laymen, and the process is accompanied by various local rituals. =Act of slaughter and the butchering of carcass= Stirring of blood in order to prevent its coagulation. Collected blood will be further used. (Moravia, Czech Republic). Traditionally, the pig is slaughtered with a knife and then put in a wooden or a metal trough and showered with hot water to remove the hair. The pig is then removed from the trough and any remaining hair is removed with a knife or a razor, and then it is again washed with hot water. Today, the animal is rendered unconscious by electrical or carbon dioxide stunning and then immediately bled by cutting the throat. For quality reasons, mechanical means of stunning such as a captive bolt pistol are not recommended although in some abattoirs they do use it and the pigs are stunned using 80 volts.Humane Slaughter of Pigs , by the Humane Slaughter Association, England Then, the pig's intestines are removed. The evisceration process is when the sexual, digestive and excretory organs are removed. These days, the pig can also be obtained as a half (Croatian: polovica or polutka), without intestines or blood. In modern times, because of the danger of Trichinosis, people in some countries are required to have critical parts of the fresh meat tested by a veterinarian before any further contact with potentially infected meat. Very sharp knives and a cleaver are required for butchering. The carcass is cut into hams, shoulders, bacon sides, pork bellys, ham hocks, loins, pork chops, and other cuts of lesser importance. =Processing of animal parts= After it is cut into pieces, the meat from the animal is then processed further into edible products. The buttocks are salted and pressed in order to eventually produce ham. The ribcage meat is salted and smoked in order to get bacon. Salt is rubbed thoroughly into each piece of meat and all surfaces are covered. Some formulas also include much black pepper. The bulk of the meat is cut and ground to produce various sausages, which are traditionally wrapped into the intestines of various sizes. Schematic representation of the main pork cuts. The bulk of the fat is cut into small pieces. Some of it is fried to produce cracklings. Lard is made by rendering ‚Äì heating fragments of fat in a large iron pot over a fire until it is reduced to simmering grease which congeals when cooled. Lard is then stored in lard tins with tin covers. The typical tins in the US are five gallons. In some areas (mainly Eastern and Central Europe, but also Italy and United Kingdom), the fat is salted as is to produce salo, lardo or salt pork. The intestines are stripped by drawing them through a clenched fist. They are then washed, cut into short pieces, and fried to make chitlins. The various \\"leftovers\\" are put into various forms of headcheese jelly, etc. Most parts of the pig are used in this traditional process, even parts of the skin that would normally be thrown away are preserved to be cooked with beans. The smoke house is essential for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, bacon sides, and pork bellies. The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as hickory, beech, or cherry is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork. Country-specific statistics and customs Illustration of medieval pig stunning, from The Medieval Cookbook =Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia= The traditional pig slaughter in Croatia as well as the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia is a widespread practice that involves pig slaughtering, processing, and butchery of pig meat, and is observed by rural families, usually in late autumn. The tradition is variously called \\"koline\\", kolinje, pra≈°ƒáina, svinjokolj, svinjokolja or svinjokolje or posjek. The names literally mean \\"pig-slaughtering\\" (svinja=pig, n., klanje=slaughter, n.). It is a custom specific to the parts of the countries in the Pannonian plain. After WWII, in Yugoslavia, a state holiday fell on 29 November, with that and next day being non-working, so most slaughters were held on that occasion. In Croatian region Dalmatia, the pig-slaughter are traditionally done in period between Christmas and New Year's Eve. The entire duration of the slaughter can be as long as three days. Because people were traditionally stocking up on supplies before winter, it became customary to slaughter more than one pig, which increased the amount of time necessary for the meat to be processed. Some families visit their relatives (often grandparents) and friends at that time of the year, in order to help. Also, little mechanization is used, with meat being cut manually. Any grinding is done with relatively small manually operated, mechanical grinding machines. The traditionally produced ham (≈°unka), bacon (slanina), the sausages (kobasica) such as blood sausage (krvavica) and kulen are well known as delicacies. Some of them, notably kulen, are classified under the laws of protected designation of origin. The non-meat products such as cracklings (ƒçvarci) or ≈°vargl and hladetina are also respected as parts of traditional cuisine. To complement the activities, rakija or wine is drunk by participants during the butchering. The pig liver is customarily roasted the same day of the slaughter. Men and women were traditionally assigned different jobs during the slaughter. It was commonly the men who were doing the actual slaughter, the larger part of butchering, and the grinding of meat. Because the society is traditionally patriarchal, the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (washing and scrubbing), as well as the emptying the pigs' bowels in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat. The standard of hygiene long recommended by veterinarians has included various requirements for the people, tools and space used in the process. All people involved in the slaughter and butchering must be healthy, dressed with a hat, apron and boots, and clean hands. The tools (knives, axes, saws etc.) are sharpened, cleaned and disinfected before use, and they should be kept in a clean place throughout the process, preferably in a clean toolbox around the butcher's belt. The location of the killing needs to be a clean concrete surface with a sewer canal, meaning that the space can be easily cleaned. The trough used should have a zinced surface which is easy to clean and disinfect; the wooden troughs absorb water and microorganisms which makes them unsuitable. The Croatian Ministry of Agriculture has published rules on sanitation requirements for animal slaughter since 1992, animal waste disposal rules since 2003, while regulations from 2005 also cover animal welfare in relation to slaughter. These rules track the relevant European Union regulation. Croatian animal rights activists regard the traditional slaughtering process as cruel and outdated. They also question if European animal welfare and sanitary standards are really met, as there is not sufficient supervision available during the country-wide slaughter. Farmers are barely educated about the new standards they have to apply to, as this information is solely available through a website from the Ministry of Agriculture. The most vocal Croatian animal rights organization \\"Animal Friends Croatia\\" advocates banning the entire practice. In the process of Croatia's entry into the EU, there were widespread fears that new legislation would make svinjokolja as such illegal, forcing all pig slaughter to be conducted in controlled, inspected facilities. The fears were unwarranted because new regulation focused on stopping distribution of unhealthy meat products on the open market, rather than the traditional process where meat is consumed within household. Families check the meat for microbiological health and Trichinella = Czech Republic = Jitrnice, traditional part of the Czech national cuisine In some countries traditional pig slaughter is a special event. Pig slaughter in the Czech Republic has usually taken place during the winter months, when low temperatures make it easier to store fresh meat and meat products. Preparations for the event extended over a number of days and involved a variety of ceremonies. The event itself was accompanied by the making of traditional dishes such as jitrnice, tlaƒçenka and ≈°kvarky. After the slaughter, the young men of the village would visit neighbours and relatives bringing gifts of meat and fresh soup. The pig slaughter ended with what was called a karmina, a special celebration held in the household where the slaughter had taken place. Invited guests, sometimes dressed in masks, would join in the feasting and drinking. In the past, the traditional pig slaughters usually ended on Ash Wednesday. Traditional pig slaughters (zabijaƒçka) still (as of 2011) take place in public at Mardi Gras celebrations in many Czech towns and villages. However the domestic pig slaughter is a disappearing tradition. During the communist era it was cheaper and people preferred to raise and slaughter pigs at home. Many Bohemian and Moravian villagers worked in the JZD (collective farms) and it was easier for them to obtain the foodstuffs needed to fatten a pig. Since then pig raising and slaughtering has become less common in Czech villages and towns. It is also subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009 Jan B≈ôezina, Czech politician and MEP, commented that: \\"The discovery that in Romania the animals are not paralyzed before slaughter provoked a hysterical reaction on the part of the European institutions. The older member states have begun calling for more stringent European regulation. \\" (\\"Zji≈°tƒõn√≠, ≈æe se v Rumunsku zv√≠≈ôata p≈ôed por√°≈ækou neomraƒçuj√≠, vyvolalo na p≈Ødƒõ evropsk√Ωch instituc√≠ hysterickou reakci.

In the play Prase (The Pig, 1987), V√°clav Havel tries to buy a pig for a zabijaƒçka by local villagers, with difficulty because as a dissident he is considered politically suspect. In 1968, Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†eb√°nek, a founder of the J√°ra Cimrman Theatre, wrote the play The Pig Slaughter at Home. Toilet Horror. = Slovakia = In Slovakia, the pig slaughter (zab√≠jaƒçka, zak√°ƒæaƒçka, bravƒçovina, svinsk√Ω kar, karmina) was an essential part of the winter traditions from early medieval times. The pig slaughter was considered an important event in village society and an opportunity for families to get together. According to Katar√≠na N√°dask√° of the Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology at Comenius University in Bratislava, the traditional period for pig slaughters usually started on 21 December, the feast day of St. Thomas. There was a special magical importance attached to the date and farmers believed that the meat of a pig slaughtered on St. Thomas Day would last longer. A second traditional pig slaughtering period began around Mardi Gras. In the past there were a number of traditional customs associated with the pig slaughter. After the slaughter, the girls of the household would collect the bones and scatter them around the yard for love magic purposes. They believed that when a dog snatched the first bone, the girl who had thrown the bone would be the first one to marry.

The film, designed as a roughly one-and-a-half minute film trailer for YouTube but conceived as a 9-minute short, stars actors Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel. It was later adapted into a theatrical feature-length film titled This Is the End (2013) and fully released on its full-length counterpart's Blu-ray release. Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse follows fictionalized versions of the two actors who have shut themselves in their apartment and argue over their predicament during some unspecified end-of-the-world event.CinemaBlend.com: \\"Seth Rogen And Jay Baruchel Fight The Apocalypse\\"EmpireMovies.com Plot Seth and Jay are holed-up in a filthy cockroach-infested apartment while something terrible but unspecified is going on outside. After a series of trivial arguments it is decided that the need for water is such that one of them must go outside the heavily barricaded house to fix the supply - a job which requires going onto the roof. Jay reluctantly goes having accepted it's his turn. While he is on the roof having restored the water supply, an anxious Seth hears a shot from the pistol Jay was carrying. A bathroom window is broken from the outside and Seth's anxiety increases. Seth's shouts to Jay are met with silence as blood begins to flow through the faucet. Seth sits trembling on the floor, back to the wall, and clutching a table leg with nails through the end ready to defend himself against whatever is out there. Production Immediately after wrapping production on Knocked Up, Stone and Goldberg worked to turn around the short's script in only three weeks. Principal photography lasted for two days in September 2006, with one day of pick-ups in January 2007. Rachel Robb Kondrath, who co-produced the short with Stone, was also the production designer, and the few visual effects were provided by The Orphanage under co-founder Scott Stewart. After the trailer they put up on YouTube in June 2007 got over 50,000 hits in the first two weeks, Stone and Goldberg began shopping the project around. Variety reports that several production companies vied for the rights for production.Variety: \\"Rogen, Baruchel set for 'Apocalypse'\\" In October 2011, it was announced that there would be a feature film adaptation of the trailer titled This Is the End.

On October 1, 2013, Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse was finally released in full as a Blu-ray exclusive feature on the home video release on This Is the End. Reception The clip on YouTube which is the only publicly available footage from the film, bills itself as a trailer because when it was first posted the filmmakers intended to publicly screen the short at festivals. However, when the film was picked up by Mandate the short was shelved from festival consideration. This frustrated many fans who expected to see a feature closer to the 2007 release of the trailer online.Slashfilm: \\"The idea for the film began as an internet trailer...\\" ReferencesExternal links New York Magazine: \\"It's the End of the World As Seth Rogen Knows It\\" 2007 films English-language films 2007 short films American short films American buddy comedy films 2000s buddy comedy films 2007 comedy films ","title":"Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse"},{"id":"18621361","text":"Vulcana-Pandele is a commune in D√¢mbovi»õa County, Muntenia, Romania.

EPS; full legal name: Javno preduzeƒáe Elektroprivreda Srbije Beograd) is a state-owned electric utility power company with headquarters in Belgrade, Serbia. It was founded in 1991 and it has around 29,150 employees, making it the largest enterprise in the country. The company has an installed capacity of 7,326 MW and generates 36.461 TWh of electricity per year. Its installed capacity in lignite-fired thermal power plant is 4,390 MW, gas-fired and liquid fuel-fired combined heat and power plants is 336 MW, and hydro power plants is 2,936 MW. EPS also operates three power plants of total capacity 461 MW which are not in the ownership of the company. EPS is also the largest producer of lignite in Serbia operating in the Kolubara and Kostolac basins, producing around 37 million tonnes per year. History Ivanjica's 1911 HPP building Since 1870, the coal production has begun in Serbia. Fourteen years later, the first electric lighting in Serbia was furnished in the military office building in Kragujevac. On October 6, 1893, the first Serbian power plant in Belgrade started with the production of electricity. In 1900, the first alternating current hydroelectric power plant Pod gradom in U≈æice on the river ƒêetinja went online. This power plant is still operating. The first alternating current transmission line from hydroelectric power plant Vuƒçje to Leskovac, with the length of , went online three years later. In 1909, hydroelectric plants Gamzigrad in Zajeƒçar and Sveta Petka in Ni≈° began to build. Two years later, the hydroelectric power station on the river Moravica in Ivanjica was put in the operation. In Belgrade, the power plant Snaga i Svetlost was built in 1933, being one of the largest in the Balkans at that time. ;1945‚Äì1991 The establishment of the Elektriƒçno preduzeƒáe Srbije followed in 1945. Between 1947 and 1950, the hydroelectric power plant Sokolovica and coal power plants Mali Kostolac and Veliki Kostolac, the first power stations to be built in Serbia after the Second World War. In 1952, the underground mining of the coal field Kolubara had started. Four years later, coal power plant RB Kolubara went in operation. A year earlier, the hydroelectric power plants Vlasina and Zvornik have been connected to the power grid. In the period from 1960 to 1967, hydroelectric power plants Bistrica, Kokin Brod and Potpeƒá were under construction. In 1965, Zdru≈æeno elektroprivredno preduzeƒáe Srbije was founded. The coal-fired power plant Bajina Ba≈°ta began with the production of electricity a year later. The two largest power plants in Serbia, the hydroelectric power plant HPP ƒêerdap I at the Danube river and the coal power plant TENT, went into operation in 1970. Twelve years later, the pumped storage plant Bajina Ba≈°ta was built, and in 1990 the hydroelectric power station Pirot was put into operation. ;1991‚Äì2004 In 1991, the company was reorganized and changed name to Elektroprivreda Srbije. During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, many power plants have been severely damaged. With the establishment of the UNMIK administration in Kosovo on July 1, 1999, the company lost its access to the local coal mines and power plants, including Kosovo A and Kosovo B power plants. Since then, government-owned Elektroprivreda Srbija by political decision continued to pay off earnings to all of Kosovo-based EPS companies - EPS Surface Mining Kosovo, EPS TPP Kosovo and EPS Elektrokosmet. However, all these employees are not working in Kosovo-based power plants, and are only occasionally and indirectly employed by EPS throughout the rest of Serbia. As of May 2009, there was a total of around 7,000 such employees which were working only on paper and receive regular earnings. As of June 2017, that number was cut to 4,539 employees. ;2004‚Äì2013 Following the stabilization of the country after war, in 2004 EPS was again a member of the European interconnected system UCTE. Company operates in the current form since July 1, 2005. Then, the electric power transmission division of EPS was split from the company and established as its own public enterprise, named Elektromre≈æa Srbije (EMS). Since 2007, EPS has prepared plans for the construction of new power plants and the expansion of existing plants to increase generating capacity and meet growing consumption demand. ;2013‚Äìpresent EPS de facto holds a monopoly on the electricity market in Serbia. Since 1 January 2013, the Serbian electricity market has been open to other companies with the expectations to be completely liberalized in the coming years. Since then, EPS has continued with further reorganization for better company's effectiveness. In 2014, EPS was split into two subsidiaries - EPS Distribucija Belgrade and EPS Trgovanje Ljubljana. Market and financial data In 2011, company's total assets and the equity increased for nearly 100 percent.

He was an important Talmudic scholar and one of the earliest roshei yeshiva in America. Biography He entered the Volozhin yeshiva when he was only twelve years old, and remained there until its close in the winter of 1892. He then went to learn with his mentor, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, in Brisk for the next four years. It was Rav Chaim that referred to him as the Meitscheter Illui (Talmudic genius from Meitchet). Chaim Soloveitchik commented that in all his life, he had never come upon a genius of the measure of the Meitscheter. Polachek went on to become the rosh yeshiva in yeshivos in Lida and Bia≈Çystok. At the invitation of Rabbi Dr. Dov Revel, Polachek arrived in America in 1922 to become a rosh yeshiva at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) the rabbinical school of Yeshiva University and its Yeshiva College, America's first yeshiva.

Frequently people refer to the Korg MS-10 but this is a single oscillator monosynth. The DS-10 adds sync which the MS-20 is lacking. It was released on July 24, 2008 in Japan, October 10, 2008 in Europe, and November 4, 2008 in the United States. A newer, DSi compatible version, entitled KORG DS-10 Plus, was released in Japan on September 17, 2009 and in the United States on February 16, 2010. It doubles the number of synth and drum machines when played on DSi/3DS system. It also adds some minor new features for the standard DS. KORG iDS-10 for iPhone combines a virtual analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and drum machine, inspired by the design of the Nintendo DS-10.http://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_ids_10/ Instruments The DS-10 creates sound with two analogue synthesizer emulators, each with two Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (the Korg MS-10 had only one VCO). The VCOs feature a sawtooth, a pulse (with a non-modifiable pulse width), a triangle and a noise waveform. There is also a four-part drum machine that uses the same sound creation techniques as the synthesizers. The sounds made by each of the synthesizer emulators are modified using virtual knobs to change the value of standard synthesizer parameters such as cutoff frequency and waveform shape. Additionally there is a screen where users can patch certain parameters to be modified by an LFO, the envelope generator, or VCO2. Those new to Korg synthesizers may find the original Korg MS-10 Manuals useful in understanding the function of its components. Interface The user interface is mainly through the DS's touch screen with the cursors serving as a supplementary method of moving through the various interface screens. The primary method of navigating through interface screens is by switching the interface screen with the processing flow map and selecting which item to modify. Notes can be played using a 2 octave keyboard or through an interface that detects the X and Y position of the stylus on the touch pad simulating a KORG Kaoss Pad. The Kaoss Pad can also be used to modify volume and pan as well as being able to assign the X or Y values to any of the parameters that can be modified elsewhere. Users can record twenty-one sessions with sixteen different step patterns with either live input or through a step sequencer. These patterns can then either be selected live or sequenced with the song mode. Effects The DS-10 features a chorus, flanger and delay parameter that can be applied to each synth or the drum machine individually or as a whole. In addition, each of the editable drum sounds can have a separate effect added to it in addition to the global effect. Reception Reviews of KORG DS-10 have been generally positive, with 82/100 on Metacritic and 85% on GameRankings. IGN gave the tool the lowest score, saying that \\"it isn't standalone, full-fledged music software\\". However, other reviewers gave this tool very positive scores, citing that this software has great music-making potential. Devoted fans have set up dedicated communities centered on KORG DS-10. Legacy A follow-up title, Korg M01D, was released for Nintendo 3DS via the Nintendo eShop in Japan on July 2013 and November 7, 2013 in North America and Europe. The title features all the sounds from the Korg M1 and some of the sounds from the Korg 01/W. In 2014, the KORG DSN-12 was released for the 3DS, focusing on \\"the user creating their own unique synth sounds from scratch\\". It features a \\"3D oscilloscope screen\\" which lets the user visualize their sounds.

Mayer: King of Hollywood (1999) is a documentary film directed by F. Whitman Trecartin that takes a look at life of filmmaker Louis B. Mayer, who as head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios, came to rule over movie stars. The film takes a look at the personal price that Mayer paid for that success.  Film summary  Few Jewish immigrants have wielded the cultural power of Louis B. Mayer, head of America's largest cinematic factory before the days of television. \\"I have abundant reason to cherish the blessings of our democracy and to resist with all my strength any effort to undermine it,\\" Mayer said, as part of his testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.Hearings Regarding the Communist Infiltration of the Motion Picture Industry (1947) This was one of the few existing recordings of Mayer's own voice. Mayer rarely emerged from behind the carefully constructed wall of his studio. That studio defined what many consider to be Hollywood‚Äôs \\"Golden Age\\". While he is often remembered as the all-powerful sculptor of silver screen glitz and glamour, this film shows Mayer in a far more personal, and often unflattering, light. Through numerous photos and interviews with family and colleagues, we see the idiosyncrasies and insecurities of a very successful individual whose traditional family values drove the star system of Hollywood studios. Born in Russia, but raised within the Jewish immigrant enclave of Saint John, New Brunswick, in Canada, Mayer grew up believing that the father figure was the indisputable head of any family. Later, as general manager of MGM, he often played this patriarchal role to the hilt in order to control the lives and careers of stars like Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Spencer Tracy and Judy Garland. Mayer‚Äôs protective watch included building influence among political, religious, and military figures, while also getting police and newspapers to turn a blind eye to any scandals. \\"L.B. Mayer had some powerful friends,\\" recalls his grandson, Daniel Mayer Selznick, son of David O. Selznick and Irene Mayer Selznick, \\"When they say he looked after and protected you, this was a long, wide protective arm. Some people loved it. Some people hated it.\\" Those who chafed the most were his daughters, Edith and Irene. Despite his efforts to hinder them from becoming involved in the movie business, they rebelled and married film producers. Studio success and a hefty paycheck that made him \\"America‚Äôs highest paid employee\\" had changed the family forever. This irony was not lost on Mayer's father Jacob, a lover of Talmudic lore, who had once supported the family as a peddler. \\"God has made you treasurer,\\" the elder Mayer is said to have told his son. \\"Every family has one.\\" Maintaining his wealth was not as easy as viewers may have assumed. Mayer was only granted one-year contracts from MGM, with renewal based on his ability to judge the ever-changing tastes of the American viewing public. He was assisted by Irving Thalberg, a production specialist, whose intellectual leanings balanced Mayer's more populist tastes. Their collaboration helped produce the studio's most successful period. Mayer's final years at MGM were not happy ones. His divorce from his invalid wife, Margaret, and subsequent pursuit of younger women, irrevocably harmed his relationship with his children. In his 70s, he became increasingly out of touch with his audience. He was eventually forced out as studio chief after three decades. Despite all the turmoil, Louis B. Mayer has left a lasting legacy of MGM films. His greater achievement, however, may be that of a reminder to Jews and immigrants of the possibilities and the pitfalls that come with achieving the American dream.

Biography Hudson was born in the town of Sumrall, Mississippi, located approximately 15 miles from Hattiesburg. Prior to Blue Mountain, Hudson was in a band called The Hilltops, and Blue Mountain formed out of The Hilltops. Blue Mountain featured numerous drummers, most infamously Frank Coutch, and bassist/wife of Hudson, Laurie Stirratt. After the divorce of Hudson and Stirratt, Blue Mountain split, and Hudson embarked on a solo career that spawned three albums released on his and his cousin Chris Hudson's record label, Black Dog Records. The first album, The Phoenix was released in 2002. Though Hudson shows his country roots often, many of the tracks offer him showing his talent for the electric guitar, such as the track \\"Mad, Bad, & Dangerous\\". His second album, Cool Breeze released in 2004, finds Hudson once again using his guitar to show his talent. This album, however, has a more rustic feel to it. Those who are familiar with the area that Hudson grew up will know many of the places that he mentions in the songs. Cool Breeze is a very diverse album, with there being no way that you can pin any one sound to it. His 3rd solo album, the appropriately titled Bittersweet Blues, allows Hudson to strip away the electric guitar and record an exclusively acoustic album. Every song displays Hudson's amazing song writing talent and pure bluesy voice. From the opening \\"Snow in Mississippi\\", the album is a mature, addictive, rush of pure Mississippi music that engulfs your mind and captures your soul. As a songwriter, Hudson is possibly at the finest of his entire career on this album. The XM Radio hit, \\"Berlin Blues\\", is the ninth track on the record. In 2007, Hudson reunited with Blue Mountain, and he put his solo career on hold. He resides in his hometown of Sumrall, and can often be seen by the locals of nearby towns as he plays solo shows at some of the establishments in Hattiesburg. In 2008, Cary Hudson named one of the best in the Gibson magazine's list of Top 10 Alt.Country Guitarists of all time. In 2013, Blue Mountain once again dissolved and Hudson has now refocused on his solo output. He released Town and Country album in the summer of 2014 and continues to tour on his own.

The Barony of Aiket with its castle, lay within the old feudal bailiary of Cunninghame. The barony lands equate to the extant Parish of Dunlop, East Ayrshire, Scotland. Aiket castle Aiket House in the 19th century Aiket Castle itself was a four storeyed square tower typical of the residences of the lesser barons, originally surrounded by a moat and built by the Cunninghames soon after they acquired the land in 1479. Following the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton the castle was destroyed and then rebuilt, with an extension, in 1592. In 1734 the castle was sold and the new owners attempted to remodel the castle as a Georgian semi-classical mansion, removing the top storey in the process.Campbell, p. 115 The Dunlop family owned the building in the start of the 17th century and latterly it was used to house farm labourers.Coventry, Page 134 In 1957 the building was gutted by fire and was then restored to its pre-1734 condition by the present owners (2010). The restoration was awarded a Diploma of Merit by Europa Nostra in 1987. The placename 'Aiket' is derived from 'Oak Wood'. Barr Hill, near Aiket Castle (Ackett in 1775) had two interesting small monuments on its top until the early 19th century. These structures were well built, with lime cemented stones and stood twelve feet high. Typically for feudal baronies, Aiket possessed a Justice Hill for the open air meeting of the barony court; as indicated on OS maps, this stood close to the castle. A view of Aiket Castle in 2006 Aiket Castle and Barr Hill =The lairds= The Aiket Cunninghames were descended from the Cunninghames of Bedlands (Baidland), who in turn were cadets of the Cunninghames of Glencairn.Dobie Alexander Cunninghame is the first recorded as living at Aiket, receiving a charter from the Crown in 1479. Elizabeth Cunninghame had previously disposed of the lands to Lord Hay of Yester without permission from the Crown as feudal superior.Clow, Page 90 Robert Cunninghame seems to have been a very undesirable individual, implicated in the killing Sir John Mure of Caldwell and his own wife apparently attempted to poison him; she, Helen Colquhoun of Luss, was sent to the Court of Session at Edinburgh to answer the charge, but apparently never made it there. The murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton Robert Cunninghame was also implicated in the murder of Hugh Montgomerie, 4th Earl of Eglinton in 1586; an Aiket daughter was the wife of the Laird of Lainshaw, central to the story of the murder. The Aiket Cuninghames had all their property forfeited and Robert Cunninghame was eventually shot dead in revenge, 'on or near', his own doorstep in 1586.Bayne, Pages 10 - 16 Three Aiket daughters were married to participants in the tale of the murder of Hugh Montgomerie, Earl of Eglinton; two to Cunninghames and one, Lady Margaret, to a Montgomerie. In 1564 Cunninghame of Aicket (sic) is referred to as the 'Larde of Halkhede.'Rollie, Page 83 Robert Cunninghame's wife complained bitterly when the estate was eventually returned in ruinous condition in 1592, saying: - Bayne, Page 50 She appears to have rebuilt the castle in the late 16th century style, adding a lower kitchen wing to the west, with two upper floors. In 1566 the last Roman Catholic vicar of Dunlop, John Houston, with the permission of Gavin Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning Abbey, granted the church lands of Dunlop to William Cunnighame of Aiket. He kept an acre of land at the manse for his use and for the use of his successors.Bayne, Page 47 James Cunninghame was closely involved with the Dari√©n scheme and accompanied the first expedition. On his return he was an armed opponent of the 1707 Union of Parliaments. He lost so much money on his various financial ventures that he was forced to sell his estates. In the 18th-century the Dunlops made the castle more fashionable by cutting off the tower and regularising the windows. A disastrous fire in 1957 left the castle with only two vaults and three walls standing, however Robert and Katrina Clow restored the building in the mid- seventies.Dunlop, Page 17 Tradition has it that one of the Cunninghames of Aiket hanged a Gemmill at Templehouse using the rafters of the victims own house.Davis, Page 387 =The Spectral Knight of Hessilhead and the Bride of Aiket= Hessilhead (Hasil head) castle in 1876 Aiket's main entrance Anna Cunninghame of Aiket was pledged to marry her true love, Henry Montgomerie of Hessilhead. They were to marry upon his return from the crusades, however Allan Lockhart, son of a neighbouring Baron began to pay increasingly frequent visits to the inmates of Aiket Castle. His courtship was in vain and he would have no success unless the Crusades were to claim Henry. After many more months had passed Allan decided to use trickery and eventually persuaded a footsoldier recently returned from the Crusades to tell the false tale of the death of Henry Montgomerie. The ruse was carried off with success and after a short while Allan pressed his attentions again and the marriage day was set. On that very day Henry returned to Hessilhead castle and discovered the treacherous act, however he fell from his horse on his way to claim his bride and died within minutes. At twelve o'clock midnight the wedding feast was halted abruptly by the figure of the fully armour clad Henry Montgomerie striding into Aiket Castle hall, lifting up the Lady Anna and then vanishing into the night. Neither soldier nor bride were ever found.Robertson, Pages 340 - 357. The Lockhart, Loccard or Lockhard family are believed to have been the first owners of the Barony of Kilmarnock. { border=\\"0\\" -----  ::\\"For there, by Glazert's lonely stream, ::A lovely maiden swore ::to be my bride, when I returned ::Again to Scotia's shore.\\"MacIntosh, Page 301. } Anna Inglis and William Cunningham History records some facts that may in some way relate to the tale of the 'Spectral bride'. A Montgomerie of Hessilhead was pledged to marry an Anna Inglis, daughter of Thomas and Marion of Corsflat in Paisley. Anna's mother, Marion Peibles, was related to the Montgomeries. The Thomas Inglis died and Marion then married an Allan Lockhart (b. 1593), son of Allan Lockhart of Cleghorn near Lanark. Allan Lockhart forced his step-daughter, who was not yet 12 years old, to marry William Cunningham of Aiket, his cousin.Rogers, Page 425 William received a dowry of 40,000 merks and upon the marriage, however he beat and starved his young wife, spending his time with harlots in Paisley. His wife petitioned for a divorce and succeeded in 1641, however William (d. 1645) left her burdened with 10,000 merks debt. Anna had a son, James Cunningham, who became a Paisley burgess in 1668. =Aiket Mill= The restored Aiket Mill. Old millstones at the mill The corn mill on the Glazert Water at Aiket is first marked on the 1890 OS map. It has been restored as a dwelling, however the waterwheel is no longer in situ. Several millstones are located at the site and the mill race is in good condition and substantially built. Bloak Holm mill was located nearby, a little further down the Glazert Water and is recorded as being part of the Kirkwood Estate in the 18th century. The surviving Aiket millstones are made of French Burr which came in sections and the millwright had to turn these into a usable millstone. The sections were shaped and then the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle such were fitted together to give him the overall shape and size required. Once assembled, a set of iron tyres were fitted around them, in exactly the same way as a wheelwright would prepare a wooden wagon wheel. When cold, the metal tyre is made a little too small to fit around the stones, but when heated expansion caused it to become just large enough to drop into place. The cooling metal attempts to shrink back to its original size, gripping the pieces of the stone tightly. The stones were sealed with plaster of paris, poured into every crack and the working face was also coated to help cement the stones together, and to keep the dirt out.Whitemill. Accessed : 2010-09-05 =Braikenheuch Hill= This hill, its name meaning the 'Bracken Crag',Warrack lies about a mile and a half from Dunlop. It is said to be the site of the death of one of the Cunninghames of Aiket, killed by a Montgomerie during the times of the feuds between these families. The area is now known as the 'Brechna Braes.' Micro-history The gardens have been thoroughly developed, using recycled stone for steps, landscaping of the old quarry and extensive ornamental tree and shrub plantings. In 2011 the castle was put on the market for ¬£1.1 million.  See also  * Barony of Peacockbank * Chapeltoun * Lambroughton * Corsehill * Lands of Borland  References  Notes; Sources; #Bayne, John F.

Played by Patrick Stewart, Picard has appeared in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) and one episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, as well as the feature films Star Trek Generations (1994), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998), and Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). He is also featured as the central character in the show Star Trek: Picard (2020‚Äìpresent). Casting and design After the success of the contemporary Star Trek feature films, a new Star Trek television series featuring a new cast was announced on October 10, 1986. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry named Picard for one or both of the twin brothers Auguste Piccard and Jean Piccard, 20th-century Swiss scientists. cited in Patrick Stewart, who has a background of theatre at the Royal Shakespeare Company, was initially considered for the role of Data. Roddenberry did not want to cast Stewart as Picard, since he had envisioned an actor who was \\"masculine, virile, and had a lot of hair\\". Roddenberry's first choice was Stephen Macht, and it took \\"weeks of discussion\\" with Robert H. Justman, Rick Berman, and the casting director to convince him that \\"Stewart was the one they had been looking for to sit in the captain's chair\\"; Roddenberry agreed after auditioning every other candidate for the role. This book gives the actor's name as \\"Steven Mocked\\". The other actors considered included Yaphet Kotto, Patrick Bauchau, Roy Thinnes and Mitchell Ryan. Stewart was uncertain why the producers would cast 'a middle-aged bald English Shakespearean actor' as captain of the Enterprise. He had his toupee delivered from London to meet with Paramount executives, but Roddenberry ordered Stewart to remove the \\"awful looking\\" hairpiece. Stewart's stentorian voice impressed the executives, who immediately approved the casting. Roddenberry sent Stewart C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels, saying the Picard character was based on Hornblower, but Stewart was already familiar with the character, having read the books as a teenager. As the series progressed, Stewart exercised more control over the character's development. By the time production began on the first Next Generation film, \\"it was impossible to tell where Jean-Luc started and Patrick Stewart ended\\", and by the fourth film, Stewart stated: However, Stewart stated that he is not nearly as serious or brooding as his alter ego. Stewart also stated, \\"One of the delights of having done this series and played this role is that people are so attracted to the whole idea of Star Trek... several years after the series has ended... I enjoy hearing how much people enjoyed the work we did... It's always gratifying to me that this bald, middle-aged Englishman seems to connect with them\\". Stewart has commented that his role has helped open up Shakespeare to science fiction fans. He has noted the \\"regular presence of Trekkies in the audience\\" whenever he plays theater, and added: \\"I meet these people afterwards, I get letters from them and see them at the stage door... And they say, 'I've never seen Shakespeare before, I didn't think I'd understand it, but it was wonderful and I can't wait to come back.'\\" A new Star Trek series was announced by CBS All Access, Alex Kurtzman and Patrick Stewart in July 2018 and released on January 23, 2020 under the title Star Trek: Picard, in which Stewart reprises his role as Picard. Depiction Jean-Luc Picard was introduced on television in 1987, in the debut episode \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In this science fiction television show, he is the captain of a manned spacecraft of the fictional organization Starfleet as it visits various exoplanets and aliens. It is set in the late 24th century, and Picard must balance the challenges of people and technology. As a character in the Star Trek franchise, Picard appears in various books, comics, computer games, and films throughout the 1990s and a variety of merchandise. He is portrayed as being deeply moved by a desire to explore the universe and with a strong sense of duty, however he has misgivings about not having a family and difficulty interacting with children. The close-knit crew of the Enterprise provides his main friendships as they take on the Galaxy. Some of his interests, as presented by the show, include space exploration, Shakespeare, archeology, and Earl Grey tea. Notable episodes featuring the Jean-Luc Picard character include \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" (Parts I & Part II), \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", \\"Family\\", \\"All Good Things...\\", and \\"The Inner Light\\". Actor Patrick Stewart noted of the character \\"During these past years, it has been humbling to hear many stories about how ‚ÄòThe Next Generation‚Äô brought people comfort, saw them through difficult periods in their lives or how the example of Jean-Luc inspired so many to follow in his footsteps, pursuing science, exploration and leadership...\\" =Television series and films= Jean-Luc Picard was born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in La Barre, France, on 13 July 2305. As a child, he dreamed of joining Starfleet. He and the rest of his family speak English, with UK English dialects‚Äîthe French language having become obscure by the 24th century, as mentioned in the Next Generation episode \\"Code of Honor\\". Picard also has a number of British habits, including the regular consumption of Earl Grey tea, a fondness for Shakespeare, which he performs in holodeck simulations, riding horses with English tack and a knowledge of such British songs with Royal Navy associations as \\"A British Tar\\" (Gilbert and Sullivan) and \\"Heart of Oak\\". The young Picard failed his first Starfleet Academy entrance exam, and, upon admission, met with numerous ethical/scholastic difficulties during his cadet career, but went on to flourish, developing a lifelong passion for archaeology, and he became the first freshman to win the Academy marathon. Shortly after graduation, Picard was stabbed in the heart by a Nausicaan, leaving the organ irreparable and requiring replacement with a parthenogenetic implant; this would prove near-fatal later. Picard eventually served as first officer aboard the USS Stargazer, which he later commanded. During that time, he performed a warp-speed battle tactic that would become known as the Picard Maneuver. Depicted as deeply moral, highly logical, and intelligent, Picard is a master of diplomacy and debate who resolves seemingly intractable issues between multiple, sometimes implacable parties with a Solomon-like wisdom. Though such resolutions are usually peaceful, Picard is also shown using his remarkable tactical cunning in situations when it is required. Picard has a fondness for detective stories, Shakespearean drama, and archeology. He is frequently shown drinking Earl Grey tea and issuing the order, \\"Make it so\\", or, \\"Engage\\". Star Trek: The Next Generation depicts Picard's command of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). The pilot episode shows the ship's mission to investigate a problem at Farpoint Station, which becomes sidetracked when an entity known as Q makes Picard \\"representative\\" in a trial charging humanity with being a \\"dangerously savage child-race\\". Picard persuades Q to test humanity, and Q chooses as the test's first stage the crew's performance at Farpoint. The trial \\"ends\\" seven years later (when Q reminds Picard that it never does), in the series finale, when humanity is absolved by Picard's demonstration that the species has the capacity to explore the \\"possibilities of existence\\". The third-season finale, \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\", depicts Picard being assimilated by the Borg to serve as a bridge between humanity and the Borg (renamed Locutus of Borg); Picard's assimilation and recovery are a critical point in the character's development, and provided backstory for the film Star Trek: First Contact and the development of Benjamin Sisko, the protagonist of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in the series premiere \\"Emissary.\\" Stewart asked Roddenberry to keep Picard a Borg for a few more episodes beyond the third-season finale, as he thought that would be more interesting than simply restoring Picard in Part II. It is later revealed in First Contact that parts of Borg machinery were removed from inside Picard, but that he retains traumatic memories and lingering neurological aftereffects of assimilation (which become a pivotal plot twist in Star Trek: First Contact). The fourth-season episode \\"Family\\" reveals that Picard has a brother, Robert, who took charge of the family vineyards in La Barre after Picard joined Starfleet. Robert and his wife have a young son, Ren√©. In the film Star Trek Generations, Picard is devastated to learn that Robert and Ren√© have both died in a fire, and worse, the loss makes him the last of the Picard family. Picard joins forces with the 23rd-century Enterprise captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek Generations to fight the film's villain Dr. Tolian Soran. Commanding the new USS Enterprise-E (after the Enterprise-D is destroyed in Generations), Picard again confronts the Borg in First Contact. Later, he defends the Prime Directive and fights the forced relocation of the Ba'ku in Star Trek: Insurrection, and encounters Shinzon, a Romulan-made clone of himself, in Star Trek: Nemesis. Nemesis concludes with the death of Lieutenant Commander Data when he sacrifices himself to save the Enterprise, shortly before Riker accepts a promotion to Captain of the USS Titan and departs with his new wife Deanna Troi. The follow-up series Star Trek: Picard is set at the close of the 24th century. A now-retired Admiral Picard lives in solitude on the Picard estate in La Barre, France. His retirement was brought upon by his failure to save the Romulans from the Hobus supernova depicted in Stark Trek (the 2009 film). A mysterious woman, Dahj Asha, comes to his estate seeking sanctuary, and Picard learns that she may be a Soong-type android, created from Data's remains. Androids had been made illegal in the wake of their rebellion on Mars, which directly led to the failure of the Romulan rescue attempt. Soon, Picard is drawn into a conspiracy to suppress all synthetic life, which involves the remnants of the Tal Shiar. Picard, accompanied by a rag-tag crew, works to subvert this conspiracy. At the end of season one, Picard's human form expires on Coppelius due to a pre- existing medical condition, and he encounters Data's consciousness, still alive in a simulated matrix. Data pleads for Picard to finally let him die, as he considers the finiteness of life to be a defining human characteristic. Picard is brought back to life in a synthetic body, specifically configured to only give him the lifespan he would have lived if he didn't have his previous disease, and obliges Data's request, staying by him in the simulated matrix as Data dies. Picard then continues exploring space in his new body and crew. =Development in non-canon works= In novels by Pocket Books, Picard has married Beverly Crusher, and they have a son named Ren√© Jacques Robert Fran√ßois Picard. Jean-Luc also corresponds regularly with Marie, his sister- in-law, who still maintains the family vineyards. As of 2385 in the novel miniseries Star Trek: The Fall, Picard remains as commanding officer of the Enterprise-E. In the comics miniseries Star Trek: Countdown, a prequel to the Star Trek reboot (2009), Picard is depicted as having retired from Starfleet and becoming Federation Ambassador to Vulcan. In 2387, he works with Data, the new commanding officer of the Enterprise-E, Ambassador Spock, and the Romulan miner Nero to save the Romulan Star Empire from a cataclysmic supernova. He is present aboard the Enterprise as it confronts Nero, who has gone mad and begun killing non-Romulans after they fail to save Romulus. The Enterprise arrives too late to aid Ambassador Spock against Nero, believing both Spock and Nero to have been consumed by the artificial black hole that Spock created. The PC video game Star Trek: Hidden Evil (1999) included voice acting by Brent Spiner as Data and Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, with the plot a follow-up from the ninth Star Trek film Star Trek: Insurrection (1998) which also starred both actor-character combinations. Patrick Stewart also voiced Picard and Locutus for the year 2000 computer game Star Trek: Armada. Reception The character received critical acclaim among fans of The Next Generation, and he is usually considered one of the top two captains in the Star Trek franchise ‚Äì there are often lengthy and serious debates over whether Picard or James T. Kirk is the \\"best\\" Starfleet captain. A 1991 TV Guide cover story was titled \\"It's Kirk vs. Picard: Experts and fans debate who's best\\". In a more lighthearted take on the debate, the cover of a 1994 Mad magazine Star Trek special features both Kirk and Picard wrestling childishly to fit into the Enterprises captain's chair, while Scotty and Worf watch their respective commanders with looks of astonishment. Picard is deemed the ultimate delegator of authority, knowing \\"how to gather and use data better than any other Star Trek captain\\". His leadership style \\"is best suited to a large, process- centric, either geographically identical or diverse team\\".Paul Kimmerly & David R. Webb, \\"Leadership, The Final Frontier: Lessons From the Captains of Star Trek \\" CrossTalk: The Journal of Defense Software Engineering Oct. 2006 Kirk and Picard are considered to be attentive to the needs of their respective crews.John D. W. Beck & Neil M. Yeager, The Leader's Window: Mastering the Four Styles of Leadership to Build High-Performing Teams New York: Wiley (1994): 38 When Stewart and William Shatner were asked in 1991 how their characters would have dealt with Saddam Hussein, Shatner stated that Kirk would \\"have told him to drop dead\\" while Stewart joked that Picard \\"would still be talking\\". In 2015, Stewart addressed a long-asked conundrum among Star Trek fans, \\"If Kirk and Picard fought each other, who would win?\\" in Smithsonian magazine, by saying Picard would prefer to negotiate in the hope of avoiding a fight altogether. UGO Networks listed Picard as one of their best heroes in entertainment, saying, \\"He doesn't have Kirk's sense of panache, but he did have a tendency to take everything really, really seriously for years\\". He also became a sex symbol. Jean-Luc Picard finished up as Captain of the Enterprise on television with \\"All Good Things...\\", which was watched by over 30 million viewers. TNG was the most-watched Star Trek show to date, with a peak audience of 11.5 million during its fifth season prior to the launch of DS9. Between 1988 and 1992 it picked up half a million to a million additional viewers per year. However, starting in the 6th season there was a slow decline in Star Trek viewership that continued almost unabated until both the film and television empires ground to a halt. Neither Deep Space Nine, Voyager nor the film series were quite able to recapture the popularity of Picard's tenure on the Enterprise 1701-D. One factor was that the franchise began to face an extraordinary amount of competition from other space science fiction shows, as well as the loss or departure of many of its guiding inspirations including Roddenberry who had died in 1991. In 2012, IGN ranked the character Captain Picard, as depicted in the next generation series and films, as the 3rd top character of the Star Trek universe, behind Spock and Kirk in first and second place respectively. In 2017, IndieWire ranked Picard as the number one best character on Star Trek:The Next Generation. In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Picard the number one most attractive person in the Star Trek universe, ahead of Nyota Uhura (#2), Benjamin Sisko (#3), and Seven of Nine (#4). In 2018, Screen Rant ranked Picard as one of the top 8 most powerful characters of Star Trek, remarking that Picard is \\"Played with trademark charm and gravitas by Patrick Stewart.\\" In 2018, CBR ranked Picard the second best Starfleet character of Star Trek. In 2019, Jean-Luc Picard was ranked the 8th sexiest Star Trek character by SyFy. In July 2019, Screen Rant ranked Picard the 6th smartest character of Star Trek.

Gist (1807-1874), the 68th governor of South Carolina. Gist helped instigate a Secession Convention in South Carolina, which led to the creation of the Ordinance of Secession that preceded the Civil War. William Gist was the natural son of Francis Fincher Gist (c. 1773-1819), a Charleston merchant and South Carolina state representative,Biographical Directory of the South Carolina House of Representatives, 5:106 who by 1811 had purchased land in Upstate South Carolina. Either Francis Fincher or William Henry built a Georgian-style brick house (c. 1811-1830), eventually called Rose Hill after the many varieties of roses planted in its formal gardens. In the late 1850s and early 1860s, William Gist remodeled the house, adding two-tiered back and front porches and stuccoing the brick in order to transform the exterior into the more fashionable Greek revival-style. The final house had three stories, the first two used as living quarters and the third a mixture of living and storage areas. According to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, Rose Hill featured \\"more refined ornamentation than usually found in upcountry houses of the period.\\" A spiral staircase led to the second floor, which included a ballroom with two fireplaces so that the space could be converted into two bed chambers to accommodate guests.South Carolina Plantations; SCDAH description. Today the house is surrounded by rose gardens, mature boxwoods, and magnolias and is enclosed by a cast-iron fence. During Gist's term of office (1858-1860), the house served as the governor's mansion. From Rose Hill, Gist wrote the governors of Louisiana, North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, suggesting that if Abraham Lincoln were elected President, South Carolina might take the lead in seceding from the Union.\\"Rose Hill Plantation,\\" Sandlapper (Winter 2002-03), 54. Rose Hill was a working plantation of about where enslaved laborers grew cotton, corn, and oats. (There were approximately 20 slaves in 1820, 82 in 1840, and 178 in 1860). After slavery was abolished at the end of the Civil War, the plantation was farmed by tenant farmers and sharecroppers.South Carolina Plantations; Park website. By 1860 Rose Hill was producing nearly 300 bales of cotton and 4,000 bushels of corn per year. Gist died in 1874, but the mansion and land remained in the Gist family, though both were leased to tenants. In 1938 the US Forest Service purchased Rose Hill, and it became part of the Sumter National Forest. In 1942 Clyde T. Franks (1885-1970), a representative of the Federal Land Bank and an antique collector from Laurens, South Carolina, purchased the house and from the Forest Service; and in the following year, he opened the house to the public, restoring it and the gardens and adding period furniture. In 1960, Franks sold the property to the South Carolina State Park Service.Libby Rhodes, Laurens (Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2000), 84; South Carolina Plantations. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1970. National Register nomination form. The park includes restrooms, a picnic shelter, and a small gift shop. A brick kitchen built in the 1850s is the only other antebellum structure on the property. The location of the slave quarters is unknown. A one-and-a-quarter mile nature trail runs through both park and Forest Service property and extends to the Tyger River. The Gist family cemetery is about one mile south of the mansion.South Carolina Plantations; Clint Johnson, Touring the Carolinas' Civil War Sites (Winston- Salem, NC: John F.

It was considered the forerunner to Pope Pius XI's 1930 Casti connubii and Pope Paul VI's 1968 Humanae vitae. Arcanum outlines the role of marriage in the late 19th century, and goes through those actions which weaken the marriage contract such as polygamy and divorce. The encyclical also posits the church as a protector of marriage, and not one interfering in the marital relationship. Summary Leo began ‚ÄúArcanum‚Äù by recalling the history of marriage, established in the Old Testament when God created man and woman: \\"We record what is to all known, and cannot be doubted by any, that God, on the sixth day of creation, having made man from the slime of the earth, and having breathed into his face the breath of life, gave him a companion, whom He miraculously took from the side of Adam when he was locked in sleep.\\" According to Leo, the institution of marriage was corrupted over the years by the Jewish nation. Polygamy and divorce both became accepted practice such as men being allowed to violate their vows by having sexual relations outside of marriage. Also, parents were allowed to buy and sell marriageable girls and to make and unmake the marriages of their offspring. The Excellence of Marriage All of these practices were condemned by Christ who raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament, Leo states in Arcanum. \\"By the command of Christ, it not only looks to the propagation of the human race, but to the bringing forth of children for the Church....\\" \\"The list of those who tried to corrupt the sacrament of marriage was long, starting with the incestuous Corinthian was condemned by the authority of blessed Paul.\\" This continued into the 19th Century ‚Äúin our own time Mormons, St. Simonians, phalansterians, and communists.‚Äù Almost since its inception, the Church had been at odds with the State about the sanctity of marriage. The civil institution of marriage cannot replace the sacrament of marriage as so many of Leo's contemporaries thought it could. The placing of marriage under the state as just another civil, contractual institution was a part of the on- going secular movement by the Freemasons and Socialists of Leo's time. ‚Äú...in Christian marriage the contract is inseparable from the sacrament, and that, for this reason, the contract cannot be true and legitimate without being a sacrament as well. Treating marriage as just another contractual event opened the door for the reckless enablement of divorce. According to the modernists, what was needed was for Christianity ‚Äúto introduce a more humane code sanctioning divorce. THE EVILS OF DIVORCE The evils from divorce were many according to Leo in Arcanum: ‚Ä¢ Matrimonial contracts are by it made variable; mutual kindness is weakened; ‚Ä¢ deplorable inducements to unfaithfulness are supplied; ‚Ä¢ harm is done to the education and training of children; ‚Ä¢ occasion is afforded for the breaking up of homes; ‚Ä¢ the seeds of dissension are sown among families; ‚Ä¢ the dignity of womanhood is lessened and brought low, and women run the risk of being deserted after having ministered to the pleasures of men ...The Romans of old are said to have shrunk with horror from the first example of divorce. Due to marriage's relation to the circumstances of life, marriage was something ‚Äúabout which the State rightly makes strict inquiry and justly promulgates decrees.‚Äù In spite of that state's interest in marriage, marriage had a spiritual side and many of Leo's predecessors had to stand up to the princes and emperors of their times who tried to relax the bonds of marriage: ... the decrees of Nicholas I against Lothair; of Urban II and Paschal II against Philip I of France; of Celestine III and Innocent III against Alphonsus of Leon and Philip II of France; of Clement VII and Paul III against Henry VIII; and, lastly, of Pius VII, that holy and courageous pontiff, against Napoleon I, when at the height of his prosperity and in the fullness of his power. Mixed-Marriages Though later Popes would place conditions on mixed-Marriages, during the 19th Century, those marriages, per Leo, were considered part of the on-going rationalist attack on this sacred sacrament: Care also must be taken that they do not easily enter into marriage with those who are not Catholics; for, when minds do not agree as to the observances of religion, it is scarcely possible to hope for agreement in other things. ...they give occasion to forbidden association and communion in religious matters; endanger the faith of the Catholic partner; are a hindrance to the proper education of the children; and often lead to a mixing up of truth and falsehood, and to the belief that all religions are equally good. Later Encyclicals by Leo XIII on Marriage In two later encyclicals, Leo expressed his displeasure with the passing of legislation legalizing civil marriage in both Peru and Ecuador. Leo objected to these laws because they had removed the Church from the marriage contract and therefore from the teachings of Christ himself and from Church law. As he stated in ‚ÄúArcanum‚Äù, Leo saw a role for the state in the institution of marriage, but the basis of marriage must be within the context of the sacrament of marriage which only the Church can confer: The matter of the contract can be separated in some sense from the nature of the sacrament. This means that while the civil authority retains in full its right to regulate the so-called civil effects, the marriage itself is subject to the authority of the Church. Summary of Arcanum from The Catholic Encyclopedia Arcanum taught that since family life is the germ of society, and marriage is the basis of family life, the healthy condition of civil no less than of religious society depends on the inviolability of the marriage contract. The argument of the encyclical runs as follows: The mission of Christ was to restore man in the supernatural order. That should benefit man also in the natural order; first, the individual; and then, as a consequence, human society. Having laid down this principle, the encyclical deals with Christian marriage which sanctifies the family, i.e. the unit of society. The marriage contract, Divinely instituted, had from the beginning two properties: unity and indissolubility. Through human weakness and wilfulness it was corrupted in the course of time; polygamy destroyed its unity, and divorce its indissolubility. Christ restored the original idea of human marriage, and to sanctify more thoroughly this institution He raised the marriage contract to the dignity of a sacrament. Mutual rights and duties were secured to husband and wife; mutual rights and duties between parents and children were also asserted: to the former, authority to govern and the duty of training; to the latter, the right to parental care and the duty of reverence. Christ instituted his church to continue his mission to men. The church, true to her commission, has always asserted the unity and indissolubility of marriage, the relative rights and duties of husband, wife, and children; she has also maintained that, the natural contract in marriage having been raised to the dignity of a sacrament, these two are henceforth one and the same thing so that there cannot be a marriage contract amongst Christians which is not a sacrament. Hence, while admitting the right of civil authority to regulate the civil concerns and consequences of marriage, the church has always claimed exclusive authority over the marriage contract and its essentials, since it is a sacrament. The encyclical shows by the light of history that for centuries the church exercised, and the civil power admitted, that authority. But human weakness and wilfulness began to throw off the bridle of Christian discipline in family life; civil rulers began to disown the authority of the church over the marriage tie; and rationalism sought to sustain them by establishing the principle that the marriage contract is not a sacrament at all, or at least that the natural contract and the sacrament are separable and distinct things. Hence arose the idea of the dissolubility of marriage and divorce, superseding the unity and indissolubility of the marriage bond. The encyclical points to the consequences of that departure in the breaking up of family life, and its evil effects on society at large. It points out as a consequence, that the church, in asserting its authority over the marriage contract, has shown itself not the enemy but the best friend of the civil power and the guardian of civil society. In conclusion, the encyclical commissions all bishops to oppose civil marriage, and it warns the faithful against the dangers of mixed marriages.

He is the bassist and lead vocalist for the punk rock band NOFX and the bassist for the punk rock supergroup cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Fat Mike started out with his first band False Alarm in 1982. He credits Joe Escalante of the Vandals for introducing him to punk rock when he was 13 at a summer camp. Musical career While attending Beverly Hills High School, Mike began his musical career with the band False Alarm. After the band split up in 1983, he met Eric Melvin and Erik Sandin and formed the original line-up of NOFX. He has also appeared as a guest-vocalist on a number of other bands' tracks including \\"Peter Brady\\" on Screeching Weasel's 1993 album, Anthem for a New Tomorrow. Other appearances include \\"Beware\\" by Randy, \\"Mr. Coffee\\" and \\"Lazy\\" by Lagwagon, and can be heard heckling and requesting \\"Free Bird\\" at the end of the Lunachicks song, \\"Missed It,\\" off their 1996 album, Pretty Ugly, which he also produced. He also appears as a guest vocalist on the Dropkick Murphys single \\"Going Out In Style\\". Mike is the owner and founder of Fat Wreck Chords, one of the most successful independent labels in North America. Mike recorded the Cokie the Clown EP with NOFX, playing Cokie on both the cover of the EP and the music video for the title-track, \\"Cokie the Clown\\". In the video, Mike dresses as Cokie and puts white powder into his squirting flower, which in the song he describes as \\"my own special blend of ex, coke, and K\\". Cokie then walks around Chicago squirting powder in pedestrians' faces, as chronicled in the song itself. The video was shot during the punk music festival Riot Fest. Fat Mike has made several appearances as Cokie the Clown, but one of his most memorable was at Emo's, a popular nightclub in Austin on March 20, 2010 at the South by Southwest festival. He recounted several graphic and disturbing stories about his life, and played several songs both previously released and unreleased. He also tricked several members of the audience into drinking tequila, before showing them a video of himself filling a partially full bottle of tequila to the top with urine to shocked reactions. The stunt was later revealed as a joke on NOFX's website, which showed Fat Mike switching out the urine bottle for an untainted one before making audience members drink it. Mike has since been banned from Emo's. However, in NOFX's autobiography Mike claims that the urine was indeed served to the audience. In 2015 Mike premiered a Broadway musical titled Home Street Home which he co-wrote with Soma Snakeoil and Jeff Marx. In 2019, Fat Mike released a solo album, in the character of Cokie the Clown, titled You're Welcome. The album features Fat Mike as Cokie as well as Dizzy Reed (Guns N Roses) and Travis Barker (blink 182). Activism=Punkvoter.com= Fat Mike founded the website Punkvoter.com in 2004 in an effort to mobilize the punk community to vote George W. Bush out of office in that year's presidential election. He had never been very active in politics before then, admitting that he never even voted until 2000. However, he was driven into political activism because of Bush, whom he viewed as \\"the most ridiculous president in the history of presidents.\\" Punkvoter.com targeted 18-to-25-year-old punk fans and other disenfranchised young people and encouraged them to vote Bush out of office. At its peak, the site was getting 15 million hits a day and ultimately raised over $1 million. =Rock Against Bush= As with Punkvoter.com, Mike organized the Rock Against Bush campaign to mobilize punk fans and musicians against George W. Bush. Fat Mike's band NOFX, along with many other well-known punk artists including Alkaline Trio, Green Day and Jello Biafra, embarked on a tour of American college campuses in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. Mike hoped to go beyond just protest and actually educate kids about why they should vote against Bush. At the shows, he would hand out free DVDs of Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War, a documentary that questions the Bush administration's motives in the Middle East. To coincide with the tour, Mike released two Rock Against Bush compilation albums on Fat Wreck Chords featuring new music from some of the bands on the label. The albums sold over 650,000 copies and proceeds helped fund the tour, as well as going toward magazine ads and billboards in swing states. Personal life Burkett lives in Sherman Oaks, California. He attended college at San Francisco State University and graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in Social Science and a minor in Human Sexuality. According to the book NOFX The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories, Burkett has said that he received the moniker \\"Fat Mike\\" from \\"one of the guys from [the band] Subculture\\". He is of Jewish heritage but is an atheist. He and his wife Erin divorced in 2010 after 18 years of marriage. They have a daughter named Darla. In October 2009, Mike appeared in the documentary The Other F Word, an analysis of punk rock fatherhood. Fat Mike formerly owned a gastropub-style restaurant in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY called Thistle Hill Tavern. He has been into BDSM for years: he has had a dungeon in his house. Fat Mike has numerous tattoos, including one on his left arm that features a golfing dominatrix and her bound caddy.How To Explain Awkward Tattoos, From A Guy With A Golfing Dominatrix On His Shoulder Fatherly. June 30, 3015 Fat Mike announced his engagement to adult film actress Soma Snakeoil on January 28, 2014. Mike and Soma separated August 2017. He has been vocal about assisting with his terminally ill mother's death, describing the episode in a song called \\"La Pieta\\" which is featured in NOFX's audiobook version of The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories. In 2014, Burkett started Fatale, a brand of panties marketed towards men. =Assault incident= On November 5, 2014 at a NOFX show in Sydney, Australia, Fat Mike had complained about a neck injury and had asked the audience not to throw objects at him and grab him while on stage as it caused him pain. While playing the song \\"Linoleum\\", a fan climbed onstage and put his arm around Mike's neck, to which Mike responded by elbowing him to the ground and then kicking him in the face. The fan suffered some bruising on his face but had no major injuries. Later, Fat Mike and the fan both apologized via Twitter. A video was released of Mike giving the fan a beer and custom T-shirt and letting him kick him as an apology.

Starring three anthropomorphic toads named after skin conditions, Rash, Zitz, and Pimple, the series was created to rival the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games series.Battletoads Retrospective  What happened to Rare's popular hardcore beat-'em-up, IGN, January 13, 2009. The series as a whole has been quite popular with five installments up to this date and at its apex spawned an animated television pilot. The initial Battletoads game for the NES was renowned for its difficulty, but also received a cult following and spawned sequels for various platforms including a crossover with the Double Dragon series. In each of the games, the objective is to defeat the toads' nemesis the Dark Queen and her army of space mutants. Video games=Series= *Battletoads: The Battletoads have to defeat the evil Dark Queen on her planet and rescue their kidnapped partners, Pimple and Princess Angelica. Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1991 by Rare (in Japan the game is distributed by Masaya Games,Battletoads (J) Import ‚Äì Amazon in Europe and the USA the game is distributed by Tradewest) and subsequently ported by Mindscape to the Amiga in 1992 (but not released until 1994), by Arc System Works to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Game Gear both in 1993, by Rare to the Game Boy in 1993 (as Battletoads in Ragnarok's World), and by Mindscape to the Amiga CD32 in 1994. *Battletoads: An LCD game was released by Tiger Electronics in 1991. *Battletoads (Game Boy): A spin-off of the original NES game. Despite having the same box art and title as the original NES release, it is an entirely different game from the NES version. *Battletoads in Battlemaniacs: Released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and developed in 1994 for the Sega Master System (but not released until 1996). In this game, Zitz and the daughter of Psicone Industries' CEO have been captured and it is up to Rash and Pimple to save them from being the Dark Queen. Different from the previous games, in this one each character has its own specific abilities and combos. Pimple is the powerhouse, big and with big range with punches, while Rash is nimble and smaller, fighting using kicking attacks. Aside from cooperative play, a solo player is able to play as Rash by switching to the second controller. *Battletoads in Ragnarok's World: A 1993 port of the original game, made by Rare for the Game Boy. *Battletoads/Double Dragon: A crossover with the characters from the Double Dragon series with liberties taken. The Dark Queen and Shadow Boss team up and five heroes (the three toads, Zitz, Rash and Pimple, and the two Lee brothers, Billy and Jimmy) must stop them. For the first time in the series, the game offers players a character selection screen. Released in 1993 for the NES, Genesis, SNES and Game Boy. *Battletoads Arcade: An arcade game released in 1994, also known as Super Battletoads. The arcade game, unlike the other games, featured voice-overs and several other features that distinguish it from the other games, such as a vastly increased level of violence. It follows the Battletoads in Battlemaniacs updated formula of each character having his own design and specific abilities and combos, but this time featuring the three toads, Zitz, Rash and Pimple, as selectable characters: while Rash is kept as the nimble and smaller character and Pimple as the powerhouse, Zitz is represented as the intermediate and balanced character. Vehicle levels emphasize combat, rather than memorizing and avoiding obstacles. *Battletoads (2020): An Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Microsoft Windows game developed by DLaLa Studios in collaboration with Rare, released on August 20th, 2020. It features three-player couch co-op multiplayer and high resolution hand-drawn 4K 2.5D graphics. The first gameplay trailer for the game was revealed at E3 2019. The Battletoads appear in a bonus boss encounter in the Xbox One and PC versions of Shovel Knight. Battletoads and Battletoads Arcade are included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare games released for the Xbox One in 2015. Rash appears as a playable guest character in the third season of the fighting game Killer Instinct, available on Xbox One and Windows. Rash also appears as an action figure in Grounded.https://www.destructoid.com/stories/look-at-this- big-ass-battletoad-in-grounded--598399.phtml =History of production= A sequel/remake game was being developed for the Game Boy Advance, but was ultimately canceled. In 2013, Phil Spencer from Microsoft's Xbox team mentioned his fondness for Battletoads while asking the fans what Rare games should be brought back for the Xbox One. In 2014, \\"Battletoads\\" was re- trademarked in the United States. Spencer appeared publicly in a Battletoads T-shirt in 2015, just days after Microsoft Studios' Ken Lobb (creator of 2013's Killer Instinct reboot) said they have plans to bring Battletoads and other classic Rare series back \\"someday\\". =Other= Battletoads: The Official Battlebook, the Tradewest-authorized guide to the Battletoads console games, was written by Steve Schwartz and published in 1994 by Prima Publishing. Detailed playing tips, strategies, and secrets were provided for the following games: Battletoads (NES and Genesis), Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (Super NES), and Battletoads/Double Dragon (NES, Genesis, and Super NES). Animated series Battletoads spun off a half-hour animated television special produced by DIC Animation City in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (DiC would try this again later on when producing Street Sharks and Extreme Dinosaurs). Intended as the pilot for a full-fledged series, the special aired in syndication in the United States on the weekend of Thanksgiving 1992. It was never picked up for a series however, despite comic-style ads in GamePro magazine claiming otherwise. Buena Vista Home Video released the pilot on VHS in January 1994. Although the pilot hasn‚Äôt been released onto DVD, it did see an official YouTube release on August 5, 2014 on the Retro Gaming Shows, (which later changed its name to WildBrain Super Heroes), a YouTube channel run by the Canadian company DHX Media, which currently owns the rights to DIC's cartoon library. The story served as a prequel to the video game franchise. Set in Oxnard, California, it stars three junior high schoolers. The trio is given the ability to transform into anthropomorphic toads with superhuman strength and the ability to change their arms and legs into weapons in techniques called \\"Smash Hits\\". They are charged with protecting Professor T. Bird and Princess Angelica from the Dark Queen, who wants to steal Angelica's magical amulet for her plans of universal conquest. The cartoon was adapted and written by David Wise (no relation to the Battletoads video games' composer of the same name). A comic with the backstory of Battletoads, written by Rare employee Guy Millar, was also published in Nintendo Power. Reception In 2010, Game Informer included Battletoads among ten gaming franchises that deserve a revival, and precisely, \\"a true HD sequel\\". In 2012, Forbes listed it as one of five video game franchises \\"that need to come back from the dead\\", adding that a modern Battletoads \\"should retain its side-scroller qualities while adopting the 2.5D style\\" similar to Mark of the Ninja. The series' return was also demanded by other outlets, including Complex, Maxim and GameRevolution. On the other hand, the animated version of Battletoads was very badly received. It was included on the lists of five \\"worst one-shot TV cartoons ever made\\" by Topless Robot in 2008. Prank call Beginning in early 2011, 4chan users organized a mass prank calling to the Gold and Silver pawn shop, home to the popular television show Pawn Stars. The callers would repeatedly ask the employees if they sold Battletoads. This call led Rick Harrison, star of Pawn Stars and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the callers, who recorded this and uploaded it to YouTube. This originated a series of many other similar videos of pranksters dialing random establishments and asking about Battletoads. Battletoads developer Rare has acknowledged the prank via an achievement named \\"Do You Have Battletoads?\\" in their 2015 game compilation Rare Replay.

Although physically located in Hartsville, Warwick Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, its mailing address is in Warminster Township, Pennsylvania. The house served as the headquarters for General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War from August 10 to 23, 1777 while on the way to the Battle of Brandywine. The encampment stretched along both sides of Old York Road, on the slope of Carr's hill to the north; both sides of Bristol Road from Mearns Road to Meetinghouse Road. The Battle of Crooked Billet ended near here on May 1, 1778. Moland House is owned by Warwick Township and is being restored and maintained by the Warwick Township Historical Society through grants from Warwick Township, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the federal government, plus by private foundations and individual donors. Restoration began in 1997, and although it is nearly complete, a number of projects remain to be funded. Carriage House in Moland House Historic Park. History In the early evening of August 10, 1777, 11,000 Continental Army and militia soldiers were marching up York Road towards the Cross Roads with Bristol Road (which is known today as Hartsville, PA) on their way to Coryell's Ferry (now New Hope), intending to camp four miles beyond the Delaware River in New Jersey. General George Washington received a dispatch from John Hancock, President of the Second Continental Congress, which told Washington that the 260-vessel British fleet, hauling 17,000 British Army and Hessian troops under General William Howe, was fifty miles south of the Delaware Capes (Cape May and Cape Henlopen) on August 7. Unsure and wary of Howe's intentions, Washington immediately halted his force to encamp around the bridge over the Little Neshaminy Creek in Warwick Twp. Knowing the area and having ridden through only ten days earlier, he selected the substantial stone dwelling of Widow Moland as his headquarters on the farm north of the bridge. General Washington held a \\"Council of War\\" with his four major generals and six brigadier generals in the Moland House. While in Warwick Township the Betsy Ross flag, an American flag that was allegedly designed by Betsy Ross, was first presented to General Washington. Verbal history of the area alleges that the encampment was the site where the American flag was first flown. It was also here that the Marquis de Lafayette and Count Casimir Pulaski joined the American Revolution and distinguished themselves soon at the Battle of Brandywine and for many years thereafter in the fight for American freedom from England.The Thirteen Days of August by Helen Gemmil During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Moland House was recognized as an important landmark, however, it did remain a private residence. The Moland house was the site of meetings of history-interested groups during the first half of the 20th century. Members of Sons of the Revolution met there in 1903 and a group of French educators and military officers taking part in the Lafayette College Centennial Celebration met there 1932. During the 1960s or early 1970s the Moland House ceased to be a private residence and became a rooming house. According to local residents, as a rooming house, it was frequented by members of motorcycle gangs. It fell into disrepair and was abandoned by 1985. It was then that a concerned group of local citizens began to take action and in concert with a local housing developer and local authorities, rescued Moland House.

Accessed on 2020-07-05. It is distinguished from tallow, a similar product derived from fat of cattle or sheep. Lard can be rendered by steaming, boiling, or dry heat. The culinary qualities of lard vary somewhat depending on the origin and processing method; if properly rendered, it may be nearly odorless and tasteless.E. S. Clifton, Joseph Kastelic, and Belle Lowe (1955): Relationships between Lard Production Methods, Volumes of Production, Costs and Characteristics of Lard Produced in Selected Packing Plants. Research Bulletin 422, Iowa State College Experiment Station, US Department of Agriculture. It has a high saturated fatty acid content and no trans fat. At retail, refined lard is usually sold as paper-wrapped blocks. Many cuisines use lard as a cooking fat or shortening, or as a spread in the same ways as butter. It is an ingredient in various savoury dishes such as sausages, p√¢t√©s, and fillings. As a replacement for butter, it provides flakiness to pastry. In western cuisine, it has ceded its popularity to vegetable oils, but many cooks and bakers still favor it over other fats for certain uses. History Raw fatback being diced to prepare tourti√®re Lard has always been an important cooking and baking staple in cultures where pork is an important dietary item, with pig fat often being as valuable a product as pork. During the 19th century, lard was used similarly to butter in North America and many European nations. Lard remained about as popular as butter in the early 20th century and was widely used as a substitute for butter during World War II. As a readily available by-product of modern pork production, lard had been cheaper than most vegetable oils, and it was common in many people's diet until the industrial revolution made vegetable oils more common and more affordable. Vegetable shortenings were developed in the early 1900s, which made it possible to use vegetable-based fats in baking and in other uses where solid fats were called for. Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, though fictional, portrayed men falling into rendering vats and being sold as lard, and it generated negative publicity. By the late 20th century lard began to be considered less healthy than vegetable oils (such as olive and sunflower oil) because of its high content of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. However, despite its reputation, lard has less saturated fat, more unsaturated fat and less cholesterol than an equal amount of butter by weight. Unhydrogenated lard contains no transfats. It has also been regarded as a \\"poverty food\\". Many restaurants in the western nations have eliminated the use of lard in their kitchens because of the health-related dietary restrictions of many of their customers, and religious pork-based dietary restrictions such as Kashrut and Halal mean that some bakers will substitute beef tallow for lard. In the 1990s and early 2000s, however, chefs and bakers rediscovered lard's unique culinary values, leading to a partial rehabilitation of this fat among \\"foodies\\". Negative publicity about the transfat content of the partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in vegetable shortening has partially driven this trend. Chef and food writer Rick Bayless is a prominent proponent of the virtues of lard for certain types of cooking.\\"The Real Thing: nothing beats lard for old-fashioned flavor\\" by Matthew Amster-Burton, The Seattle Times, September 10, 2006.\\"Don't let lard throw you into a tizzy\\" by Jacqueline Higuera-McMahan, San Francisco Chronicle, March 12, 2003.\\"Light, Fluffy ‚Äì Believe It, It's Not Butter\\" by Matt Lee and Ted Lee, New York Times, October 11, 2000.\\"Heart-stopping moment for doctors as we're falling in love again with lard\\" by Sally Williams, Western Mail, January 5, 2006. It is also again becoming popular in the United Kingdom among aficionados of traditional British cuisine. This led to a \\"lard crisis\\" in late 2004.\\"Chefs prize it. The French love it. The Poles are hogging it. And now Britain's running out of it.\\" by Christopher Hirst, The Independent, November 20, 2004. Production Lard can be obtained from any part of the pig that has a high concentration of fatty tissue. The highest grade of lard, known as leaf lard, is obtained from the \\"flare\\" visceral fat deposit surrounding the kidneys and inside the loin. Leaf lard has little pork flavor, making it ideal for use in baked goods, where it is valued for its ability to produce flaky, moist pie crusts. The next-highest grade is obtained from fatback, the hard subcutaneous fat between the pig's back skin and muscle. The lowest grade (for purposes of rendering into lard) is obtained from the soft caul fat surrounding digestive organs, such as small intestines, though caul fat is often used directly as a wrapping for roasting lean meats or in the manufacture of p√¢t√©s.Davidson, Alan.

Arlington, VA: National Renderers Association. p 95‚Äì110. (Warning: large document). Lard may be rendered by two processes: wet or dry. In wet rendering, pig fat is boiled in water or steamed at a high temperature and the lard, which is insoluble in water, is skimmed from the surface of the mixture or separated in an industrial centrifuge. In dry rendering, the fat is exposed to high heat in a pan or oven without water (a process similar to frying bacon). The two processes yield somewhat differing products. Wet-rendered lard has a more neutral flavor, a lighter color, and a high smoke point. Dry-rendered lard is somewhat browner and has a caramelized flavor and has a lower smoke point.Moustafa, Ahmad and Stauffer, Clyde. (1997). Bakery Fats. Brussels: American Soybean Association. Rombaur, Irma S, et al. (1997). Joy of Cooking (revised ed). New York: Scribner. \\"About lard and other animal fats\\"; p 1069. Industrially-produced lard, including much of the lard sold in supermarkets, is rendered from a mixture of high and low quality fat from throughout the pig.\\"Ask Cook's: Is Lard an Acceptable Shortening?\\", Cook's Illustrated, November 2004. Lard is often hydrogenated to improve its stability at room temperature. Hydrogenated lard sold to consumers typically contains fewer than 0.5 g of transfats per 13 g serving. Lard is also often treated with bleaching and deodorizing agents, emulsifiers, and antioxidants such as BHT.\\"Put Lard Back in Your Larder\\" by Linda Joyce Forristal, Mother Linda's Olde World Cafe and Travel Emporium. These treatments make it more consistent and prevent spoilage. (Untreated lard must be refrigerated or frozen to prevent rancidity.)Matz, Samuel A. (1991). Bakery Technology and Engineering. New York: Springer. \\"Lard\\"; p 81. \\"Make Your Own Lard: Believe it or not, it's good for you\\" by Lynn Siprelle, The New Homemaker, Winter 2006. Consumers wanting a higher-quality source of lard typically seek out artisanal producers, or render it themselves from leaf lard or fatback. A by-product of dry-rendering lard is deep-fried meat, skin and membrane tissue known as cracklings. =Composition= A triglyceride molecule, the main constituent of lard Lard consists mainly of fats, which in the language of chemistry are known as triglycerides. These triglycerides are composed of three fatty acids and the distribution of fatty acids varies from oil to oil. In general lard is similar to tallow in its composition. Pigs that have been fed different diets will have lard with a significantly different fatty acid content and iodine value. Peanut-fed hogs or the acorn-fed pigs raised for Jam√≥n ib√©rico therefore produce a somewhat different kind of lard compared to pigs raised in North American farms that are fed corn.Ockerman, Herbert W. (1991). Source book for food scientists (Second Edition). Westport, CN: AVI Publishing Company.Kaminsky, Peter. (2005). Pig Perfect: Encounters with Remarkable Swine and Some Great Ways to Cook Them. Hyperion. 304 p. Culinary use Lard is one of the few edible oils with a relatively high smoke point, attributable to its high saturated fatty acids content. Pure lard is especially useful for cooking since it produces little smoke when heated and has a distinct flavor when combined with other foods. Many chefs and bakers prize lard over other types of shortening because of its flavor and range of applications.Julie R. Thomson, \\"10 Reasons You Should Be Cooking With Lard,\\" HuffPost Taste, 28 April 2014 (Retrieved 5 October 2014). =Nutritional valueCompared to other fatsIn baking= Because of the relatively large fat crystals in lard, it is extremely effective as a shortening in baking. Pie crusts made with lard tend to be flakier than those made with butter. Many cooks employ both types of fat in their pastries to combine the shortening properties of lard with the flavor of butter.\\"Heaven in a Pie Pan ‚Äì The Perfect Crust\\" by Melissa Clark, New York Times, November 15, 2006.King Arthur Flour. (2003). King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion: The All- Purpose Baking Cookbook. Woodstock, VT: Countryman Press. \\"Lard\\"; p. 550. =In cuisines= Lard was once widely used in the cuisines of Europe, China and the New World and still plays a significant role in British, Central European, Mexican and Chinese cuisines. In British cuisine, lard is a traditional ingredient in mince pies and Christmas puddings, lardy cake and for frying fish and chips as well as many other uses. Lard is traditionally one of the main ingredients in the Scandinavian p√¢t√© leverpostej. 1916 advertisement for lard produced by Swift & Company In Spain, one of the most popular versions of the Andalusian breakfast includes several kinds of mantecas differently seasoned, consumed spread over toasted bread. Among other variants, manteca color√° (lard with paprika) and zurrapa de lomo (lard with pork flakes) are the preferred ones. In Catalan cuisine lard is used to make the dough for the pastry known as coca. In the Balearics particularly, ensaimades dough also contains lard. A slice of bread spread with lard was a typical staple in traditional rural cuisine of many countries Lard consumed as a spread on bread was once very common in Europe and North America, especially those areas where dairy fats and vegetable oils were rare. As the demand for lard grows in the high-end restaurant industry, small farmers have begun to specialize in heritage hog breeds with higher body-fat contents than the leaner, modern hog. Breeds such as the Mangalitsa hog of Hungary or Large Black pig of Great Britain are experiencing an enormous resurgence, to the point that breeders are unable to keep up with demand. When used without qualification the word 'lard' in English generally refers to wet-rendered lard, which has a very mild, neutral flavor as opposed to the more noticeably pork-flavored dry-rendered lard, or dripping. Dripping sandwiches are still popular in several European countries‚ÄîHungarian zs√≠roskeny√©r (\\"lardy bread\\") or zs√≠rosdeszka (\\"lardy plank\\"), and German \\"Fettbemme\\", seasoned pork fat. Similar snacks are sometimes served with beer in Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. They are generally topped with onions, served with salt and paprika, and eaten as a side-dish with beer. All of these are commonly translated on menus as \\"lard\\" sandwiches, perhaps due to the lack of familiarity of most contemporary English native speakers with dripping. Attempts to use Hungarian zs√≠r or Polish smalec (both meaning \\"fat/lard\\") when British recipes calling for lard will reveal the difference between the wet-rendered lard and dripping.IMG_2116 by chrys, Flickr.com, September 16, 2006.\\"Austrian Restaurant Guide\\" by Keith Waclena, February 18, 2000. In Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as in many parts of China, lard was often consumed mixed into cooked rice along with soy sauce to make \\"lard rice\\" (Ë±¨Ê≤πÊãåÈ£Ø or Ë±¨Ê≤πÊíàÈ£Ø). And in Japan, back loin (fatback) lard is frequently used for ramen, creating a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty dish. Traditionally, along with peanut oil, lard is extensively used in Asian cooking as a general-purpose cooking oil, esp. in stir-fries and deep-frying. Schweineschmalz, German lard Griebenschmalz, German lard with crispy pieces of pork skin In Germany lard is called Schweineschmalz (literally, \\"rendered fat from swine\\") and has been a longtime favorite as a spread. It can be served plain, or it can be mixed with seasonings: pork fat can be enhanced with small pieces of pork skin, called Grieben (cf. Yiddish gribenes) to create Griebenschmalz. Other recipes call for small pieces of apple or onion. In English, however, schmaltz usually refers to kosher fat rendered from chicken, duck or goose. Schmalzbrot (\\"bread with Schmalz\\") can be found on the menu in grounded restaurants or brewery pubs. Schmalzbrot is often served as Griebenschmalz on rye bread accompanied with pickled gherkin. Vegetarian Grieben from onions or apples, which began as a makeshift means of diluting Schmalz in time of need, became rather popular on their own account because they allow for a specific taste and a lower fat content. Completely vegetarian Schmalz-like spreads based on vegetable fats use those ingredients as well. In Germany it is forbidden to use the term Schmalz for non-lard products. In Poland lard mixed with fruit, usually chopped apple, and spread on thick slices of bread, is often served as a starter. Other uses Rendered lard can be used to produce biofuel\\"The Biodiesel Bible\\" by Keith Addison, Make your own biodiesel (website). and soap. Lard is also useful as a cutting fluid in machining. Its use in machining has declined since the mid-20th century as other specially engineered cutting fluids became prominent. However, it is still a viable option. Lard and other animal fats were formerly used as an anti-foaming agent in industrial fermentation processes such as brewing; there, animal fats have been superseded by polyethers.Randal M.

The company currently produces around and has a refining capacity in three refineries of 21 million tonnes/year.  History  Cepsa was founded in 1929 as a private company led by Francisco Recasens, with its first refinery located at Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Because of the CAMPSA state monopoly of fuel distribution, Cepsa sold its production to that company. It expanded to lubricant production in 1950 and petrochemical products in 1955. In 1964 it opened a factory in Portugal, and in 1967 it added a second refinery at San Roque de C√°diz. After relaxations of the state monopoly, Cepsa bought a portion of Campsa petrol stations in 1992. In 1988, Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) bought a 10% stake of Cepsa.

The game was created by Garry Newman as a mod for Valve's Source game engine and released in December 2004, before being expanded into a standalone release and published by Valve in November 2006. Ports of the original Microsoft Windows version for Mac OS X and Linux followed in September 2010 and June 2013, respectively. The base game mode of Garry's Mod has no set objectives and provides the player with a world to freely manipulate. Other game modes, notably Trouble in Terrorist Town, are created by other developers as mods and are installed separately, by means such as the Steam Workshop. As of December 2019, Garry's Mod has sold 15 million copies.  Gameplay  The player character (right) positioning characters from Team Fortress 2 on a couch using the physics gun Garry's Mod is a physics-based sandbox game and its base game mode has no set objectives. The player is able to spawn non-player characters, ragdolls, and props, and interact with them by various means. Using the physics gun, ragdolls and props can be picked up, rotated, and frozen in place. The tool gun is a multi-purpose item for various tasks, such as welding and constraining props together, and altering the facial expressions of ragdolls.  User-created content  Garry's Mod includes the functionality to modify the game by developing scripts written in the Lua programming language. Notable mods include Spacebuild, Wiremod, Elevator: Source, DarkRP, Prop Hunt, and Trouble in Terrorist Town. Specialised servers, known as Fretta servers, rotate between custom game modes every fifteen minutes. Garry's Mod version 12 introduced the \\"Toybox\\" section, through which the player could browse and install user-created mods. In Garry's Mod version 13, this was mostly replaced with support for the Steam Workshop. = Fretta Contest = In late 2009, Facepunch launched the \\"Fretta Contest\\", a competition in which people were to develop Garry's Mod game modes using the proprietary Fretta programming framework, with the winner to be natively added to the game. The winner of this contest was Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), wherefore it was added to the game in July 2010, alongside another Fretta game, Dogfight: Arcade Assault. TTT assigns players to three groups: Traitors, Detectives, and Innocents. Detectives are known to all players, whereas Traitors are only known to other Traitors and otherwise appear as Innocents. While Traitors attempt to eliminate all other players, Innocents and Detectives need to co-operate to identify and eliminate all Traitors. To do the latter, Detectives are given special equipment, such as DNA scanners that can trace a dead player's killer. = GMod Tower = In July 2009, four developers working under the name \\"PixelTail Games\\" opened a Garry's Mod server called GMod Tower. GMod Tower was a network of servers, designed as a social media platform for users to play minigames with friends and socialise in a hub area. Within hours of the server's opening, the website for GMod Tower reached two million views. GMod Tower temporarily shut down between January 2012 and April that year. PixelTail later expanded GMod Tower into Tower Unite, a standalone game. When the game launched into early access in April 2016, GMod Tower was shut down permanently. =Machinima= Garry's Mod has also been used as the basis for user-made machinima. One of the more notable examples is Half-Life: Full-Life Consequences, a machinima of a poorly-written fanfic in the Half-Life universe written in 2008 by a user named Squirrelking, whom The Verge named the \\"Cormac McCarthy of terrible fan fiction\\". YouTube user Djy1991 used Garry's Mod to animate the fanfic, using literal interpretation of some of the work's typographical errors and awkward grammar.  Development and release  Garry's Mod was created by the video game programmer Garry Newman. He started developing games under the studio name Facepunch Studios after dropping out of college, at the time out of a room in his parents' house. He did this as a hobby, simultaneous to his occupation as a PHP programmer for a dating website, from which he was later fired when he launched his own such website. His first game was Facewound, described as \\"Mario with guns\\", while Garry's Mod later came about as a side- project in the form of a mod for the Source game engine and principally the game Half-Life 2. Newman soon found more enjoyment in developing Garry's Mod than in developing Facewound, so development on Facewound was mostly halted (and put on indefinite hiatus in 2004) to focus on Garry's Mod. The first iteration of the mod, version 1, was released on 24 December 2004. Initial feedback was polarised, with some criticising the mod for its similarity to an existing mod, JBMod. However, the increasing positive reception led Newman to continue development. Through 2004 and 2005, Newman released several updated versions of Garry's Mod, adding new features along the way and culminating in version 9.0.4 on 27 November 2005. Out of Newman's one-man operation grew a team of multiple people for a remake of the mod as a standalone game. Valve, the developers of Source, contacted Newman to suggest a commercial, standalone release of the mod through their digital distribution service Steam, which Newman initially rejected. Valve and Facepunch later struck a publishing agreement wherein Valve would release Garry's Mod onto Steam at a price of , while the two companies would equally share profits. The last free version of Garry's Mod remained available for download, rechristened as the demo to the retail game. The standalone game was released on 29 November 2006. Despite the game no longer being a mod, Valve and Facepunch stuck with the \\"Garry's Mod\\" name, which Newman later cited as a mistake, stating that he should have called it \\"Sandbox\\" instead. Because Garry's Mod still required a separate Source-based game to function properly, a bundle including Garry's Mod and Valve's Counter-Strike: Source was also released. A port of the Microsoft Windows version for Mac OS X was released on 23 September 2010. Support for Kinect, a full-body motion tracking peripheral, was added to the Windows version in December 2012. When Garry's Mod was moved over to Valve's SteamPipe content delivery system, with the move completed on 5 June 2013, an experimental Linux client was also introduced.  Reception  In 2005, Garry's Mod was awarded \\"PC Mod of the Year\\" by GameSpy. In 2017, Brendan Caldwell of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as a \\"must-own sandbox game\\", and PCGamesN included it in its 2019 list of \\"best sandbox games on PC\\". = Commercial performance = In its first day, Garry's Mod sold 5,729 copies, and 312,541 by early December 2008. Further sales milestones were reached with 770,628 copies sold by late October 2010, 1 million by July 2011, 1.4 million by March 2012, 3.5 million by July 2013, 6 million by September 2014, and 10 million by January 2016. By December 2019, Newman estimated that the game sold about 1.5 million copies annually, and stated that it had achieved over 15 million sales in total. Sales of the game attributed for revenues of by December 2008, by March 2013, and by February 2014. The game's success allowed Facepunch to grow further, eventually branching out into other games, such as Rust.  Successor  Newman stated in September 2015 that a sequel to Garry's Mod was in early development, with Newman looking to include virtual reality content and chose a name other than \\"Garry's Mod 2\\" for it. Newman later announced Sandbox (stylized as S&box;), a sandbox game using Unreal Engine 4, in September 2017 as a potential spiritual successor to Garry's Mod. In December 2019, Newman announced that development on the game had been paused. He resumed development in March 2020, announcing that Sandbox would be shifted to the Source 2 engine.

This is achieved as a time enabled geographic information system (GIS) on the web. All information can be used and edited freely and is intended to be a resource for education, archaeologists, historians and others. Introduction HistoAtlas provides a system to actively maintain historical information derived from historical records and check if it is consistent. It is not meant for the discovery of new historical facts but to put everything together so it can be presented as one whole story. It is an open project making sure everyone benefits from it. Everyone can use the information and can collaborate on the project. Its main audience is the general public but it should also have enough historical details so also historians should be able to enjoy it. HistoAtlas is not only able to visualize the changes in extent of different countries, but also the events that caused this change altogether, because these things are historically more important than just the change of a border. The atlas has information about different aspects of history. A few examples. * Political boundaries based on antique historical records or archeological research. * Historical events like wars, disasters, discoveries, treaties and journeys that shaped the course of time. * Facts about historical figures and their families that played an important role in history. * The evolution of cultural aspects like languages and religions. Strategy HistoAtlas aims to be a free, multilingual historical encyclopedia, intended as the most precise open content global historical reference. In concept there are some similarities to what online encyclopedia like Wikipedia are doing, with differences on how data is stored, presented and used. It is a history oriented geographic information system. Information is structured more transparently so it can be searched more efficiently and presented in different ways. Wikipedia and other encyclopedia are focused on articles and are not able to create maps efficiently because they are not meant to do this. But like Wikipedia the information and application will be made available under an open license, meaning it will be maintained by volunteers who want to share their knowledge. Consistency The vision that HistoAtlas wants to put forward is the one of a collaborative system. Scientists require that the information is correct. Making sure that data is correct will be a high priority of the system. For now only a basic system has been put in place, but this will be extended in the future.

After a grueling 10 weeks at sea, the Mayflower, with 102 passengers and a crew of about 30, reached America, dropping anchor near the tip of Cape Cod on , 1620. The Puritans believed that the Church of England was beyond redemption due to its Roman Catholic past, which forced them to pray in private. In 1608, they left England for Holland, where they could worship freely. After remaining there until 1620, a number of the Puritans purchased boats to cross the Atlantic for America, which they considered a \\"new Promised Land,\\" and where they established Plymouth Colony. The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America in early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, the Mayflower. Arriving in November, they had to survive unprepared through a harsh winter. As a result, only half of the original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth. Without the help of local Indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering and other survival skills, all of the colonists may have perished. The following winter, they celebrated the colony's first fall harvest along with the Indigenous people, which became the first Thanksgiving.Weinstein, Allen, and Rubel, David. The Story of America, Agincourt Press Production, (2002) pp. 60-61 The Pilgrims created and signed the Mayflower Compact while on the ship. The Compact was an agreement made among the passengers before going ashore to establish a rudimentary form of democracy, in which each member would contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement. As one of the earliest pilgrim vessels, the ship has become a cultural icon in the history of the United States.\\"The Mayflower and the Birth of America\\", Sky History Celebrations for the 400th Anniversary of the landing have been planned during 2020 in the U.S., England and the Netherlands; however, the coronavirus pandemic has put some of those plans on hold. The U.S. Postal Service issued a new \\"Mayflower\\" stamp which went on sale September 17, 2020.\\"Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor\\" stamp, USPS  Motivations for the voyage  A congregation of approximately four hundred English Puritans living in exile in Leiden, Holland, was determined to purge the Church of England of what they felt were many excesses and abuses. But rather than work for change in England, they chose to live as separatists in religiously tolerant Holland in 1608. As separatists, they were considered illegal radicals by their home country of England.Philbrick, Nathaniel. Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, Penguin Publishing (2006) ebook The government of Leiden was recognized for offering financial aid to reformed churches, whether English, French or German, which made it a sought-after destination for Protestant intellectuals.Fraser, Rebecca. The Mayflower, St. Martin's Press, N.Y. (2017) Many of the separatists were illegal members of a church in Nottinghamshire England, secretly practicing their Puritan form of Protestantism. When they learned that the authorities were aware of their congregation, church members fled in the night with little more than the clothes they were wearing, and clandestinely made it to Holland. Painting by Isaac Claesz. Van Swanenburg of workers in Leiden's wool industry However, life in Holland became increasingly difficult for the congregation. They were forced into menial and backbreaking jobs, such as cleaning wool, which led to a variety of health afflictions. In addition, a number of the country's leading theologians began engaging in open debates which led to civil unrest, instilling the fear that Spain might again place Holland's population under siege, as it had done years earlier. England's James I subsequently formed an alliance with Holland against Spain, with a condition outlawing independent English church congregations in Holland. Thus formed the separatists' motivating factors to sail for the New World, with the benefit of being beyond the reach of King James and his bishops. Their desire to travel to America was considered audacious and risky, as previous attempts to settle in North America had failed. Jamestown, founded in 1607, saw most of its settlers die within the first year. 440 of the 500 new arrivals died of starvation during the first six months of winter. The Puritan separatists also learned of the constant threat of attacks by Indigenous peoples. But despite all the arguments against traveling to this new land, their conviction that God wanted them to go held sway: \\"We verily believe and trust the Lord is with us,\\" they wrote, \\"and that He will graciously prosper our endeavors according to the simplicity of our hearts therein.\\" Voyage= Leaving Holland = After deciding to leave Holland, they planned to cross the Atlantic using two purchased ships. A small ship with the name Speedwell would first carry them from Leiden to England. Then the larger Mayflower would be used to transport most of the passengers and supplies the rest of the way. John Carver, William Bradford and Miles Standish at prayer during their voyage to North America. 1844 painting by Robert Walter Weir. Not all of the Separatists were able to depart, however. Many did not have enough time to settle their affairs and their budgets were too meager to buy the necessary travel supplies. The congregation therefore decided that the younger and stronger members should go first, with others possibly following in the future. Although the congregation had been led by John Robinson, who first proposed the idea of emigrating to America, he chose to remain in Leiden to care for those who could not make the voyage. In explaining to his congregation why they should emigrate, Robinson used the analogy of the ancient Israelites leaving Babylon to escape bondage by returning to Jerusalem, where they would build their temple.Marshall, Peter. The Light and the Glory, Baker Publishing Group (1977) p. 20 \\"The Pilgrims and Puritans actually referred to themselves as God's New Israel,\\" writes Peter Marshall. It was therefore the manifest destiny of the Puritans to similarly build a \\"spiritual Jerusalem\\" in America. When it was time to leave, the ship's senior leader, Edward Winslow, described the scene of families being separated at the departure: \\"A flood of tears was poured out. Those not sailing accompanied us to the ship, but were not able to speak to one another for the abundance of sorrow before parting.\\"Hilton, Christopher. Mayflower: The Voyage that Changed the World, History Press ebook (2005) William Bradford, another leader who would be the second Governor of the Plymouth Colony, similarly described the departure: The trip to the south coast of England took three days, where the ship took anchor at Southampton on , 1620. From there, the Pilgrims first laid eyes on their larger ship, the Mayflower, as it was being loaded with provisions. =Speedwell and Mayflower= Mayflower II, a replica of the original \\"Mayflower\\" docked at Plymouth, Massachusetts Carrying about 65 passengers, the Mayflower left London in mid July 1620.Charles Edward Banks p.17 The ship then proceeded down the Thames to the south coast of England, where it anchored at Southampton, Hampshire. There she waited for the planned rendezvous on July 22 with the Speedwell, coming from Holland with members of the Leiden congregation.Jackson, Kevin. Mayflower: The Voyage from Hell, Amazon ebook, 2013 Although both ships planned to depart for America by the end of July, a leak was discovered on the Speedwell, which had to be repaired.Whittock, Martyn. Mayflower Lives: Pilgrims in a New World and the Early American Experience, Pegasus Books (2019) ebook The ships set sail for America around August 5, but Speedwell sprang another leak shortly after, which necessitated the ships' return to Dartmouth for repairs. They made a new start after the repairs, but more than 200 miles (320 km) beyond Land's End at the southwestern tip of England, the Speedwell sprang a third leak. It was now early September, and they had no choice but to abandon Speedwell and make a determination on her passengers. This was a dire event, as vital funds had been wasted on the ship, which were considered very important to the future success of their settlement in America. Both ships returned to Plymouth, where twenty Speedwell passengers joined the now overcrowded Mayflower, while the others returned to Holland.Bishop, Rev. E. W., \\"The Pilgrim Forefathers\\", Lansing State Journal (Michigan), Oct. 2, 1920 p. 4 They waited for seven more days until the wind picked up. William Bradford was especially worried, however: \\"We lie here waiting for as fair a wind as can blow... Our victuals will be half eaten up, I think, before we go from the coast of England; and, if our voyage last long, we shall not have a month's victuals when we come in the country.\\"Arber, Edward. The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers, 1606-1623, Ward and Downey, Limited (1897) According to Bradford, Speedwell was refitted and seaworthy, having \\"made many voyages... to the great profit of her owners.\\" He suggested that Speedwells master may have used \\"cunning and deceit\\" to abort the voyage by causing the leaks, fearing starvation and death in America.Philbrick, Nathaniel. Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War, (Penguin Books 2006) =Mayflower sets sail= In early September, western gales turned the North Atlantic into a dangerous place to sail. The Mayflowers provisions were already quite low when departing Southampton, and they became lower still by delays of more than a month. The passengers had been on board the ship this entire time, feeling worn out and in no condition for a very taxing, lengthy Atlantic journey cooped up in the cramped spaces of a small ship. When the Mayflower sailed from Plymouth alone on , 1620, with what Bradford called \\"a prosperous wind\\", she carried 102 passengers plus a crew of 25 to 30 officers and men, bringing the total aboard to approximately 130.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who Came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and \\"Little James\\" in 1623, orig. pub 1929, reprint 2006 by Genealogical Publishing Co., p. 17‚Äì19 However, at about 180 tons, the Mayflower was considered a smaller cargo ship, having traveled mainly between England and Bordeaux with clothing and wine, not an ocean ship. Nor was it in good shape, as it was sold for scrap four years after her Atlantic voyage. She was a high built craft forward and aft measuring approximately 100 feet (30 m) in length and about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point.Bunker, Nick. Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History, Knopf, New York (2011) = The trip across the Atlantic = The Mayflower at sea, drawing from a book, c 1893 The living quarters for the 102 passengers were cramped, with the living area about 80 feet by 20 feet (1,600 sq. feet,) and the ceiling about five feet high. With couples and children packed closely together for a trip lasting two months, a great deal of trust and confidence was required among everyone aboard.Cutaway illustration of the Mayflower John Carver, one of the leaders on the ship, often inspired the Pilgrims with a \\"sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose.\\" He was later called the \\"Moses of the Pilgrims,\\" notes historian Jon Meacham.Meacham, Jon, American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation, Random House, 2006, p. 40. The Pilgrims \\"believed they had a covenant like the Jewish people of old,\\" writes author Rebecca Fraser. \\"America was the new Promised Land.\\" In a similar vein, early American writer James Russell Lowell stated, \\"Next to the fugitives whom Moses led out of Egypt, the little shipload of outcasts who landed at Plymouth are destined to influence the future of the world.\\"Ames, Azel; Bradford, William. of the Mayflower Voyage and the Destiny of Its Passenger, Madison & Adams Press (2018), public domain (CC BY-SA 3.0) The first half of the voyage proceeded over calm seas and under pleasant skies. Then the weather changed, with continuous Northeasterly storms hurling themselves against the ship, and huge waves constantly crashing against the topside deck. In the midst of one storm, the servant of physician Samuel Fuller died and was buried at sea. A baby was also born, christened Oceanus Hopkins. During another storm, so fierce that the sails could not be used, the ship was forced to drift without hoisting its sails for days, or else risk losing her masts. The storm washed a male passenger, John Howland, overboard. He had sunk about 12 feet until a crew member threw out a rope, which Howland managed to grab, and he was safely pulled back on board. Mayflower II cabin interior The passengers were forced to crouch in semi-darkness below deck as ocean swells rose to over a hundred feet. With waves tossing the boat in different directions, men held onto their wives, who themselves held onto their children. Water was soaking everyone and everything above and below deck. However, in mid-ocean, the ship came close to being totally disabled and may have had to return to England or risk sinking. A storm had so badly damaged its main beam that even the sailors despaired. By a stroke of luck, one of the colonists had a metal jackscrew that he had purchased in Holland to help in the construction of the new settler homes. They used it to secure the beam, which kept it from cracking further, thus maintaining the seaworthiness of the vessel. All told, despite the crowding, unsanitary conditions and sea sicknesses, there was only one fatality during the voyage. The ship's cargo included many stores that supplied the Pilgrims with the essentials needed for their journey and future lives. It is assumed that they carried tools, food and weapons, as well as some live animals, including dogs, sheep, goats, and poultry. The ship also held two small 21-foot boats powered by oars or sails. There were also artillery pieces aboard, which they might need to defend themselves against enemy European forces or indigenous tribes.Hodgson, Godfrey. A Great and Godly Adventure. Public Affairs: New York, 2006 Arrival in America Landing of the Pilgrims, painting by Charles Lucy (c. 1898) On , 1620, they sighted present-day Cape Cod. They spent several days trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, where they had obtained permission to settle from the Company of Merchant Adventurers. But the strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, known today as Provincetown Harbor, and they set anchor on . It was before setting anchor that the Mayflower Compact was drawn up and signed by the male Puritans and non-Puritan passengers (whom the Puritans referred to as \\"Strangers\\"). Among the resolutions in the Compact were those establishing legal order and to quell increasing strife within the ranks.Eugene Aubrey Stratton.

Myles Standish was selected to make sure the rules were obeyed, as there was a consensus that discipline would need to be enforced to ensure the survival of the planned colony. Once they agreed to settle and build a self-governing community, they came ashore. The moment the Pilgrims stepped ashore was described by William Bradford, the second Governor of the Plymouth Colony: =First winter= On Monday, , an exploring expedition was launched under the direction of Capt. Christopher Jones to search for a suitable settlement site. There were 34 persons in the open small boat: 24 passengers and 10 sailors. They were ill prepared for the bitter winter weather which they encountered on their reconnoiter, as the Puritans were not accustomed to winter weather which was much colder than back home. They were forced to spend the night ashore due to the bad weather they encountered, ill-clad in below-freezing temperatures with wet shoes and stockings that froze overnight. Bradford wrote, \\"Some of our people that are dead took the original of their death here\\" on the expedition. Plymouth faced many difficulties during its first winter, the most notable being the risk of starvation and the lack of suitable shelter. The Pilgrims had no way of knowing that the ground would be frozen by the middle of November, making it impossible to do any planting. Nor were they prepared for the snow storms that would make the countryside impassable without snowshoes. And in their haste to leave, they did not think to bring any fishing rods. From the beginning, the assistance they received from the local Native Americans was vital. One colonist's journal reported, \\"We dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, and a bag of beans. ... In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.\\" Governor Bradford held out hope: During the winter, the passengers remained on board Mayflower, suffering an outbreak of a contagious disease described as a mixture of scurvy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. After it was over, only 53 passengers remained‚Äîjust over half; half of the crew died as well. In the spring, they built huts ashore, and the passengers disembarked from Mayflower on , 1621. Historian Benson John Lossing described that first settlement: Jones had originally planned to return to England as soon as the Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, and he realized that he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor \\"till he saw his men began to recover.\\" Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620‚Äì21, then set sail for England on , 1621. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, and more than a dozen sailors. Mayflower made excellent time on her voyage back to England. The westerly winds that had buffeted her on the initial voyage pushed her along on the return trip home. She arrived in London on , 1621,John Harris, Saga Of The Pilgrims(historical analysis), (Globe Newspaper Co., 1983), webpages (no links between): UCcom-saga1 and UCcom-saga11 less than half the time that it had taken her to sail to America.\\" Passengers Some families traveled together, while some men came alone, leaving families in England and Leiden. Just over a third of the passengers were Puritan separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Other passengers were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. The passengers mostly slept and lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 feet large (23 m √ó 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m √ó 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall would be unable to stand up straight. The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.Caffrey, Kate. The Mayflower. New York: Stein and Day, 1974 Passengers would pass the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games. They consumed large amounts of alcohol such as beer with meals. This was known to be safer than water, which often came from polluted sources and caused disease. No cattle or beasts of draft or burden were brought on the journey, but there were pigs, goats, and poultry.  Mayflower ship history  There were 26 vessels bearing the name Mayflower in the Port Books of England during the reign of James I (1603‚Äì1625); it is not known why the name was so popular.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who Came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (orig. pub: 1929 reprint: 2006 by Genealogical Publishing Co.), p. 22 The identity of Captain Jones's Mayflower is based on records from her home port, her tonnage (est. 180‚Äì200 tons), and the master's name in 1620 in order to avoid confusion with the many other Mayflower ships. It is not known when and where Mayflower was built, although late records designate her as \\"of London\\". She was designated in the Port Books of 1609‚Äì11 as \\"of Harwich\\" in the county of Essex, coincidentally the birthplace of Mayflower master Christopher Jones about 1570.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who Came to Plymouth on Mayflower in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (orig. pub: 1929, reprint: 2006 by Genealogical Publishing Co.), p. 19 Records dating from August 1609 note Christopher Jones as master and part owner of Mayflower when his ship was chartered for a voyage from London to Trondheim in Norway and back to London. The ship lost an anchor on her return due to bad weather, and she made short delivery of her cargo of herring. Litigation resulted, and this was still proceeding in 1612. According to records, the ship was twice on the Thames at London in 1613, once in July and again in October and November, and in 1616 she was on the Thames carrying a cargo of wine, which suggests that the ship had recently been on a voyage to France, Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, or some other wine-producing land. Jones sailed Mayflower cross-Channel, taking English woolens to France and bringing French wine back to London. He also transported hats, hemp, Spanish salt, hops, and vinegar to Norway, and he may have taken Mayflower whaling in the North Atlantic in the Greenland area or sailed to Mediterranean ports. After 1616, there is no further record which specifically relates to Jones's Mayflower until 1624. This is unusual for a ship trading to London, as it would not usually disappear from the records for such a long time. No Admiralty court document can be found relating to the pilgrim fathers' voyage of 1620, although this might be due to the unusual way in which the transfer of the pilgrims was arranged from Leyden to New England, or some of the records of the period might have been lost. Jones was one of the owners of the ship by 1620, along with Christopher Nichols, Robert Child, and Thomas Short. It was from Child and Jones that Thomas Weston chartered her in the summer of 1620 to undertake the Pilgrim voyage. Weston had a significant role in Mayflower voyage due to his membership in the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, and he eventually traveled to the Plymouth Colony himself.Banks, Charles Edward. The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (orig. pub: 1929 reprint: 2006 by Genealogical Publishing Co.), p. 17. = Later history = Three of Mayflower's owners applied to the Admiralty court for an appraisal of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship for the purpose of settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The appraisement is extant and provides information on ship's gear on board at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms. The ship may have been laid up since Jones' death and allowed to get out of repair, as that is what the appraisal indicates.R. G. Marsden, The Mayflower English Historical Review (19 October 1904), p. 677 The vessel was valued at one hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eight shillings, and fourpence.Kate Caffrey, The Mayflower Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; Reissue edition (October 18, 2014), p. 324 What finally became of Mayflower is an unsettled issue. Charles Edward Banks, an English historian of the Pilgrim ship, claims that the ship was finally broken up, with her timbers used in the construction of a barn at Jordans village in Buckinghamshire. Tradition claims that this barn still exists as the Mayflower Barn, located within the grounds of Old Jordan in South Buckinghamshire. In 1624, Thomas Russell supposedly added to part of a farmhouse already there with timbers from a ship, believed to be from the Pilgrim ship Mayflower, bought from a shipbreaker's yard in Rotherhithe. The well-preserved structure was a tourist attraction, receiving visitors each year from all over the world and particularly from America, but it is now privately owned and not open to the public. =Second Mayflower= Another ship called Mayflower made a voyage from London to Plymouth Colony in 1629 carrying 35 passengers, many from the Pilgrim congregation in Leiden that organized the first voyage. This was not the same ship that made the original voyage with the first settlers. The 1629 voyage began in May and reached Plymouth in August; this ship also made the crossing from England to America in 1630 (as part of the Winthrop Fleet), 1633, 1634, and 1639. It attempted the trip again in 1641, departing London in October of that year under master John Cole, with 140 passengers bound for Virginia. It never arrived. On October 18, 1642, a deposition was made in England regarding the loss.  Mayflower structure and layout  Mayflower was square-rigged with a beakhead bow and high, castle-like structures fore and aft which protected the crew and the main deck from the elements‚Äîdesigns that were typical of English merchant ships of the early 17th century. Her stern carried a 30-foot high, square aft-castle which made the ship difficult to sail close to the wind and not well suited against the North Atlantic's prevailing westerlies, especially in the fall and winter of 1620; the voyage from England to America took more than two months as a result. Mayflowers return trip to London in April‚ÄìMay 1621 took less than half that time, with the same strong winds now blowing in the direction of the voyage. Mayflowers exact dimensions are not known, but she probably measured about 100 feet (30 m) from the beak of her prow to the tip of her stern superstructure, about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point, and the bottom of her keel about 12 feet (3.6 m) below the waterline. William Bradford estimated that she had a cargo capacity of 180 tons, and surviving records indicate that she could carry 180 casks holding hundreds of gallons each. The general layout of the ship was as follows: * Three masts: mizzen (aft), main (midship), and fore, and also a spritsail in the bow area * Three primary levels: main deck, gun deck, and cargo hold Aft on the main deck in the stern was the cabin for Master Christopher Jones, measuring about ten by seven feet (3 m √ó 2.1 m). Forward of that was the steerage room, which probably housed berths for the ship's officers and contained the ship's compass and whipstaff (tiller extension) for sailing control. Forward of the steerage room was the capstan, a vertical axle used to pull in ropes or cables. Far forward on the main deck, just aft of the bow, was the forecastle space where the ship's cook prepared meals for the crew; it may also have been where the sailors slept. The poop deck was located on the ship's highest level above the stern on the aft castle and above Master Jones' cabin. On this deck stood the poop house, which was ordinarily a chart room or a cabin for the master's mates on most merchant ships; but it might have been used by the passengers on Mayflower, either for sleeping or cargo. The gun deck was where the passengers resided during the voyage, in a space measuring about with a ceiling. But it was a dangerous place if there was conflict, as it had gun ports from which cannon could be run out to fire on the enemy. The gun room was in the stern area of the deck, to which passengers had no access because it was the storage space for gunpowder and ammunition. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannon used to fire from the ship's stern. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, similar in function to the steerage capstan, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck, which they could reach only by climbing a wooden or rope ladder. Below the gun deck was the cargo hold where the passengers kept most of their food stores and other supplies, including most of their clothing and bedding. It stored the passengers' personal weapons and military equipment, such as armor, muskets, gunpowder and shot, swords, and bandoliers. It also stored all the tools that the Pilgrims would need, as well as all the equipment and utensils needed to prepare meals in the New World. Some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold. There was no privy on Mayflower; passengers and crew had to fend for themselves in that regard. Gun deck passengers most likely used a bucket as a chamber pot, fixed to the deck or bulkhead to keep it from being jostled at sea. Mayflower was heavily armed; her largest gun was a minion cannon which was brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) cannonball almost a mile (1,600 m). She also had a saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) and shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85‚Äì140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long-range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Ship's Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify Plymouth Colony.  Mayflower officers, crew, and others  According to author Charles Banks, the officers and crew of Mayflower consisted of a captain, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cooks, boatswains, gunners, and about 36 men before the mast, making a total of about 50. The entire crew stayed with Mayflower in Plymouth through the winter of 1620‚Äì1621, and about half of them died during that time. The remaining crewmen returned to England on Mayflower, which sailed for London on , 1621.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 18Eugene Aubrey Stratton.

The 300th Anniversary of Mayflower's Landing was commemorated in 1920 and early 1921 by celebrations throughout the United States and by countries in Europe. Delegations from England, Holland and Canada met in New York.

Located on the east rim of Canyon Diablo approximately east of Flagstaff, Two Guns prospered as a tourist stop along Route 66. History Two Guns from across Canyon Diablo Two Guns in 2013 Abandoned gas pump islands Canyon Diablo Bridge at Two Guns is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Early history= Native artifacts found at Two Guns have been dated to between 1050 and 1600 AD. As white settlers began to populate the area in the mid-19th century, Two Guns was recognized as an ideal place to cross Canyon Diablo, first by wagon, then later by vehicle. Two Guns was the site of a mass murder of Apaches by their Navajo enemies in 1878. A group of Apaches had hid in a cave at Two Guns to avoid detection, but were discovered by the Navajos, who lit sagebrush fires at the cave's exit and shot any Apaches trying to escape. The fire asphyxiated 42 Apaches, after which they were stripped of their valuables. The murder site is referred to as the \\"death cave\\". During the winter of 1879-80, Billy the Kid and his outlaw gang hid in the ruins of a stone house and corral on the west rim of Canyon Diablo, across from Two Guns. In 1880, long before Two Guns was established as a settlement, the construction of the Santa Fe Railway was progressing across northern Arizona. At the location where the rail line crossed Canyon Diablo, about north of Two Guns, construction was delayed while a trestle was built. A settlement populated by male work crews was established near the construction site and was named Canyon Diablo, after the nearby canyon. The settlement \\"quickly became a wild and lawless place as drifters, gamblers, and outlaws made their way to town\\". Four men employed by the Hashknife Ranch robbed the train at Canyon Diablo in 1889, then fled on horseback with $100,000 in currency, 2,500 new silver dollars, $40,000 in gold coins, as well as silver watches, jewelry, and diamonds. A posse led by sheriff Buckey O'Neill pursued the bandits, but recovered less than $100 when the men were captured. Years later, after release from prison, one of the thieves disclosed that the stolen goods, along with their rifles, had been buried in the canyon rim near Two Guns. The location remains popular with treasure hunters. The National Old Trails Highway (called the \\"Santa Fe Highway\\" in Arizona) was built in 1907 in Arizona, and loosely followed the railway. The highway crossed the dry river bed of Canyon Diablo at the Two Guns location, and zig-zagged up and down each embankment. In 1915, Canyon Diablo Bridge opened at the Two Guns crossing, and was used until 1938 when a new bridge was built nearby. =Settlement= The first settler at Two Guns was Ed Randolph, who built a store next to the death cave. In 1922, Earle and Louise Cundiff purchased of land from Randolph at this location for $1,000, and built a store, restaurant, and gasoline pumps. Harry E. Miller leased a property from the Cundiffs in 1925 and began extensive construction. Calling himself \\"Chief Crazy Thunder\\", Miller wanted to capitalize on the beauty of Canyon Diablo and the flow of passing tourists. Along the canyon rim Miller erected a zoo with cages made of brick, mortar and chicken wire; his zoo animals included mountain lions, cougars, gila monsters, coral snakes, birds and a lynx. A restaurant and Indian gift shop were opened, and Miller cleaned out the death cave, selling any Apache skulls found inside as souvenirs. For a fee, visitors were led on a tour which began at a Hopi house Miller had built, where rolls of colored piki bread was made and sold. They then followed a paved path down the side of the canyon to a soft drink stand at the bottom. Next was a tour of the death cave, where Miller had installed electric lights, and fake ruins of cliff dwellers. Flamboyant signs were placed along the highway, and Miller named his establishment \\"Fort Two Guns\\" as an homage to silent movie actor William S. \\"Two Guns\\" Hart, with whom Miller claimed to have previously worked. The Cundiffs applied for a post office under the name \\"Two Guns\\" in 1924, but it was refused. The post office was renamed \\"Canyon Lodge\\". In 1925, \\"Rimmy\\" Jim Giddings opened a gas station and cafe at Two Guns called Rimmy Jim's. Another location burned down in 1969. In 1926, the highway designation was changed to U.S. Route 66. That same year, Cundiff and Miller had a disagreement about the details of their lease, and Miller shot the unarmed Cundiff to death. He was later acquitted of the killing. The interior of Miller's store burned in 1929, and soon after, Louise Cundiff built her own tourist store. The following year, Miller left the state. Cundiff remarried, and in 1934 opened the Two Guns Texaco service station along a new alignment of Route 66. Behind it they relocated the zoo (which closed prior to 1950). In 1938, a new bridge across Canyon Diablo was built, and Route 66 began following Interstate 40 at the Two Guns location. A more modern service station was built at Two Guns in 1963, and in the late 1960s a motel, western tavern, reptile exhibit, and new zoo were added. Later, a Shell service station was built and a KOA campground opened. =Decline= The service station burned in 1971, and Two Guns began to decline. The ruins of many former structures remain, including the trading post, campground, old cottages, zoo, and burned-out service station. In 1988, Canyon Diablo Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

() (;\\"Tolstoy\\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Russian: ,In Tolstoy's day, his name was written as in post-reformed Russian tr. ; ; ), usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. He received multiple nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1910, and that he never won is a major controversy. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852‚Äì1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859), and Hadji Murad (1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays. In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma GandhiMartin E. Hellman, Resist Not Evil in World Without Violence (Arun Gandhi ed.), M.K. Gandhi Institute, 1994, retrieved on 14 December 2006 and Martin Luther King Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly Resurrection (1899).  Origins  The Tolstoys were a well-known family of old Russian nobility who traced their ancestry to a mythical nobleman named Indris described by Pyotr Tolstoy as arriving \\"from Nemec, from the lands of Caesar\\" to Chernigov in 1353 along with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis) and Zimonten (or Zigmont) and a druzhina of 3000 people.Vitold Rummel, Vladimir Golubtsov (1886).

Suvorin Publishing House, p. 487Ivan Bunin, The Liberation of Tolstoy: A Tale of Two Writers, p. 100 While the word \\"Nemec\\" has been long used to describe Germans only, at that time it was applied to any foreigner who didn't speak Russian (from the word nemoy meaning mute).Nemoy/–ù–µ–º–æ–π word meaning from the Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary (in Russian) Indris was then converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, under the name of Leonty, and his sons as Konstantin and Feodor. Konstantin's grandson Andrei Kharitonovich was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as fat) by Vasily II of Moscow after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow. Because of the pagan names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by Demetrius I Starshy some researchers concluded that they were Lithuanians who arrived from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14th- to-16th-century documents, while the Chernigov Chronicles used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost. The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived during the 17th century, thus Pyotr Tolstoy himself is generally considered the founder of the noble house, being granted the title of count by Peter the Great.Tolstoy coat of arms by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire. Part 2, 30 June 1798 (in Russian)The Tolstoys article from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1890‚Äì1907 (in Russian)  Life and career  Tolstoy at age 20, 1848 Tolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana, a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula, Russia, and 200 kilometres (120 mi) south of Moscow. He was the fourth of five children of Count Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794‚Äì1837), a veteran of the Patriotic War of 1812, and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (n√©e Volkonskaya; 1790‚Äì1830). His mother died when he was two and his father when he was nine. Tolstoy and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at Kazan University, where teachers described him as \\"both unable and unwilling to learn\\". Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much time in Moscow, Tula and Saint Petersburg, leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle. He began writing during this period, including his first novel Childhood, a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852. In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the Caucasus and joined the army. Tolstoy served as a young artillery officer during the Crimean War and was in Sevastopol during the 11-month-long siege of Sevastopol in 1854‚Äì55, including the Battle of the Chernaya. During the war he was recognised for his courage and promoted to lieutenant.\\"Ten Things You Didn't Know About Tolstoy\\". BBC. He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare, and left the army after the end of the Crimean War. His experience in the army, and two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860‚Äì61 converted Tolstoy from a dissolute and privileged society author to a non-violent and spiritual anarchist. Others who followed the same path were Alexander Herzen, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a letter to his friend Vasily Botkin, Tolstoy wrote: \\"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\\"A.N. Wilson, Tolstoy (1988), p. 146 Tolstoy's concept of non-violence or ahimsa was bolstered when he read a German version of the Tirukkural. He later instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his A Letter to a Hindu when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice. His European trip in 1860‚Äì61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met Victor Hugo. Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished Les Mis√©rables. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's War and Peace indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's forthcoming publication, La Guerre et la Paix (\\"War and Peace\\" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece. The two men also discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \\"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\\" Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been emancipated from serfdom in 1861. Tolstoy described the schools' principles in his 1862 essay \\"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\\". His educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to A.S. Neill's Summerhill School, the school at Yasnaya Polyana can justifiably be claimed the first example of a coherent theory of democratic education.  Personal life  The death of his brother Nikolay in 1860 had an impact on Tolstoy, and led him to a desire to marry. On 23 September 1862, Tolstoy married Sophia Andreevna Behrs, who was sixteen years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends.Susan Jacoby, \\"The Wife of the Genius\\" (19 April 1981) The New York Times They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:Feuer, Kathryn B.

Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose War and Peace and Anna Karenina with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and hand-writing his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing War and Peace and had to have clean final drafts to be delivered to the publisher. However, their later life together has been described by A.N. Wilson as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works. Some of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the 1905 Russian Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union, and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Tolstoy's son, Count Lev Lvovich Tolstoy, settled in Sweden and married a Swedish woman.

His cousin Fyokla Tolstaya (born Anna Tolstaya in 1971), daughter of the acclaimed Soviet Slavist Nikita Tolstoy (ru) (1923‚Äì1996), is also a Russian journalist, TV and radio host.  Novels and fictional works  Tolstoy in 1897 Tolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina and novellas such as Hadji Murad and The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Tolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852‚Äì1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up. Tolstoy served as a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment during the Crimean War, recounted in his Sevastopol Sketches. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent pacifism and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism.

E Crankshaw ‚Äì 1974 ‚Äì Weidenfeld & Nicolson The Cossacks (1863) describes the Cossack life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. Anna Karenina (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in War and Peace, Levin in Anna Karenina and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in Resurrection. War and Peace is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of Napoleon, from the court of Alexander I of Russia to the battlefields of Austerlitz and Borodino. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the Decembrist revolt, to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that Andrei Bolkonsky's son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider War and Peace to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.Tolstoy and the Development of Realism.

Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of Georgism, of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life. Tolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as Volga-bogatyr and Oaf stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his Russian Book for Reading, a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the New Azbuka textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, \\"Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time\\". According to Valentin Bulgakov, he criticised poets, including Alexander Pushkin, for their \\"false\\" epithets used \\"simply to make it rhyme\\".Leo Tolstoy (1874).

Moscow: Zakharov, 352 pages, p. 29  Critical appraisal by other authors  Tolstoy's contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who died thirty years before Tolstoy, admired and was delighted by Tolstoy's novels (and, conversely, Tolstoy also admired Dostoyevsky's work). Gustave Flaubert, on reading a translation of War and Peace, exclaimed, \\"What an artist and what a psychologist!\\" Anton Chekhov, who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \\"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\\" The 19th-century British poet and critic Matthew Arnold opined that \\"A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.\\" Later novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote \\"I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism.\\" Virginia Woolf declared him \\"the greatest of all novelists.\\" James Joyce noted that \\"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\\" Thomas Mann wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \\"Seldom did art work so much like nature.\\" Vladimir Nabokov heaped superlatives upon The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Anna Karenina; he questioned, however, the reputation of War and Peace, and sharply criticized Resurrection and The Kreutzer Sonata. Religious and political beliefs Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by Ilya Repin (1901) After reading Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes. In 1869 he writes: \\"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\\".Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, 30 August 1869 In Chapter VI of A Confession, Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete denial of self causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the description of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: > But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for > eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior (Matthew > 19:24): \\"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than > for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\\" Therefore, those who were > greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose voluntary poverty > when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus > Buddha Sakyamuni was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's > staff; and Francis of Assisi, the founder of the mendicant orders who, as a > youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were > sitting together, was asked: \\"Now Francis, will you not soon make your > choice from these beauties?\\" and who replied: \\"I have made a far more > beautiful choice!\\" \\"Whom?\\" \\"La povert√† (poverty)\\": whereupon he abandoned > every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a > mendicant.Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. II, ¬ß 170 In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called What I Believe, in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in Jesus Christ's teachings and was particularly influenced by the Sermon on the Mount, and the injunction to turn the other cheek, which he understood as a \\"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\\" and a doctrine of pacifism and nonviolence. In his work The Kingdom of God Is Within You, he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \\"perversion\\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American Quakers who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as George Fox, William Penn and Jonathan Dymond. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments, is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist. Later, various versions of \\"Tolstoy's Bible\\" were published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.Orwin, Donna T. The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy. Cambridge University Press, 2002 Mohandas K. Gandhi and other residents of Tolstoy Farm, South Africa, 1910 Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner perfection through following the Great Commandment of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is nonresistance during conflict. This idea in Tolstoy's book The Kingdom of God Is Within You (full text of English translation available on Wikisource) directly influenced Mahatma Gandhi and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day.

Tolstoy's passion from the depth of his austere moral views is reflected in his later work. One example is the sequence of the temptation of Sergius in Father Sergius. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before him and Chekhov and Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Later passages of rare power include the personal crises faced by the protagonists of The Death of Ivan Ilyich, and of Master and Man, where the main character in the former and the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives. Tolstoy had a profound influence on the development of Christian anarchist thought. The Tolstoyans were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, Vladimir Chertkov (1854‚Äì1936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Philosopher Peter Kropotkin wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: > Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in > the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, Chojecki, > Denk and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the state and > property rights, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the > teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the > might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in The Kingdom of God Is > Within You) a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law > altogether, and especially of the present property laws. He describes the > state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. > Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. > He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now > concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the > existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he > deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all > wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments > borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the > anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non- > religious reader alike. famine relief in Samara, 1891 Tolstoy denounced the Eight-Nation Alliance intervention in the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Second Boer War between the British Empire and the Boer republics.Apollon Davidson, Irina Filatova. The Russians and the Anglo Boer War. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1998. p. 181 Tolstoy praised the Boxer Rebellion and harshly criticized the atrocities of the Russian, German, American, Japanese and other troops. He heard about the looting, rapes and murders, and accused the troops of slaughter and Christian brutality. He named the monarchs most responsible for the atrocities as Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany.(Original from the University of Michigan) He described the intervention as \\"terrible for its injustice and cruelty\\". The war was also criticized by other intellectuals such as Leonid Andreev and Gorky. As part of the criticism, Tolstoy wrote an epistle called To the Chinese people. In 1902, he wrote an open letter describing and denouncing Nicholas II's activities in China. The Boxer Rebellion stirred Tolstoy's interest in Chinese philosophy. He was a famous sinophile, and read the works of Confucius(Original from the University of Michigan) and Lao Zi. Tolstoy wrote Chinese Wisdom and other texts about China. Tolstoy corresponded with the Chinese intellectual Gu Hongming and recommended that China remain an agrarian nation, and not reform like Japan. Tolstoy and Gu opposed the Hundred Day's Reform by Kang Youwei and believed that the reform movement was perilous. Tolstoy's ideology of non- violence shaped the thought of the Chinese anarchist group Society for the Study of Socialism.

Chertkov (bald man with the beard and mustache); and students. In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Proudhon to his readers, while rejecting anarchism's espousal of violent revolutionary means. In the 1900 essay, \\"On Anarchy\\", he wrote: \\"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution‚Äîa moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\\" Despite his misgivings about anarchist violence, Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in Russia, and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \\"Words of a Rebel\\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel. G Woodcock, I Avakumoviƒá.1990. Tolstoy in his study in 1908 (age 80) In 1908, Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from British colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi read a copy of the letter when he was becoming an activist in South Africa. He wrote to Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the author, which led to further correspondence. Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You also helped to convince Gandhi of nonviolent resistance, a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy \\"the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced\\". Their correspondence lasted only a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy's death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second ashram in South Africa.Tolstoy and Gandhi, men of peace: a biography. MB Green ‚Äì 1983 ‚Äì Basic Books Both men also believed in the merits of vegetarianism, the subject of several of Tolstoy's essays.. Preface to the Russian translation of Howard William's The Ethics of Diet Tolstoy also became a major supporter of the Esperanto movement. He was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the Doukhobors and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895. He aided the Doukhobors to migrate to Canada.Mays, H.G. \\"Resurrection:Tolstoy and Canada's Doukhobors.\\" The Beaver 79. October/November 1999:38‚Äì44 He also provided inspiration to the Mennonites, another religious group with anti-government and anti-war sentiments. In 1904, Tolstoy condemned the ensuing Russo-Japanese War and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest Soyen Shaku in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement. Towards the end of his life, Tolstoy become occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of Georgism.Tolstoy: Principles For A New World Order, David Redfearn He incorporated it approvingly into works such as Resurrection (1899), the book that was a major cause for his excommunication. He spoke with great admiration of Henry George, stating once that \\"People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.\\"‚ÄúA Great Iniquity,‚Äù letter to the London Times (1905) He also wrote a preface to George's journal Social Problems. Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income for Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy heavily criticized). They also rejected a centrally planned socialist economy. Because Georgism requires an administration to collect land rent and spend it on infrastructure, some assume that this embrace moved Tolstoy away from his anarchist views. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have been proposed since then. Tolstoy's 1899 novel Resurrection explores his thoughts on Georgism and hints that Tolstoy had such a view. It suggests small communities with local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods, while still heavily criticising state institutions such as the justice system.  Death  Tolstoy's grave with flowers at Yasnaya Polyana Tolstoy died in 1910, aged 82. Just before his death, his health was a concern of his family, who cared for him daily. In his last days, he spoke and wrote about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he left home one winter night.The last days of Tolstoy. VG Chertkov. 1922.

Both performers were nominated for Oscars for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including Departure of a Grand Old Man, made in 1912 just two years after his death, How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were (1913), and Leo Tolstoy, directed by and starring Sergei Gerasimov in 1984. There is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer Burton Holmes visited Yasnaya Polyana with Albert J. Beveridge, the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in The Sunday Gentleman.

(c. 1823 or 1824) is a painting by the French artist Eug√®ne Delacroix. History Believed to be a preparatory work in oil for the artist's later Massacre at Chios, Orphan Girl at the Cemetery is nevertheless considered a masterpiece in its own right. An air of sorrow and fearfulness emanates from the picture, and tears well from the eyes of the grief-stricken girl as she looks apprehensively upward. The dimness of the sky and the abandoned laying-ground are consonant with her expression of melancholy. The girl's body language and clothing evoke tragedy and vulnerability: the dress drooping down from her shoulder, a hand laid weakly on her thigh, the shadows above the nape of her neck, the darkness at her left side, and the cold and pale coloring of her attire. All these are combined to emphasize a sense of loss, of unreachable hope, her isolation, and the absence of any means of help. For Delacroix, colors were the most important ingredients for his paintings. Because of this artistic taste and belief, he did not have the patience to create facsimiles of classical statues. He revered Peter Paul Rubens and the Venetians. He chose the use of colorful hues and exotic themes for his paintings, drawing inspiration from other inspirational places, resulting in works described as glossy and abundant with movement.

Career Kaiser, who played as a midfielder, began his career with his hometown club, Ajax, before leaving in 1980 to join Antwerp. He would later play for Coventry City and OGC Nice before returning to the Netherlands with FC Den Bosch and SVV. He ended his career in Belgium with KFC Dessel Sport. Coaching career He then moved into coaching, where he has earned a reputation as a specialist at spotting and working with young players. Kaiser spent seven years at TOP Oss, working in a variety of sporting development roles, before taking on his first managerial responsibilities at RBC, whom he managed from 1997 to 1999. He then moved to the Royal Dutch Football Association, where he initially served as assistant manager to the Olympic team, who were unable to qualify for the 2000 Olympics. In 2001, he took over as head coach of the Netherlands U-17 team, where he had his greatest successes. Working with future stars such as Rafael van der Vaart, Robin van Persie, Nigel de Jong, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder, he led the team to runner-up spot in the 2005 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and third place in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship. During this time he also headed up international scouting for the Dutch FA. From 2006 to 2007 Kaiser was coach of the Chelsea Academy, and was appointed as Dynamo Dresden manager in July 2008, replacing Eduard Geyer who was fired on 4 October 2009. Dynamo struggled for the first half of Kaiser's first season in charge, with the team generally performing well, but unable to convert this into goals. Things picked up in the second half of the season, though, and the team finished in a respectable position in the top half of the 3. Liga table. However, the following season also started badly, and in October, with six defeats in the first twelve games, Dynamo found themselves in the relegation zone, and Kaiser was sacked. In April 2010 Kaiser signed a two-year contract with Regionalliga Nord side 1. FC Magdeburg, taking over managing duties on 1 July 2010. He is the first foreign manager at the club and is tasked with building a squad that is capable of winning promotion in the 2011‚Äì2012 season. However, after a string of bad results brought the side dangerously close to relegation, Kaiser was let go on 17 March 2011, to be succeeded by Wolfgang Sandhowe. After being technical director of Lierse SK for two years, Kaiser returned to a managerial role by signing with Eerste Divisie side FC Den Bosch from July 2013.

In 2005-06, St. Jakob-Park attracted an average attendance of 23,500,Inoffizielles Statistik- Portal des FC Basel 1893 making Basel the most highly supported football club in Switzerland. In 1968, Basel competed in the European Cup for the first time, but only reached the first round. The highest stage Basel ever reached in the competition was in 1974 when they reached the quarter-finals before being eliminated by Celtic. In 2001, Basel reached the final of the UEFA Intertoto Cup where they were defeated by Aston Villa. Then in 2003 they battled through to the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Early history The Basel Coat of Arms, FC Basel's Original logo. FC Basel was started by an advertisement on 12 November 1893 that appeared in the Basler national newspaper requesting that a football team be formed and that anyone that wished to join should meet up the following Wednesday at 8:15. So, on 15 November 1893, FC Basel was born in the city of Basel. One of the early club captains was Joan Gamper, who later founded FC Barcelona in Spain. Gyula Kert√©sz coached the side from 1928-30. FC Basel did not have much of an early footballing success; it took them 40 years to win their first trophy, winning the Swiss Cup in 1933 when they defeated arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich 4‚Äì3, in what is now considered to be one of the best cup finals in Swiss football history. They won the cup again in 1947 when they beat Lausanne Sports, who had also been runners-up the previous year, 3‚Äì0 in the final at the Stadion Neufeld in Bern. Paul St√∂cklin scored two goals and Ren√© Bader scored the other one. Basel won their first league title in 1953, with club legend Bader then as player-manager. Basel ended the season three points ahead of BSC Young Boys. The team line up under Manager Bader that year was Werner Schley, Walter M√ºller, Walter Bannwart, Walter Bielser, Werner Bopp, Hansruedi Fitze, Hans H√ºgi, Josef \\"Sepp\\" H√ºgi, Ren√© Bader, Kurt Maurer, Georges Mogoy, Peter Redolfi, Kurt Thalmann and Hans Weber. Success and relegation Basel won their first trophy of the new decade in 1963; with Czechoslovakian manager Georges Sobotka at the helm, Basel stormed to Swiss Cup glory by overcoming Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich 2‚Äì0 in the final. But, FCB (which is pronounced \\"Eff Tsay Bay\\" in Swiss German) came to prominence in the late 1960s under the management of Helmut Benthaus and with quality players such as Karl Odermatt and Ottmar Hitzfeld. Benthaus' first league win as Basel manager was in 1967, finishing a single point above FC Z√ºrich. A cup final victory over Lausanne Sports also came later in the season. This led to Basel qualifying to play in the European Cup, for the first time, in 1968. Basel were knocked out of the tournament in the first round, however, by Danish side Akademisk Boldklub. Basel's next league win came in 1969, when they once again finished just one point above the runners-up, who this time were Lausanne Sports. This meant that Basel could embark on another European adventure, but they, once again, failed to overcome the first hurdle, who were Celtic of Scotland. In the 1969‚Äì70 season, Basel won the league by one point over Lausanne, once again. The European Cup was a little kinder to Basel in 1970, as they reached the second round, losing to Ajax, after defeating Soviets Spartak Moscow in the first round. Basel did not retain their title the next season despite finishing with the same number of points as the winners, Grasshopper, who won it on head-to-head. After a trophy-less season, Basel then won two league titles in-a-row, in 1972 and 1973. They also won the League Cup in 1973. In Europe, Basel failed to impress once again, in 1972, as they were sent crashing out at the first stage by Hungary's √öjpesti D√≥zsa SC. In the 1973‚Äì74 season, however, they excelled, eliminating Icelanders Fram Reykjav√≠k and Club Brugge of Belgium, before narrowly exiting in the quarter- finals to Celtic, 5‚Äì6 on aggregate. Despite Basel's improvement on the European stage, they did not retain the league for another four years, although they did manage to lift the Swiss Cup in 1975 after beating FC Winterthur 2‚Äì1 after extra time. Basel's long-awaited title-win came in 1977 as they triumphed over Servette FC in a playoff. This meant that Basel returned to play in the European Cup but they were defeated in the first round once more, this time by Wacker Innsbruck of Austria, after showing so much promise on their last European outing. After the success of the 1976‚Äì77 season, Basel endured two seasons of below-par performances and mid-table finishes until glory returned in 1980, as Basel won the Nationalliga A title through the playoff. Manager Helmut Benthaus, however, left in 1982 and in the following seasons, Basel's final league positions started to drop until their relegation into the Nationalliga B in 1988. Several managers came and went at St. Jakob Stadium between then, and when Basel finally returned to Nationalliga A in 1994 under Claude Andrey. Basel avoided relegation by three points in their first season back in the top-flight, but Andrey left and was replaced by Karl Engel. Engel led Basel to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge and a solid mid-table finish in 1997, but he was sacked after a poor start to the 1997‚Äì98 campaign, in which Basel finished second-bottom. J√∂rg Berger then took over, but lasted only a year in charge before Christian Gross came. Under Gross=1999‚Äì2005= Gross' appointment went hand-in- hand with the financial backing that had just been put into the club, and it was not long until Basel returned to the top. When St. Jakob-Park was opened in 2001, success returned. In 2002, Basel won the double (Swiss Championship and Swiss Cup) and reached the final of the Intertoto Cup. In the following season, they were the second Swiss team to ever play in the Champions League. Their first game was in the second qualifying round against M≈†K ≈Ωilina of Slovakia, where they ultimately won 4‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the next round, they faced Scottish giants Celtic. In the first leg at Celtic Park, the home side won 3‚Äì1, but in the second leg at St. Jakob-Park, FCB came away with a famous 2‚Äì0 victory, meaning Basel progressed on the away goals rule after a 3‚Äì3 aggregate draw. In the first group stage, FCB were drawn into Group B alongside Valencia, Liverpool and Spartak Moscow. On Matchday One, Basel defeated Spartak 2‚Äì0 at home, then on Matchday Two, FCB travelled to Anfield where they managed to draw 1‚Äì1 against Liverpool. After a great start to the group stage, FCB were brought back down to earth when they were defeated 6‚Äì2 by Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium. They bounced back, however, and held Valencia to a 2‚Äì2 draw in the next fixture. Basel were now sitting in second place in the group, but they would still need to win at least one of their last two games and hope that Liverpool would not pick up more than two points to secure that place. In Matchday Five, Liverpool lost 1‚Äì0 to Valencia and FCB won 2‚Äì0 against Spartak at the Luzhniki Stadium. Basel's place in the last 16 was all but secured, although they still had to make sure they did not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the final Matchday, Basel were leading 3‚Äì0 at half-time through goals from Julio Rossi, Under Christian Gross Basel reached the highest level in European football and played against the likes of Celtic. Christian Gim√©nez and Timoth√©e Atouba. The second half was a different story, however, and Liverpool fought back to draw 3‚Äì3. Nonetheless, this was still enough for FCB to qualify for the second group stage. In the last 16, Basel faced Manchester United, Juventus and Deportivo de La Coru√±a. They had a poor start, losing back-to-back games against Manchester United at home and Juventus away. FCB then faced Deportivo in a double-header, with the home side winning 1‚Äì0 in both games. Arguably two of FCB's greatest games came next as they held Manchester United to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Old Trafford and claimed a 2‚Äì1 victory over Juventus at St. Jakob-Park. Despite picking up the same number of points as second-placed Juventus, Basel was eliminated on goal difference. Basel finished second in the Swiss Super League that season and won the Swiss Cup after beating Neuch√¢tel Xamax 6‚Äì0 in the final. After being the surprise package in Europe in the 2002‚Äì03 season, Basel could not carry this form into the 2003‚Äì04 UEFA Cup, suffering elimination from Newcastle United in the second round after defeating Malatyaspor in the previous round. The club did go on to achieve some success in Europe in 2004‚Äì05, however, as they were dropped into the UEFA Cup after being eliminated by Inter Milan in the qualification stage of the 2004‚Äì05 Champions League. After they defeated Russian side Terek Grozny in the first round, they faced considerabley tougher opponents Feyenoord, Schalke 04, Ferencv√°ros and Hearts in the group stage. They drew 1‚Äì1 away to Schalke, were defeated 2‚Äì1 at home by Hearts, beat Ferencv√°ros 2‚Äì1 at Stadion Albert Fl√≥ri√°n and won 1‚Äì0 against Feyenoord at home. They finished third in the group on seven points and qualified for the Round of 32, where they were defeated 2‚Äì0 on aggregate by French side Lille. Basel also won the domestic title during the 2004‚Äì05 campaign. As Swiss champions, Basel entered the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round against German Bundesliga club Werder Bremen in 2005. Basel won the first leg 2‚Äì1 at St. Jakob-Park but lost 3‚Äì0 at the Weserstadion in the second leg, the aggregate 4‚Äì2 in Werder's favour. Basel were then dropped into the UEFA Cup, where they met ≈†iroki Brijeg of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first round. Basel sealed a one-sided 6‚Äì0 aggregate win and were drawn into Group E alongside Strasbourg, Roma, Red Star Belgrade and Troms√∏. FCB lost the first group match 2‚Äì0 against Strasbourg at home but won 2‚Äì1 away to Red Star, giving themselves an opportunity to progress to the next round if they won their next game against Troms√∏. They did in a seven-goal thriller, winning 4‚Äì3 and securing third place. The last match of the group was against Italian giants Roma at the Stadio Olimpico, where the Serie A club won 3‚Äì1. In the Round of 32, Basel came up against Monaco, who they beat 2‚Äì1 on aggregate after a 1‚Äì1 stalemate away at the Stade Louis II and a 1‚Äì0 home victory. As Basel progressed to the last 16, they played Strasbourg once again; they won the first leg 2‚Äì0 and drew 2‚Äì2 in the second leg, winning 4‚Äì2 overall. In the quarter-finals, the club came up against Middlesbrough, where they won 2‚Äì0 at home and looked certain to progress as they travelled to the Riverside Stadium. In the second leg, however, the English club fought back to win the match 4‚Äì1 and the tie 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. On 13 May 2006, Basel lost a league game at St. Jakob Park for the first time since 1 December 2002, falling 1‚Äì2 against Z√ºrich, resulting in riots and property damage by hooligans of both Basel and their rival after the match (see 2006 Basel Hooligan Incident). On 26 February 2006, Basel broke their own club record of 52 unbeaten league games at St. Jakob Park. The new record was set at 59; the streak ended on the final day of the season against FC Z√ºrich, where a last- minute goal by Iulian Filipescu of Z√ºrich knocked Basel out of contention with a 2‚Äì1 victory, and gave Z√ºrich its first national championship since 1980‚Äì81. A victory ‚Äì and the subsequent 60th-straight home league match undefeated ‚Äì would have made Basel champions. =2006‚Äìpresent=2006‚Äì07 season Basel's European campaign of 2006 started in the first qualifying stage of the UEFA Cup when they beat Kazakhi side Tobol 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the second round, they played against Liechtensteiner team Vaduz, narrowly progressing on the away goals rule after a 2‚Äì2 aggregate draw. They were then put up against Macedonians Rabotniƒçki. Basel won 6‚Äì2 at St. Jakob Park and 1‚Äì0 at the Skopje City Stadium to qualify for the group stages where they faced tough opposition: Blackburn Rovers, Nancy, Feyenoord and Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. Basel's first game came against Feyenoord at home, which finished in a respectable 1‚Äì1 draw. Their next group match was at Ewood Park against Blackburn. Basel played reasonably well but shaky defending became their downfall. Nancy, at home, were their next opponents: the match ended 2‚Äì2. Basel's last group game was against Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w at the Wis≈Ça Stadium, where FCB needed a win to qualify to the next round. Their poor European campaign, however, came to an end after losing 3‚Äì1 despite taking an early lead through Mladen Petriƒá. Basel won the Swiss Cup after beating FC Luzern 1‚Äì0. The winning goal came from the penalty spot through Daniel Majstoroviƒá in the 93rd minute. Basel finished in second place in the Swiss Super League, just one point behind winners Z√ºrich. This was despite the club defeating Z√ºrich in three of four of their direct meetings in that league campaign. 2007‚Äì08 season In 2007, Basel were drawn against Bosnian minnows FK Sarajevo in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, a tie that Basel won 8‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the next round, Basel faced a considerably tougher opponent in SV Mattersburg of Austria. Nonetheless, Basel finished the tie off with a 4‚Äì0 away win after a 2‚Äì1 victory at home. Basel were then drawn into the \\"group of death\\" of Group D alongside Brann, Dinamo Zagreb, Hamburger SV and Rennes, all of which were ranked within the top three of their own respective leagues at the start of the stage. Basel won their first group game against Rennes at home 1‚Äì0 thanks to a Marco Streller header. Their next game was away to Dinamo Zagreb, in which Basel earned a valuable away point thanks to in-form goalkeeper Franco Costanzo, who kept the game level at 0‚Äì0 for 90 minutes. They club then faced Brann at St. Jakob Park, where they won 1‚Äì0 through a Carlitos free-kick and were highly praised for playing attractive and flowing football. Basel then went to Germany to face Hamburg at the HSH Nordbank Arena, where they were fortunate to escape with a 1‚Äì1 draw. The goals came courtesy of captain Ivan Ergiƒá and Hamburg's Ivica Oliƒá. Basel then faced Sporting CP in the last 32 after qualifying second in the group alongside first-placed Hamburg and third- placed Brann. (Sporting finished third in their group in the Champions League, hence their \\"relegation\\" to the UEFA Cup.) The first leg took place on 13 February in Lisbon, where first-choice goalkeeper Franco Costanzo was injured and Basel lost 2‚Äì0. The second leg, however, did not fare any better for Basel. Costanzo remained injured and Basel lost 3‚Äì0 on 21 February in Basel, resulting in their elimination from the competition. Basel won the Swiss Cup for the second consecutive season after beating second-tier side AC Bellinzona 4‚Äì1 at St. Jakob Park on 6 April 2008. Eren Derdiyok gave Basel the lead in the first half before Bellinzona equalised through Christian Pouga in the second. Daniel Majstoroviƒá restored the lead for Basel with a header and Swiss internationalists Marco Streller and Benjamin Huggel scored one goal each to make the final scoreline 4‚Äì1 in Basel's favour. Basel won the Super League for the first time since 2005 on the 10 May 2008 at St. Jakob Park after a 2‚Äì0 win over fellow contenders Young Boys. It was the last game of the season and Basel only needed a point from the match to win the Championship. However, if Young Boys won, then they would have instead been champions, exactly the same situation as the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, only it was between Basel and Z√ºrich then. The painful memories of losing the league on the last day of the season in 2006 seemed to spur FCB on as they took an early lead through Valentin Stocker before Marco Streller wrapped up the victory with the second. This rounded off a highly successful season for Basel, as they conquered on the domestic front, winning both the Super League and Swiss Cup, and reaching the last 32 of the UEFA Cup. 2008‚Äì09 season Ivan Ergiƒá resigned from being club captain before the start of the season; goalkeeper Franco Costanzo was unveiled as the new captain a day before the season began. Basel entered the Champions League in the second qualifying round and were drawn against IFK G√∂teborg of Sweden. The first leg was played on 30 July 2008 at Ullevi, finishing 1‚Äì1; Benjamin Huggel put Basel ahead before Thomas Olsson equalised for the home team. The second leg took place on 6 August at St. Jakob Park, where Basel came from behind twice to win 4‚Äì2. Pontus Wernbloom put G√∂teborg ahead on 19 minutes before Huggel equalised soon after. Early in the second half, Robin S√∂der restored G√∂teborg's lead, but Basel fought back, with Scott Chipperfield equalising. Basel then earned a penalty due to a supposed handball in the penalty area, although replays later showed that the referee had made the wrong decision. The penalty was converted which eventually sealed the victory for Basel. The club then faced Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es in the third qualifying round. The first leg at Est√°dio D. Afonso Henriques, on 13 August, ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. The second leg took place on 27 August at St. Jakob Park, where Valentin Stocker gave Basel an early lead on 11 minutes before Jo√£o Alves was fouled in the penalty area by Fran√ßois Marque and Jo√£o Fajardo dispatched the spot-kick, just four minutes later, to draw Vit√≥ria level. In the second half, the away side started well, but Eren Derdiyok gave FCB a 2‚Äì1 lead which they hung on to, securing qualification to the competition's group stage. FCB were drawn into Group C alongside Barcelona, Shakhtar Donetsk and Sporting CP. Basel lost their opening game 2‚Äì1 at home on 16 September against Shakhtar; Fernandinho put the Ukrainians ahead on 25 minutes before J√°dson doubled their lead just before half time. David Abraham scored a late consolation goal for the home team. Sporting were the opponents on Matchday 2 (1 October), and despite defending well and causing a few scares at the other end of the park, Basel were defeated 2‚Äì0 away at the Est√°dio Jos√© Alvalade. On Matchday 3 (22 October), Barcelona visited Basel and came away with a 5‚Äì0 win, but a fortnight later it was a different story as FCB came away with a respectable 1‚Äì1 draw at the Camp Nou, with Eren Derdiyok scoring a late equaliser after Lionel Messi put Bar√ßa ahead. On 26 November, Basel travelled to Ukraine to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5‚Äì0. Basel then faced Sporting at home on the final Matchday (9 December) and were defeated 1‚Äì0. Basel finished the 2008‚Äì09 Super League season in third place (their worst finish since 2001), ending with two consecutive losses to Grasshoppers and Young Boys. On 27 May 2009, coach Gross' contract was terminated, effective at the end of the final match two days later, bringing his very eventful ten-year tenure as Basel manager to an end. On 6 June, Thorsten Fink was hired as his replacement.

Her performing career included solo appearances with leading European and American symphony orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra and Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Child Prodigy Camilla Dolores Wicks was born in Long Beach, California. Her Norwegian born father, Ingwald Wicks (Ingvald Kristian Eriksen Varhaugvik), was a distinguished violinist and teacher. Her pianist mother studied with composer Xavier Scharwenka.

She also made a number of recordings for HMV, Mercury and Philips. Camilla Wicks explored a wide range of repertoire and promoted many lesser-known works, in particular by Scandinavian composers, who in turn wrote many works for her. Norwegian composer and violinist, Bjarne Brustad dedicated a number of solo violin works to her. Wicks was an advocate of contemporary Scandinavian composers: she performed concertos by Fartein Valen and Hilding Rosenberg, and gave the world premiere of those by Harald Saeverud and Klaus Egge.

He was born in 1766, the son of a paper maker and stationer, and grandson of the engraver Paul Fourdrinier, 1698‚Äì1758, sometimes mistakenly called Pierre Fourdrinier. With his brother, Sealy, he commissioned the development of the Fourdrinier machine, a papermaking machine that produced continuous rolls of paper. The machine is an industrialised version of the historical hand paper-making method, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of printing and writing materials. A patent was granted on 24 July 1806,Repertory of Patent Inventions. London, 1807 for a machine that could make a long continuous web of paper. This had the dual advantage of considerably higher productivity plus production in roll form, for applications such as wallpaper printing. The range of cut paper sizes was also extended as it was not limited by the frame or deckle size of hand made paper. Large Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. A row of heated drums dry out the paper, which enters the machine as wet pulp. Large rolls are usually sliced into a number of thin rolls, which can feed continuous presses (e.g. newspapers) or be cut into separate sheets. The invention cost ¬£60000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted but with no benefit to the inventors. In 1814, two machines were made in Peterhof, Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition ¬£700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years -- but, despite petitioning Tsar Nicholas, no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, ¬£7000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family. Fourdrinier died in 1854, at the age of 88. His sister, Jemima, was the mother of the theologian John Henry Newman.https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp05298/jemima- fourdrinier ReferencesExternal links * motherbedford.com - The Paper Machine 1766 births 1854 deaths English inventors Pulp and paper industry Papermaking ","title":"Henry Fourdrinier"},{"id":"18622393","text":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations may refer to many of several United States Congressional subcommittees: * United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Management, Investigations, and Oversight * United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * United States House Science Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight * United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight * United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  See also  * United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform * United States Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight ","title":"Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations"},{"id":"18622408","text":"R.B. Grover Shoe factory before explosion View of disaster, March 1905. The arrow shows the trajectory of the boiler. View of boiler lodged in home of Miss Mary Pratt The Grover Shoe Factory disaster was an industrial explosion, building collapse and fire that killed 58 people and injured 150 when it leveled the R. B. Grover shoe factory in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 20, 1905. Following a boiler explosion, the four-story wooden building collapsed and the ruins burst into flames, incinerating workers trapped in the wreckage. The Grover disaster brought new attention to industrial safety and led to stringent safety laws and a national code governing the safe operation of steam boilers. The factory The R. B. Grover shoe factory was big, but not the biggest shoe factory in Brockton, a town that had 35,000 shoe workers. The wooden building, shaped like a letter E, occupied half a city block at the corner of Main and Calmar Streets. Grover made the popular Emerson brand shoe, and business had been good enough to add a fourth floor. The factory was heated using steam radiators, with the steam being produced by coal-fired steel boilers installed in a brick boiler house attached to the wooden factory as the crossbar of the E. When the fourth floor was added, the original boiler was replaced by a larger one and the old boiler, long and six feet in diameter, was left in place as a backup. Since the new boiler could generally meet the factory's demands on its own, the old one was seldom used; and when used, was used reluctantly. Grover's chief engineer David Rockwell, who had a first-class engineer's license and twelve years experience, did not trust it. Explosion The new boiler had to be flushed out as part of its regular maintenance, so Rockwell had put the old boiler back into service temporarily. Early that cold damp Monday, he fed its coal fire and put the boiler to work heating the building for arriving day-shift workers. At 7:45 a.m. the plant manager telephoned Rockwell to ask about some strange noises coming from the radiators along one wall. Rockwell had just stepped out of the building, but his assistant assured the manager that everything was in order. A few minutes later, the old boiler exploded, rocketing up through three floors and the roof. Collapse and fire The flying boiler knocked over an elevated water tower at one end of the building and its full tank smashed through the roof, causing that end of the building to immediately collapse, with the floors pancaking and the walls falling in on top of them. Many workers who survived the initial explosion and collapse were trapped by broken beams and heavy machinery. Burning coals thrown from the boiler's fire pit landed throughout the debris, starting fires that were fed by broken gas lines. The factory's more than 300 windows, now blown out, created a chimney effect in the parts of the factory still standing, resulting in a fire hot enough to melt iron pipes and radiators. The wooden floors, treated nightly with linseed oil to keep the dust down, burned quickly. High winds helped spread the fire to nearby storage sheds and neighboring buildings including a hardware store and a rooming house. The Campello neighborhood's district firehouse shared a city block with the factory and its firefighters arrived quickly, as did many local citizens. Using long timbers as levers, they were able to lift some of the wreckage and rescue some workers before the flames reached them. Local newspapers recount many acts of heroism in the rescues made that day. Barrels of naphtha, a volatile industrial solvent related to gasoline, were stored in a wooden shed directly behind the boiler house. The shed was set afire by the burning coals and the naphtha exploded, throwing sheets of flame onto the wreckage and driving rescuers away. =Escape= Between 300 and 400 workers were in the factory at the time of the explosion. Workers in the sections that were still standing escaped down stairways or climbed to the roof; others had to jump from windows because the explosion had knocked some fire escapes off the building. About 100 workers escaped unharmed and 150 were injured. A number who were only slightly injured went home without reporting their injuries. Police later related the story of a worker so dazed that he left the scene, applied for a job at another shoe factory, worked all day, then went home to find his family mourning him. =Death= An immediate search was made for the chief engineer. Rockwell was at first reported as among the injured, then could not be found, then at one point was reported as having left town. From her kitchen window, Mrs. Rockwell had seen him sitting in a chair near the boiler house window five minutes before the explosion. A search of the boiler house the next day turned up a charred body, a bent watch, two rubber heels and a torn piece of clothing identified by Mrs. Rockwell as belonging to her husband. Survivors were asked to register their names with the police. Body collection began that afternoon, with only bone fragments to be found toward the rear of the factory where the fire was worst. As families arrived looking for missing workers, grief-stricken relatives ran back and forth between reading the latest survivor lists and watching the recovery of bodies. Due to the extreme heat of the fire, only a few bodies could be positively identified. Thirty-nine unidentified victims were buried in a ceremony at Brockton's Melrose Cemetery three days later. The disaster's 58th victim, Hiram Pierce, died on April 15. Financial assistance On the day of the fire, the leatherworkers union announced that the injured would be paid $5 weekly until they recovered, and that the families of the dead would receive $100 for each family member killed. Civic leaders created the Brockton Relief Fund, which collected and distributed nearly $105,000 in cash assistance to the families (). Factory owner Robbins Grover worked for the rest of his life to secure financial aid for the families of those who died. Failure theories An assistant engineer who had been with Rockwell five minutes before the explosion stated that when he left, the boiler gauges showed steam pressure to be in the safe range and the boiler to have plenty of water. The state Inspector of Boilers checked the boiler's fusible plug and determined that the explosion was not caused by a lack of water. Rockwell's wife stated that for the past few days her husband had been irritable because he had to operate the boiler at \\"a pressure it was unequal to\\". A factory official stated that he was \\"at a loss\\" to account for the explosion, and when told of Mrs. Rockwell's remarks said that the amount of pressure on the boiler was not a matter in which factory officials interfered, adding that the engineer \\"took his orders in this matter from the Hartford Boiler Insurance Company, and if he overworked that boiler he did it without our knowledge. We do not even know why he used the old boiler this week instead of the newer one\\". :(The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company provided regular inspection and testing to customers of its insurance program, as well as on-site engineering services,History of The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company resulting in something of a shared responsibility with boiler owners for safe operation.) One Grover executive speculated that the explosion might have been caused by a recently installed safety device. C. E. Roberts, a manager of Hartford Steam Boiler, stated \\"So far as I have been able to learn there appears to have been no carelessness in the handling of the boiler, and the explosion, in my opinion, was caused by a defect that was impossible to discover.\\" Inquest A coroner's inquest was convened. A Grover representative testified that the boiler was inspected in December and found in apparent good condition. Several employees testified that David Rockwell \\"seemed capable of attending to his duties\\" that morning. Boiler inspectors who examined the ripped-open boiler reported finding a crack in one of its riveted, lap jointed seams. Experts characterized the boiler, built in 1890, as old technology likely to have a short service life under high pressure. Thousands of similar boilers were then in use in the United States. On March 29 the district attorney stated that the accident was due to a hidden defect in the boiler and that no criminal charges would be filed. As to civil liability, two weeks later a judge ruled that the explosion was caused by a defect that could not have been discovered, and held the company blameless. He also found that the various insinuations made against chief engineer Rockwell were untrue. =Engineering study= An engineering study begun as part of the inquest brought new facts to light. At least two barrels of naphtha were stored in a wooden shed directly behind the boiler house. The study said that without the naphtha explosions the number of deaths would have been only about one-quarter of the actual. When the naphtha exploded, it crushed one side of the factory building, pinning more workers under beams and machinery. A second outbuilding containing naphtha caught fire after about fifteen minutes and there was a second naphtha explosion, showering hundreds of gallons of the flaming liquid on the burning wreckage. Engineers estimated the force of the boiler explosion as equal to 300 kilos (660 pounds) of dynamite. Bankruptcy Although his factory was insured, Captain Grover was financially ruined. The R. B. Grover Company declared bankruptcy and assigned its remaining assets, more than 30 Emerson shoe stores scattered around the country, to its creditors. Legacy The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) had been founded in 1880 in response to the boiler explosions that had become common as the use of steam power expanded during the Industrial Revolution. Between 1880 and 1890 there were over 2000 boiler explosions in the United States. By 1890, some 100,000 boilers were in service, many of them unsafe. Inspections were rare, and operating guidelines almost nonexistent. Steam pressures were regularly cranked up to produce additional work. The Grover disaster, coupled with another fatal Massachusetts shoe factory boiler explosion the following year in Lynn, brought new cries for improved industrial safety. A new governor demanded prompt action and a Board of Boiler Rules was formed, drafting a simple three-page set of rules. After the ASME helped overcome manufacturer objections to \\"needless government interference\\", Massachusetts passed \\"An Act Relating to the Operation and Inspection of Steam Boilers\\" in 1907.Boston: Secretary of the Commonwealth, 1907 Chap. 0465. An Act Relative To The Operation And Inspection Of Steam Boilers. The Massachusetts laws eventually led to passage of a national boiler safety code. Safety improved, but the Massachusetts fatalities would not be the last. Twenty-three people were killed and 94 injured in 1962 when a boiler exploded and ripped through a New York Telephone Company cafeteria at lunchtime. A city agency later determined that the boiler had been improperly maintained and operated.

It was first serialized in Comic Rush in 2004. Nine volumes have been published so far. The series has been currently discontinued as Comic Rush is no longer publishing. Plot synopsis The series follows the life of High School student Keita Kusakabe, who is given a magical box by his friend and fellow student Natsuki Morishima. Keita has obtained the box in hopes that, as per legend, his wishes will be granted. He opens the box and out pops Maki a powerful devil, she at first tells Keita she's a genie that will grant three wishes whatever they may be. At first Keita can't decide what he wants and decides to sleep on it, later the next day Keita accidentally walks in on Maki who has just finished taking a shower. Now that she is without clothes Keita spots Maki's wings and tail, and realizes that she is in fact a devil. Maki reveals that once Keita has used all three wishes, she will take his soul. Unfortunately for her evil plans, she is inexperienced and doesn't even know how to be evil. She must stay with Keita until she can trick him into making his third wish while also teaching herself to be evil, but matters are complicated further when she starts falling in love with him. Characters=Main= ;Maki :She is a devil princess from the demon world. She grew up sheltered by her parents and doesn't really know how to be evil or any of the common actions, relying all of her information on a book her mother gave that is usually greatly misinformed with perverted suggestions on how to get Keita's soul. Keita accidentally summoned her from a box he was forced to buy from Natsuki. She will grant any wish Keita has, yet will take his soul after the third wish. She is unable to cry due to Keita's accidental first wish, which he begged that she would stop crying, and despite needed for him to wish, will often help him without him doing so. Maki wears a ring on each finger that limits her powers, and is able to summon small spirits to assist her. It is obvious she has fallen in love with Keita, however due to her sheltered life growing up is completely oblivious to this, often wondering why her chest hurts when he is being seduced by another woman or why she is now nervous at the idea of getting naked in front of Keita, despite doing it often before. She was known to be very cute when she was a child. She is one of the candidates to become the next demon queen in her home world. ;Keita :He is a human teenager who accidentally summoned Maki. This happened by accident when he opened a box he was forced to by from Natsuki. At first, he thought she was a genie for granting three wishes, until he saw the wings on her back and realized she is a Devil and he will die after his third wish is granted. However, despite the fact that she will take his soul, he genuinely cares for her, even falling in love with her, later admitting he will only give his soul to Maki. At school he is on the track team despite he is a slow runner, as the only memory he has of his mother was how she praised his running. Though Maki has suggested he just use one of his wishes to become the best runner, he turns it down, wishing to get better through his own strength and hard work, feeling as wishing for it wouldn't make it count. He actually does become a faster runner in later chapters, able to outrun Hayami who is one of the fastest runners in the school, as well as getting much faster when it is to help someone he cares for. He later becomes the owner of Miki during a dispute. It is later revealed by Alpha that his mother was an angel, which makes his soul highly sought after. In order to protect Maki from harm, Keita uses his second wish and is now armed with the most powerful weapon from Hell, the Lance of Longinus. However, he is only able to use it if Maki is in danger. =Devils= ;Devil Queen :Ruler of all devils and Maki's mother. Despite her dark towering appearance she is a very loving mother to her only daughter, often trying to help her get Keita's soul through the use of a book, however her information is usually very misinformed with sexual seducing techniques that seems to be taken from stereotypical romance story scenes. She also created many treaties between the angels and demons and single handedly stopped the countless wars between the two. ;Miki :She is another candidate to be the next demon queen. She tries to get in Maki's way so that Maki will lose and Miki will become Queen instead. She is summoned by an antique incense stand. Through tricking Keita she too becomes contracted to him. She tries to get Keita to make a wish by annoying him and only stopping if he makes a wish. ;Pazu :A wind spirit and one of the twelve spirits that Maki can summon with her powers. Resembles a fairy. ;Tarot :The spirit of dragons. He was summoned alongside Tarte to save Keita from Sheeta. He wears a tuxedo, top hat, eyepatch, a large snake, and one horn on the side of his head, opposite of Tarte's. ;Tarte :The spirit of love, who is also known as Moon Demon Astarte. She was summoned alongside Tarot. She appears to have an attraction to Keita, as she is usually seen around him. Like Tarot, she has a large snake and one horn on the side of her head on the opposite side. ;Levi :A Samurai-spirit based upon the biblical creature Leviathan. Levi has a dragon-like tail and travels around as a master-less, wandering samurai. Maki gave Levi to Keita to protect him and her summon box in a dangerous situation. He is so far the only male spirit beside Tarot and completely infatuated with Maki, often latching onto her large breasts. =Angels= ;Sheeta :She is an angel determined to remove Maki from the human world and to save Keita's soul. Despite being an angel, she acts nothing of the sort: wanting to kill Keita to save him from his contract, tricking the student council into torturing Maki, and living in Hara's house uninvited. After the failed attempt in \\"saving\\" Keita, she has taken the job as his and Maki's homeroom teacher, and despite her vendetta towards the two is actually a well liked teacher in the school, though this due to memory manipulation. She is later recalled back to heaven after failing to complete her mission. ;Natsuki :Keita‚Äôs classmate and childhood friend. Hoping to make some money off her family‚Äôs old belongings, she sells Keita items that happen to be possessed by supernatural beings. She is later revealed to be an Archangel whose true name is Alpha and sold him the items in her plan to get two Queen Candidates in one location. She seems to be a bit of a sadist, as she enjoyed torturing Sheeta for her failure and regularly wields a whip. Despite all this, she truly seems to love Keita, as she states she only allows Keita to call her Natsuki, and goes out of her way to be the one to get Keita's soul. It is later revealed she did all of this for Keita's mother, so that they would be able to see each other again. She was eventually defeated after Keita uses his second wish. Currently, she has backed off from taking Keita's soul. =Classmates= ;Hayami :He is the captain of the track team and the student body president. He also likes Keita, and confesses to him early on in the story, this always causing Keita to flee on sight when Hayami calls out to him. However, it is later revealed in Chapter 16 that this is not a sexual love, but an adoration towards Keita, as Keita reminds Hayami of a dog he used to have when he was a child, even having the same name. So he believes Keita is the reincarnation of his dog, which causes him to want to hold and pet Keita every time he sees him, something Keita doesn't seem to mind after having this all cleared up. ;Haru :She is the vice president of the student council. Despite her beauty she is a vain manipulative narcissistic girl who enjoys how she is seen as the beauty of the school, and became extremely jealous at the thought that Maki was trying to take her position away. She has a crush on Hayami, because of this tries to attack or get rid of Maki as she assumed she was trying to steal him away, seeming to be unaware he is actually in love with Keita. Though after discovering this, she now has no resentment towards the demons, and only wishes to bring Hayami back to the \\"right side\\". Sheeta now lives with her through an Angel contract, must to her dismay. =Other= ;Keita's Dad :Keita's widowed father. He is a kind loving man who instantly takes a liking to Maki and lets her stay in his house, despite knowing that she is a Devil (to the extent of having dinner with Maki's spirits and even feeding Pazu). He sees her always trying her best and a kind sweet girl, practically accepting her as his daughter. He has yet shown any reaction towards Miki now living there, though when she first appeared he was excited to see his son getting the attention of so many girls. Apparently, he already knew that he had married an Angel and commented on why he never mentioned that fact to his son, \\"You already know how hard it is to date a girl with wings.\\" ;Noroi Masuzou :The son of a priest at a local shrine. He is very shy around people and has not attended school for a long period of time. Because Keita has many pretty girls about him, (or for any other reason), he has a habit of using a voodoo-type straw doll with his name on it in order to curse him and cause him pain. Surprisingly, this works on Keita, (most likely due to his half-angel status). However, his curse only works if he has the correct full name of the victim. After meeting with Maki, (and getting her name wrong as well), he seems to have become infatuated with her and has now returned to class.

The culture is defined by the presence of sand-tempered pottery decorated with the impressions of carved wooden paddles that were pressed against the vessels before they were fired. The sand-tempering distinguishes Deptford ceramics from the fiber-tempered ceramics of the late-Archaic Stallings Island/St. Simons, Orange, and Norwood cultures that preceded it. Other contemporary cultures of the southeastern United States also produced paddle decorated ceramics. The Deptford culture was oriented to the coast. From northern Georgia it spread along the Atlantic coast, reaching Cape Fear, North Carolina to the north and the mouth of the St. Johns River to the south. The Deptford culture also spread along the Gulf of Mexico coast, reaching from the Perdido River on the western border of Florida to Tampa Bay on the lower west coast of Florida. Deptford culture appeared in Florida around 500 BCE. The Deptford culture in the Gulf region (Florida Panhandle, southeast Alabama and southwest Georgia) evolved into the Swift Creek and Santa Rosa-Swift Creek cultures around 200 CE, while the culture in the Atlantic coastal region continued until about 700. In the eastern Florida Panhandle the Deptford culture has been divided into an early Deptford period, in which fiber-tempered and Deptford series ceramics are found together, a middle Deptford period, with only Deptford series ceramics present, and a late Deptford period with both Deptford series and Swift Creek series ceramics present.

Artifacts Early Deptford ceramics appear to have been developed in Georgia around 2,600 years ago out of the Early Woodland Refuge phase (near Savannah), and spread north into South Carolina and North Carolina and south into Florida. Deptford ceramics continued to be made and found on Middle Woodland sites in the southeastern U.S. until about 600 BCE. Occupation for the Atlantic coastal plain of Georgia and the Carolinas seems to have followed a seasonal pattern of winter shellfish camps on the coast, then inland occupation during the spring and summer for deer hunting, and fall for nut gathering.National Park Service, Woodland period From the Early through the Middle Woodland periods, the extensive, low-lying coastal environment of the South Atlantic coast, stretching from North Carolina to northern Florida, was used by numerous Deptford hunter-gatherer bands who lived seasonally within a variety of ecosystems and took advantage of seasonally available foods. Along the Gulf Coast, the Deptford culture continued the seasonal existence throughout the Middle Woodland. Settlements in this geographical area lacked permanence of occupation, although the cultures here participated in the Hopewellian trading network to a limited extent and constructed numerous low sand burial mounds. These sand burial mounds along coastal Georgia and Florida (noted at Canaveral National Seashore and Cumberland Island National Seashore, for instance), as well as in the Carolinas, are believed to represent local lineage burial grounds rather than the resting place of an elite individual. In northwestern Florida, the Early Woodland Deptford culture evolved in place to become the Swift Creek and Santa Rosa-Swift Creek cultures. Trade items recovered from burial mounds include copper panpipes, ear ornaments, stone plummets, and stone gorgets. These show this area's incorporation within the Hopewellian Interaction Sphere by about 1,900 years ago.

Plot The USS Enterprise is contacted by Ael i-Mhiessan t'Rllaillieu, a Romulan commander with whom Captain Kirk has tangled several times before. Ael has become disillusioned with the Romulan Empire's politics, and is especially concerned with a secret project she has discovered which seeks to use captured Vulcans for medical research with the goal of allowing Romulans to develop extensive mental powers. She convinces her crew to cross the Neutral Zone into Federation space, where the Enterprise is patrolling with the Starships Constellation, Intrepid and the Denebian Defender-class battleship Inaieu. Ael hopes to convince Kirk to launch a strike against the medical facility. The Captain declines, but when the USS Intrepid mysteriously vanishes during an ion storm, Ael convinces him that the ship has been captured by Romulans and its Vulcan crew will become part of the project. This convinces Kirk to take the Enterprise with Ael's ship, Bloodwing, into Romulan space in a rescue mission. The plan involves Ael's ship pretending to capture the Enterprise, taking it back home through the Romulan defences on a course which will pass close to the research station. The plan proceeds smoothly until a double cross by Ael's son, Tafv threatens to leave the Enterprise genuinely captured. This attempt is overturned, the Intrepid and her crew rescued, the base destroyed, and the Enterprise duly heads back to Federation space. Ael and Kirk go their separate ways, he back to duty and she to a life of exile as a traitor. Before leaving she tells Kirk all of her names and their meaning, a highly symbolic act for a Romulan which is only done to \\"one closer than kin\\". She tells him her names will be purged from the records back home, rendering her essentially a non-person in Romulan eyes. On returning to Earth Kirk hangs a pennant with Ael's names on it in a remote valley, symbolically counteracting this status.

Development First Essex run Blue Bird TC/2000 in 2009 :For a background to the development of First Student UK, see Student transport#Switch to dedicated school buses First Student and First in West Yorkshire successfully piloted one of the first yellow school bus schemes in the Huddersfield and Calderdale area in 2000. In 2002, another early scheme began in Wrexham, Wales. It was also contracted to First, who began to operate the scheme in June of that year. FirstGroup's chief executive Moir Lockhead said \\"we believe that the yellow school bus offers the safest, most reliable way to transport children to and from school\\". As with other schemes, including one in Runnymede in Surrey set up around the same time, First had to open new bases to operate the school buses, having no other operations in the respective areas. The first schemes also had buses built like traditional US school buses, whereas later schemes have more conventional UK bus shapes. By October 2002, FirstGroup's first Welsh scheme had proved successful enough for the fleet of buses to be doubled. As further schemes developed, First became more involved in setting up schemes. First Berkshire, already running the Runnymede First Student service, won the contract from Surrey County Council in 2005 to operate the Ride Pegasus! school bus scheme, although using buses in a different livery. However, this ended in July 2010 following the withdrawal of funding.First Berkshire & The Thames Valley - \\"About us\\" Accessed 30 April 2008Surrey County Council - Access Buses Accessed 10 May 2008 In December 2007, a yellow school bus visited Perth, Scotland, to test reactions.

First Student UK currently take 8,000 students to and from school in the UK, every day. 15 school bus systems are currently operated, two in Scotland, two in Wales and the rest in England. In contrast to the North American division, where school busing is a primary function, First Student UK takes advantage of the existence of a First Group operating base throughout the country. Yellow School Bus schemes are run on behalf of the local authority by an existing subsidiary of First or sub-contracted to an independent operator where they do not have a presence.

Life Born in Omaha, Nebraska, she lived in Elkhart, Indiana during her childhood and attended the University of Chicago, receiving a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1912. She was arrested in 1917, along with Peggy Baird Johns and Dorothy Day, for picketing on behalf of women's rights.Janis P. Stout, Katherine Anne Porter: a sense of the times, University of Virginia Press, 1995. p169. In the 1920s, according to the historian Alan M.

Wald, Exiles From a Future Time: the forging of the mid-twentieth-century literary left, UNC Press, 2002, p232. Secret services reports released by the United Kingdom government in 2005 state that Evans left for Britain with Durant in 1925, after Durant was expelled from the United States due to his connection with various Communist front organisations.nationalarchives.gov.uk Her relationship with Durant was over by 1935, when he married Evans's former colleague, the poet Genevieve Taggard.Laurie Champion, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, American Women Writers, 1900-1945: a bio-bibliographical critical sourcebook, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p339. In the 1930s she met Walker Evans and Ben Shahn. Walker Evans was impressed by her intelligence and was always quick to point out they were not related.Belinda Rathbone, Walker Evans: A Biography, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2000, p78. Evans's career also involved work for the United States government. She worked for the Resettlement Administration, where her duties included conducting research for Roy Stryker, a pioneer in the field of documentary photography and a central figure in the Farm Security Administration. Additionally, during World War II, Evans worked for the Office of War Information in the Overseas Publications department of the Publications Bureau. With this position, she collaborated with the African-American photographer Gordon Parks, her colleague at OWI, who would go on to rise to prominence as a documentary photographer and film director. Evans was a member of the Society of Woman Geographers, a group co-founded by her close friend Gertrude Emerson Sen. Toward the end of her life, Evans suffered from a slew of medical problems, including cataracts. She died in New York City. Her archival papers are held by Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Columbia University. Art criticism Evans authored the first English-language book on the famed Mexican painter Diego Rivera. This illustrated oversize book, The Frescoes of Diego Rivera, was published in 1929 by Harcourt Brace. The following year, Rivera was invited to the United States, and in 1931, he was the subject of a retrospective at New York City's Museum of Modern Art. Career in publishing Over the course of her career, Evans worked for several publishing firms and literary agencies, including Coward-McCann and Lippincott (now Lippincott Williams & Wilkins). She also did freelance journalism and editing for publications including The Century Magazine, The New York Herald Tribune, Asia Magazine, The New Republic, The Nation, The Virginia Quarterly Review, and The Manchester Guardian; in addition, she reviewed books for The New York Times, Saturday Review, The New Republic, Survey Graphic, and Delphian Quarterly. Evans's journalistic career frequently took her overseas, a somewhat unusual state of affairs for a single woman at this time. Writing essays for the Virginia Quarterly Review, she wedded politics to cultural criticism as she recounted her travels through Europe as a literary agent, telling firsthand of the distinctly Russian character of train journeys to the Caucasus; a 1920s Berlin in the midst of rising Nazism; government wiretapping and the antiquarian book trade in London. Correspondence Evans was a gregarious individual and a tireless writer of letters. She demonstrated an eagerness to expand her network of colleagues, collaborators and companions, and she engaged in correspondence with such luminaries as Walker Evans, Cornell Capa and Jean Renoir, among many others.

Writer Victor Milan was also involved in the initial discussion of the plot for the novel. Plot Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise joins with the Klingons to investigate a spatial anomaly that has already swallowed one starship. Kirk suspects the problem has something to do with the nearby life forms on Taygeta V, beings which are preyed upon for the jewels they secrete at the moment of their death. Unfortunately a Klingon officer has mutiny on his mind and the anomaly threatens to destroy all of known space. Development Snodgrass sought to use Uhura as a main character as she hadn't been featured prominently in other stories Snodgrass was a fan of Star Trek: The Original Series and, after quitting her previous job at a law practice, her friend Victor Milan suggested that she try to become a writer. Milan proposed that she should write a novel about Star Trek. Despite Snodgrass not being on the list of approved authors, her outline was purchased by David G. Hartwell. Snodgrass and Milan discussed ideas and she decided that she would go with a softer, more friendly story along the lines of the episodes \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" or \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". Her inspiration for the aliens in the book was because she \\"couldn't think of anything softer or fuzzier than baby white seals\\".Ayers (2006): p. 54 Snodgrass wanted Uhura to be central to the book, partially in an attempt to market the book as the character had not been prominently featured in other Star Trek stories. The musical elements added to the character came from Snodgrass' experiences as a musician and singer. A second Uhura-based book, entitled Uhura's Song was released two books later in the numbered series. The Tears of the Singers was the only Star Trek novel written by Snodgrass, who remembers that Hartwell gave her the advice to use the book to launch her writing career but to never write another one. She subsequently wrote \\"The Measure of a Man\\" for the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation and following the success of that script and episode, she joined the writing team there for the rest of the series. Reception Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, in an article for Tor.com about the appearances of Uhura in Star Trek novels, stated that she \\"put the book down for a week of rage and derision when I hit page 132\\". That page featured an in-character consideration by Uhura about whether or not female Starfleet Captains must have lesbian mentalities as the vessels are considered to be female. However, she said that \\"This book was written in the 80s. I‚Äôm sure the question about the socio-sexual impacts of command seemed more cogent then\\". She thought that the characterization of Uhura in the novel was similar to a Barbie doll, but it did demonstrate the untapped potential of the character. In Star Trek: Adventures in Time and Space, published in 1999, The Tears of the Singers was described as one of the two defining novels alongside Uhura's Song which \\"gave Uhura the chance to expand her range beyond hailing frequencies\\".Taylor (1999): p. 115 The author, Mary P.

The CNJ region, comprising Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, and Somerset counties, has received $5 million, available under the Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) program from the United States Department of Labor (USDOL). The WIRED grant will be used to transform the rich array of existing bioscience education and training and economic development initiatives into an into a world class bioscience talent development system. The partnership has its roots in an initiative created by Governor Jon Corzine as part of his statewide economic strategy. This is the third WIRED investment in New Jersey, making it ‚Äúthe most WIRED state‚Äù in the U.S.Growing and Developing Central New Jersey's Bioscience Workforce 2007. Goals In collaboration with representatives of all key players in the biosciences in CNJ, the Bio-1 initiative will focus on six key strategies: * Excite young people about the bio-sciences, especially focusing on underrepresented groups. * Create a consortium of biotechnology educators from the high school through university levels that will facilitate smooth career pathways through articulation agreements, mentoring and professional development. * Transform graduate education with the development of professional science master's degrees that integrate business and science, and interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs in biotech areas. * Increase bioscience workforce development with education and training opportunities. A ‚Äúflak jackets to lab coats‚Äù initiative, for example, will focus on training and job placement in the bioscience industry for returning veterans. * Enhance linkages between education and industry through internships, cooperative education and mentoring. * Facilitate globally competitive ‚Äúbiobusinesses‚Äù by encouraging collaboration between business and education, supporting bioscience start-ups and leveraging existing global networks.How will Bio-1 achieve its goal? 2007.

Trees line the western side (not open to traffic) mirroring the axis starting at the entrance of Leopold Park across the street to the south. It is named after President of the European Commission Jean Rey and occupies a space between the Justus Lipsius building (headquarters of the Council of the European Union) and Leopold Park (next to the Espace L√©opold of the European Parliament). History The square was included in plans for the Justus Lipsius building in 1984. Its construction was delayed due to controversies about the area around the Justus Lipsius, legal difficulties, and failed schemes such as plans to demolish a large residential area. Belgian authorities created the space in 2001, as it was thought their reputation would be tarnished if they did not manage to improve the foreboding image of the European quarter. It was inaugurated at the start of the Belgian EU Presidency on 26 June 2001. Future Plans for the rebuilding of the quarter would see the renovation of / into a tree-lined avenue. The renovated section would terminate at Jean Rey Square which would become a traffic island with the west side being turned into a road. This would remove the tree-lined area mirroring the entrance to Leopold Park but there would be trees lining the opposite sides of the road to the north, west and east, a new fountain in the south west corner and the possibility of a tram line cutting across the square following Chauss√©e d‚ÄôEtterbeek.

Kirk encounters Spock's mother, Amanda Grayson, and Spock's father, Sarek, and soon becomes heavily involved in Spock's personal life. Then people begin to die. Kirk, trying to solve the case, is hampered by some Vulcans' belief that it would be illogical for murder to be happening on their home world, and that the deaths are therefore accidents. But he knows criminal behavior when he sees it, and presses on. Production Lorrah decided to write a script for Star Trek: The Original Series after seeing the first episode,Ayers (2006): p. 55 but found that she couldn't due to issues with Hollywood agents. She decided afterwards to write a Star Trek novel, but shelved the idea at first as Pocket Books were only accepting submissions from published authors at the time. After she published First Channel and Savage Empire, she decided to give a Star Trek novel, describing the story as one that \\"grew out of my fannish stories in the Night of the Twin Moons universe.\\"Ayers (2006): p. 56 She wrote a sequel which was published in February 1988.

He played both hurling and Gaelic football with his local club New Ross and with the Wexford senior inter-county teams in both codes in the 1900s and 1910s. Playing career=Club= Mackey played his club hurling and football with his local club in New Ross. He first tasted success in 1913 when he won a senior county hurling championship title. Two years later in 1915 Mackey added to his collection when he won a county football championship title. =Inter- county= Mackey first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Wexford senior hurling team. In 1910 he won his first Leinster hurling title as Wexford overcame Dublin by 3-3 to 1-1. Unusually, the All- Ireland series of games began before the provincial championships were completed. As a result of this Kilkenny and Dublin represented Leinster in the All-Ireland quarter-final and semi-final respectively, however, Wexford lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Limerick provided the opposition on that occasion and an entertaining contest unfolded. New rules regarding the parallelogram confused the players and Limerick had two goals disallowed because of a ‚Äòsquare ball.‚Äô Wexford had a goal disallowed for the same reason; however, they still went on to win the game by 7-0 to 6-2. It was Mackey‚Äôs first All-Ireland medal. Three years after this Mackey was a star player on the Wexford senior football team. He won a Leinster football title in 1913 with a one point victory over Louth. Wexford later disposed of Antrim to set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Kerry. After a low-scoring contest it was the men from ‚Äòthe Kingdom‚Äô who emerged victorious by 2-2 to 0-3. Mackey captured a second Leinster medal in 1914 as Wexford trounced Louth in the provincial decider. Monaghan were equally disposed of in the penultimate game of the championship, allowing Wexford to advance to a second successive All- Ireland final. Kerry were the opponents once again, however, Wexford played great football. They led by 0-6 to 0-1, however, Kerry fought back to secure a 1-3 to 0-6 draw. The replay drew a crowd of 20,000 to Croke Park and, once again, Wexford took the lead. Kerry fought back again and went on to win the game by 2-3 to 0-6. 1915 saw Mackey add a third Leinster title to his collection after two matches against Dublin. After disposing of Cavan in the All-Ireland semi-final Wexford lined out against Kerry in the championship decider. It was the third successive meeting of these two teams with the Munster men looking for a third title in-a-row. Dick Fitzgerald of Kerry missed two great goal chances while Wexford were well on top. In the end Mackey‚Äôs side won by 2-4 to 2-1. It was his first All-Ireland football medal. On that occasion Mackey, along with his teammate Se√°n O'Kennedy, jointly became the fourth players in history to have All-Ireland medals in both hurling and football. Wexford continued their winning ways in 1916 with Mackey collecting a fourth successive Leinster football title. Kildare were defeated on that occasion, however, Mackey ended up on the losing side in the Leinster hurling decider. Wexford later breezed through the All-Ireland series and qualified for a fourth successive All-Ireland final. Because of the Easter Rising and subsequent martial law the game was postponed until the Sunday before Christmas. Overnight frost resulted in the pitch being extremely hard; however, the game went ahead nonetheless. Mayo were the opponents on the occasion, however, Wexford were too strong and won the game by 2-4 to 1-2. It was Mackey‚Äôs second All-Ireland football medal. Wexford maintained their provincial dominance in 1917 with Mackey winning a fifth Leinster title following a two-point win over ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô. Once again the All-Ireland final beckoned with Clare providing the opposition on this occasion. It was a unique pairing in football terms and Wexford went on to record an easy victory. A score line of 0-9 to 0-5 gave Mackey a third consecutive All-Ireland medal. 1918 proved to be another successful year for Mackey in both codes. Wexford were the masters of provincial football once again as they defeated Louth by four points. It was Mackey‚Äôs sixth consecutive Leinster football medal. He also had success on the hurling field this year as Wexford defeated Dublin giving Mackey a second Leinster hurling title. Both the hurlers and footballers were successful in the subsequent series of games and reached the All-Ireland final. The All-Ireland football final saw Wexford take on Tipperary in yet another novel encounter. A close-scoring game saw Wexford just about secure a victory by 0-5 to 0-4. It was Mackey‚Äôs fourth All-Ireland medal and an unparalleled record fourth title in-a-row for Wexford. The All- Ireland hurling final also gave Wexford the chance of joining Cork and Tipperary in the unique situation of being double All-Ireland winners. That game saw Limerick provide the opposition, however, the hurlers were not able to match the Munster men‚Äôs scoring skills. A score line of 9-5 to 1-3 gave victory to Limerick. A seventh Leinster football title in-a-row proved beyond this Wexford team while the hurlers also gave up their provincial crown.

Kagan was asked to produce an outline by editor David G. Hartwell, after he read the manuscript of her novel Hellspark. She was unfamiliar with Star Trek and needed to research the series whilst writing Uhura's Song. She subsequently proposed two sequels, but they went unwritten as they featured original characters introduced in Uhura's Song. Plot Lt. Uhura's friendship with a cat-like diplomat from Eeiauo becomes vital when a plague threatens the population. The songs they shared are key to the cure. When the plague begins to infect humans starting with Dr. McCoy, the crew of the Enterprise must work to decipher the songs and cure the plague. Development Janet Kagan was first introduced to Star Trek: The Original Series by her younger brother during the original run of the show. She was invited to submit a proposal for a Star Trek novel by David G. Hartwell, to whom she had submitted her novel Hellspark in his capacity as editor of Pocket Books' original-SF line Timescape; though Hartwell liked the novel, Timescape did not accept novels from previously-unpublished authors ‚Äì but the Star Trek line did, and Hartwell suggested it as an avenue for qualifying as a published author. (Hellspark was ultimately released in 1988 by Tor Books, to which Hartwell had moved on in the meantime.)Afterword to the 1998 edition of Hellspark At the time she had not seen an episode of the show for some seventeen years. She researched the series, and due to it being shown in broadcast syndication, she was able to record late-night re-runs using her videocassette recorder.Ayers (2006): p. 55 She had committed to provide a ten- page outline plus a thirty-page sample to Hartwell within a week, and whilst watching the recorded episodes, she realised that Uhura had not been featured prominently and that Nichelle Nichols had never been given any memorable lines. Kagan did remember Nichols in a NASA promotional film, and desired to \\"give Uhura the plum role she deserved\\".Ayers (2006): p. 56 She was keen to have the characters sound like a real proposal for a Star Trek episode. Hartwell approved the outline, and Kagan reached out to family members and friends for more information on the series such as tapes and books and wanted to know what they had never seen in Star Trek but wanted to. She had three months to turn in a first draft, and during that time she watched the entire series. During that period, Hartwell had left Simon & Schuster for Tor Books, and Kagan subsequently wondered how the book would have turned out differently had Hartwell stayed on to edit. A similar Uhura-focused book had been published two books prior, entitled The Tears of the Singers. Following the successful publishing of the book, Kagan outlined two sequels to the novel, both featuring her original characters from Uhura's Song. She submitted her outlines to the new editor once the office had stabilised after Hartwell's departure, but discovered that the policy was that authors were not allowed to bring back original characters from previous books, and so the sequels went unwritten. Reception Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, in an article for Tor.com about the appearances of Uhura in Star Trek novels, described the plot of Uhura's Song as \\"undisputably weird\\". She described the book as an \\"epic coming-of-age journey\\" with \\"lots and lots of ballads\\". She did say that she felt that there were numerous Mary Sue-type characters in various guises throughout the book. In Star Trek: Adventures in Time and Space, published in 1999, Uhura's Song was described as one of the two defining novels alongside The Tears of the Singers which \\"gave Uhura the chance to expand her range beyond hailing frequencies\\".Taylor (1999): p. 115 References=FootnotesBibliography= External links Novels based on Star Trek: The Original Series 1985 American novels 1985 science fiction novels American science fiction novels American bildungsromans ","title":"Uhura's Song"},{"id":"18622880","text":"Lloyd Glenn Perry (October 28, 1944 ‚Äì October 21, 1998) was the first Chief Accountant of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
