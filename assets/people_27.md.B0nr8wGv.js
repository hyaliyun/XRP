L. 111-256, 124 Stat. 2643 (2010). is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ under 70, in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have intellectual disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 2‚Äì3% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic, or idiopathic cases account for 30‚Äì50% of these cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people . Signs and symptoms Intellectual disability (ID) becomes apparent during childhood and involves deficits in mental abilities, social skills, and core activities of daily living (ADLs) when compared to same-aged peers. There often are no physical signs of mild forms of ID, although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome). The level of impairment ranges in severity for each person. Some of the early signs can include: * Delays in reaching, or failure to achieve milestones in motor skills development (sitting, crawling, walking) * Slowness learning to talk, or continued difficulties with speech and language skills after starting to talk * Difficulty with self-help and self-care skills (e.g., getting dressed, washing, and feeding themselves) * Poor planning or problem-solving abilities * Behavioral and social problems * Failure to grow intellectually, or continued infant childlike behavior * Problems keeping up in school * Failure to adapt or adjust to new situations * Difficulty understanding and following social rules In early childhood, mild ID (IQ 50‚Äì69) may not be obvious or identified until children begin school. Even when poor academic performance is recognized, it may take expert assessment to distinguish mild intellectual disability from specific learning disability or emotional/behavioral disorders. People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment. Moderate ID (IQ 35‚Äì49) is nearly always apparent within the first years of life. Speech delays are particularly common signs of moderate ID. People with moderate intellectual disability need considerable supports in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive group home, or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a sheltered workshop. People with Severe (IQ 20‚Äì34) or Profound ID (IQ 19 or below) need more intensive support and supervision for their entire lives. They may learn some ADLs, but an intellectual disability is considered severe or profound when individuals are unable to independently care for themselves without ongoing significant assistance from a caregiver throughout adulthood. Individuals with profound ID are completely dependent on others for all ADLs and to maintain their physical health and safety. They may be able to learn to participate in some of these activities to limited degree. = Co-morbidity= Autism and intellectual disability  Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share clinical characteristics which can result in confusion while diagnosing. Overlapping these two disorders, while common, can be detrimental to a person's well being. Those with ASD that hold symptoms of ID may be grouped into a co- diagnosis in which they are receiving treatment for a disorder they do not have. Likewise, those with ID that are mistaken to have ASD may be treated for symptoms of a disorder they do not have. Differentiating between these two disorders will allow clinicians to deliver or prescribe the appropriate treatments. Comorbidity between ID and ASD is very common; roughly 40% of those with ID also have ASD and roughly 70% of those with ASD also have ID. Both ASD and ID require shortfalls in communication and social awareness as defining criteria. Both ASD and ID are classified by severity: mild, moderate, severe. In addition to those three levels, ID has a fourth classification known as profound.  Defining differences  In a study conducted in 2016 surveying 2816 cases, it was found that the top subsets that help differentiate between those with ID and ASD are, \\"...impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity, [...] restricted interests, strict adherence to routines, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupation with parts of objects\\". Those with ASD tend to show more deficits in non-verbal social behavior such as body language and understanding social cues. In a study done in 2008 of 336 individuals with varying levels of ID, it was found that those with ID display fewer instances of repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. It also recognized that those with ASD, when compared to those with ID, were more likely to isolate themselves and make less eye contact. When it comes to classification ID and ASD have very different guidelines. ID has a standardized assessment called the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS), this measures severity on a system built around how much support an individual will need. While ASD also classifies severity by support needed there is no standard assessment, clinicians are free to diagnose severity at their own judgment.Boat TF, Wu JT. (2015). Clinical Characteristics of Intellectual Disabilities. Mental Disorders and Disabilities Among Low-Income Children. (pp. 169-176). Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK332877/ Causes Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Among children, the cause of intellectual disability is unknown for one-third to one-half of cases. About 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Genetic defects that cause intellectual disability, but are not inherited, can be caused by accidents or mutations in genetic development. Examples of such accidents are development of an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome, which is the most common genetic cause. Velocardiofacial syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the two next most common causes. However, there are many other causes. The most common are: * Genetic conditions. Sometimes disability is caused by abnormal genes inherited from parents, errors when genes combine, or other reasons. The most prevalent genetic conditions include Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Fragile X syndrome (common among boys), neurofibromatosis, congenital hypothyroidism, Williams syndrome, phenylketonuria (PKU), and Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome. Other genetic conditions include Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13del), Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome, genetic ciliopathy, and Siderius type X-linked intellectual disability () as caused by mutations in the PHF8 gene (). In the rarest of cases, abnormalities with the X or Y chromosome may also cause disability. 48, XXXX and 49, XXXXX syndrome affect a small number of girls worldwide, while boys may be affected by 49, XXXXY, or 49, XYYYY. 47, XYY is not associated with significantly lowered IQ though affected individuals may have slightly lower IQs than non-affected siblings on average. * Problems during pregnancy. Intellectual disability can result when the fetus does not develop properly. For example, there may be a problem with the way the fetus's cells divide as it grows. A pregnant woman who drinks alcohol (see fetal alcohol spectrum disorder) or gets an infection like rubella during pregnancy may also have a baby with intellectual disability. * Problems at birth. If a baby has problems during labor and birth, such as not getting enough oxygen, he or she may have developmental disability due to brain damage. * Exposure to certain types of disease or toxins. Diseases like whooping cough, measles, or meningitis can cause intellectual disability if medical care is delayed or inadequate. Exposure to poisons like lead or mercury may also affect mental ability. * Iodine deficiency, affecting approximately 2 billion people worldwide, is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in areas of the developing world where iodine deficiency is endemic. Iodine deficiency also causes goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland. More common than full- fledged cretinism, as intellectual disability caused by severe iodine deficiency is called, is mild impairment of intelligence. Residents of certain areas of the world, due to natural deficiency and governmental inaction, are severely affected by iodine deficiency. India has 500 million suffering from deficiency, 54 million from goiter, and 2 million from cretinism. Among other nations affected by iodine deficiency, China and Kazakhstan have instituted widespread salt iodization programs. But, as of 2006, Russia had not. * Malnutrition is a common cause of reduced intelligence in parts of the world affected by famine, such as Ethiopia and nations struggling with extended periods of warfare that disrupt agriculture production and distribution. * Absence of the arcuate fasciculus. Diagnosis According to both the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities(Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (11th Edition) and the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), three criteria must be met for a diagnosis of intellectual disability: significant limitation in general mental abilities (intellectual functioning), significant limitations in one or more areas of adaptive behavior across multiple environments (as measured by an adaptive behavior rating scale, i.e. communication, self-help skills, interpersonal skills, and more), and evidence that the limitations became apparent in childhood or adolescence. In general, people with intellectual disability have an IQ below 70, but clinical discretion may be necessary for individuals who have a somewhat higher IQ but severe impairment in adaptive functioning. It is formally diagnosed by an assessment of IQ and adaptive behavior. A third condition requiring onset during the developmental period is used to distinguish intellectual disability from other conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries and dementias (including Alzheimer's disease). =Intelligence quotient= The first English-language IQ test, the Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales, was adapted from a test battery designed for school placement by Alfred Binet in France. Lewis Terman adapted Binet's test and promoted it as a test measuring \\"general intelligence.\\" Terman's test was the first widely used mental test to report scores in \\"intelligence quotient\\" form (\\"mental age\\" divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100). Current tests are scored in \\"deviation IQ\\" form, with a performance level by a test-taker two standard deviations below the median score for the test-taker's age group defined as IQ 70. Until the most recent revision of diagnostic standards, an IQ of 70 or below was a primary factor for intellectual disability diagnosis, and IQ scores were used to categorize degrees of intellectual disability. Since current diagnosis of intellectual disability is not based on IQ scores alone, but must also take into consideration a person's adaptive functioning, the diagnosis is not made rigidly. It encompasses intellectual scores, adaptive functioning scores from an adaptive behavior rating scale based on descriptions of known abilities provided by someone familiar with the person, and also the observations of the assessment examiner who is able to find out directly from the person what he or she can understand, communicate, and such like. IQ assessment must be based on a current test. This enables diagnosis to avoid the pitfall of the Flynn effect, which is a consequence of changes in population IQ test performance changing IQ test norms over time. =Distinction from other disabilities= Clinically, intellectual disability is a subtype of cognitive deficit or disabilities affecting intellectual abilities, which is a broader concept and includes intellectual deficits that are too mild to properly qualify as intellectual disability, or too specific (as in specific learning disability), or acquired later in life through acquired brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Cognitive deficits may appear at any age. Developmental disability is any disability that is due to problems with growth and development. This term encompasses many congenital medical conditions that have no mental or intellectual components, although it, too, is sometimes used as a euphemism for intellectual disability. =Limitations in more than one area= Adaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning, refers to the skills needed to live independently (or at the minimally acceptable level for age). To assess adaptive behavior, professionals compare the functional abilities of a child to those of other children of similar age. To measure adaptive behavior, professionals use structured interviews, with which they systematically elicit information about persons' functioning in the community from people who know them well. There are many adaptive behavior scales, and accurate assessment of the quality of someone's adaptive behavior requires clinical judgment as well. Certain skills are important to adaptive behavior, such as: * Daily living skills, such as getting dressed, using the bathroom, and feeding oneself * Communication skills, such as understanding what is said and being able to answer * Social skills with peers, family members, spouses, adults, and others Other specific skills can be critical to an individual's inclusion in the community and to developing appropriate social behaviours, as for example being aware of the different social expectations linked to the principal lifespan stages (i.e., childhood, adulthood, old age). The results of a Swiss study suggest that the performance of adults with ID in recognizing different lifespan stages is related to specific cognitive abilities and to the type of material used to test this performance. Management By most definitions, intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. Intellectual disability can be distinguished in many ways from mental illness, such as schizophrenia or depression. Currently, there is no \\"cure\\" for an established disability, though with appropriate support and teaching, most individuals can learn to do many things. Causes, such as congenital hypothyroidism, if detected early may be treated to prevent development of an intellectual disability. There are thousands of agencies around the world that provide assistance for people with developmental disabilities. They include state-run, for-profit, and non- profit, privately run agencies. Within one agency there could be departments that include fully staffed residential homes, day rehabilitation programs that approximate schools, workshops wherein people with disabilities can obtain jobs, programs that assist people with developmental disabilities in obtaining jobs in the community, programs that provide support for people with developmental disabilities who have their own apartments, programs that assist them with raising their children, and many more. There are also many agencies and programs for parents of children with developmental disabilities. Beyond that, there are specific programs that people with developmental disabilities can take part in wherein they learn basic life skills. These \\"goals\\" may take a much longer amount of time for them to accomplish, but the ultimate goal is independence. This may be anything from independence in tooth brushing to an independent residence. People with developmental disabilities learn throughout their lives and can obtain many new skills even late in life with the help of their families, caregivers, clinicians and the people who coordinate the efforts of all of these people. There are four broad areas of intervention that allow for active participation from caregivers, community members, clinicians, and of course, the individual(s) with an intellectual disability. These include psychosocial treatments, behavioral treatments, cognitive- behavioral treatments, and family-oriented strategies.Mash, E., & Wolfe, D. (2013). Abnormal child psychology. (5th ed., pp. 308‚Äì313). Wadsworth Cengage Learning. Psychosocial treatments are intended primarily for children before and during the preschool years as this is the optimum time for intervention.Hodapp, R.M., & Burack, J.A. (2006). Developmental approaches to children with mental retardation: A second generation? In D. Cicchetti & D. J. Cohen (Eds.), Developmental psychopathology, Vol. 3: Risk, disorder, and adaptation (2nd ed., pp. 235‚Äì267). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. This early intervention should include encouragement of exploration, mentoring in basic skills, celebration of developmental advances, guided rehearsal and extension of newly acquired skills, protection from harmful displays of disapproval, teasing, or punishment, and exposure to a rich and responsive language environment. A great example of a successful intervention is the Carolina Abecedarian Project that was conducted with over 100 children from low socioeconomic status families beginning in infancy through pre-school years. Results indicated that by age 2, the children provided the intervention had higher test scores than control group children, and they remained approximately 5 points higher 10 years after the end of the program. By young adulthood, children from the intervention group had better educational attainment, employment opportunities, and fewer behavioral problems than their control-group counterparts. Core components of behavioral treatments include language and social skills acquisition. Typically, one-to-one training is offered in which a therapist uses a shaping procedure in combination with positive reinforcements to help the child pronounce syllables until words are completed. Sometimes involving pictures and visual aids, therapists aim at improving speech capacity so that short sentences about important daily tasks (e.g. bathroom use, eating, etc.) can be effectively communicated by the child. In a similar fashion, older children benefit from this type of training as they learn to sharpen their social skills such as sharing, taking turns, following instruction, and smiling. At the same time, a movement known as social inclusion attempts to increase valuable interactions between children with an intellectual disability and their non-disabled peers. Cognitive- behavioral treatments, a combination of the previous two treatment types, involves a strategical-metastrategical learning technique that teaches children math, language, and other basic skills pertaining to memory and learning. The first goal of the training is to teach the child to be a strategical thinker through making cognitive connections and plans. Then, the therapist teaches the child to be metastrategical by teaching them to discriminate among different tasks and determine which plan or strategy suits each task. Finally, family-oriented strategies delve into empowering the family with the skill set they need to support and encourage their child or children with an intellectual disability. In general, this includes teaching assertiveness skills or behavior management techniques as well as how to ask for help from neighbors, extended family, or day-care staff. As the child ages, parents are then taught how to approach topics such as housing/residential care, employment, and relationships. The ultimate goal for every intervention or technique is to give the child autonomy and a sense of independence using the acquired skills he/she has. In a 2019 Cochrane review on beginning reading interventions for children and adolescents with intellectual disability small to moderate improvements in phonological awareness, word reading, decoding, expressive and receptive language skills and reading fluency were noted when these elements were part of the teaching intervention. Although there is no specific medication for intellectual disability, many people with developmental disabilities have further medical complications and may be prescribed several medications. For example, autistic children with developmental delay may be prescribed antipsychotics or mood stabilizers to help with their behavior. Use of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines in people with intellectual disability requires monitoring and vigilance as side effects occur commonly and are often misdiagnosed as behavioral and psychiatric problems. Epidemiology Intellectual disability affects about 2‚Äì3% of the general population. 75‚Äì90% of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic ID accounts for 30‚Äì50% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people . It is more common in males and in low to middle income countries. History Intellectual disability has been documented under a variety of names throughout history. Throughout much of human history, society was unkind to those with any type of disability, and people with intellectual disability were commonly viewed as burdens on their families. Greek and Roman philosophers, who valued reasoning abilities, disparaged people with intellectual disability as barely human. The oldest physiological view of intellectual disability is in the writings of Hippocrates in the late fifth century BCE, who believed that it was caused by an imbalance in the four humors in the brain. Caliph Al-Walid (r. 705‚Äì715) built one of the first care homes for intellectually disabled individuals and built the first hospital which accommodated intellectually disabled individuals as part of its services. In addition, Al-Walid assigned each intellectually disabled individual a caregiver. Until the Enlightenment in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of basic physical needs such as food, shelter and clothing. Negative stereotypes were prominent in social attitudes of the time. In the 13th century, England declared people with intellectual disability to be incapable of making decisions or managing their affairs. Guardianships were created to take over their financial affairs. In the 17th century, Thomas Willis provided the first description of intellectual disability as a disease. He believed that it was caused by structural problems in the brain. According to Willis, the anatomical problems could be either an inborn condition or acquired later in life. In the 18th and 19th centuries, housing and care moved away from families and towards an asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large professional institutions, many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Individuals of higher wealth were often able to afford higher degrees of care such as home care or private asylums. Heavy tranquilization and assembly-line methods of support were the norm, and the medical model of disability prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the needs of the individual. A survey taken in 1891 in Cape Town, South Africa shows the distribution between different facilities. Out of 2046 persons surveyed, 1,281 were in private dwellings, 120 in jails, and 645 in asylums, with men representing nearly two-thirds of the number surveyed. In situations of scarcity of accommodation, preference was given to white men and black men (whose insanity threatened white society by disrupting employment relations and the tabooed sexual contact with white women). In the late 19th century, in response to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, Francis Galton proposed selective breeding of humans to reduce intellectual disability. Early in the 20th century, the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. This led to forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by Adolf Hitler as a rationale for the mass murder of people with intellectual disability during the holocaust. Eugenics was later abandoned as an evil violation of human rights, and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid-20th century. In 1905, Alfred Binet produced the first standardized test for measuring intelligence in children. Although ancient Roman law had declared people with intellectual disability to be incapable of the deliberate intent to harm that was necessary for a person to commit a crime, during the 1920s, Western society believed they were morally degenerate. Ignoring the prevailing attitude, Civitans adopted service to people with developmental disabilities as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for children with disabilities, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. The segregation of people with developmental disabilities was not widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work \\"The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models\\", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that \\"deviant\\" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of those with intellectual disability and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population. The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation. Successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980. From the 1960s to the present, most states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Normalization and deinstitutionalization are dominant. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad, a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services. By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of normalization. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts. In the past, lead poisoning and infectious diseases were significant causes of intellectual disability. Some causes of intellectual disability are decreasing, as medical advances, such as vaccination, increase. Other causes are increasing as a proportion of cases, perhaps due to rising maternal age, which is associated with several syndromic forms of intellectual disability. Along with the changes in terminology, and the downward drift in acceptability of the old terms, institutions of all kinds have had to repeatedly change their names. This affects the names of schools, hospitals, societies, government departments, and academic journals. For example, the Midlands Institute of Mental Subnormality became the British Institute of Mental Handicap and is now the British Institute of Learning Disability. This phenomenon is shared with mental health and motor disabilities, and seen to a lesser degree in sensory disabilities. =Terminology= The terms used for this condition are subject to a process called the euphemism treadmill. This means that whatever term is chosen for this condition, it eventually becomes perceived as an insult. The terms mental retardation and mentally retarded were invented in the middle of the 20th century to replace the previous set of terms, which included \\"imbecile\\"Fernald, Walter E. (1912). The imbecile with criminal instincts. Fourth edition. Boston: Ellis. .Duncan, P. Martin; Millard, William (1866). A manual for the classification, training, and education of the feeble-minded, imbecile, and idiotic. Longmans, Green, and Co. and \\"moron\\"Rafter, Nicole Hahn (1998). Creating Born Criminals. University of Illinois Press, and are now considered offensive. By the end of the 20th century, these terms themselves have come to be widely seen as disparaging, politically incorrect, and in need of replacement. The term intellectual disability is now preferred by most advocates and researchers in most English- speaking countries. The term \\"mental retardation\\" was used in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV (1994) and in the World Health Organization's ICD-10 (codes F70‚ÄìF79). In the next revision, the ICD-11, this term has been replaced by the term \\"disorders of intellectual development\\" (codes 6A00‚Äì6A04; 6A00.Z for the \\"unspecified\\" diagnosis code). The term \\"intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)\\" is used in DSM-5 (2013). , \\"intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)\\" is the term that has come into common use by among educational, psychiatric, and other professionals over the past two decades. Because of its specificity and lack of confusion with other conditions, the term \\"mental retardation\\" is still sometimes used in professional medical settings around the world, such as formal scientific research and health insurance paperwork. The several traditional terms that long predate psychiatry are simple forms of abuse in common usage today; they are often encountered in such old documents as books, academic papers, and census forms. For example, the British census of 1901 has a column heading including the terms imbecile and feeble-minded. Vaguer expressions like developmentally disabled,Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 2013 special, or challenged have been used instead of the term mentally retarded. The term developmental delay was popular among caretakers and parents of individuals with intellectual disability because delay suggests that a person is slowly reaching his or her full potential, rather than having a lifelong condition. Usage has changed over the years and differed from country to country. For example, mental retardation in some contexts covers the whole field but previously applied to what is now the mild MR group. Feeble-minded used to mean mild MR in the UK, and once applied in the US to the whole field. \\"Borderline intellectual functioning\\" is not currently defined, but the term may be used to apply to people with IQs in the 70s. People with IQs of 70 to 85 used to be eligible for special consideration in the US public education system on grounds of intellectual disability. * Cretin is the oldest and comes from a dialectal French word for Christian. The implication was that people with significant intellectual or developmental disabilities were \\"still human\\" (or \\"still Christian\\") and deserved to be treated with basic human dignity. Individuals with the condition were considered to be incapable of sinning, thus \\"christ-like\\" in their disposition. This term has not been used in scientific endeavors since the middle of the 20th century and is generally considered a term of abuse. Although cretin is no longer in use, the term cretinism is still used to refer to the mental and physical disability resulting from untreated congenital hypothyroidism. * Amentia has a long history, mostly associated with dementia. The difference between amentia and dementia was originally defined by time of onset. Amentia was the term used to denote an individual who developed deficits in mental functioning early in life, while dementia included individuals who develop mental deficiencies as adults. Theodor Meynert in the 1890s lectures described amentia as a form of sudden-onset confusion (), often with hallucinations. This term was long in use in psychiatry in this sense. Emil Kraepelin in the 1910s wrote that ‚Äúacute confusion (amentia)‚Äù is a form of febrile delirium. By 1912, amentia was a classification lumping \\"idiots, imbeciles, and feeble minded\\" individuals in a category separate from a dementia classification, in which the onset is later in life. In Russian psychiatry the term ‚Äúamentia‚Äù defines a form of clouding of consciousness, which is dominated by confusion, true hallucinations, incoherence of thinking and speech and chaotic movements. In Russia ‚Äúamentia‚Äù () is not associated with intellectual disability and mean only clouding of consciousness. * Idiot indicated the greatest degree of intellectual disability, where the mental age is two years or less, and the person cannot guard himself or herself against common physical dangers. The term was gradually replaced by the term profound mental retardation (which has itself since been replaced by other terms). * Imbecile indicated an intellectual disability less extreme than idiocy and not necessarily inherited. It is now usually subdivided into two categories, known as severe intellectual disability and moderate intellectual disability. * Moron was defined by the American Association for the Study of the Feeble- minded in 1910, following work by Henry H. Goddard, as the term for an adult with a mental age between eight and twelve; mild intellectual disability is now the term for this condition. Alternative definitions of these terms based on IQ were also used. This group was known in UK law from 1911 to 1959‚Äì60 as feeble-minded. * Mongolism and Mongoloid idiot were medical terms used to identify someone with Down syndrome, as the doctor who first described the syndrome, John Langdon Down, believed that children with Down syndrome shared facial similarities with Blumenbach's \\"Mongolian race\\". The Mongolian People's Republic requested that the medical community cease use of the term as a referent to intellectual disability. Their request was granted in the 1960s, when the World Health Organization agreed that the term should cease being used within the medical community. * In the field of special education, educable (or \\"educable intellectual disability\\") refers to ID students with IQs of approximately 50‚Äì75 who can progress academically to a late elementary level. Trainable (or \\"trainable intellectual disability\\") refers to students whose IQs fall below 50 but who are still capable of learning personal hygiene and other living skills in a sheltered setting, such as a group home. In many areas, these terms have been replaced by use of \\"moderate\\" and \\"severe\\" intellectual disability. While the names change, the meaning stays roughly the same in practice. * Retarded comes from the Latin retardare, \\"to make slow, delay, keep back, or hinder,\\" so mental retardation meant the same as mentally delayed. The term was recorded in 1426 as a \\"fact or action of making slower in movement or time\\". The first record of retarded in relation to being mentally slow was in 1895. The term mentally retarded was used to replace terms like idiot, moron, and imbecile because retarded was not then a derogatory term. By the 1960s, however, the term had taken on a partially derogatory meaning as well. The noun retard is particularly seen as pejorative; a BBC survey in 2003 ranked it as the most offensive disability- related word, ahead of terms such as spastic (or its abbreviation spaz) and mong. The terms mentally retarded and mental retardation are still fairly common, but currently the Special Olympics, Best Buddies, and over 100 other organizations are striving to eliminate their use by referring to the word retard and its variants as the \\"r-word\\", in an effort to equate it to the word nigger and the associated euphemism \\"n-word\\", in everyday conversation. These efforts resulted in federal legislation, known as Rosa's Law, which replaced the term mentally retarded with the term intellectual disability in federal statutes. The term mental retardation was a diagnostic term denoting the group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as idiot, imbecile, and moron derived from early IQ tests, which acquired pejorative connotations in popular discourse. It acquired negative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of the words retarded and retard as insults. This may have contributed to its replacement with euphemisms such as mentally challenged or intellectually disabled. While developmental disability includes many other disorders, developmental disability and developmental delay (for people under the age of 18) are generally considered more polite terms than mental retardation. United States Special Olympics USA team in July 2019 * In North America, intellectual disability is subsumed into the broader term developmental disability, which also includes epilepsy, autism, cerebral palsy, and other disorders that develop during the developmental period (birth to age 18). Because service provision is tied to the designation \\"developmental disability\\", it is used by many parents, direct support professionals, and physicians. In the United States, however, in school-based settings, the more specific term mental retardation or, more recently (and preferably), intellectual disability, is still typically used, and is one of 13 categories of disability under which children may be identified for special education services under Public Law 108‚Äì446. * The phrase intellectual disability is increasingly being used as a synonym for people with significantly below-average cognitive ability. These terms are sometimes used as a means of separating general intellectual limitations from specific, limited deficits as well as indicating that it is not an emotional or psychological disability. It is not specific to congenital disorders such as Down syndrome. The American Association on Mental Retardation changed its name to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) in 2007, and soon thereafter changed the names of its scholarly journals to reflect the term \\"intellectual disability\\". In 2010, the AAIDD released its 11th edition of its terminology and classification manual, which also used the term intellectual disability. United Kingdom In the UK, mental handicap had become the common medical term, replacing mental subnormality in Scotland and mental deficiency in England and Wales, until Stephen Dorrell, Secretary of State for Health for the United Kingdom from 1995‚Äì97, changed the NHS's designation to learning disability. The new term is not yet widely understood, and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork (the American usage), which are known in the UK as \\"learning difficulties\\". British social workers may use \\"learning difficulty\\" to refer to both people with intellectual disability and those with conditions such as dyslexia. In education, \\"learning difficulties\\" is applied to a wide range of conditions: \\"specific learning difficulty\\" may refer to dyslexia, dyscalculia or developmental coordination disorder, while \\"moderate learning difficulties\\", \\"severe learning difficulties\\" and \\"profound learning difficulties\\" refer to more significant impairments. In England and Wales between 1983 and 2008, the Mental Health Act 1983 defined \\"mental impairment\\" and \\"severe mental impairment\\" as \\"a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant/severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.\\" As behavior was involved, these were not necessarily permanent conditions: they were defined for the purpose of authorizing detention in hospital or guardianship. The term mental impairment was removed from the Act in November 2008, but the grounds for detention remained. However, English statute law uses mental impairment elsewhere in a less well-defined manner‚Äîe.g. to allow exemption from taxes‚Äîimplying that intellectual disability without any behavioral problems is what is meant. A BBC poll conducted in the United Kingdom came to the conclusion that 'retard' was the most offensive disability-related word. On the reverse side of that, when a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother live used the phrase \\"walking like a retard\\", despite complaints from the public and the charity Mencap, the communications regulator Ofcom did not uphold the complaint saying \\"it was not used in an offensive context [...] and had been used light-heartedly\\". It was, however, noted that two previous similar complaints from other shows were upheld. Australia In the past, Australia has used British and American terms interchangeably, including \\"mental retardation\\" and \\"mental handicap\\". Today, \\"intellectual disability\\" is the preferred and more commonly used descriptor. Society and culture Severely disabled girl in Bhutan People with intellectual disabilities are often not seen as full citizens of society. Person-centered planning and approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with disabilities, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts as well as support needs. The self-advocacy movement promotes the right of self-determination and self-direction by people with intellectually disabilities, which means allowing them to make decisions about their own lives. Until the middle of the 20th century, people with intellectual disabilities were routinely excluded from public education, or educated away from other typically developing children. Compared to peers who were segregated in special schools, students who are mainstreamed or included in regular classrooms report similar levels of stigma and social self- conception, but more ambitious plans for employment. As adults, they may live independently, with family members, or in different types of institutions organized to support people with disabilities. About 8% currently live in an institution or a group home. In the United States, the average lifetime cost of a person with an intellectual disability amounts to $223,000 per person, in 2003 US dollars, for direct costs such as medical and educational expenses. The indirect costs were estimated at $771,000, due to shorter lifespans and lower than average economic productivity. The total direct and indirect costs, which amount to a little more than a million dollars, are slightly more than the economic costs associated with cerebral palsy, and double that associated with serious vision or hearing impairments. Of the costs, about 14% is due to increased medical expenses (not including what is normally incurred by the typical person), and 10% is due to direct non-medical expenses, such as the excess cost of special education compared to standard schooling. The largest amount, 76%, is indirect costs accounting for reduced productivity and shortened lifespans. Some expenses, such as ongoing costs to family caregivers or the extra costs associated with living in a group home, were excluded from this calculation. Health disparities People with intellectual disability are usually at a higher risk of living with complex health conditions such as epilepsy and neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric problems compared to people without disabilities. Adults also have a higher prevalence of poor social determinants of health, behavioral risk factors, depression, diabetes, and poor or fair health status than adults without intellectual disability. In the United Kingdom people with intellectual disability live on average 16 years less than the general population. Some of the barriers that exist for people with ID accessing quality healthcare include: communication challenges, service eligibility, lack of training for healthcare providers, diagnostic overshadowing, and absence of targeted health promotion services. Key recommendations from the CDC for improving the health status for people with intellectual disabilities include: improve access to health care, improve data collection, strengthen the workforce, include people with ID in public health programs, and prepare for emergencies with people with disabilities in mind.

Although the term often refers to the study of three- dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.  Overview  Computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the mathematical and computational foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely aesthetic issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of visualization, although the two fields have many similarities. Connected studies include: * Applied mathematics * Computational geometry * Computational topology * Computer vision * Image processing * Information visualization * Scientific visualization Applications of computer graphics include: *Print design *Digital art *Special effects *Video games *Visual effects  History  There are several international conferences and journals where the most significant results in computer graphics are published. Among them are the SIGGRAPH and Eurographics conferences and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Transactions on Graphics journal. The joint Eurographics and ACM SIGGRAPH symposium series features the major venues for the more specialized sub- fields: Symposium on Geometry Processing, Symposium on Rendering, Symposium on Computer Animation, and High Performance Graphics. As in the rest of computer science, conference publications in computer graphics are generally more significant than journal publications (and subsequently have lower acceptance rates).An extensive history of computer graphics can be found at this page .  Subfields  A broad classification of major subfields in computer graphics might be: # Geometry: ways to represent and process surfaces # Animation: ways to represent and manipulate motion # Rendering: algorithms to reproduce light transport # Imaging: image acquisition or image editing = Geometry = Successive approximations of a surface computed using quadric error metrics The subfield of geometry studies the representation of three-dimensional objects in a discrete digital setting. Because the appearance of an object depends largely on its exterior, boundary representations are most commonly used. Two dimensional surfaces are a good representation for most objects, though they may be non-manifold. Since surfaces are not finite, discrete digital approximations are used. Polygonal meshes (and to a lesser extent subdivision surfaces) are by far the most common representation, although point-based representations have become more popular recently (see for instance the Symposium on Point-Based Graphics). These representations are Lagrangian, meaning the spatial locations of the samples are independent. Recently, Eulerian surface descriptions (i.e., where spatial samples are fixed) such as level sets have been developed into a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes (with fluids being the most notable example). ; Geometry Subfields * Implicit surface modeling ‚Äì an older subfield which examines the use of algebraic surfaces, constructive solid geometry, etc., for surface representation. * Digital geometry processing ‚Äì surface reconstruction, simplification, fairing, mesh repair, parameterization, remeshing, mesh generation, surface compression, and surface editing all fall under this heading. CS 598: Digital Geometry Processing (Fall 2004) * Discrete differential geometry ‚Äì a nascent field which defines geometric quantities for the discrete surfaces used in computer graphics. * Point-based graphics ‚Äì a recent field which focuses on points as the fundamental representation of surfaces. * Subdivision surfaces * Out-of-core mesh processing ‚Äì another recent field which focuses on mesh datasets that do not fit in main memory. = Animation = The subfield of animation studies descriptions for surfaces (and other phenomena) that move or deform over time. Historically, most work in this field has focused on parametric and data- driven models, but recently physical simulation has become more popular as computers have become more powerful computationally. ; Subfields * Performance capture * Character animation * Physical simulation (e.g. cloth modeling, animation of fluid dynamics, etc.) = Rendering = Indirect diffuse scattering simulated using path tracing and irradiance caching. Rendering generates images from a model. Rendering may simulate light transport to create realistic images or it may create images that have a particular artistic style in non-photorealistic rendering. The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light passes from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light). See Rendering (computer graphics) for more information. ; Transport Transport describes how illumination in a scene gets from one place to another. Visibility is a major component of light transport. ; Scattering Models of scattering and shading are used to describe the appearance of a surface. In graphics these problems are often studied within the context of rendering since they can substantially affect the design of rendering algorithms. Shading can be broken down into two orthogonal issues, which are often studied independently: # scattering ‚Äì how light interacts with the surface at a given point # shading ‚Äì how material properties vary across the surface The former problem refers to scattering, i.e., the relationship between incoming and outgoing illumination at a given point. Descriptions of scattering are usually given in terms of a bidirectional scattering distribution function or BSDF. The latter issue addresses how different types of scattering are distributed across the surface (i.e., which scattering function applies where). Descriptions of this kind are typically expressed with a program called a shader. (Note that there is some confusion since the word \\"shader\\" is sometimes used for programs that describe local geometric variation.) ;Other subfields * Non-photorealistic rendering * Physically based rendering ‚Äì concerned with generating images according to the laws of geometric optics * Real-time rendering ‚Äì focuses on rendering for interactive applications, typically using specialized hardware like GPUs * Relighting ‚Äì recent area concerned with quickly re-rendering scenes  Notable researchers  * Arthur Appel * James Arvo * Brian A.

Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by computer graphics hardware. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as computer generated imagery (CGI). Some topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surface visualization, image processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, physics, and perception. Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world, such as photo and video content. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, and graphic design in general.  Overview  The term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe \\"almost everything on computers that is not text or sound\\".What is Computer Graphics?, Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009. Typically, the term computer graphics refers to several different things: * the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer * the various technologies used to create and manipulate images * methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see study of computer graphics Today, computer graphics is widespread. Such imagery is found in and on television, newspapers, weather reports, and in a variety of medical investigations and surgical procedures. A well-constructed graph can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media \\"such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, theses\\", and other presentation material.University of Leeds ISS (2002). \\"What are computer graphics?\\" . Last updated: 22 September 2008 Many tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics. As technology has improved, 3D computer graphics have become more common, but 2D computer graphics are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization, and scientific visualization more concerned with \\"the visualization of three dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component\\".Michael Friendly (2008). \\"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization\\".  History =Introduction= The precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place during the first half of the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, was invented in 1897 ‚Äì it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel ‚Äì the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-World War II period ‚Äì during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further development of technologies like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading to the development of computer graphics as a discipline. = 1950s = SAGE Sector Control Room. Early projects like the Whirlwind and SAGE Projects introduced the CRT as a viable display and interaction interface and introduced the light pen as an input device. Douglas T. Ross of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics ‚Äì Tennis for Two ‚Äì was created for an oscilloscope by William Higinbotham to entertain visitors in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, Douglas T. Ross innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated 3D machine tool vectors by taking the opportunity to create a display scope image of a Disney cartoon character.Ross on MIT TECH TV 1959 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob9NV8mmm20 Electronics pioneer Hewlett-Packard went public in 1957 after incorporating the decade prior, and established strong ties with Stanford University through its founders, who were alumni. This began the decades-long transformation of the southern San Francisco Bay Area into the world's leading computer technology hub ‚Äì now known as Silicon Valley. The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware. Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects ‚Äì not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires. = 1960s = Spacewar! running on the Computer History Museum's PDP-1 The phrase \\"computer graphics\\" itself was coined in 1960 by William Fetter, a graphic designer for Boeing.Wayne Carlson (2003) A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation . Ohio State University This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence: :Fetter has said that the terms were actually given to him by Verne Hudson of the Wichita Division of Boeing.Jon Peddie: The History of Visual Magic in Computers: How Beautiful Images are Made in CAD, 3D, VR and AR, Springer, 2013, p. 101, In 1961 another student at MIT, Steve Russell, created another important title in the history of video games, Spacewar!. Written for the DEC PDP-1, Spacewar! was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy. The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the \\"world's first video game\\" for their new customers. (Higginbotham's Tennis For Two had beaten Spacewar by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.) At around the same time (1961-1962) in the University of Cambridge, Elizabeth Waldram wrote code to display radio-astronomy maps on a cathode ray tube.EDSAC 1 and after - a compilation of personal reminiscences, Retrieved 11 July 2019. E. E. Zajac, a scientist at Bell Telephone Laboratory (BTL), created a film called \\"Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system\\" in 1963.David Salomon (1999). Computer graphics and geometric modeling. p. ix In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an IBM 7090 mainframe computer. Also at BTL, Ken Knowlton, Frank Sinden, Ruth A. Weiss and Michael Noll started working in the computer graphics field. Sinden created a film called Force, Mass and Motion illustrating Newton's laws of motion in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Nelson Max created the films Flow of a Viscous Fluid and Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form. Boeing Aircraft created a film called Vibration of an Aircraft. Also sometime in the early 1960s, automobiles would also provide a boost through the early work of Pierre B√©zier at Renault, who used Paul de Casteljau's curves ‚Äì now called B√©zier curves after B√©zier's work in the field ‚Äì to develop 3d modeling techniques for Renault car bodies. These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves ‚Äì unlike polygons ‚Äì are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well. Pong arcade version It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics through the 1970s. Also in 1966, Ivan Sutherland continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled head-mounted display (HMD). It displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D. The heavy hardware required for supporting the display and tracker was called the Sword of Damocles because of the potential danger if it were to fall upon the wearer. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah ‚Äì a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company. In 1968, Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland founded the first computer graphics hardware company, Evans & Sutherland. While Sutherland originally wanted the company to be located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Salt Lake City was instead chosen due to its proximity to the professors' research group at the University of Utah. Also in 1968 Arthur Appel described the first ray casting algorithm, the first of a class of ray tracing-based rendering algorithms that have since become fundamental in achieving photorealism in graphics by modeling the paths that rays of light take from a light source, to surfaces in a scene, and into the camera. In 1969, the ACM initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics (SIGGRAPH) which organizes conferences, graphics standards, and publications within the field of computer graphics. By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time. = 1970s = An important technological advance that enabled practical computer graphics technology was the emergence of metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology in the early 1970s. MOS LSI technology made possible large amounts of computational capability in small MOS integrated circuit chips, which led to the development of the Tektronix 4010 computer graphics terminal in 1972, as well as the microprocessor in 1971. MOS memory, particularly the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip introduced in 1970, was also capable of holding kilobits of data on a single high-density memory chip, making it possible to hold an entire standard-definition (SD) raster graphics image in a digital frame buffer, which was used by Xerox PARC to develop SuperPaint, the first video-compatible, raster-based computer graphics system, in 1972. The Utah teapot by Martin Newell and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development during the 1970s. Subsequently, a number of breakthroughs in the field ‚Äì particularly important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic ‚Äì occurred at the University of Utah in the 1970s, which had hired Ivan Sutherland. He was paired with David C. Evans to teach an advanced computer graphics class, which contributed a great deal of founding research to the field and taught several students who would grow to found several of the industry's most important companies ‚Äì namely Pixar, Silicon Graphics, and Adobe Systems. Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. One of these students was Edwin Catmull. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first computer animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered texture mapping to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in 3D modeling. It became one of his goals to produce a feature- length motion picture using computer graphics ‚Äì a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in Pixar. In the same class, Fred Parke created an animation of his wife's face. The two animations were included in the 1976 feature film Futureworld. As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, John Warnock was another of those early pioneers; he later founded Adobe Systems and create a revolution in the publishing world with his PostScript page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard photo editing software in Adobe Photoshop and a prominent movie industry special effects program in Adobe After Effects. James Clark was also there; he later founded Silicon Graphics, a maker of advanced rendering systems that would dominate the field of high-end graphics until the early 1990s. A major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers ‚Äì hidden surface determination. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are \\"behind\\" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be \\"hidden\\" when the computer creates (or renders) the image. The 3D Core Graphics System (or Core) was the first graphical standard to be developed. A group of 25 experts of the ACM Special Interest Group SIGGRAPH developed this \\"conceptual framework\\". The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future developments in the field. Also in the 1970s, Henri Gouraud, Jim Blinn and Bui Tuong Phong contributed to the foundations of shading in CGI via the development of the Gouraud shading and Blinn-Phong shading models, allowing graphics to move beyond a \\"flat\\" look to a look more accurately portraying depth. Jim Blinn also innovated further in 1978 by introducing bump mapping, a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today. The modern videogame arcade as is known today was birthed in the 1970s, with the first arcade games using real-time 2D sprite graphics. Pong in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games. Speed Race in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically scrolling road. Gun Fight in 1975 featured human-looking animated characters, while Space Invaders in 1978 featured a large number of animated figures on screen; both used a specialized barrel shifter circuit made from discrete chips to help their Intel 8080 microprocessor animate their framebuffer graphics. = 1980s = Donkey Kong was one of the video games that helped to popularize computer graphics to a mass audience in the 1980s. The 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics. As the home computer proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly. In the early 1980s, metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology led to the availability of 16-bit central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors and the first graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, which began to revolutionize computer graphics, enabling high-resolution graphics for computer graphics terminals as well as personal computer (PC) systems. NEC's ¬µPD7220 was the first GPU, fabricated on a fully integrated NMOS VLSI chip. It supported up to 1024x1024 resolution, and laid the foundations for the emerging PC graphics market. It was used in a number of graphics cards, and was licensed for clones such as the Intel 82720, the first of Intel's graphics processing units. MOS memory also became cheaper in the early 1980s, enabling the development of affordable framebuffer memory, notably video RAM (VRAM) introduced by Texas Instruments (TI) in the mid-1980s. In 1984, Hitachi released the ARTC HD63484, the first complementary MOS (CMOS) GPU. It was capable of displaying high-resolution in color mode and up to 4K resolution in monochrome mode, and it was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late 1980s. In 1986, TI introduced the TMS34010, the first fully programmable MOS graphics processor. Computer graphics terminals during this decade became increasingly intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers. Typical of the early move to high- resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from Bell-Northern Research, and led by David Pearson, an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on the 16-bit Motorola 68000 microprocessor and AMD bit-slice processors, and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh, as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods. The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use graphical user interfaces (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology. In the field of realistic rendering, Japan's Osaka University developed the LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System, a supercomputer that used up to 257 Zilog Z8001 microprocessors, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic 3D computer graphics. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: \\"The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, light source, and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D planetarium-like video of the entire heavens that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the Fujitsu pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in Tsukuba.\\" The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful computer, as of 1984.http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=29 Also in the field of realistic rendering, the general rendering equation of David Immel and James Kajiya was developed in 1986 ‚Äì an important step towards implementing global illumination, which is necessary to pursue photorealism in computer graphics. The continuing popularity of Star Wars and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic became known as the \\"go-to\\" house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in chroma keying (\\"bluescreening\\", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: Dire Straits' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song \\"Money for Nothing\\" in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from Young Sherlock Holmes the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass knight). In 1988, the first shaders ‚Äì small programs designed specifically to do shading as a separate algorithm ‚Äì were developed by Pixar, which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity ‚Äì though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics (SGI) computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated short films at Pixar, and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade. The 1980s is also called the golden era of videogames; millions-selling systems from Atari, Nintendo and Sega, among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience ‚Äì as did MS-DOS-based personal computers, Apple IIs, Macs, and Amigas, all of which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough. For the arcades, advances were made in commercial, real-time 3D graphics. In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D graphics boards were introduced for arcades, with the Namco System 21 and Taito Air System. On the professional side, Evans & Sutherland and SGI developed 3D raster graphics hardware that directly influenced the later single-chip graphics processing unit (GPU), a technology where a separate and very powerful chip is used in parallel processing with a CPU to optimize graphics. The decade also saw computer graphics applied to many additional professional markets, including location-based entertainment and education with the E&S; Digistar, vehicle design, vehicle simulation, and chemistry. = 1990s = Quarxs, series poster, Maurice Benayoun, Fran√ßois Schuiten, 1992 The 1990s' overwhelming note was the emergence of 3D modeling on a mass scale and an impressive rise in the quality of CGI generally. Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as 3D modelers became available for home systems, the popularity of Silicon Graphics workstations declined and powerful Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh machines running Autodesk products like 3D Studio or other home rendering software ascended in importance. By the end of the decade, the GPU would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today. The field began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as photorealistic to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and 3D graphics became far more popular in gaming, multimedia, and animation. At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: La Vie des b√™tes by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), Les Fables G√©om√©triques (1989‚Äì1991) by studio Fant√¥me, and Quarxs, the first HDTV computer graphics series by Maurice Benayoun and Fran√ßois Schuiten (studio Z-A production, 1990‚Äì1993). In film, Pixar began its serious commercial rise in this era under Edwin Catmull, with its first major film release, in 1995 ‚Äì Toy Story ‚Äì a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude. The studio to invent the programmable shader would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trail breaker. In video games, in 1992, Virtua Racing, running on the Sega Model 1 arcade system board, laid the foundations for fully 3D racing games and popularized real-time 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience in the video game industry. The Sega Model 2 in 1993 and Sega Model 3 in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics. Back on the PC, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, three of the first massively popular 3D first-person shooter games, were released by id Software to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated primarily by John Carmack. The Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64, among other consoles, sold in the millions and popularized 3D graphics for home gamers. Certain late-1990s first-generation 3D titles became seen as influential in popularizing 3D graphics among console users, such as platform games Super Mario 64 and The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time, and early 3D fighting games like Virtua Fighter, Battle Arena Toshinden, and Tekken. Technology and algorithms for rendering continued to improve greatly. In 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented normal mapping ‚Äì an improvement on Jim Blinn's bump mapping. 1999 saw Nvidia release the seminal GeForce 256, the first home video card billed as a graphics processing unit or GPU, which in its own words contained \\"integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines\\". By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as DirectX and OpenGL. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful graphics hardware and 3D modeling software. AMD also became a leading developer of graphics boards in this decade, creating a \\"duopoly\\" in the field which exists this day. = 2000s = A screenshot from the videogame Killing Floor, built in Unreal Engine 2. Personal computers and console video games took a great graphical leap forward in the 2000s, becoming able to display graphics in real time computing that had previously only been possible pre-rendered and/or on business-level hardware. CGI became ubiquitous in earnest during this era. Video games and CGI cinema had spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s. CGI was also adopted en masse for television advertisements widely in the late 1990s and 2000s, and so became familiar to a massive audience. The continued rise and increasing sophistication of the graphics processing unit were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for desktop computer makers to offer. The Nvidia GeForce line of graphics cards dominated the market in the early decade with occasional significant competing presence from ATI.The Future Of Computer Graphics Daniel Sevo, 2005 (retrieved 26 February 2015) As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as Nvidia and AMD both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market. Shaders which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved texture and shading in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of normal mapping, bump mapping, and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail. Computer graphics used in films and video games gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the uncanny valley. CGI movies proliferated, with traditional animated cartoon films like Ice Age and Madagascar as well as numerous Pixar offerings like Finding Nemo dominating the box office in this field. The Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.Cinema: A Painstaking Fantasy Chris Taylor, Time, 31 July 2000 (retrieved 8 August 2012). The film was not a box-office success, however.Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within at Box Office Mojo (retrieved 12 August 2012). Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the \\"uncanny valley\\". Other animated films like The Polar Express drew attention at this time as well. Star Wars also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film. In videogames, the Sony PlayStation 2 and 3, the Microsoft Xbox line of consoles, and offerings from Nintendo such as the GameCube maintained a large following, as did the Windows PC. Marquee CGI-heavy titles like the series of Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, Final Fantasy, BioShock, Kingdom Hearts, Mirror's Edge and dozens of others continued to approach photorealism, grow the video game industry and impress, until that industry's revenues became comparable to those of movies. Microsoft made a decision to expose DirectX more easily to the independent developer world with the XNA program, but it was not a success. DirectX itself remained a commercial success, however. OpenGL continued to mature as well, and it and DirectX improved greatly; the second-generation shader languages HLSL and GLSL began to be popular in this decade. In scientific computing, the GPGPU technique to pass large amounts of data bidirectionally between a GPU and CPU was invented; speeding up analysis on many kinds of bioinformatics and molecular biology experiments. The technique has also been used for Bitcoin mining and has applications in computer vision. = 2010s = A diamond plate texture rendered close-up using physically based rendering principles ‚Äì increasingly an active area of research for computer graphics in the 2010s. In the 2010s, CGI has been nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically photorealistic, and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye. Texture mapping has matured into a multistage process with many layers; generally, it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, bump mapping or isosurfaces or normal mapping, lighting maps including specular highlights and reflection techniques, and shadow volumes into one rendering engine using shaders, which are maturing considerably. Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating pixels, vertices, and textures on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects. Their shader languages HLSL and GLSL are active fields of research and development. Physically based rendering or PBR, which implements many maps and performs advanced calculation to simulate real optic light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced areas like ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, Rayleigh scattering, photon mapping, and many others. Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in real time at ultra-high-resolution modes like 4K Ultra HD are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware. In cinema, most animated movies are CGI now; a great many animated CGI films are made per year, but few, if any, attempt photorealism due to continuing fears of the uncanny valley. Most are 3D cartoons. In videogames, the Microsoft Xbox One, Sony PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch currently dominate the home space and are all capable of highly advanced 3D graphics; the Windows PC is still one of the most active gaming platforms as well.  Image types = Two- dimensional = Raster graphic sprites (left) and masks (right) 2D computer graphics are the computer-based generation of digital images‚Äîmostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them. 2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies such as typography. In those applications, the two-dimensional image is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two- dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than 3D computer graphics, whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography.  Pixel art  A large form of digital art, pixel art is created through the use of raster graphics software, where images are edited on the pixel level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, graphing calculator games, and many mobile phone games are mostly pixel art.  Sprite graphics  A sprite is a two- dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory bitmap of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays. Originally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a screen, such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the data defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic circuitry or software. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a hardware construct that employs custom DMA channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.  Vector graphics  Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics. Vector graphics formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for the representation of photographic images. Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools. = Three- dimensional = 3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data. For the purpose of performance, this is stored in the computer. This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing. Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar algorithms as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques. 3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical computer simulations and calculations. = Computer animation = Example of Computer animation produced using Motion capture Fractal landscape, an example of computer-generated imagery. Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films. Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up). To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer screen then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in television and motion pictures.  Concepts and principles  Images are typically created by devices such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc. Digital images include both vector images and raster images, but raster images are more commonly used. = Pixel = In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen. In digital imaging, a pixel (or picture element) is a single point in a raster image. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three components such as red, green, and blue. Graphics are visual presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style. = Primitives = Primitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models. Examples would be sprites and character maps in 2D video games, geometric primitives in CAD, or polygons or triangles in 3D rendering. Primitives may be supported in hardware for efficient rendering, or the building blocks provided by a graphics application. = Rendering = Rendering is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term \\"rendering\\" may be by analogy with an \\"artist's rendering\\" of a scene. Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device, such as a GPU. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the rendering equation. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output. ; 3D projection : 3D projection is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread. This method is used in most real-time 3D applications and typically uses rasterization to produce the final image. ; Ray tracing : Ray tracing is a technique from the family of image order algorithms for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane. The technique is capable of producing a high degree of photorealism; usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost. ; Shading Example of shading. : Shading refers to depicting depth in 3D models or illustrations by varying levels of darkness. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including cross hatching where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that shaders are applied. ; Texture mapping : Texture mapping is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.Blythe, David. Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL. Siggraph 1999. (see: Multitexture) Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss. ; Anti-aliasing : Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a liquid-crystal display or CRT television inevitably causes aliasing artifacts mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called \\"jaggies\\". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as supersampling) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased bitmap texture being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any procedurally defined texture will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as mipmapping and texture filtering help to solve texture-related aliasing problems. = Volume rendering = CT scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood. Volume rendering is a technique used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a CT or MRI scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel. = 3D modeling = 3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, wireframe representation of any three-dimensional object, called a \\"3D model\\", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, polygonal mesh modeling (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh subdivision (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering, used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using 3D Printing devices.  Pioneers in computer graphics  ; Charles Csuri : Charles Csuri is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964. Csuri was recognized by Smithsonian as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and Association for Computing Machinery-SIGGRAPH. ; Donald P. Greenberg : Donald P. Greenberg is a leading innovator in computer graphics. Greenberg has authored hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists, animators, and researchers such as Robert L. Cook, Marc Levoy, Brian A. Barsky, and Wayne Lytle. Many of his former students have won Academy Awards for technical achievements and several have won the SIGGRAPH Achievement Award. Greenberg was the founding director of the NSF Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization. ; A. Michael Noll : Noll was one of the first researchers to use a digital computer to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random processes in the creation of visual arts. He began creating digital art in 1962, making him one of the earliest digital artists. In 1965, Noll along with Frieder Nake and Georg Nees were the first to publicly exhibit their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery exhibited Noll's computer art along with random- dot patterns by Bela Julesz. =Other pioneers = A modern render of the Utah teapot, an iconic model in 3D computer graphics created by Martin Newell, 1975 * Pierre B√©zier * Jim Blinn * Jack Bresenham * John Carmack * Paul de Casteljau * Ed Catmull * Frank Crow * James D.

Although the term often refers to three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing. As an academic discipline, computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the mathematical and computational foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely aesthetic issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of visualization, although the two fields have many similarities.  Applications  Computer graphics may be used in the following areas: * Computational biology * Computational photography * Computational physics * Computer-aided design * Computer simulation * Design * Digital art * Education * Graphic design * Infographics * Information visualization * Rational drug design * Scientific visualization * Special Effects for cinema * Video Games * Virtual reality * Web design  See also  * Glossary of computer graphics  Notes  References  Further reading  * L.

He wrote a 100-page book entitled \\"Kennedy and Sirhan: Why?\\", and had said that he believed Sirhan had acted in justifiable self- defense, stating: \\"Sirhan was defending himself against those 50 Phantom jets Kennedy was sending to Israel.\\" After the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, he gave counsel to the blind sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was later convicted and given a life sentence for his role in the attacks. He has also been criticized for his denouncing of Yasser Arafat, especially by those within the Muslim organizations. Regarding Arafat's red-carpet welcome from President Bill Clinton, M. T. Mehdi, then-president of the American Arab and Muslim Council, denounced Arafat as \\"... a pawn in the reelection bids of both Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres...\\", who visited the White House on April 30, 1996. \\"He is being as well-received as Peres because he is doing what Peres wants him to do,\\" said Mehdi. \\"It's a charade.\\" Publications * Kennedy and Sirhan: Why?

Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states (\\"low state\\" and \\"high state\\", \\"0\\" and \\"1\\"). The main purpose of a digital pattern generator is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a digital pattern generator are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards ‚Äì TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS and LVDS, for instance. Digital pattern generators are sometimes referred to as \\"pulse generator\\" or \\"pulse pattern generator\\" which may be able to function as digital pattern generators as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A digital pattern generator is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called \\"logic source\\". A pulse generator is of purpose to generate electrical pulse of different shapes; they are mostly used for tests at an electrical or analog level. Another common name for such equipment is \\"digital logic source\\" or \\"logic source\\". Digital pattern generator can produce either repetitive, or single-shot signals in which case some kind of triggering source is required (internal or external).  Types of digital pattern generators  Digital pattern generators are today available as stand-alone units, add-on hardware modules for other equipment such as a [logic analyzer] or as PC-based equipment. Stand-alone units are self-contained devices that include everything from the user interface to define the patterns that should be generated to the electronic equipment that actually generates the output signal. Some test equipment manufacturers propose pattern generators as add-on modules for logic analyzers (see for example the PG3A module for Tektronix' TLA7000 series of logic analyzers or Hewlett-Packard 16520A/16522A modules for 16500-series of logic analyzers). In this case, the pattern generator is the \\"generation counterpart\\" to the analysis functionality offered by logic analyzers. PC-based digital pattern generators are connected to a PC through peripheral ports such as PCI, USB and/or Ethernet (see for example the \\"Wave Generator Xpress\\" from Byte Paradigm, connected through USB). They use the PC as user interface for defining and storing the digital patterns to be sent.  Features  Digital pattern generators are primarily characterized by a number of digital channels, a maximum rate and the supported voltage standards. * The number of digital channels defines the maximum width of any pattern generated - typically, 8-bits, 16-bits, 32 bits pattern generator. A 16-bits pattern generator is able to generate arbitrary digital samples on from 1 to 16 bits. * The maximum rate defines the minimum time interval between 2 successive patterns. For instance, a 50 MHz (50 MSample/s) digital pattern generator is able to output a new pattern every 20 nanoseconds. * The supported voltage standards ultimately define the set of electronic devices a digital pattern generator can be used with. Concretely, the voltages and the transition characteristics of the signal at the output of the digital pattern generator will be compliant to these voltage standards. Examples of supported voltage standards: TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS, LVDS. Most digital pattern generator add features such as the ability to generate a repetitive sequence or a digital clock signal at a specified frequency, the ability to use an external clock input and triggering options, to start pattern generation upon the reception of an event from an external input.  Common applications  * Digital electronics and embedded system testing and debugging * Stimulation of digital signal processing hardware * Digital-to-analog converter stimulation  Special purpose digital pattern generators  Video digital pattern generators are digital pattern generators dedicated to the generation of a specific test pattern in a specific digital video format such as DVI or HDMI. In safety critical technology such as automotive, specialised electronic systems are involved to keep its correct functioning. These can be used for the monitoring of brakes, motor and airbag. Internal testing is undertaken for these electronic systems by pattern generators, i.e. LFSR that feeds the circuit under test, verifying output correctness.Mart√≠nez LH, Khursheed S, Reddy SM.

The devalaya is dedicated to Kataragama deviyo. A local deity called Devatha Bandara is also worshiped at this site. The shrine consists of three sections, the \\"Sanctum of Garagha\\", the \\"Digge\\" or \\"Dancing Hall\\" and the \\"Hevisi Mandapaya\\" or the \\"Drummers' Hall\\". The Drummers' Hall has drawn the attention of visitors to the site, due to the splendid wood carvingsBooklet Kandy Embekke Wood Carvings by M. W. E. Karunaratna of its ornate pillars and its high pitched roof.  Location  Embekka Devalaya is situated in Medapalata Korale of Udunuwara in Kandy district. This is a sheltered place used to rest during long pilgrimage or long journeys in ancient days of Sri Lanka. This Ambalama is said to be built during A.D. 1341 - 1357 by the King Bhuwanekabhahu IV.  Carvings and woodwork  It is said that some of the wood work utilised for the \\"Drummers' Hall\\" came from an abandoned \\"Royal Audience Hall\\" at Gampola. There is every possibility the hall has seen repairs during the reigns of the Sinhalese Kings of Kandy. The carvings, which adorn the wooden pillars of the drummers' hall, as well as the \\"Vahalkada\\" (the entrance porch of the devala, which is said to be older) are some of the best examples of Sinhalese art. The base of the wooden pillars are octagonal shaped while their pillar top or \\"Pedaka\\", has four leaves stacked in a square. The most noted and famous carvings out of them are the entwined swans, double headed eagles, entwined rope designs, breast-feeding image, a soldier fighting on horseback, female dancers, wrestlers, women emanating from a vein, bird-human hybrid, elephant-bull hybrid and elephant-lion hybrid. The roof has significant features. The rafters all slant from above towards the incoming visitor are fixed together and kept in position by a \\"Madol Kurupawa\\", a kind of a giant catch pin the like of which we do not find elsewhere.

Career Born in Bo'ness, near Falkirk, Bennett joined Aston Villa on schoolboy forms aged 14, and was given a professional contract in 1987. However, he remained on their books as a senior pro for just one season before being released without making a first team appearance in July 1988. He joined fellow Midlanders Wolverhampton Wanderers the following day and made his league debut on 10 January 1989 as a substitute in a 2‚Äì0 win against Cardiff. He made the vast majority of his Wolves appearances between 1990-1992 (in the second tier), and from then onward made only sporadic first team outings. He was eventually sold in June 1995 to Stockport County for ¬£75,000. At Edgeley Park, he quickly became a first choice player and was part of the team that won promotion from the Second Division in 1996‚Äì97, a season which also saw them reach the League Cup semi-finals. Here, he played in his preferred midfield role rather than the full-back position he had usually occupied with his previous club. His career at County was interrupted by a broken leg sustained at Birmingham in January 1998. This injury ended his status as an automatic choice and he made just 17 further appearances for the club over the following two seasons. After 146 appearances in total, he left Stockport for Walsall in July 2000, after previously having had two loan spells with them. He became their captain and helped them gain promotion to the First Division via the play-offs in his first full season, beating Reading in the final. He was a virtual ever-present in their first season back in the second flight, but departed at its conclusion for Boston United. He played in Boston's inaugural season in the Football League, but left midway through their second season for fellow League Two side Kidderminster Harriers. However, Harriers were relegated from the league at the season's end and Bennett returned to his native Scotland with Hamilton Academical.

He was a successful artist during his lifetime and could even count Queen Victoria as an admirer of his work.Queen Victoria ordered a proof of Puss in Boots following its exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1880 (source of information: Animal Magic by John Adams, Country Life magazine, 22 December 1988). His most famous compositions, \\"Fairest of Them All\\" and \\"Puss in Boots\\" (1880), have adorned many a wall in the form of plates and posters. In addition, his series of printed Christmas cards published between 1880 and 1909 have become an affordable way for those interested in Paton's art to begin a collection. Biography A Proud Mother Frank Paton was born on 23 November 1855 in Stepney, London, England.Information obtained from the birth certificate of Frank Paton, registered on 1 January 1856 in the sub district of Ratcliff, Middlesex. His parents were James Paton and Mary Ann Paton (n√©e Ross) and he was the youngest of their seven children.The parish records of a) St Peter & St Paul, Milton near Gravesend b) St Vincent street Scotch Church, Stepney and c) St Dunstan, Stepney reveal that James and Mary Ann Paton had six sons, other than Frank, and a daughter (also called Mary Ann) between the years 1838 and 1851. Their fourth son, Charles, died in infancy from cholera (source of information: death certificate of Charles Henry Paton, registered 27 August 1846 in the sub-district of Mile End Old Town, Middlesex). Although Stepney, in the East End of London, was a stronghold for the Paton family,The Parish records of St Dunstan, Stepney, show that Frank Paton's paternal grandparents were called James and Mary Paton and that they were resident in Stepney from 1808. According to the 1841 census of England and Wales, both were Scottish. Census returns and parish records show that many of their children established families in Stepney and surrounding parishes. Frank Paton grew up in and around Gravesend, Kent as his father was a maritime pilot The Corporation of Trinity House Registers of Pilots' Licences (London) 1808-1986, Guildhall Library (Ms 30172) record James Paton as first being examined by them on 27 October 1840. His last entry in the register is dated 2 December 1856 and his address was \\"Gravesend\\". 1861 and 1871 England and Wales Census returns for the parishes of Milton and Gravesend respectively, confirm that James Paton remained a Pilot for the rest of his working life. Both censuses show Frank Paton living with his family. (Gravesend, at the mouth of the river Thames, was a pilot station for the port of London).Source: Pears Encyclopaedia, 82nd edition (gazetteer entry for Gravesend). Unlike his brothers, the majority of whom entered the Merchant Navy,The Index of Apprentices' indentures, the National Archives (BT 150), show that Frank Paton's eldest brother James was apprenticed to the Merchant Navy on 1 August 1853. His brothers John and Frederick are recorded in the Lloyd's Captains Register 1851 - 1911, Guildhall (Ms 18567). Of his two remaining brothers, William Paton was a Trinity House Pilot (from the will of William Hutchinson Paton, witnessed 11 April 1906, obtained from First Avenue House) and George Edmiston Paton was a Shipwright (the recorded occupation on his certificate of marriage to Rachel Laws, 24 February 1883). Frank Paton showed an early talent for drawing animals and was allowed to follow his artistic bent.Information from an anonymous tribute to Frank Paton, contained within the inner sleeve of a portfolio of the artist held at the British Museum. His first known exhibition was at the age of sixteen, the piece being a portrait of a German peasant girl.Source of information: Animal Magic by John Adams, Country Life magazine, 22 December 1988. Family rumour has it that Paton briefly spent time in France working in stained glass before being recalled by his father. It is believed that he then travelled to, and made a living in, Australia. Paton had relatives in Australia - an Uncle and Aunt had emigrated there from London in the 1850s and settled in Williamstown, Victoria The death certificate of Ann Kilgour, nee Paton, records that she died on 18 December 1897 in Williamstown, Victoria. She was born in Stepney and had lived 46 years in Victoria (emigrated c. 1851). Her brother Robert Paton (also born in Stepney) died on 5 January 1898 and his death certificate states that he had been in Victoria for 43 years (emigrated c. 1855). Their parents are recorded as James Paton and Mary Paton, formally Edmonstone/Edmondson (Frank Paton's paternal grandparents).  so this is plausible and Australian immigration records of the time show that a Frank Paton, aged 19, an unassisted passenger on the \\"Shannon\\" from London, arrived in Melbourne in September 1875.There are no other Frank Patons recorded in the England and Wales Birth Index born around 1855/1856, so unless the age of this passenger was inaccurately recorded, or they were of another nationality, this could only be the artist Frank Paton If Paton did spend time in Australia then it is unclear for how long. What is certain, however, is that he was in England during 1878 as this was the year that his painting \\"You Are No Chicken\\" - a modest sized oil on panel featuring two chicks staring at a frog - was accepted by the Royal Academy for exhibition.Information provided by the Royal Academy It was to be a turning point in the young artist's career as the work was purchased by Edward Ernest Leggatt. Although only the same age as Paton, Leggatt was already running a print and art dealership from a Fenchurch Street address in London.The 1878 - 1884 editions of The City of London Directory list Edward Ernest Leggatt's premises as 46 Fenchurch Street. A further shop at 62 Cheapside was opened in 1884 and commemorated by Paton in his Christmas card of that year. By 1890 the business was operating as \\"Leggatt Brothers\\" and had expanded into publishing and picture-frame manufacturing (source of information: The City of London Directory, 1890 edition). The 1881 census for England and Wales shows Edward E Leggatt to be the head of a household composed mainly of his brothers (two of them print-setters and a further brother a picture restorer), and his age is given as 26 putting his birth year c.1855. You Are No Chicken was engraved in mezzotint by J B Pratt in 1880. Its commercial success cemented a lifelong association with Leggatt, who became the main publisher of Frank Paton's work. In April 1881 Frank Paton married Mary Sophia Edwards (1852‚Äì1929), with the artist Basil Holmes (c.1825 - 1902) bearing witness to the union.Basil Holmes' record of probate (obtained from First Avenue House) records that he \\"died on the 28th day of July 1902 at Herongate\\" (near Brentwood, Essex). Census returns for England and Wales put Holmes' birth year c.1925. Although he trained as an engineer (source of information: marriage certificate of Basil Gent Holmes to Lydia Edwards, 25 July 1853), he became an artist and exhibited two works at the Royal Academy: 1844 Cat No 574 Landscape; 1850 Cat no 889 Mow Cop, Cheshire. Holmes also exhibited at the British Institution and the Royal Society of British Artists (information provided by the Royal Academy).Source of information: Frank Paton's certificate of marriage to Mary Sophia Edwards, 30 April 1881, Leytonstone, Essex. Mary, known as 'Marian' within the family,Christened Mary Sophia Edwards (source of information: Winterborne Houghton parish records and the marriage certificate of Frank Paton), but recorded as \\"Marian Edwards\\" on the 1871 England and Wales Census for Exeter and referred to as \\"Marian Paton wife of Frank Paton\\" in the will of Basil Holmes, witnessed 25 Dec 1899 (obtained from First Avenue House). was from Winterborne Houghton in Dorset. She was brought up from an early age by Basil Holmes and his wife Lydia, who was Mary's maternal aunt.The parish records of Winterborne Houghton, Dorset reveal that Mary's parents were cousins Eli Edwards and Merab Edwards. The England and Wales Death Index records that Eli died in 1860. This may have been the event that led to Mary being raised by the Holmes family. According to England and Wales Censuses of the time, she appears to have been in their care from at least 1861 until the time of her marriage to Frank Paton. Basil Holmes' wife Lydia Holmes, nee Edwards, was the younger sister of Merab Edwards (source of information: Winterborne Houghton Parish records). Merab remarried in 1862 to a George Allen. The death certificate of Merab Allen records that she died on 12 February 1869, the cause of death: \\"Decline Not Certified\\". Decline was an archaic expression sometimes used to denote phythisis, itself an archaic term for pulmonary tuberculosis. \\"Not Certified\\" suggests that the condition had remained undiagnosed until her death. It is possible, then, that Mary Edwards continued to be entrusted to the care of Basil and Lydia Holmes because of Merab's ill health. The 1871 Census of England and Wales for Exeter shows that Mary's sister, Fanny Constantine Edwards, had joined the Holmes family as a permanent addition by that time. Winterbourne Houghton parish records. Most likely under the tutorage of Basil Holmes, Mary became a talented, amateur artist in her own right as is evident from a pair of etchings by her own hand: \\"Old Inn Chigwell\\" and \\"A Glade near Woodford\\".Etchings in the private collection of D Horne, great grandson of Frank Paton. The 1871 census also records Marian Edward's profession as \\"drawing instructor\\". After marrying, Frank Paton mainly lived in rural communities in Kent and in Essex.The following is a list of all known addresses for Frank Paton during his professional career: 1878 - 1880 Hampsted Road, Leytonstone, Middlesex (information provided by the Royal Academy) 1881 - 1886 Ditton Place Farm, Ditton, near Maidstone, Kent (information provided by the Royal Academy and name of residence obtained from the 1884 Electoral Roll for the parish of Ditton) 1887 - 1889 Herongate, near Brentwood (information provided by the Royal Academy) 1889 - 1895 Scotts Farm, Moreton near Ongar, Essex (address given on the birth certificates of the last four of Frank Paton's children, born during this period) 1899 Silver Street, Malden, Essex (from the will of Frank Paton, witnessed 1 May 1899) 1909 40 the parade, Walton on Naze, Essex (from the death certificate of Frank Paton). He divided his time between London and the countryside, accepting commissions for animal portraits from their owners. He was a good family man and raised four sons and three daughters with his wife.Frank and Mary Paton‚Äôs children (from eldest to youngest) were as follows: Frank, Basil, Agnes, Marian, Philip, Dorothy and Leonard (from the birth certificates of all seven children). The Deaths Index for England and Wales records Frank Paton Junior dying in 1900 at the age of 18. Of these, his second eldest son Basil and youngest daughter Dorothy showed considerable artistic talent (the latter becoming a commercial artist and occasionally exhibiting works in public).Dorothy Paton exhibited three works at the Royal Academy: 1920 Red Cross Nurse (546); 1930 Market Place Romford - etching (1114); 1932 Winchelsea Church - aquatint (1026). She also exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Society of Women Artists. Information provided by the Royal Academy. Although never a member of the Royal Academy, a total of 20 works by Paton were exhibited at their annual selling exhibition between the years 1878 and 1890.Information provided by the Royal Academy. However, Frank Paton is perhaps most widely known for his series of etched Christmas cards published annually by Edward Ernest Leggatt from 1880 until Paton's death in 1909. They were intended to be a cut above the average Christmas card and sold for half a guinea each. Their format became quite formulaic over the years. A central subject reflecting the title of the print was usually complemented by a series of often humorous sketches around its border. A number of the prints would be sent from the printers to be signed in pencil by Paton.The British Museum portfolio of Frank Paton has an anonymous tribute written shortly after the artist's death. It records that a pile of his Christmas card The End of the Day \\"alas too late were sent him on Friday last for signature\\". The example of this etching in the museum's portfolio is actually signed, so it must have been a regular occurrence that batches were sent to the artist for signature. The many Frank Paton etchings bearing his mark indicate that this was the case. From 1890 Frank Paton no longer exhibited at the Royal Academy following a dispute with the organisers. His reputation firmly established, it was of little consequence and the artist continued to work until his final days. At the time of his death Paton was living in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex. During the summer of 1909 the family had moved to a new house, which was undergoing alterations and repairs. Paton spent the day of 12 November 1909 discussing and supervising the works with his builder and then in the evening, at around 11.30, suffered a heart attack. Although a doctor was called, Frank Paton died from heart failure at around 5.30 am on 13 November 1909, just 10 days short of his 54th birthday.From an article about the death of Frank Paton, Essex County Standard, West Suffolk Gazette and Eastern Counties Advertiser, 20 November 1909, page 2. Angina pectoris was recorded as the cause of death on Frank Paton's death certificate, registered 19 November 1909 by his widow. In 1919 Edward E. Leggatt donated a full set of copies of Frank Paton's prints to the British Museum.\\"Drawing and Prints for the Nation, British Museum Additions\\", Times newspaper, 8 September 1919. In the inside cover of the Museum's portfolio of the artist is an anonymous tribute to Paton, written shortly after his death. Frank Paton is described as, \\"A kindly, modest, unassuming man with a rare fund of humour, which is reflected in his etchings. He leaves a large circle of friends and admirers to mourn his untimely and terribly sudden death.\\" Fittingly, Paton's last ever Christmas card was called \\"The End of the Day\\".

Following decisive Druze victories and massacres against the Christians, the conflict spilled over into other parts of Ottoman Syria, particularly Damascus, where thousands of Christian residents were killed by Muslim and Druze militiamen. The fighting precipitated a French-led international military intervention. By the war's end, around 20,000 people, mainly Christians, had been killed in Mount Lebanon and Damascus, and 380 Christian villages and 560 churches were destroyed. The Druze and Muslims also suffered heavy losses. Background On 3 September 1840, Bashir Shihab III, a distant cousin of the once-powerful Emir Bashir Shihab II, was appointed emir of Mount Lebanon by Ottoman Sultan Abdulmejid I. Geographically, the Mount Lebanon Emirate corresponded with the central part of present-day Lebanon, which historically has had a Christian and Druze majority. In practice, the terms \\"Lebanon\\" and \\"Mount Lebanon\\" tended to be used interchangeably by historians until the formal establishment of the Mandate. Bitter conflicts between Christians and Druzes, which had been simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule (mostly centred on the firmans of 1839 and, more decisively, of 1856, which equalised the status of Muslim and non- Muslim subjects, the former resenting their implied loss of superiority) resurfaced under the new emir. The sultan deposed Bashir III on 13 January 1842 and appointed Omar Pasha as governor of Mount Lebanon. Representatives of the European powers proposed to the sultan that Mount Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. On 7 December 1842, the sultan adopted the proposal and asked the governor of Damascus to divide the region into two districts: a northern district under a Christian deputy governor and a southern district under a Druze deputy governor. The arrangement came to be known as the \\"Double Qaimaqamate\\". Both officials were to be responsible to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut. The Beirut-Damascus highway was the dividing line between the two districts. The partition of Lebanon was nurtured by outside powers, and animosities between the religious sects increased. The French, for example, traditionally supported the Christians, but the British supported the Druze,https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2013/09/sects-syria The sects of Syria: Those ancient differences and the Ottomans fomented strife to increase their control over the administratively-divided region. The tensions led to conflict between Christians and Druzes as early as May 1845. Consequently, the European powers requested for the Ottoman sultan to establish order in Lebanon, and he attempted to do so by establishing a new council in each of the districts. Composed of members of the various religious communities, the councils were intended to assist the deputy governor. =Leadup to war= The system failed to keep order when the peasants of Keserwan, overburdened by heavy taxes, rebelled against the feudal practices that prevailed in Mount Lebanon. In 1858, Tanyus Shahin, a Maronite Christian peasant leader, demanded for the feudal class to abolish its privileges. The demand was refused, and the peasants began to prepare for a revolt. In January 1859, an armed uprising, led by Shahin, was launched against the Maronite Khazen muqata'jis (feudal lords) of Keserwan. Khazen lands were pillaged and homes burned. After driving the Maronite feudal lords out of Keserwan and seizing their land and property, the insurgent peasants set up their own rule.An Interview with Cheikh Malek el-Khazen. CatholicAnalysis.org. Published: 28 July 2014. The Keserwan uprising had a revolutionary effect on other regions in Lebanon. The disturbances spread to Latakia and to central Mount Lebanon. Maronite peasants, actively supported by their clergy, began to prepare for an armed uprising against their Druze lords. In turn, the Druze lords, who had been hesitant to confront the growing assertiveness of the Maronite peasantry due to the numerical imbalance in the Maronites' favour,Harris 2012, p. 157. began to arm Druze irregulars. In August 1859, a brawl occurred between Druze and Maronites in the Metn area in the Christian sector of the Qaimaqamate. The dispute enabled Maronite bishop Tobia Aoun to mobilise his Beirut-based central committee to intervene in the matter. Soon, a Druze muqata'ji of the Yazbaki faction, Yusuf Abd al-Malik, and his fighters intervened in a brawl between young Maronite and Druze men in the vicinity of the Metn village of Beit Mery, which resulted in 20 fatalities. The Druze lords began making war preparations, allegedly in co-ordination with the local Ottoman authorities, while Bishop Aoun oversaw the distribution of weapons to Maronite peasants. According to the historian William Harris, the Christians of Mount Lebanon felt \\"buoyed by their local numerical superiority, yet despondent because of the hostile Muslim mood in Syria\\" in the aftermath of the Ottoman Empire's reforms. In March, April and May 1860, numerous acts of murder, looting and skirmishing took place across the mixed Christian-Druze districts of southern Mount Lebanon in the Druze-run sector of the Double Qaimaqamate.Fawaz, 1994, p. 47. According to the historian Leila Terazi Fawaz, the initial acts were \\"random and unpredictable enough to seem more the acts of lawless men than a calculated war against other sects, especially since banditry was always part of the objective\\". In March, the father of a Catholic monastery in Aammiq was killed and the monastery looted, and soon, a Druze man from Ainab allegedly killed a Christian man from Abadiyeh. Those acts fuelled a cycle of revenge attacks that significantly increased in frequency by April.Fawaz, 1994, p. 48. In April, two Druze men were killed in the vicinity of Beirut, followed by the killing of three Christians outside of Sidon. Two Christians from Jezzine were killed at Khan Iqlim al-Shumar by Druze from Hasbaya on 26 April, and the next day, another four Christians were killed in Katuli. On 11 May, Christians from Katuli killed two Druzes at the Nahr al-Assal River, and three days later, two Druzes from Chouf were killed near Sidon. The tit-for-tat killings continued, rendering most of the roads of Mount Lebanon unsafe for travellers. Around the end of May, Christians reported to the European consuls that killings of their co-religionists occurred in the districts of Beqaa, Arqub and Gharb. The Maronite clergy communicated to one another their increasing concerns on the violence and the need to end it, but some clergymen believed that the cycle of retaliatory attacks would not stop.Fawaz, 1994, p. 49 With Maronite militias launching raids into Metn and Shahin's forces making incursions into the Gharb area west of Beirut, the Druze muqata'jis held a war council in Moukhtara in which the Jumblatti factions and their more hawkish Yazbaki counterparts agreed to appoint Sa'id Jumblatt as their overall commander. Civil war=Outbreak of war= Christian militiamen of Mount Lebanon Most sources put the start of the war at 27 May, while the British consul considered 29 May the actual start of full-fledged conflict. The first major outbreak of violence occurred when a 250-strong Maronite militia from Keserwan led by Taniyus Shahin went to collect the silk harvest from Naccache, but instead of returning to Keserwan, proceeded to Baabda in the al-Sahil district near Beirut. The local Druze leadership considered the Maronite mobilization at Baabda to be a provocation to the Druze in the mixed Metn district, while the Maronites saw the garrisoning of Ottoman troops under Khurshid Pasha near Naccache on 26 May as a prelude to a Druze assault. The Ottoman garrison established itself at Hazmiyeh with the support of the European consuls in order to bring order to Mount Lebanon. However, the Maronites considered it a threat since they viewed the Ottomans as allies of the Druze.Fawaz, 1994, p. 50. On 29 May, Keserwani Maronites raided the mixed villages of Qarnayel, Btekhnay and Salima and forced out its Druze residents.Fawaz, 1994, p. 54.Farah, p. 560. The tension broke out into open conflict later that day during a Druze assault against the mixed village of Beit Mery, with the village's Druze and Christian residents subsequently calling for support from their co-religionists in Abadiyeh and al-Sahil, respectively. The Druze, backed by an Ottoman commander of irregulars named Ibrahim Agha, and Maronite fighters burned down the houses of the rival sect in Beit Mery. The Maronite fighters defeated the Druze and Ibrahim Agha at Beit Mery before withdrawing from the village.Fawaz, 1994, p. 51. On 30 May, the Keserwani Maronite militiamen attempted to renew their assault against Beit Mery, but were countered by 1,800-2,000 Druze militiamen led by the Talhuq and Abu Nakad clans on the way, prompting previously neutral Maronites from Baabda, Wadi Shahrur, Hadath and elsewhere in al-Sahil to join the fighting. Although casualties among the Christian militiamen were relatively low during the fighting on 30 May, in the renewed battle on 31 May, the 200-strong Maronite force was routed at Beit Mery and forced to retreat to Brummana. By the day's end, the Druze fighters were in complete control of Metn, where clashes were widespread, and between 35 and 40 Maronite majority villages were set alight and some 600 Maronites in the district slain. Also on 30 May, full-fledged fighting between Druze and Christians occurred in the area of Zahle, when a 200-strong Druze force led by Ali ibn Khattar Imad confronted 400 local Christian fighters at the village of Dahr al-Baidar, prompting Christian militiamen from nearby Zahle to join the fighting. Imad's men retreated to Ain Dara, where the Christians followed them before being defeated.Fawaz, 1994, p. 52. Ali Imad died of his wounds on 3 June; consequently, a 600-strong Druze force was mobilized under the command of his father Khattar Imad. Some 3,000 Christian fighters, predominantly from Zahle, met Khattar's forces near Ain Dara where a major battle took place. The Druze experienced twice as many casualties as the Christians, but ultimately forced the Christians to retreat to Zahle. Between 29 and 31 May, 60 villages were destroyed in the vicinity of Beirut, and 33 Christians and 48 Druzes were killed.Farah, Caesar E. The politics of interventionism in Ottoman Lebanon, 1830‚Äì1861, p. 564. I.B.Tauris, 2000. . In the last days of May, Druze forces under the command of Bashir Nakad and backed by the Imad and Jumblatt clans besieged Deir al-Qamar. In the first days of June, reports from the town to European consuls reported that starvation was beginning to set in. A relief supply of grain and flour sent by the Ottoman general Khurshid Pasha apparently did not reach the town. Bashir's forces, numbering some 3,000 Druze fighters, launched an assault on Deir al- Qamar on 2 June and another assault the next day. The Christian defenders in Deir al-Qamar initially put up stiff resistance and inflicted heavy casualties on the Druze forces, who managed to raze the town's outskirts. After eight hours of the Druze assault, Deir al-Qamar surrendered on 3 June, partially as a result of internal divisions among the town's Christian militia. Fatality reports ranged from 70 to 100 slain Druze and 17 to 25 Christians. Following its capture, the Druze plundered Deir al-Qamar until 6 June and destroyed 130 houses.Fawaz, 1994, p. 57. Around half of the town's Christian residents had remained neutral and appealed for protection by the Druze, with whom many had long maintained social and commercial ties.Fawaz, 1994, p. 58. =Wadi al-Taym clashes and Hasbaya massacre= Christian refugees during the strife Unlike their co-religionists elsewhere in Syria, the Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Wadi al-Taym were generally aligned with the Maronites of Mount Lebanon, due to shared opposition to Protestant missionary activity, and were loyal to their lords, the Sunni Muslim Shihab emirs of Rashaya and Hasbaya.Harris 2012, pp. 157‚Äì158. Fighting between the Shihab emirs led by Sa'ad al-Din Shihab and the Druze led by Sa'id al-Shams and Sa'id Jumblatt had been going on since the last days of May, particularly in Deir Mimas. The clashes led to shoot-outs in Hasbaya between Christians and Druze peasant fighters from various other Wadi al-Taym villages. Before casualties became heavy, emergency Ottoman reinforcements led by Yusuf Agha intervened to back the Ottoman garrison led by Uthman Bey, and stopped the fighting in Hasbaya. Meanwhile, fighting between Druzes and Christians had broken out in nearby Shebaa, prompting Uthman Bey to intervene in the village and then confer with Druze sheikhs in Marj Shwaya ostensibly to gain assurances from them that they would cease hostilities. Not long after Uthman Bey assured the Christians of Hasbaya that Druze attacks would end, Druze forces set fire to a Christian village in Wadi al-Taym and proceeded to assault Hasbaya, where Christians fleeing the clashes had been seeking shelter.Fawaz, 1994, p. 59. At the advice of Uthman Bey, a large part of Hasbaya's Christian community took refuge in Hasbaya's government house, along with several Shihabi family members, and surrendered their weapons, which numbered around 500 guns. The surrendered guns were soon looted by the Druze and according to the British consul, this had been Uthman Bey's actual intention. The Christians of Hasbaya, along with 150 Christian refugees from Qaraoun, had taken shelter in the government house on 3 June. Some 400 sheltered in the home of Sa'id Jumblatt's sister Nayifa, due to her concerns that the gathering of so many Christians at government house would put so many of their lives in danger. Many Christians did not trust Nayifa due to her frequent hosting of Uthman Bey, who the local Christians increasingly lost trust of, and her family's leadership of the Druzes.Fawaz, 1994, p. 61. The Druzes of Wadi al-Taym had been receiving numerous reinforcements from Majdal Shams, Iqlim al-Ballan and the Hauran plain, and were quietly backed by Uthman Bey. Led by commanders Ali Bey Hamada, Kenj Ahmad and Hasan Agha Tawil, the Druze forces assembled around Hasbaya on 3 June. Several hundred (possibly up to 1,000) largely disorganized and inexperienced Christian men from Hasbaya mobilized as well. After heavy fighting that day, the Christians, who suffered 26 casualties, managed to briefly push back the Druzes, who suffered 130 fatalities, and proceeded to burn down Druze homes in the area. On 4 June, the much larger Druze force defeated the Christians after an hour-long assault and the Christian forces fled. The Christians had apparently been waiting for Ottoman troops to arrive and protect them as they were promised, but this did not materialize. Following the Druzes' capture of Hasbaya, their forces proceeded to assault the government house. At first, the Druzes sought out and killed 17 Shihabi men, including Emir Sa'ad al-Din, who was decapitated and thrown off the three-story building's rooftop. The Druze fighters then began killing the Christians who had taken refuge there. Druze fighters massacred about 1,000 Christian males, adults and children, while sparing the women. According to an account by a Christian survivor, \\"the men were slaughtered in the embrace of their wives and the children at the breasts of their mothers\\".Fawaz, 1994, p. 62. About 40-50 men survived after managing to escape. The 400 Christians who had sheltered with Nayifa Jumblatt survived because she had them relocated initially to the Jumblatt stronghold of Moukhtara and from there to the port of Sidon, from which they were able to make it to Beirut on a British warship. =Assault on Rashaya= Rashaya and its citadel, late 19th century In the days after the Druze victory at Hasbaya, violence raged in the southern Beqaa Valley. The hostilities were set off after two Druze men from Kfar Qouq were arrested by the authorities for their suspected role in the deaths of two Christians from Dahr al-Ahmar who were shot down as they were transporting clay pots on their way to Damascus. The Druze men were quickly released by the Ottomans after protests by the local Druze community. The local Druze were angry at the Christians for complaining to the authorities, which led to the arrests, and launched an attack on Dahr al-Ahmar. On 8 June Christians from Dahr al-Ahmar and the vicinity fled to Rashaya, which had an Ottoman garrison, for protection.Fawaz, 1994, p. 63. As the Christians fled to Rashaya, Druzes began burning down the homes they left behind and assaulted the Christian villages of Kfar Mishki, Beit Lahia and Hawush. The Christians received assurances of safety from Emir Ali Shihab, governor of Rashaya, and the Druze al-Aryan family, which held significant influence in the town. About 150 took refuge in the government house and set up barricades on the streets leading to the building as additional security measures. That same day, a Druze force attacked the town and burnt down Christian homes, forcing many other local Christians to seek shelter in the government house. Several Christians were killed before the Druze force withdrew after a meeting with the Ottoman authorities at Ziltatiat. The Christians remained in the government house upon the counsel of the local Ottoman garrison's commander.Fawaz, 1994, p. 64. By 11 June, a 5,000-strong Druze force assembled outside Rashaya consisting of local Druze militiamen, the Druze force from the previous Hasbaya battle and Druze troops under the command of Isma'il al-Atrash. Al-Atrash's men had attacked several Christian villages in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains on their way to Rashaya. That day, the Druze force split into two main contingents, with one attacking the Christian village of Aya and the other storming Rashaya. The Shihab emirs of Rashaya, with the exception of two, were slain. The Druze assaulted the government house and killed the men inside, including priests. The combined Christian fatalities from the massacre at Hasbaya and the assault on Rashaya and its neighboring villages were roughly 1,800. =Battle of Zahle= Zahle was a Christian stronghold during the war and the scene of a major battle where Druze forces triumphed over the town's defenders. The Druze followed up on their victory at Rashaya by raiding villages in the central Beqaa Valley and the vicinity of Baalbek together with Shia Muslim peasants and irregulars, guided by the Harfush clan. While the Harfushes continued to assault Baalbek, the Druze proceeded back south towards Zahle, which at that time remained the last major Christian stronghold. The Zahalni Christians, largely led by Abdallah Abu Khatir, appealed for support from Maronite militia leaders in Kesrawan and Metn, namely Taniyus Shahin of Reifun, Youssef Bey Karam of Ehden and Yusuf al-Shantiri of Metn. Shahin feared antagonizing the Ottoman authorities and did not respond to the appeal, while al-Shantiri preferred to wait and assess any moves made by Shahin or Karam first. Karam responded positively to the appeal and assembled a 4,000-strong force, but it did not make it further than the Metn village of Bikfaya. After the conflict's end, Karam claimed his abrupt halt was due to prohibitions on further advances by the French consul and the Ottoman authorities.Fawaz, 1994, p. 65. The Christian force assembled in Zahle numbered around 4,000 men, mostly from Zahle, but also 400 cavalry from Baskinta and a smaller force from Metn. They stockpiled ammunition and had hundreds of horses available for battle. The Zahalni militiamen prepared the town's defences by digging deep trenches around it, building a brick wall at its southern edge and fortifying parts of the town's narrow roads and paths. They stocked foodstuffs and other supplies, and townspeople hid any valuable items in their possession.Fawaz, 1994, p. 66. Meanwhile, Druze forces from Wadi al-Taym, Rashaya, Chouf and the Hauran were assembling in Zahle's vicinity, using the nearby mixed village of Qabb Ilyas to Zahle's south, as their headquarters. Zahalni Christian forces launched an assault against Qabb Ilyas on 14 June. According to an account of that confrontation, the Christians fought \\"without discipline\\" and were \\"heedless of danger\\", spreading themselves thin across the plains of Qabb Ilyas, with fighters taking up uncoordinated positions and firing their weapons. The Druze defenders forced them to retreat to Zahle. The Zahalni repeated their assault a few days later, but were again repulsed. Youssef Bey Karam On 18 June, Druze forces under Khattar Imad's command and reinforced by Shia peasants and Sunni Sardiyah Bedouin cavalry from Hauran (3,000 men altogether) began their assault on Zahle, some of whose defenders were feuding among each other at the time of the attack. The Druze assault was well-planned according to accounts of the battle, with some of their forces attacking Zahle's well-defended eastern, southern and western sides, while Imad's contingent launched a surprise attack against the town from the north. The Zahalni had not concentrated their fortifications at Zahle's north because they expected that side of town to be safe due to the heavy Christian presence there. Furthermore, they were still expecting Karam's men to be arriving from the north side (they had not yet been notified of his troops' halt at Bikfaya). Imad disguised his contingent as Christians by adorning them with crosses and Christian flags taken from slain Christian fighters in previous battles. Thus, when Imad and his men approached Zahle from the north, its defenders enthusiastically welcomed them, believing them to be Karam's men.Fawaz, 1994, p. 67. As Imad's Druze forces entered Zahle, they proceeded to burn down its northern neighborhoods. When Druze forces commanded by Isma'il al-Atrash saw the flames emanating from northern Zahle, they stormed the town. Within hours, Zahle was under Druze control. Zahle's residents panicked and fled the town for Metn, Keserwan and al-Sahil. By 19 June, the town was emptied of its inhabitants. The Christians suffered between 40 and 900 casualties, while the Druze and their allies suffered between 100 and 1,500 casualties. The Druze agreed beforehand not to loot Zahle, but the Sardiyah Bedouin tribesmen plundered the town, taking money, horses and jewellery. The outcome at Zahle held enormous significance for both sides in the war. For the Christians, the fall of the strongest Christian town meant the loss of their principal support base, as the Zahalni supported other Christians in many earlier battles during the conflict. Zahle was believed by many Christians in Mount Lebanon to be unconquerable. According to the British consul, the Christian defeat at Zahle caused many Christians to consequently want to flee Ottoman Syria. The Druze victory at Zahle was a major morale boost for their forces since the fall of Zahle effectively symbolized their total victory over the Christians of Mount Lebanon, which they then controlled indisputably. It was also a cause for celebration among Muslims of all sects in Ottoman Syria because many Muslims viewed its inhabitants as arrogant, and reportedly \\"suffered from the people of Zahle and heard of their sly deeds\\", according to the Damascene notable Sayyid Muhammad Abu'l Su'ud al-Hasibi, who condemned what he saw as Druze and Muslim excesses during the conflict. The Muslims of Damascus held celebrations in the city after the fall of Zahle. Following Zahle's fall, groups of Sunni and Shia Muslims from Baalbek used the opportunity to settle scores with local Christians and plunder the town and its vicinity. Up to 34 Christian villages in the Beqaa Valley were plundered and burned, with many houses and churches destroyed, and harvests and livestock taken. The Shia Harfush clan led the siege and assault on Baalbek, attacking the Ottoman garrison there commanded by Husni Bey and the headquarters of the district governor, Faris Agha Qadro,Fawaz, 1994, p. 68. killing several of the latter's employees. The Kurdish irregulars led Hassan Agha Yazigi that were dispatched by the Ottoman governor of Damascus did not attempt to relieve the siege. Baalbek was largely destroyed and Yazigi's irregulars would later participate in the town's plunder.Fawaz, 1994, p. 69. =Massacre of Deir al-Qamar= Sketch of Deir al- Qamar from an English newspaper published in July 1860 Deir al-Qamar had already been captured by Druze forces and its residents had consistently appealed for protection from their friends among the local Druze and from the Ottoman authorities. Nonetheless, following their decisive victory at Zahle, the Druze renewed their assault against Deir al-Qamar on 20 June. In the weeks prior, some of the town's wealthier residents managed to leave for Beirut or gained Sa'id Jumblatt's protection in Moukhtara. However, thousands of Christians remained in Deir al-Qamar and the Druze militiamen were preventing many from leaving. As Druze fighters moved in on the town, ostensibly guarding homes and shops, they proceeded to loot many buildings that had been abandoned by their patrons.Fawaz, 1994, p. 70. The Christian residents did not put up armed resistance against the Druze fighters, and sometime before 20 June the Christians had been disarmed either at the counsel of the district governor Mustafa Shukri Effendi or an Ottoman general from the Beirut garrison named Tahir Pasha. The Ottomans' advice to the Christians regarding disarmament was that it would help in not provoking the Druze.Fawaz, 1994, p. 71. On the evening of 19 June, a Christian resident and a priest were killed outside the government house in Deir al-Qamar, where thousands of residents had begun taking refuge. Hundreds of others took shelter in the abandoned Ottoman barracks at Beit ed-Dine or the district governor's residence. Meanwhile, Druze fighters from Moukhtara, Baakline, Ain al-Tineh, Arqub district, Manasif district, Boutmeh, Jdaideh, Shahahir, and Ammatour were streaming into Deir al-Qamar from several directions. At least part of these forces were commanded by Sheikh Qasim Imad. The roughly 4,000 Ottoman troops stationed in Deir al- Qamar did not stop the incoming Druzes. On the morning of 20 June, the Druzes assaulted the government house and proceeded to kill the males taking refuge in it, all of whom were unarmed. European consuls who witnessed the killings or their aftermath reported that many women were assaulted as well in an unprecedented manner. Afterwards, the Druzes plundered Deir al-Qamar, which was well known for being wealthy. Unlike in Zahle, the Druzes looted large quantities of horses, livestock, jewellery and other goods. Large parts of the town were burned down. Other Christians were killed throughout Deir al- Qamar.Fawaz, 1994, p. 72. Nearby Beit ed-Dine and its countryside was also sacked. The plunder in Deir al-Qamar ended on 23 June,Mallat, p. 247. after intervention by Sa'id Jumblatt, Bashir Nakad, sheikhs from the Hamada clan, and an Ottoman colonel. By the end of the fighting, much of Deir al-Qamar, which was the most prosperous town of the predominantly Druze Chouf district, was in ruins, and corpses, some mutilated, were left throughout the town's streets, markets, houses and Ottoman government buildings and military installations.Fawaz, 1994, p. 73. Between 1,200 and 2,200 Christians had been killed in the onslaught and many more had fled. By October 1860, Deir al- Qamar's population which had been roughly 10,000 before the conflict, had been reduced to 400. According to Fawaz, the ceasefire negotiated between by the Druze sheikhs and the authorities marked the \\"end to the most violent phase of the civil war\\" in Mount Lebanon.Fawaz, 1994, p. 74. Spread of conflict The war in Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley caused inter-communal tension throughout Ottoman Syria.Fawaz, p. 75. =Beirut= On 23 June, a Sunni Muslim man was killed during a dispute with a Christian refugee in Beirut. The man's death prompted his angry relatives to demand from the Ottoman authorities that the perpetrator be executed. The authorities arrested a suspect and tried him immediately, but by then mobs were forming throughout the city, whose population had doubled due to the influx of Christian refugees. Panic ensued among the Christians in Beirut, and many were assaulted or threatened, including Europeans. The acting governor of Beirut, Isma'il Pasha, deployed troops throughout the city to prevent violence, but ultimately decided that the only way to disperse the mobs was by executing the Christian suspect,Fawaz, p. 75. who consistently declared his innocence. Although only the actual governor, Khurshid Pasha (who was in Deir al-Qamar), could sanction an execution and the European consuls refused to give their blessing to it, Isma'il Pasha had the suspect executed within twelve hours of the Muslim man's killing to avert further violence. The angry crowds consequently dispersed and calm was restored to Beirut.Fawaz, 1994, p. 76. =Other coastal cities: Tripoli to Jaffa= Tensions were also raised in other coastal cities such Tripoli, Sidon, TyreAcre, Haifa and Jaffa, but their proximity to European warships in the Mediterranean helped maintain calm. Nonetheless, Tyre and Sidon were at the brink of civil war due to violence raging between Sunni and Shia residents and Christian refugees fleeing the war. Hundreds of Christians opted to leave Syria altogether, boarding ships to Malta or Alexandria. =Galilee= In the Galilee, peace was maintained by local Bedouin chieftains, such as Aqil Agha, who assured Christians in Nazareth and Acre of his protection.Mansour, 2004, p. 262. However, in the village of Kafr Bir'im near Safad, three Christians were killed by Druze and Shia Muslim raiders, while the mixed village of al-Bassa was also plundered.Fawaz, 1994, p. 77. =Jerusalem and Nablus regions= A violent incident occurred between a Muslim and Christian man in Bethlehem, ending with the latter being beaten and imprisoned. The authorities strengthened security and maintained calm in Jerusalem and Nablus. =Homs, Hama, Latakia and Aleppo= The authorities also maintained calm in Homs, Hama, Latakia and Aleppo by introducing additional security measures. In the latter city, the Ottoman governor Umar Pasha appeared keen to maintain order, but his garrison was too small to ensure security in the city. Instead, many Christians pooled money together to pay for protection by local Muslims, who formed an ad hoc police force. =Damascus massacre of Christians= Abdelkader El Djezairi saving Christians during the Druze‚ÄìChristian strife of 1860, by Jan-Baptist Huysmans. Public gathering in Beirut during the 1860 events In July 1860, fighting spilled over into Damascus. With the connivance of the military authorities and Turkish soldiers, Druze and Sunni Muslim paramilitary groups organised pogroms which lasted three days (9-11 July). The American vice-consul and Dutch consul could narrowly escape the mobs. Churches and missionary schools were set on fire. Many Christians were saved through the intervention of the Muslim Algerian exile Emir Abdelkader and his soldiers, who brought them to safety in Abdelkader's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors. Most sources put the figure of those killed between 7,000 and 11,000, with some claiming over 20,000(2002) , www.tanbourit.com or 25,000.Shaw, Ezel Kural. History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1977 A letter in the English Daily News in July 1860 states that between 7,000 and 8,000 had been murdered; 5,000 widowed and 16,000 orphaned. James Lewis Farley, in a letter, speaks of 326 villages, 560 churches, 28 colleges, 42 convents, and 9 other religious establishments, having been totally destroyed. Churchill puts the figures at 11,000 murdered, 100,000 refugees, 20,000 widows and orphans, 3,000 habitations burnt to the ground, and 4,000 perishing from destitution. Other estimates claim 380 Christian villages were destroyed. International intervention The Times report of the French Expedition, August 9, 1860, describing how the expedition was cast as humanitarian Fuad Pasha The bloody events led France to intervene and stop the massacre after Ottoman troops had been aiding local Druze and Muslim forces by either direct support or by disarming Christian forces. France, led by Napoleon III, recalled its ancient role as protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire which was established in a treaty in 1523. Following the massacres and an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order. This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with Austria, Great Britain, France, Prussia and Russia. France was to supply half of that number, and other countries were to send supplementary forces as needed. French expeditionary corps led by General Beaufort d'Hautpoul, landing in Beirut on 16 August 1860. General Beaufort d'Hautpoul was put in charge of the expeditionary force. D'Hautpoul had experience and knowledge of matters in the Middle East, as he had served during the 1830s as chief of staff for Ibrahim Pasha in the Egyptian campaigns in Southern Syria.Fawaz, 1994, p. 114. The French expeditionary corps of 6,000 soldiers, mainly from Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, landed in Beirut on 16 August 1860. D'Hautpoul had instructions to collaborate with the Ottoman authorities in reestablishing order, and especially to maintain contact with the Ottoman minister Fuad Pasha. Although the troubles had already been quelled by the Ottomans, the French expeditionary corps remained in Syria from August 1860 to June 1861, longer than the initially agreed period of six months. The prolonged French presence in Syria was soon objected to by the British government, which argued that pacification should be left to Ottoman authorities. An important consequence of the French expedition was the establishment of the autonomy of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate from Ottoman Syria, with the nomination by the Sultan of an Armenian Christian Governor from Constantinople, Daud Pasha, on 9 June 1861. The French intervention has been described as one of the first humanitarian interventions.

Life and work In 1974 Morris, then at school in London, heard that Bob Marley was playing at the Speakeasy Club in Great Marlborough Street, London. He went to the club during the day, met Marley and asked to take his picture. Marley agreed, and after hearing that Morris wanted to be a photographer told him ‚ÄúYou are a photographer‚Äù. The following day Morris left with the band in their Transit van. He went on to photograph the musician until Marley's death in 1981. In 1977 Morris spent a year with the Sex Pistols, documenting them in depth. In 1978 Morris went with Virgin boss Richard Branson on a talent-spotting trip to Jamaica. Morris persuaded Virgin that John Lydon should accompany them. Morris describes his style as \\"reportage\\", citing as influences Robert Capa and Don McCullin. He used a Leica camera, finding that its small size meant that \\"you can take it anywhere, and no one takes it seriously. So you get them to open up.\\" In 1979 Morris created the logo for the band Public Image Limited and the innovative Metal Box album packaging.metal box stories from John Lydon's public image limited book by Phil Strongman published by Helter Skelter ‚Äì He then became art director of Island RecordsDestroy: Sex Pistols 1977 The Guardian London 7 June 2002 retrieved 2010-04-21 and designed album covers for Linton Kwesi Johnson, Marianne Faithfull (Broken English) and Bob Marley.

Its opening occurred the same year 22 African American students integrated the all-white Warren County High School which drew national media attention. After the Stanley Plan, the legislative package implementing the massive resistance policies of Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr., was found to be unconstitutional by federal courts, Criser High School was built to prevent total integration of Warren County High School. Its principal was James W. McClendon from Farmville, Va. McClendon previously taught agriculture at the R. R. Moton School in Prince Edward County, Va. The Prince Edward County, Board of Supervisors, refusing to integrate their school system voted not to appropriate any funds for the operation of all their schools. McClendon seeking employment elsewhere became aware of a new all-black High School being built in Warren County Virginia. He applied and was hired as its first and only principal. His wife Eunice was also hired as one of the school's elementary instructors. Prior to the construction of Criser High School only grades 1 through 7 were available to black students of Warren County. Students that aspired to receive a high school education had two choices. They could attend Manassas Regional High School (Jennie Dean), a location away from Front Royal. This entailed leaving Sunday and returning Friday on transportation provided by the County. A second option later became available after repeated requests from concerned parents regarding the distance and time spent from home by these young black students now attending Manassas Regional. A few years prior to the construction of Criser High School the second option became available which transported some of Front Royal's black High School students to neighboring Berryville, Va to attend the Johnson-Williams High School away. This arrangement allowed these students to return home the same day but much later than their white county counterparts.  Legacy  Once the construction of Criser High School was completed, the school became the educational darling of the African American community. With a campus overlooking Southtown, Criser High School provided education for African American students from the surrounding communities of Bentonville, Limeton, Guard Hill, Milldale, Bayard, Reliance, Riverton, Rockland and Happy Creek. With an initial student population of 300 plus, African American instructors from various historically black colleges were recruited to make up its corp of teachers. Some of the initial high school instructors came from the Prince Edward County School system. Criser reached its zenith in the early 1960s and it was these formative years of the band that music instructor Geraldine Jackson established the foundation of its music legacy. Appearing on Ted Mack's nationally known The Original Amateur Hour, she showed her proficiency playing the baritone horn. Later, it was under the direction of music instructor John Easley, from Langston University, that the Black and Gold Lancers truly excelled and became marching band favorites of the Annual Apple Blossom Festival, Front Royal Christmas Parade, and the Hagerstown Halloween Parade. Frank Threatts of Richmond inaugurated and coached the school's sports program. In 1962, McKinley Armstrong significantly expanded the program and took it to new heights that included baseball along with track and field competition. Criser competed with other historically black Virginia high schools in a local district that included Frederick Douglas of Winchester, Johnson-Williams of Berryville, Virginia, West Luray of Luray, and Lucy Simms of Harrisonburg, Virginia. Beyond their district, their competition included Page-Jackson High School of Charles Town, Douglass High School (Leesburg, Virginia) Frederick Douglass of Leesburg, William C. Taylor of Warrenton, Virginia, George Washington Carver of Culpeper, Virginia, Luther P. Jackson of Merrifield, Virginia, Hoffman-Boston of Arlington, Virginia, Booker T. Washington of Staunton, Virginia, Central Augusta of Staunton, and Jennie Dean of Manassas, Virginia. All of these schools have a rich history of community activism which brought about the creation of these historic African American institutions in the late 1940s and 1950s. The consolidation of both Warren and Rappahannock County school systems introduced African American students from Huntly, Virginia, Flint Hill, Virginia Washington, Virginia, and Sperryville, Virginia to its school population, but still the overall student enrolment continued to decline. The school closed its doors in 1966 due to further declining enrolment as a major exodus of students opted to attend Warren County High School in search of a purported better education, and to fulfil a driving need to satisfy the wishes of Front Royal's integrationist constituency.

It is part of the European Movement International which pushes for a \\"democratic, federal, enlarged European Union\\". It is the most prominent pro-Europe group in Britain. The President was Lord Paddy Ashdown until his death in December 2018. Former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine was appointed as President in May 2019. and the current chairman (since December 2016) is Stephen Dorrell.  History  The origins of the European Movement lie in the aftermath of the Second World War. More than eight hundred delegates from across Europe gathered at the First Congress of Europe in The Hague in May 1948, under the chairmanship of Sir Winston Churchill, to create a new international movement to promote European unity and prevent further wars between its European countries. The British section of the European Movement was founded a year later. It was also supported by Clement Attlee, the British Prime Minister. Churchill consistently made clear that he saw any 'united Europe' rooted in 'a partnership between France and Germany'. \\"In all this urgent work\\" as he put it, \\"France and Germany must take the lead together. Great Britain, the British Commonwealth of Nations, mighty America, and I trust, Soviet Russia....must be the friends and Sponsors of the new Europe, and must champion its right to live.\\" The British European Movement, mostly working through its Campaign Group based in Chandos House, London, worked closely with the Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath in the early 1970s when Heath applied to join the European Union. During the UK's European Communities membership referendum in 1975, the organisation campaigned strongly within the 'Yes' campaign and worked with the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Other campaigns since then have included pressing for direct elections to the European Parliament in the 1970s and promoting the benefits of the single market in the run-up to 1992. In 1997 the British European Movement promoted heavily its Europe 97 campaign (ninety-seven reasons for the UK to be in the European Union). It campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and continued to oppose Brexit in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as Open Britain and Britain for Europe. In February 2018 George Soros's Open Society Foundations donated ¬£500,000 to a number of groups opposing Brexit including ¬£182,000 to European Movement UK. In April the same year the group joined the People's Vote to campaign for a second vote.

Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management is the business school of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College in Maryland) and is located on the college's main campus in Baltimore, Maryland. Formally established in 1980, the business school was named in honor of Loyola's late president Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J., although the university has been offering courses in business for over 70 years. The Sellinger School consists of seven academic departments: Accounting, Economics, Finance, Information Systems/ Operations Management, Management/ International Business, Marketing, and Law & Social Responsibility. The Sellinger School of Business and Management is one of Loyola's three schools, the other two being the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education. Timeline Loyola College first offered courses in accounting and business administration at the undergraduate level in 1937. The baccalaureate degree in business administration was first awarded in 1943 with the accounting major added shortly thereafter. Loyola introduced the Executive MBA program in 1973, the first of its kind in the Baltimore-Washington area and one of the first ten Executive MBA programs in the country. Loyola established the School of Business and Management in 1980 to provide strategic management for business programs. In 1984, the business school was formally named The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger. In 1985, the Sellinger School initiated the Fellows MBA program to serve rising young executives. In 1988, the Sellinger School earned accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education). In early 2000, the Sellinger School moved into a new state-of-the-art facility constructed on the north side of the academic quadrangle. Jesuit Education View from the bridge. Loyola University Maryland is a Jesuit Catholic university committed to the educational and spiritual traditions of the Society of Jesus and to the ideals of liberal education and the development of the whole person. Accordingly, the College will inspire students to learn, lead and serve in a diverse and changing world. In this mission the hallmarks of a Jesuit education are clearly evident: a commitment to the rich tradition of Catholic education, an emphasis on academic excellence, the importance of the liberal arts, and the education of the whole person. At Loyola, this means that the curriculum is rigorous and faculty expectations are high. All undergraduates complete the core curriculum that includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, science, and social sciences. Students are challenged to understand the ethical dimensions of personal and professional life and to examine their own values, attitudes, and beliefs. The College sponsors a variety of programs and opportunities in support of its Jesuit mission; these include the Center for Values and Service, Campus Ministry, and Catholic Studies. Academics The Sellinger School stresses the importance of Experiential Learning, noting that such opportunity serves to enhance traditional classroom work through the integration of theory and practice. Students are offered the chance for enriched academic discussion and a broadened learning environment through Internship, Study Abroad, and Service-Learning Experiences. Two of the three are required for graduation from the Sellinger School. The college recognizes chapters of Beta Gamma Sigma and Beta Alpha Psi, and affords students international societies such as the Financial Management Association for academic growth and development. The Sellinger Scholars business honors program was developed to prepare highly motivated students for roles of leadership and service in a diverse and changing world. Students are invited to join in their Freshmen year based on academic achievement and must then go through an interview process.

The Westside Shopping and Leisure Centre, on the outskirts of Bern, Switzerland, is a multi-use facility with shops, restaurants, a swimming pool, conference spaces, residences, a hotel, fitness centres, and a cinema. It was designed by international architect Daniel Libeskind and completed in October 2008. Design Westside under construction. Despite its location west of the city, in Br√ºnnen-Bern, Westside is urban in scale. According to Studio Daniel Libeskind's website, the site brings ‚Äútogether the dimensions of commerce, culture and leisure.\\" Positioned over a motorway, the centre overlooks an S-Bahn station and acts as a gateway to Bern. The complex is crystalline in structure; a steel concrete skeleton supports the centre's wood fa√ßade. Cuts in the roof bring the changing daylight into the center's two plazas. One plaza faces the surrounding Br√ºnnen landscape and connects to the centre's bath, while the other plaza adjoins the hotel and cinema. Windows tumble across the fa√ßade, bringing light into the building. This design evokes the erratic matrix of windows across Libeskind's first major international success, the Jewish Museum Berlin. Reaction Artist's concept of swimming facility inside the Westside Shopping and Leisure Centre. Critics, such as David Rogers of the Los Angeles-based Jerde Partnership, have faulted Bern for neglecting to integrate such a shopping centre into the city's urban fabric. A shopping centre on the city's periphery contributes to the disintegration of the city centre and leads to a ‚Äúloss of values,‚Äù he says. Defenders of Westside, such as Swiss architect Barbara Holzer, argue that Bern's urban centre is not under threat and that the shopping centre instead offers ‚Äúnew urban spaces.‚Äù Westside, with its blend of commercial, residential and recreational spaces, exemplifies populist architecture and emphasises public life. Peter Keller, of the Z√ºrich newspaper, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, adds that the shopping centre suits its surrounding landscape and bears the striking signature of its architect.

Augusto Timoteo Vandor (1923‚Äì1969) was an Argentine trade unionist leader, naval non-commissioned officer and politician. Career Vandor was born in Bovril, Entre R√≠os Province, to a Dutch father and a French mother, in 1923. He enlisted in the Argentine Navy in 1941, and later became a non-commissioned officer aboard the minesweeper ARA Comodoro Py. He left the Navy in 1947, however, and joined the new Philips factory in the Saavedra neighborhood of Buenos Aires. There, he met his future wife, and gained a reputation for strategic thinking that earned him the nickname of El Lobo (the Wolf). He became the steward of the Phillips factory UOM local and in 1954, led a strike for better pay at the facility. Its success made him prominent in the UOM (the steelworkers' union within the CGT, the paramount trade union in Argentina), but led to his arrest following a 1955 military coup that overthrew the populist administration of Juan Per√≥n.UOM Tres de Febrero: Augusto Vandor Introduced to the exiled Per√≥n in Santo Domingo in 1958, Vandor cultivated good relations with amenable figures in management and the military, and on the lifting of government receivership over the CGT in 1961, Vandor was elected Secretary General of the UOM, the largest of the CGT's 62 unions. He represented labor as part of the troika of Per√≥n's official delegates in Argentina, and as such helped negotiate potential endorsements ahead of the 1963 elections.Potash, Robert. The Army and Politics in Argentina. Stanford University Press, 1996. As the leading CGT political strategist, he was at least as influential in the Peronist movement as CGT Secretary General Jos√© Alonso, and helped plan \\"Operation Return\\", a 1964 mission to slip Per√≥n into Argentina.Page, Joseph. Per√≥n: A Biography. Random House, 1983. The mission's failure, and Alonso's support for a military coup against President Arturo Illia made opponents of Alonso and Vandor, and the two labor leaders backed opposing candidates in a Mendoza Province gubernatorial race in the 1965 elections. Vandor became increasingly critical of Per√≥n, in part from a conviction that the aging leader might never return to Argentina. His vocal challenge to Per√≥n's influence reached a high pitch during the Mendoza campaign, with slogans such as \\"For a Peronism without Per√≥n,\\" and \\"to save Per√≥n, one has to be against Per√≥n,\\" and led the exiled leader to send his wife, Isabel, to promote Alonso's candidate. This resulted in the defeat of both Peronist candidates, however, and a conservative candidate was ultimately elected.La masacre de Ezeiza Vandor had the CGT leader ousted in February 1966, after which Alonso formed the \\"62 Organizations Standing with Per√≥n\\" faction of the CGT. The military dictatorship installed that June and headed by General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a lost Alonso's support by the end of 1966, and the two leaders found common cause in both their support for a \\"participationist\\" point of view (in favor of negotiations with the regime rather than for headfront opposition), and in their opposition to the more confrontational Raimundo Ongaro. These developments came to a head in March 1968, when Ongaro, head of the Graphists' Union, and Vandor both sought the post of CGT Secretary General. Per√≥n, wary of Vandor, supported the graphist leader, and Ongaro was elected to the post. The CGT elections were annulled by Labor Minister Rubens San Sebasti√°n, however, leading to a temporary schism within the CGT. Vandor thereafter reconciled himself with Per√≥n, who favored a moderately critical stance towards the junta, opting for the participationist stance. Tribute to Augusto Vandor at Chacarita Cemetery, Buenos Aires  Assassination  Augusto Vandor was shot five times on 30 June 1969, at his UOM offices, in what was codenamed Operation Judas. The perpetrators left a bomb, which upon exploding, destroyed part of the building. A far-left Peronist group, the Ej√©rcito Nacional Revolucionario claimed responsibility for the attack in February 1971. On the other hand, various authors point to figures and groups such as Dardo Cabo and the CGT de los Argentinos as responsible for the murder.Clar√≠n (√ë): Augusto Vandor See AlsoReferences= Bibliography = *√Ålvaro Ab√≥s.

It is named after the wealthy gold miner who owned the house from 1898 to 1900. The house has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture Dome on Mooers House The Victorian era house combines elements of Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque and Moorish Revival architectural styles. In their book, \\"An Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles,\\" authors David Gebhard and Robert Winter note that the home's overall design is in the Queen Anne style, though are also elements of Richardsonian Romanesque (the two pairs of small columns) and Islamic design (the elongated domed roof) (Moorish Revival). Ownership of the House=The Wrights and Mooers= The Mooers House was built in 1894 for May Gertrude Wright and F. L. Wright. However, the Wrights sold the house in 1898 to Frederick M. Mooers (1847‚Äì1900) for $5,200. Mooers, known as the \\"Yellow Aster mining king,\\" was the home's most famous occupant, and the house is commonly known by his name despite his having lived there for less than two years. Mooers came from a wealthy family, but reportedly had an adventurous spirit and spent years prospecting for gold in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. He moved to Southern California in 1885 and spent years traveling through the Mojave Desert on a burro with a pickaxe and grub-kit searching for his big strike. In 1895, while working with two other prospectors who became his partners, Mooers picked a spot in Randsburg, California that proved to be the site of the Yellow Aster mine, the richest in the area. Mooers became a wealthy man and bought a house in one of the finest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Will contest over Frederick Mooers' estate The Mooers House and the Mooers entire estate became the subject of a bitter and widely publicized will contest after he died at age 52 in 1900. At the time of his death, Mooers' interest in the Yellow Aster Mining and Milling Company was valued at $755,050; the family house on Bonnie Brae was valued at $10,000. Mooers' wife, who was given only one-sixth of the estate, had not lived with him for 18 years prior to discovery of the Yellow Aster mine. Mrs. Mooers said she had tried living with him over the years, but his alcoholism had caused him to desert his family, leaving her to run a boarding house in New York. On making the big strike in 1895, Mooers wrote asking her to join him in California. Mrs. Mooers came to California and had Mooers deed his interest in the Yellow Aster to her. Mrs. Mooers than granted an option in the property to another, spawning litigation over the mine's ownership. Though Mrs. Mooers had filed for divorce (on grounds of desertion) in 1898, the two remained married, and upon Mooers' death it was revealed that he had recently signed a new will ‚Äì limiting Mrs. Mooers to one-sixth of the estate and leaving the house on Bonnie Brae to his mother. Prior to his death, Mooers was living at the house on Bonnie Brae with his brothers, and Mrs. Mooers alleged that Mr. Mooers was suffering from severe alcoholism prior to his death and had been coerced by one of his brothers to sign the new will. Mrs. Mooers noted that her husband had been hospitalized for delirium tremens and was not in a proper mental state to sign a new will. The Los Angeles Times reported that Mooers was \\"shattered by drink\\" and had come under the delusion that his wife was trying to kill him. Mooers' brother, who along with two other brothers and their mother were the principal beneficiaries of Mooers' will, contended that Mrs. Moers had not been \\"a good and faithful wife\\" and should receive nothing from the estate. The dispute was settled the day before it was to be tried, after Mrs. Mooers met with her late husband's brother at the family home on Bonnie Brae. Ownership by Mooers' mother and brothers The Mooers House on Bonnie Brae ultimately was conveyed to Mooers' mother, Eliza A.R. Mooers, who lived there until her death in January 1902. The house was then inherited by her surviving sons. Historic designations Closeup of top of the house Though the surrounding neighborhood is no longer an upper class neighborhood as it was at the turn of the 20th Century, the Mooers House and other Victorians in the South Bonnie Brae Historic District have been well preserved. The Mooers House has often been used as an illustration of West Coast Victorian architecture. The Mooers House was declared a Historic- Cultural Monument (HCM #45) in 1967 by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. It was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

It lived in the Ladinian stage of the late Middle Triassic or the earliest Carnian of the Late Triassic, and is known from the Cha√±ares Formation of Argentina. Luperosuchus was one of the largest carnivores of the Cha√±ares Formation, although its remains are fragmentary and primarily represented by a skull with similarities to Prestosuchus and Saurosuchus.  Description  Life restoration Luperosuchus is known only from a single incomplete skull, with an associated atlas intercentrum representing the only known postcranial material. However, it is likely that it was a large quadruped, similar to other basal loricatans. Isolated osteoderms from the same region were initially attributed this genus based on their size and similarity to those of other \\"rauisuchian\\" osteoderms, however they were later found to be belong to the contemporary erpetosuchid Tarjadia. The presence of osteoderms in Luperosuchus is therefore left ambiguous. The length has been estimated to be 4.1-4.4 meters (13.5-14.4 ft) based on rauisuchids and 3.7 meters (12.3 ft) based on Prestosuchus. = Skull = The skull belongs to a large animal, with the preserved portions measuring and an estimated complete length of approximately , resembling those of other basal loricatans. The material largely consists of the skull roof, including the nasals, maxilla and part of the premaxilla. The snout is narrow and pointed, with a tall maxilla. Only a small, rounded front portion of the antorbital fenestra is preserved, though it was likely triangular based on the height of the skull. The antorbital fossa, the basin surrounding the antorbital fenestra, was deep. The premaxilla has a characteristically long posterodorsal process that articulates with the nasals, excluding the maxilla from the external naris, which tapers posteriorly. A narrow slit was identified between the premaxilla and maxilla, as in other loricatans, however this feature is likely to be from postmortem distortion rather than anatomical. An unusual feature found in Luperosuchus is the tall, mediolaterally compressed crest that sits on the front of the snout. This structure is formed by the dorsally arching nasals, and has been described as a 'roman-nose' following Romer's initial description. A similar structure is found in other loricatans, particularly Prestosuchus and Batrachotomus, although it is most prevalent in Luperosuchus. The orbit is tall and has smooth boundaries, without the \\"keyhole\\" shape of many other loricatans. The upper part of the infratemporal fenestra was also tall and narrow, although it may have been much wider near the lower rear corner of the skull, which was not preserved. The prefrontal bone had a pronounced finger-like process which stretched forwards above the lacrimal bone, although it did not stretch as far as the front edge of the frontals which were adjacent to it. A palpebral bone was situated above the orbit, though it was small and fused to the frontal and postfrontal. The postorbital bone had two distinguishing features: a large rounded knob on its upper portion and an elongated lower branch.  Discovery and naming  The holotype material of Luperosuchus, specimen PULR 04, was collected by Ruth Romer, wife of palaeontologist Alfred S. Romer, on January 17, 1965. It was found near the remains of a large dicynodont at a locality about 5 km northeast of where the Cha√±ares River emerges onto the Plano de Talampaya. The site is believed to represent the top of the lower member of the Cha√±ares Formation, based on similarities in preservation and the composition of the surrounding matrix to other fossils known from this time interval. This would be positioned below the strata recently dated by Marsicano et al., providing a minimum age of 236.1 +/- 0.6 Ma for the Luperosuchus locality. The material is stored at the La Plata Museum in La Plata, Argentina. Romer published his description of Luperosuchus in 1971, as part of a series of articles describing the numerous \\"thecodonts\\" he had collected from the Cha√±ares Formation. The binomial name, Luperosuchus fractus, refers to the fragmentary and \\"perplexing\\" nature of the fossil, and is derived from the Greek lyperos (\\"vexing\\", \\"difficult\\", \\"troublesome\\") and souchos (\\"crocodile\\"), with the specific name is from the Latin fractus, meaning \\"broken\\". Romer had collected additional fragments of bone from the holotype locality, but was unsure if they belonged to Luperosuchus or the dicynodont collected with it. After rediscovering and examining these fragments, Nesbitt & Desojo determined that many of the identifiable pieces were consistent with loricatan archosaurs, and so referred them to the holotype of Luperosuchus. These additional pieces include portions of the maxilla, quadrate, fragments of the braincase and the atlas intercentrum, the only postcranial material for Luperosuchus. A second specimen, PULR 057, was reported in 2009 by Desojo & Arcucci and was referred to this genus. This specimen however was a third smaller than the type specimen, and differed from it in a number of aspects, including a less developed 'roman-nose', but these were interpreted as ontogenetic variation as the material appeared to exhibit juvenile features (including loose sutures and less developed ornamentation of the bones). The referral of this material to Luperosuchus was questioned by Nesbitt & Desojo in 2017, who suggested that the differences are taxonomic, rather than ontogenetic. The holotype PULR 04 remains the only known material of Luperosuchus, with the taxonomic identity of the former referred specimen PULR 057 currently unknown. Classification Romer identified Luperosuchus as a member of the family Rauisuchidae in 1971, however at the time of his description the relationships of Rauisuchidae to other archosaurs were poorly understood and a detailed examination of its relationships was not performed. Luperosuchus was largely ignored in later phylogenetic analyses of Triassic pseudosuchians, likely due to the poor preservation of its remains and lack of identifying characteristics, as well as an unclear understanding of the interelationships of close relatives. As such, it was typically only ever provisionally assigned to \\"Rauisuchia\\" based on general similarities, without further justification. Luperosuchus was incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis for the first time by Nesbitt & Desojo in 2017, where it was recovered in a clade with two other South American loricatans, Saurosuchus and Prestosuchus, at the base of Loricata. They found two equally plausible hypotheses for the least inclusive position of Luperosuchus; one as a sister taxon to both Saurosuchus and Prestosuchus, and another as a sister taxon to Saurosuchus, the former of which is reproduced here: A study on new Cha√±ares vertebrates (including new specimens of Tarjadia) published in 2017 incorporated Luperosuchus and several other suchians into an archosauromorph dataset used by Ezcurra (2016). This study found Luperosuchus as the sister taxon to Decuriasuchus based on a prominent vertical peg on the supraoccipital bone of the braincase. The Luperosuchus + Decuriasuchus clade was found outside of a more restrictive Paracrocodylomorpha, crownward of Ticinosuchus and stemward of Prestosuchus. Nesbitt & Desojo (2017) was one of several phylogenetic analyses combined together during the course of Da-Silva et al. (2019)'s study of a new Prestosuchus specimen. This study did not fully support the Luperosuchus + Saurosuchus + Prestosuchus clade, although it did note that the clade was only barely less optimal than their most parsimonious tree (MPT). Their MPT found these three taxa in a series leading up to more crownward loricatans, with Prestosuchus occupying the bottom (stemward) rung, Saurosuchus in the middle, and Luperosuchus at the top (crownward) rung just below Batrachotomus.  Palaeobiology = Histology and growth = The skull of Luperosuchus has very few visible sutures, partly due to the material's poor preservation but also from the addition of consolidates to the surface of the specimen that obscure finer anatomical details. Romer struggled to identify the suture pattern, but identified fused sutures which he interpreted as a possible indicator that the specimen was mature. Later examination by Nesbitt & Desojo confirmed that many of the sutures in the skull of Luperosuchus were obliterated, with the bones in the skull fully fused, in addition to well developed sculpting of the bones. In 2008, Ricql√®s et al. reported that they performed a histological study on a limb bone belonging to Luperosuchus, identified as specimen MCZ 4077. However, as Luperosuchus is only definitively known from the holotype material, the referral of this bone to Luperosuchus is dubious. MCZ 4077 was later referred to Tarjadia ruthae.  Palaeoecology  Luperosuchus is one of the largest animals in the Cha√±ares Formation, and indeed was one of the few large animals known from the formation. In the lower member of the formation, it shared its environment with smaller archosauromorphs, including proterochampsians, the erpetosuchid Tarjadia, and the archosaur taxon represented by PULR 057, possibly a related loricatan. A specimen of a large paracrocodylomorph has been reported from the Cha√±ares, possibly representing the largest predatory archosaur in the ecosystem. Luperosuchus also coexisted with several therapsids, including the very abundant dicynodont Dinodontosaurus, as well as numerous cynodonts such as Massetognathus. The environment of the Cha√±ares Formation is characterised by deposits of pyroclastic and volcaniclastic materials, such as tuff and ash, indicating a complex history of regional volcanism in the environment.

Growling is used primarily in rock and blues style playing, it is also frequently used in klezmer music; it is popular in the woodwind family of instruments, especially the saxophone, though it is also commonly used on brass instruments, as well. It is commonly used by mainstream artists such as Ben Webster, Illinois Jacquet and Earl Bostic.Saxophone Tone & Effects - Growl Outside of these styles and instruments, it is often considered a novelty effect. The growl gives the performer's sound a dark, guttural, gritty timbre resulting largely from the rustle noise and desirable consonance and dissonance effects produced. The technique of simultaneous playing a note and singing into an instrument is also known as horn chords or multiphonics. Method The most common and effective method of woodwind growling is to hum, sing, or even scream into the mouthpiece of the instrument.Saxophone Growl effect, how to growl on Sax to get that dirty sax sound This method introduces interference within the instrument itself, breaking up the normal quality of sound waves produced. Furthermore, the vibration of the vocal note in the mouth and lips creates rustle noise in the instrument. The vocally produced note can be the same note (though this is believed to be less effective), a natural third or perfect fifth, or any random note, usually from a different octave than the note the instrument is producing. The latter choice is believed to cause the most interference and yield the darkest, grittiest timbre. Alternate methods A woodwind growl can also be produced by allowing air to escape from around the corners of the mouth, causing a vibration in the lips and mouthpiece. Although this method does not set up patterns of interference, it does produce the characteristic rustle noise of the growl. Alternately, it is possible to use multiphonic fingering to create a growl-like effects. The performer selects a bizarre or unusual fingering that causes the instrument to attempt to sound on multiple notes. This creates interference, but no beating or rustle noise. Other methods include constricting the airway to create a \\"rasp\\". Use in other instruments A \\"growl\\" can be produced by instruments outside of the woodwind family such as the trumpet or the trombone. Bubber Miley is often referred to as \\"growl trumpeter\\". A \\"growl trombone\\" may be seen in a 1929 film Black and Tan Fantasy played by Joe \\"Tricky Sam\\" Nanton. Harmonica players have started growling as well by using a technique similar to bending notes which causes the reeds to project a raspy guttural sound.

The primary nature of Davidson's business consisted of providing promotional services for companies by sending large volumes of unsolicited commercial electronic messages (\\"spamming\\"). The spamming was designed to promote the visibility and sale of products offered by various companies. Davidson utilized the services and assistance of other individuals whom he hired as \\"sub-contractors\\" to provide spamming at his direction on behalf of his client companies. Spamming operations Throughout 2002 through the middle of 2005, Davidson's spamming activities were provided on behalf of companies to promote watches, perfume, and other items. Beginning in the middle of 2005 through 2006, Davidson sent spam on behalf of a Texas company for purposes of promoting the sale of the company's stock. The company generated its income through selling low-value stock on behalf of small companies on the public market. Davidson, aided by several sub-spammers, sent hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to potential purchasers throughout the United States and the world, which messages touted the penny stock as an excellent investment. Davidson possessed hundreds of thousands of e-mail addresses, which he and his sub-spammers would use to send e-mail messages. Such e-mail messages contained false header information, which concealed the actual sender from the recipient of the e-mail. Davidson provided spammed messages for approximately 19 companies. Davidson operated his spamming activities from his personal residence in Bennett, Colorado, where he had a large network of computers and servers, which facilitated his business. Court proceedings Davidson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 5, 2007 for violating the CAN SPAM Act. He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court before Judge Marcia S. Krieger on December 3, 2007. On April 28, 2008, Davidson was sentenced by Krieger to serve 21 months in federal prison. Judge Krieger also ordered him to pay $714,139 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As part of the restitution, Davis agreed to forfeit property, including gold coins, which he purchased with the proceeds of his activities. At the time of sentencing Judge Krieger ordered Davidson to report to a facility designated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons on May 27, 2008. This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Denver field office, and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Neff prosecuted the case. Incarceration Davidson was assigned Inmate Number 35082-013 and housed in a minimum-security part of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex in Florence, Colorado. Escape and death Davidson walked away from a federal prison camp in Florence on July 20, 2008.

Academics=Mathematics= Eye Level Math has two main sections: Basic and Critical Thinking Math, which both consist of thirty-two levels. Students focus on the arithmetic part of mathematics, the four basic operations of mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in Basic Thinking Math, including the calculations applied to fractions and decimals, as well as equations and real numbers. Through thoughts nurtured and real-life applications in Critical Thinking Math, students improve critical thinking by focusing on patterns and relationships (including domino patterns, line patterns, shape patterns, number patterns, and functions, as well as graphs of functions), geometry and spatial sense (depth perception), measurement, problem-solving, and reasoning. Students are assigned to their levels based on test results, not by their ages or grade levels. The \\"eye-level\\" name means to look at the problem from the children's level. A teacher should get down to the child's level and see the problem to better assist them in solving it. These focus more on application to various real-life situations, and various manipulatives contribute to their development of mathematical and critical thinking skills. =English= Eye Level English focuses on four main fundamental skills of communication: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

History  The hospital was created using a donation of $25,000 from Judge Francis Flagg Putney. At his request, the hospital was named after his mother, Phoebe. The hospital opened on August 1, 1911. In 1986, the hospital was at the center of a criminal case after a GBI investigation following an unusually high percentage of cardiac arrests. Nurse Terri Rachals was indicted on twenty counts of aggravated assault, and convicted on one count as \\"guilty but mentally ill\\" of aggravated assault with intent to murder. Potassium chloride was injected into a bag of frozen plasma which was then introduced to a patient's body. In 2010, the facility bought out the area's only other hospital, Palmyra Medical Center, for $195 million. PMC was owned by Hospital Corporation of America, the country's largest hospital operator. The acquisition ended a lawsuit over Palmyra's provision of obstetric services. Because of the merger, the hospital agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2013 that for the next 10 years, PPMH and the Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County, without first notifying the FTC, would not acquire another medical facility within Dougherty, Lee, Baker, Terrell, Worth, and Mitchell Counties. PPMH and the hospital authority also agreed for the next five years to not file an objection to a Certificate of Need granted to a general acute care hospital within the six county region.

The Ottoman sultan, Selim I (1516‚Äì20), invaded Syria and Lebanon in 1516. The Ottomans, through the Maans, a great Druze feudal family, and the Shihabs, a Sunni Muslim family that had converted to Christianity, ruled Lebanon until the middle of the nineteenth century. Ottoman administration, however, was only effective in urban areas, while most of the country was ruled by tribal chieftains, based largely on their ability to collect taxes for the sultan. The system of administration in Lebanon during this period is best described by the Arabic word iqta', which refers to a political system, similar to other feudal societies, composed of autonomous feudal families that were subservient to the emir, who himself was nominally loyal to the sultan; therefore, allegiance depended heavily upon personal loyalty. It was precisely this power structure, made up of fiefdoms, that allowed Bashir II, an emir from the Shihab dynasty in the Druze and Maronite districts of Mount Lebanon, to become the most powerful figure in Ottoman Syria during the first part of the 19th century. It was during this period that Lebanon saw increasing class and religious antagonisms that would define Lebanese social and political life for decades to come. Ottoman conquest and early rule The Ottoman sultan, Selim I (1512‚Äì20), after defeating the Safavids, conquered the Mamluks of Egypt. His troops, invading Syria, destroyed Mamluk resistance in 1516 at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, north of Aleppo. Maan family ruleShihab dynastyBashir II The reign of Bashir II saw an economic shift in the mountain regions from a feudal to a cash crop system, in which Beiruti merchants (largely Sunni and Christian) loaned money to peasants, freeing them from dependence on their feudal mountain lords and contributing to the development of a handicraft economy with the growing specialization of agriculture. The emir's relationship with Muhammad Ali, the Albanian-Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, began in 1821 after Bashir II was forced to seek refuge in Egypt by revolting Maronites upset about overtaxation. In 1822, the emir returned to Lebanon, backed by Muhammad Ali, and reestablished his semi-autonomous rule, making allies with Maronite patriarchs and surrounding himself with Christians, causing many historians to retrospectively accuse the emir of fomenting religious tensions between the ascendant Maronite community and the historically dominant Druze. Lebanon under Egyptian Occupation After the failure to put down the insurrection in some of the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire due to the intervention of European powers sinking his naval fleet at the Battle of Navarino, the wƒÅli of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, sought the province of Syria, which had been promised to him by the Ottoman government if he succeeded in the war. When the Porte refused to give him the province, Muhammad Ali raised an army under his son Ibrahim Pasha to occupy the province and bring it under Egyptian control. Bashir II had sought refuge in Egypt during the aforementioned troubled times in Lebanon from 1821‚Äì1822 and had become an ally of Muhammad Ali, thus his help was sought to help secure Egyptian rule in the province. During the occupation, Ibrahim Pasha and Bashir II enacted high taxes, eventually producing resistance, and Bashir II's provision of Christian forces in battles against the Druze may have served as a source of future sectarian tensions. Bashir II had previously attempted to not appear as favoring the Maronites to the degree that he was required to under the Egyptian occupation, however as his help was required to hold the territory, Muhammad Ali was insistent that he provide forces to his son, even threatening Bashir II personally when he appeared to be hesitating in bringing his soldiers. The occupation also introduced social measures that raised the legal rights of Christians in the area and imposed conscription and disarmament. Foreign intervention in the 19th century and changing economic conditions The tensions that burst into the sectarian conflict during the 1860s were set within the context of a fast- paced change in the established social order in the region. Under Bashir II, the agricultural economy of the Mount Lebanon region was brought into greater interdependence with the commercial economy of Beirut, altering the structure of feudal obligations and expanding the influence of cash crops. This created increased economic and political ties with France, leading to the French becoming an international patron of sorts to the Maronites of Lebanon. This left the British to side with the Druze to the extent that a counterweight to France could be established in the region and that such tensions would not result in separatism that would threaten the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The reforms within the Tanzimat also provided a source of increasing disagreement between Maronite and Druze populations. The European powers attempted to make sure the Tanzimat was interpreted as a mandate to protected Christians in the region and grant them great autonomy; while Druze elites interpreted the Tanzimat as restoring their traditional rights to rule the land. Youssef Bey Karam, a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era. Religious conflicts On September 3, 1840, Bashir III was appointed amir of Mount Lebanon by the Ottoman sultan. Geographically, Mount Lebanon represents the central part of present-day Lebanon, which historically has had a Christian majority. Greater Lebanon, on the other hand, created at the expense of Greater Syria, was formally constituted under the League of Nations mandate granted to France in 1920 and includes the Biqa Valley, Beirut, southern Lebanon (up to the border with modern Israel), and northern Lebanon (up to the border with Syria). In practice, the terms Lebanon and Mount Lebanon tend to be used interchangeably by historians until the formal establishment of the Mandate. Bitter conflicts between Christians and Druzes, which had been simmering under Ibrahim Pasha's rule, resurfaced under the new amir. Hence, the sultan deposed Bashir III on January 13, 1842, and appointed Omar Pasha as governor of Mount Lebanon. This appointment, however, created more problems than it solved. Representatives of the European powers proposed to the sultan that Lebanon be partitioned into Christian and Druze sections. On December 7, 1842, the sultan adopted the proposal and asked Assad Pasha, the governor (wali) of Beirut, to divide the region, then known as Mount Lebanon, into two districts: a northern district under a Christian deputy governor and a southern district under a Druze deputy governor. this arrangement came to be known as the Double Qaimaqamate. Both officials were to be responsible to the governor of Sidon, who resided in Beirut. The Beirut-Damascus highway was the dividing line between the two districts. This partition of Lebanon proved to be a mistake. Animosities between the religious sects increased, nurtured by outside powers. The French, for example, supported the Christians, while the British supported the Druzes, and the Ottomans fomented strife to increase their control. Not surprisingly, these tensions led to conflict between Christians and Druzes as early as May 1845. Consequently, the European powers requested that the Ottoman sultan establish order in Lebanon, and he attempted to do so by establishing a majlis (council) in each of the districts. Each majlis was composed of members who represented the different religious communities and was intended to assist the deputy governor. This system failed to keep order when the peasants of Kasrawan, overburdened by heavy taxes, rebelled against the feudal practices that prevailed in Mount Lebanon. In 1858 Tanyus Shahin and Abou Samra Ghanem, both Maronite peasant leaders, demanded that the feudal class abolish its privileges. When this demand was refused, the poor peasants revolted against the shaykhs of Mount Lebanon, pillaging the shaykhs' land and burning their homes. Foreign interests in Lebanon transformed these basically sociopolitical struggles into bitter religious conflicts, culminating in the 1860 massacre of about 10,000 Maronites, as well as Greek Catholics and Greek Orthodox, by the Druzes. These events offered France the opportunity to intervene; in an attempt to forestall French intervention, the Ottoman government stepped in to restore order. Christian refugees during the 1860 strife between Druze and Maronites in Lebanon. On October 5, 1860, an international commission composed of France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, and the Ottoman Empire met to investigate the causes of the events of 1860 and to recommend a new administrative and judicial system for Lebanon that would prevent the recurrence of such events. The commission members agreed that the partition of Mount Lebanon in 1842 between Druzes and Christians had been responsible for the massacre. Hence, in the Statue of 1861 Mount Lebanon was separated from Syria and reunited under a non-Lebanese Christian mutasarrif (governor) appointed by the Ottoman sultan, with the approval of the European powers. The mutasarrif was to be assisted by an administrative council of twelve members from the various religious communities in Lebanon. Direct Ottoman rule of Lebanon remained in effect until the end of World War I. This period was generally characterized by a laissez-faire policy and corruption. However, a number of governors, such as Daud Pasha and Naum Pasha, ruled the country efficiently and conscientiously. Lebanese soldiers during the Mutasarrifia period of Mount Lebanon Restricted mainly to the mountains by the mutasarrifiyah (district governed by a mutasarrif) arrangement and unable to make a living, many Lebanese Christians emigrated to Egypt and other parts of Africa and to North America, South America, and East Asia. Remittances from these Lebanese emigrants send to their relatives in Lebanon has continued to supplement the Lebanese economy to this day. In addition to being a center of commercial and religious activity, Lebanon became an intellectual center in the second half of the nineteenth century. Foreign missionaries established schools throughout the country, with Beirut as the center of this renaissance. The American University of Beirut was founded in 1866, followed by the French St. Joseph's University in 1875. An intellectual guild that was formed at the same time gave new life to Arabic literature, which had stagnated under the Ottoman Empire. This new intellectual era was also marked by the appearance of numerous publications and by a highly prolific press. The period was also marked by increased political activity. The harsh rule of Abdul Hamid II (1876‚Äì1909) prompted the Arab nationalists, both Christians and Muslims, in Beirut and Damascus to organize into clandestine political groups and parties. The Lebanese, however, had difficulties in deciding the best political course to advocate. Many Lebanese Christians were apprehensive of Turkish pan-Islamic policies, fearing a repetition of the 1860 massacres. Some, especially the Maronites, began to contemplate secession rather than the reform of the Ottoman Empire. Others, particularly the Greek Orthodox, advocated an independent Syria with Lebanon as a separate province within it, so as to avoid Maronite rule. A number of Lebanese Muslims, on the other hand, sought not to liberalize the Ottoman regime but to maintain it, as Sunni Muslims particularly liked to be identified with the caliphate. The Shias and Druzes, however, fearing minority status in a Turkish state, tended to favor an independent Lebanon or a continuation of the status quo. Youssef Bey Karam, a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era. Originally the Arab reformist groups hoped their nationalist aims would be supported by the Young Turks, who had staged a revolution in 1908‚Äì1909. Unfortunately, after seizing power, the Young Turks became increasingly repressive and nationalistic. They abandoned many of their liberal policies because of domestic opposition and Turkey's engagement in foreign wars between 1911 and 1913. Thus, the Arab nationalists could not count on the support of the Young Turks and instead were faced with opposition by the Turkish government. World War I and the French Mandate The outbreak of World War I in August 1914 brought famine to Lebanon, mainly resulting from a Turkish land blockade and confiscations.Melanie Schulze Tanielian, Charity of War: Famine, Humanitarian Aid, and World War I in the Middle East. (Stanford, CA.: Stanford University Press, 2017) url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=28143 It killed an estimated third to half of the predominantly Maronite population over the next four years. Turkey, which had allied itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary, abolished Lebanon's semiautonomous status and appointed Djemal Pasha, then minister of the navy, as the commander in chief of the Turkish forces in Syria, with discretionary powers. Infamous for his brutality, he militarily occupied Lebanon and replaced the Armenian mutasarrif, Ohannes Pasha, with a Turk, Munif Pasha. The Turkish Army also cut down trees for wood to fuel trains or for military purposes. The date, May 6, is commemorated annually in both countries as Martyrs' Day, and the site in Beirut has come to be known as Martyrs' Square. The end of Ottoman rule in Lebanon began in September 1918 when French forces landed on the Lebanese coast, and the British moved into Palestine, opening the way for the liberation of Syria and Lebanon from Turkish rule. At the San Remo Conference in Italy in April 1920, the Allies gave France a mandate over Greater Syria. France then appointed General Henri Gouraud to implement the mandate provisions.

Its construction can roughly be dated to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Trapeziodal in shape as the north end is wider than the south (5.50 m wide compared to 3.65 m), the shrine is 5.50 m long. It is orientated north to south, with the southern and eastern sides of the shrine both hollowed out of the natural rock and the northern and western sides being built in stone. Four steps lead down into the central aisle (nave) of the shrine which was 80 cm below the level of the pronaos and the two flanking side benches which were all on ground level. The tauroctony sculpture was carved into the rock face.The relief includes the flanking figures of Cautes and Cautopates. An inscription at the bottom of the relief reads: FECIT IMPENDO SUO. Three altars (see below) were also found on the site. Two were dedicated by Septimius Justianus, a custodes armorum (a soldier in charge of the armoury) of Legio XIIII Gemina. The second was dedicated by Julius Saturninus, a politician from the colony.

He attacked Asia Minor, defeated the Persian troops in 333 BC, and advanced toward the Lebanese coast. Initially the Phoenician cities made no attempt to resist, and they recognized his suzerainty. However, when Alexander tried to offer a sacrifice to Melqart, Tyre's god, the city resisted. Alexander besieged Tyre in retaliation in early 332 BC. After seven months of resistance, the city fell, and its people were sold into slavery (See Siege of Tyre (332 BC)). Despite his early death in 323 BC, Alexander's conquest of the eastern Mediterranean Basin left a Greek imprint on the area. The Phoenicians, being a cosmopolitan people amenable to outside influences, adopted aspects of Greek civilization with ease. The Seleucid Dynasty After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his Macedonian generals. The eastern part‚ÄîPhoenicia, Asia Minor, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia fell to Seleucus I, founder of the Seleucid dynasty. The southern part of Syria and Egypt fell to Ptolemy I Soter, and the European part, including Macedonia, to Antigonus I. This settlement, however, failed to bring peace because Seleucus I and Ptolemy clashed repeatedly in the course of their ambitious efforts to share in Phoenician prosperity. A final victory of the Seleucids ended a forty-year period of conflict. The last century of Seleucid rule was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles.

The area around Berytus (and to a lesser degree around Heliopolis) was the only Latin speaking and Romanized part of Aramaic-speaking Phoenicia. This was one of the most prosperous periods in the history of the area that is now Lebanon. Phoenicia became one of the intellectual and economic hubs of the eastern half of the empire and a destination for merchants and intellectuals. The Romans built the temples of Baalbek, the temples at Mount Hermon, the temple of Niha and various other structures now in ruins that include smaller temples, hippodromes, baths and the Roman law school of Berytus. History The Roman Diocese of Oriens in 400 AD, with the two provinces of Phoenice Prima and Phoenice Libanensis The last century of Seleucid rule in Lebanon was marked by disorder and dynastic struggles. These ended in 64 BC, when the Roman general Pompey added Seleucid Syria and Lebanon to the Roman Empire. Economic and intellectual activities flourished in Lebanon during the Pax Romana. The inhabitants of the principal Phoenician cities of Byblos, Sidon, and Tyre were granted Roman citizenship. These cities were centers of the pottery, glass, and purple dye industries; their harbors also served as warehouses for products imported from Syria, Persia, and India. They exported cedar, perfume, jewelry, wine, and fruit to Rome. This prosperity meant Phoenicia became a notable destination for intellectuals, tradesmen and merchants; even farmers, from all over the empire and especially the east. Economic prosperity led to a revival in construction and urban development; temples and palaces were built throughout the country, as well as paved roads that linked the main cities like Baalbeck and Berytus. Indeed, starting in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE (reign of Augustus) and over a period of two centuries (reign of Philip the Arab), the Romans built a huge temple complex in Baalbek on a pre- existing tell dating to the PPNB, consisting of three temples: Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus. On a nearby hill, they built a fourth temple dedicated to Mercury. Phoenicians would ascend to the throne of Rome during the Severan dynasty. The city of Baalbeck (then called Heliopolis) was made a colonia by Septimius Severus (193-211) in 193 AD, having been part of the territory of Berytus on the Phoenician coast since 15 BC. Work on the religious complex there lasted over a century and a half and was never completed. The dedication of the present temple ruins, the largest religious building in the entire Roman empire, dates from the reign of Septimus Severus, whose coins first show the two temples. The great courts of approach were not finished before the reigns of Caracalla (211-217 CE) and Philip the Arab (244-249 CE). In commemoration of the dedication of the new sanctuaries, Severus conferred the rights of the ius Italicum on the city. Today, only six Corinthian columns remain standing of this huge Jupiter temple. Severus also separated the area of modern Lebanon and parts of Syria from the greater province of Syria Coele, and formed the new province of Phoenice. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus (actual Beirut): the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic.Roman Berytus: a colony of legionaries The city quickly became Romanized. Large public buildings and monuments were erected and Berytus enjoyed full status as a part of the empire.About Beirut and Downtown Beirut, DownTownBeirut.com. Retrieved November 17, 2007. Actual ruins of Baalbeck Under the Romans, Berytus was enriched by the dynasty of Herod the Great, and was made a colonia, Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus, in 14 BC. Beirut's school of law was widely known at the time.Beirut, Britannica.com Two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Phoenicia, taught at the law school under the Severan emperors. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws were derived from these two jurists, and Justinian recognized the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire in 533 AD. Upon the death of Theodosius I in AD 395, the empire was divided in two: the eastern or Byzantine part with its capital at Constantinople, and the western part with its capital at Ravenna. Under the Byzantine Empire, intellectual and economic activities in Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon continued to flourish for more than a century. However, in the sixth century a series of earthquakes demolished the temples of Baalbek and destroyed the city of Beirut, leveling its famous law school and killing nearly 30,000 inhabitants. To these natural disasters were added the abuses and corruptions prevailing at that time in the empire. Heavy tributes and religious dissension produced disorder and confusion. Furthermore, the ecumenical councils of the fifth and sixth centuries AD were unsuccessful in settling religious disagreements. This turbulent period weakened the empire and made it easy prey to the newly converted Muslim Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0017) Roman Temples in Lebanon Today one of the best examples of Roman Temple architecture is in Lebanon at the ruins of Baalbeck. The Roman temple sites in Lebanon can be divided into three main groups. First, the Bekaa valley north of the Beirut-Damascus road. Second, the area south of the same road, including the Wadi al-Taym and the western flank of Mount Hermon. Third, the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. In the coastal area of Lebanon there are not many Roman ruins. Roman ruins in front of St. George's Cathedral in Beirut Agrippa greatly favoured the city of Berytus, and adorned it with a splendid theatre and amphitheatre, beside baths and porticoes, inaugurating them with games and spectacles of every kind, including shows of gladiators. But now only minor ruins remains, in front of the Catholic Cathedral of Beirut. In two hundred and fifty years - from Augustus to Philip the Arab - were made all the Roman Temples, with a very similar design: they show the golden era of Roman rule in Lebanon.George Taylor.\\"The Roman Temples of Lebanon\\"Cook, Arthur Bernard.

It is centered by a three-section farmhouse whose materials date to the mid-18th century, making it one of the oldest buildings in the Town of Wawayanda. In 2008 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has undergone extensive renovation and reconstruction since its original construction, some incorporating elements of architectural styles of the later 19th century. Its residents, many of whom lived in the house for years, have primarily been from two different families, including the descendants of the original builder. Many have also been active in local affairs and served in political office. Woodlawn Farm has thus played an important role in the history of Slate Hill. Property The main farmhouse is a combination of three structures erected during different eras. The main (west) block, closest to the road, is a two-and-a-half-story three-by-two-bay gable-roofed clapboard-sided unit with wraparound veranda on the south and west sides. All the windows have louvered shutters, with those on the main block larger than the other two sections. The roof has patterned cement-asbestos shingles and a brick chimney. The center and east sections are smaller two-by-two-bay two- story buildings with rolled asphalt roofs, progressively lower in height. Another chimney rises from the east block, currently used as a kitchen. A chimney on the center block has been largely dismantled. Inside, the main block has a side-hall, double-parlor plan, suggesting it was built as the Federal style was becoming popular in the late 18th century. Some of the decorative touches, such as woodwork and door paneling, are in keeping with the Greek Revival era and an extensive renovation around that time. In the center section, believed to be the oldest, the two open areas and cooking fireplace are consistent with the late 18th century. A library and bay window were added during the 19th century. Its upper story is used for bedrooms. The east block, the smallest and newest, serves as the kitchen with a large brick mass separating it from the cooking areas in the center block. Its upper story is unfinished. Two outbuildings are considered contributing resources to the farm's historic character. A large barn with gabled roof is to the north, near the carport, and a frame privy with gabled, asphalt-shingled roof, four- paneled door and novelty siding. History Local lore dates the building's center block to 1765, when Benjamin Whitaker owned what was then a property but the hand-hewn timbers visible in the basement, and the finishes used are not consistent with that period. They, and the overall plan, are more suggestive of a circa-1790 construction date. Richard Wood, the first known occupant of the house, did not settle it until 1772. His house was used for early meetings of the nearby Primitive Baptist Church of Brookfield until the church that still bears that name was built in 1792. The main block was probably added around this time. While the house itself may not be as old as believed, some of its materials may. In 2002, during the most recent renovation of the house, notched hand-hewn timbers were found beneath the center-block bathroom floor that are more extensively used in houses on Long Island from that era. They appear to have been reused from a previously-built home. No record or other trace exists of any earlier building on or near the site. From Wood, the house became the property of Festus Webb, a local official, in 1796. He would reside there for the next forty years, during which the Greek Revival aspects of the main block were added. Roswell Mead, who bought it from Webb's estate, lived there until his death in 1850, serving as town supervisor, New York State Assemblyman, and town justice during his residency. His wife and son sold the property to William Wood, Richard's grandson, in 1867. Like his predecessors, Wood would own the house for over two decades, and distinguish himself in local politics as a supervisor, a position he held for 14 years. It is likely that he put the east wing on the house, due to the Italianate touches on it. He built the current barn in 1888 when the original one burned down. He also branched out from farming into industry, damming a nearby stream to create the now-drained Crescent Lake. He built a gristmill, ice house and the Springbrook Hat Factory, using wild teasel from his fields to card the wool. None of these buildings remain, but their existence is attested by period photographs. He transferred the property to his daughter Minnie in 1900. Under her ownership, the property became more valuable as real estate than as farmland. She subdivided it into 18 lots, reducing the family plot to today's around the house and fronting on the road. Her son LeRoy inherited it when she died in 1945, then sold it to Dr. Frank Myers Jr. a year later. Myers, who lived at Woodlawn until 1986, was also active in community affairs. He chaired the Department of Medicine at Middletown's Horton Memorial Hospital for 22 years, serving for part of that time as chief of staff, while maintaining his local practice. He was the town's health officer, and also played a part in establishing the Minisink Valley Central School District. His son and daughter-in-law have lived there since then. Aesthetics The original blocks of the Woodlawn Farm house are representative of English colonial building traditions of the mid-18th century. The center block's two-by-two-bay shape is common among older houses in Orange County built by settlers of English descent, especially in the Town of Montgomery. Most were expanded with only one wing, or with an additional bay or two. The two separate blocks added on and heavily modified in later eras represent a distinctive record of the changes in architectural taste among the region's prosperous landowners.

Under the working title \\"Dying In the Street\\", he sang, \\"Tonight tonight the strips just right, I wanna blow'em all out of their seats, so come out now everyone And we'll go racing in the street, Yes come on out now little one and we'll go dying in the street, Yes come on out now everyone and we'll go dying in the street, Look at me it's true Baby what else can we do, Racing in the Streets...\\" According to studio records at both Atlantic and the Record Plant, eight days were devoted to \\"Racing In the Street\\" during August 1977, and with a final total of seventeen, the most spent working on any song during the sessions. On August 30 at the Record Plant, the tape that would be used on the \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town\\" album was completed. However, Springsteen was not finished with the song. In late November and early December, he spent five more days working on the \\"harp version\\", which circulated for years among bootleggers, and was finally released as \\"Racing In the Street '78\\" on The Promise: The Darkness On The Edge of Town Story. December 9, 1977 was the last day he would record \\"Racing\\", although he spent three more days mixing it, March 21‚Äì23, 1978. Structure The song is a ballad that begins with a slow, graceful and elegant introduction by pianist Roy Bittan. The narrator has a dead end job, but his pride and joy is his '69 Chevy that he and his partner built, and race in the northeast section of the state (exactly which state is not mentioned) to win money gambling against similar racers. The first verse is accompanied only by piano and opens with the narrator singing that: :I got a '69 Chevy with a 396 :Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor Max Weinberg's drum rim taps signal a somewhat faster pace for the second verse. Midway through, Danny Federici's organ later joins in, combining to form what writer Robert Santelli termed \\"one beautiful, seamless sound\\". The organ entrance signals one of the lyric's main points, that the narrator divides the world into two types of people: those who \\"give up living / And start dying little by little, piece by piece,\\" and those like himself who find something to live for, which in his case is going racing in the streets. However, after an instrumental break the third verse unexpectedly takes place with again only piano behind it. The girlfriend the protagonist apparently won from a competitor in one of his races does not share his dream of going racing in the streets. Instead, she \\"stares into the night with the eyes of one who hates for just being born.\\" But the story ends on a possibly hopeful note, as the narrator attempts to find salvation in the closing lines: :Tonight my baby and me are gonna drive to the sea :And wash these sins off our hands. Other views of the closing have been grimmer. In any case, the song concludes with a moving fugue-like instrumental coda with Bittan's piano, Federici's organ and Max Weinberg's drums intertwining. The chord progression in the choruses and coda is I‚ÄìIV‚Äìii‚ÄìIV in the key of F. Springsteen uses the technique of withholding the V chord, which is only heard during the piano introduction and during a later transition; by reducing the chord's influence, the sense of longing or desperation in the song is heightened. \\"Racing in the Street\\" contains two clear homages: the title and chorus refer to Martha and the Vandellas' 1964 hit \\"Dancing in the Street\\", while the instrumental break after the second verse and chorus is an allusion to The Beach Boys' 1964 song \\"Don't Worry Baby\\", itself about the emotional aspects of drag racing. The song also inhabits the space established by other early 1960s works, such as Jan and Dean's \\"Dead Man's Curve\\" and various other Beach Boys works. Indeed, writer Jim Cullen sees as one of Springsteen's goals with the song to comment upon and reconnect certain elements of rock history. Structurally, the song is also influenced by Van Morrison's \\"Tupelo Honey\\". The organ refrain references \\"It's My Life\\", a song by The Animals that Springsteen has revered since adolescence. Similarly, the opening piano motif is based on the hook of \\"Then He Kissed Me\\" by The Crystals. Themes and interpretations Springsteen has said that this song commemorates the racing in the street that occurred on a little fire road outside his home base of Asbury Park, New Jersey. But the song is one of a number of Springsteen songs from the 1970s, such as \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Thunder Road\\", that celebrate American men's desire for freedom from responsibility, as symbolized by the ability to drive to freedom in a fast car. The protagonist of \\"Racing in the Street\\" can be contrasted with the protagonist of Tracy Chapman's \\"Fast Car\\". The protagonist of \\"Racing in the Street\\" using his fast car as a means to escape the city and responsibility, while the protagonist of \\"Fast Car\\" is using her fast car to approach the city and responsibility. In any case, the song plays off the American love of muscle cars during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Indeed, automotive enthusiasts have debated whether 1969 Chevrolet models could be ordered, customized, or built to the exact specifications given in the song of a 396-cubic-inch Chevrolet big-block engine with Fuelie Heads and Hurst Performance shifter. Unfortunately, however, as the 396 engine is a big-block, and the 'Fuelie heads' refer to the 1963-65 fuel-injected small-block Chevrolet engine, the cylinder heads are incompatible. Another interpretation of the song is that it is a possible realization of the potential inherent in \\"Thunder Road\\". That song is a declaration of what the protagonist and his girlfriend are going to do; \\"Racing in the Street\\" is the reality of how they might end up. Most importantly, \\"Racing in the Street\\" is the first song in which Springsteen introduces the suffering woman. Rock has always had songs where women are won and lost as trophies in contests, but Springsteen treats that theme with much more compassion than usual in the genre. This perspective is amplified by writer Jeffrey B. Symynkywicz, who sees the romantic attachment formed in the story removing the protagonist from his perfectly constructed world of cars built to personal specification and no external commitments. Springsteen paints \\"a harrowing portrait of the toll depression takes\\" on the woman, but the protagonist is at least mature enough to realize he has to augment the challenges he takes on the street with the role of not letting the woman face her demons alone. While romanticization of the ordinary, anonymous Americans found in \\"Racing in the Street\\" is common in rock, Springsteen's detailed depiction of them in this song shows real understanding and compassion, perhaps due to his having lived among them. Writer Greil Marcus sees \\"Racing in the Street\\" as picking up the characters of various Beach Boys songs fifteen years later in their lives, never finding anywhere else the freedom they found in their cars and driving forever towards a dead end that they could see but not wish away or reach. Rolling Stone's David Fricke echoes this view, saying it is \\"Springsteen's grim Darkness portrait of a generation racing to a dead end.\\" Both the album's title track \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"Racing in the Street\\", which is similarly set physically and which close the two album sides, are influenced by film noir, which further set the mood of the record. Writer Eric Alterman sees \\"Racing in the Street\\" as one of Springsteen's top-flight songs, and one of several on the Darkness album that helped establish its low-on-hype integrity and power, and thus cemented Springsteen's relationship with his fan base. William Gibson, \\"noir prophet\\" of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction, said in 2010 that \\"Racing in the Streets\\" had everything to do with the hacker Bobby Quine from Gibson's 1982 short story \\"Burning Chrome\\" and what he did for a living. Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh has called the song \\"the line of demarcation separating casual Springsteen fans from the fanatics,\\" with the former considering it yet another sign of Springsteen's car metaphor obsession taken to an extreme, while the latter consider it \\"maybe the best thing Springsteen has to give.\\" Detractors have also referred to the song as plodding, especially in comparison to the dynamicism of the prior Born to Run album. In any case, the people in \\"Racing in the Street\\" are part of the central thematic development of Springsteen's cast of characters from Born to Run to Nebraska and beyond.Marsh, Glory Days (1987), pp. 100, 127. Springsteen has called \\"Racing in the Street\\" one of his favorite songs. The song has been highly praised by other artists, including Bob Dylan and Joe Strummer.Marsh, Glory Days (1987), p. 272. It was disc jockey Richard Neer's favorite Springsteen song, and when famed New York station WNEW-FM finally gave up on its rock format in 1999, \\"Racing in the Street\\" was the last song Neer played. Live performance history \\"Racing in the Street\\" was a regular feature of the set list during Springsteen's 1978 Darkness Tour. This began the practice of the band playing a much longer coda part after the lyrical section concluded. With the music almost gone, Weinberg would start tapping his drumstick, and the band would slowly begin a long instrumental build-up with Bittan's piano leading. Subsequently, guitars enter almost unheard, with soft, high-pitched figures adding overtones against the keyboard parts. Listening to it live and on bootleg recordings of radio broadcasts the following year, writer Greil Marcus said the performance of \\"Racing in the Street\\" following the tour's famed elongated presentation of \\"Prove It All Night\\" had captivated his attention and was \\"the only music I've felt scared to play, and scared not to.\\" The 1978 performances of the song typically segued into \\"Thunder Road\\". The song was also a regular during the 1980‚Äì1981 River Tour. Now the song was a standalone piece, typically eight minutes in length, with a coda that neither faded out like the studio recording or segued into another song, but rather built to a series of climaxes. A live version of the song from the tour, recorded in 1981 at Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey, was included on the 1986 box set Live/1975‚Äì85. Rolling Stone noted that in concert the song \\"draws its power from a deeper well, palpably accelerating with pensive desperation as Danny Federici's sorrowful organ clouds over Roy Bittan's ballerina piano figure.\\" During the 1984‚Äì1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \\"Racing in the Street\\" was first in set list rotation with \\"Backstreets\\". Then, once \\"Rosalita\\" was dropped as the standard second-half main set closer, \\"Racing in the Street\\" often served in its stead for a while,Marsh, Glory Days (1987), pp. 189, 276. although by the 1985 U.S. stadium leg it was gone. During its time as a set closer, Springsteen began telling a softly spoken story about a summer romance gone bad, set against a wistful synthesizer backdrop by Bittan. Then the song was played, but the coda's ending was routed into Springsteen telling the conclusion of the story, with the couple packing their bags and leaving for an unknown destination, after which Springsteen walked off the stage while the coda resumed for one time around. This version was not included on the Live/1975‚Äì85 set because it had not been performed during any of the shows that were professionally recorded.Marsh, Glory Days (1987), p. 415. The song virtually disappeared from Springsteen's concert repertoire in the following years, appearing just a few times on the 1995‚Äì1997 solo Ghost of Tom Joad Tour played on acoustic guitar (and usually accompanied by future E Street Band violinist Soozie Tyrell). Beginning in 1999 with the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour and the subsequent 2000s tours in the Reunion Era, \\"Racing in the Street\\" appeared intermittently, often rotating with \\"Backstreets\\", \\"Jungleland\\", and similarly long, intense songs in a late-in- main-set \\"epic\\" slot. These versions were often nine minutes long, with audiences cheering in anticipation of the coda. Tyrell's violin and sometimes Clarence Clemons' baritone sax were added to the mix, but the lead was still Bittan, playing coda sequences up to several crescendos, before playing a minor-key line that signalled the conclusion. During the final Vote for Change concert in 2004, \\"Racing in the Street\\" was performed by Springsteen and the band with Jackson Browne sharing the vocals. Springsteen played it a number of times on solo piano during his 2005 Devils & Dust Tour. It returned in its full-band incarnation on subsequent tours beginning in 2007, including a lengthy 2009 version which appears on the DVD London Calling: Live in Hyde Park. Alternate 1978 version Springsteen released his own alternate version, \\"Racing in the Street '78\\", on The Promise, his 2010 double CD and triple LP of outtakes from Darkness on the Edge of Town. Recorded in late November-Early December 1977, almost three months after the Darkness version had been completed, it had circulated for years on bootlegs. For the Promise version, David Lindley's violin was overdubbed in 2010; the rest of the recording was vintage 1977, including Springsteen's vocal. This version has slightly different lyrics and a more uptempo, anthemic arrangement than the album version. In the opening verse, the protagonist's car is a 1932 Ford instead of a 1969 Chevy. In the final verse, the woman's \\"pretty dress\\" is torn, not her \\"pretty dreams\\". This version has been performed a few times live since its release, albeit usually with the original lyrics. Cover versions  \\"Racing in the Street\\" has been covered by several artists, including a countrified version by Townes Van Zandt from his 1993 album Roadsongs. Other artists who have covered the song include Emmylou Harris on her 1982 live album Last Date and Queen's Roger Taylor on his 1984 solo album Strange Frontier. Serena Ryder recorded it in 2009 for use on Springsteen's website, and in the same year, Charlie Robison included the song on his album Beautiful Day and a version by The Wave Pictures was used as the opening selection on the Springsteen tribute album Play Some Pool, Skip Some School, Act Real Cool. In 2010, Justin Townes Earle recorded it as the B-side to the digital single \\"Christchurch Woman\\".

It was upgraded to National Route 48 in 1963 and National Route 110 was abolished. The Sendai Nishi Road, billed as the \\"Land Gateway to Sendai\\", that links central Sendai to Sendai-Miyagi Interchange on the T≈çhoku Expressway was partially opened in 1983 and fully opened in 1987 after construction was completed on a series of tunnels. It replaced the original, congested two-lane section of National Route 48 along the Hirose River. The road along the river was redesignated as Miyagi Prefecture Route 31 after the completion of the Sendai Nishi Road.

Geology  The bed of Snowy River is covered with bright white calcite. Over time, ancient, slow moving ground water dissolved the limestone walls of the cave and, with the help of microorganisms, recrystallized limestone into the white-colored mineral. Since prehistoric times, ground water saturated with dissolved calcite has periodically flooded the cave, followed by extended periods of dryness, leaving behind coatings and deposits. Fort Stanton Cave, now including the Snowy River Passage, contains the fourth largest cave footprint (the area within a convex polygon that encloses the known cave passages) in the USA. The Bureau of Land Management reports that Snowy River may be the largest continuous cave formation in America.  Hydrology  Discovered in 2001, Snowy River is a section of a much larger cave complex. Researchers and explorers have not yet determined how the formations relate to the geology and hydrology. After visits to the dry riverbed in 2001, 2003 and 2005, explorers were surprised to find Snowy River flowing with water in 2007 and also in 2010 after a heavy winter snowfall. In 2014, cave surveys reached points as far as 12 miles (19.3 km) from daylight from the cave's single entrance. In August 2014, Snowy River again started flowing and continued to flow for the next three years, severely limiting exploration far upstream past Midnight Junction where a camping area had been established. With surveyed passage reaching 31.59 miles (50.84 km) in 2017, this cave is the third longest cave in New Mexico. At 11 miles, Snowy River is the world's longest calcite formation. The non-profit [1] group has a long history of work in the cave, and in 2017 published a new book 12 Miles From Daylight with over 300 pages and 350 photographs and maps, featuring explorations from 1855 to the present.  Biology  From crusts on the cave walls, antibiotic-producing actinobacteria and some 36 strains of manganese- using bacteria have been discovered. New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology says the organisms live in this isolated environment by chemically breaking down manganese compounds,New Mexico Institute of Mining and TechnologyDr. Penny Boston, New Mexico Tech creating reconstituted mineral byproducts in the process that may have pharmaceutical uses. Scientists anticipate new biological as well as geologic discoveries will be found.

From here it begins its journey south through the city. Within the urbanized parts of the city it is known as Kank≈ç Dori (Tourism Road). After passing by the headquarters of Michinoku Bank, the highway crosses over the Aoimori Railway Line. It then travels through a heavily commercialized area of the city before reaching an intersection with the Aomori Belt Highway (National Route 7) and the Aomori Expressway. Route 7 serves as a frontage road to the expressway and as an eventual access point to it at Aomori-ch≈´≈ç Interchange. The Hakk≈çda Gold Line snow corridor near Sukayu Onsen. Continuing out of the commercial area, the highway passes Aomori Chuo Gakuin University. After passing the institution the road divides with the western route serving as a bypass to the main highway to the east. At this point the highway is known as the Hakk≈çda Gold Line. After passing through a residential area, the main highway and bypass begin the ascent of the Hakk≈çda Mountains. The highways merge near Aomori Public University, now known solely as the Hakk≈çda Gold Line. Continuing its ascent up the mountain, the route meets Aomori Prefecture Route 40, a route that provides access to the nearby memorial of the Hakk≈çda Mountains incident and then travels southeast to Towada, Aomori. Route 103 winds its way up the mountain where it reaches the Hakk≈çda Ropeway, a cable car that takes skiers and hikers to the peak of Mount Tamoyachi of the Hakk≈çda Mountains. After a short descent, the road meets Japan National Route 394 at a signaled intersection. Just a couple of kilometers from here is Sukayu Onsen, the snowiest inhabited place on earth famous for its 1,000 person mixed-use bath.

Shulman (23 February 1924 in Ptich, Homiel Voblast ‚Äì 4 February 2007 in Minsk, Belarus) was a Belarusian hydrodynamics scientist, former chief research worker of the state research institute A. V. Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, and a doctor of technical sciences. Early life and education Born in Ptich, Shulman spent his childhood in a small township near the Ptich railway station in Gomel Province. Later, his family moved to Gomel, where attended high school in preparation for tertiary studies. When the Second World War broke out, like several of his fellow male students, Shulman joined to defend his country. His bravery, courage, and valour were marked with high battle service decorations, including the Order of Glory and Order of the Patriotic War. In 1947, after his military discharge and without passing high-school equivalency exams, Shulman matriculated to the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, where he was taught by the physicist Abram Ioffe. Career As an engineer in aerohydrodynamics, Shulman worked on an assignment at a major industrial design office in the city of Syzran where he worked to create new equipment products. While working as part of a large team, Shulman took an active part in scientific innovation. He organized several scientific cells at the plant, published his first research paper in the journal Energomachinostroyeniye and made inventions. One of his early proposals was of quite fundamental nature: a split wheel for a water turbine. In 1957, Shulman returned to his native Belarus, where he was employed by the Institute of Power Engineering of the BSSR Academy of Sciences. There he continued his scientific development, acquiring, accumulating and, what is more important, creating new knowledge. In 1963, a new scientific school investigation of the flow and heat and mass transfer in rheologically complex media began to develop at the Heat and Mass Transfer Institute (HMTI)] on the initiative of academician A. V. Luikov, member of the BSSR Academy of Sciences, and Shulman. As early as 1966 the pioneering monograph Boundary layer of Non-Newtonian Fluids by Shulman and Berkovsky was published. In it, the authors generalized their own theoretical developments and descriptions of convective processes of heat and momentum transfer in external flow of nonlinear-viscous fluids past bodies of various geometry. Subsequent results of the new theoretical and experimental investigations were reflected in Shulman‚Äôs work Convective Heat and Mass Transfer of Rheologically Complex Fluids (Moscow: Energia, 1975) and in a large series of publications for the Rheophysics Laboratory in authoritative domestic and foreign publications. The monograph gave an explanation of the phenomenon discovered by Luikov, Shulman and Puris. During the same years, Puris and Shulman discovered rubber mechanical behavior of gases in high- intensity rotating flows with considerable rates of shear deformations in the interdisk gap with eccentricity. The generalized law of nonlinear-viscous flow (1966) formulated by Shulman and his followers is widely used in the scientific world. Based on this law, six monographs have been written and various investigations have been actively conducted. A fundamental study of the electric rheological effect (ERE) was started in 1966 and that of the magnetic rheological effect (MRE) began the following year. The results led to new theories and also to more than 170 engineering applications: among them robots, manipulators, machine-tools, electro-acoustic equipment and micromachines. A large series of investigations on the said subject is reflected in articles, papers and monographs written personally or in co- authorship. In the years before his death, Shulman worked a lot and achieved success in the field of biomedical problems and, in particular, the rheology of blood. This included the description and modeling of thermal processes in controlled hyperthermia and hypothermia and also in photodynamic therapy. Honours Honored worker of science of the Republic of Belarus, Shulman is considered a pioneer in ERE and MRE. In 1982, based on the results of the all- union contest, he was mentioned among the five best inventors of the USSR. In 1997 he was awarded the annual G. V. Vinogradov Prize of the Rheological Society of the C.I.S. He was honored as a scientist and awarded decorations by foreign universities (Sheffield, Warsaw, Seoul, and Krakow). Twenty-nine doctoral dissertations and those of 108 candidates have been prepared under his supervision.

Career Born in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Mooney was a junior winger for Wauchope. He joined South Sydney in 1972. He played three seasons with the Rabbitohs before joining Manly-Warringah in 1975. At the end of the 1976 NSWRFL season Mooney played in Manly's Grand Final-winning side which defeated Parramatta 13-10. He was also the 1976 season's top try-scorer, equal with teammate and Manly's captain Bob Fulton with both scoring 18 tries in the regular season, though Fulton would score another 3 tries in the finals series. Mooney scored a try in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Grand Final against Cronulla-Sutherland, which was drawn 11-all and had to be re-played just three days later.

A graduate certificate can be awarded by universities upon completion of certain coursework indicating mastering of a specific subject area. Graduate certificates represent training at different levels in different countries and can be at bachelor's degree or master's degree level. UK A graduate certificate (GradCert, GCert, GradC) is a higher education qualification at the same level as a bachelor's degree but more limited in scope, taking less time to complete - normally between one third and two thirds of an academic year (or full-time equivalent). A longer period of work (but still less than required for a degree) would lead to a graduate diploma. The graduate certificate is positioned at Level 6 (bachelor's degree level) of The framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and at Level 9 or 10 (bachelor's degree at ordinary or honours level) of The framework for qualifications of higher education institutions in Scotland. In reference to the European Qualifications Framework, it is a 'first-cycle' qualification at the same level of knowledge and challenge as a first or bachelor's degree but without the same depth and breadth of study. Successful students will typically demonstrate some, but not all, of the kinds of skills, knowledge and capabilities that would be expected for a Bachelor's candidate. Hence this certificate is not considered to be an 'end-of-cycle' qualification (it demonstrates only some of the 'first-cycle' learning outcomes). Graduate certificates are available in a limited range of subjects that are typically work-related, for example psychology, management, counselling or law. Graduate certificates are normally taken by those who have already graduated with a bachelor's degree in another discipline (hence the name). This qualification should not be confused with postgraduate certificates or postgraduate diplomas, which are master's degree-level qualification, or with certificates of Higher Education, which are lower-level qualifications normally taken by those without previous HE qualification. Ireland A Graduate Certificate (GradCert) is a master's-level qualification indicating the successful completion of a postgraduate programme of education. The minimum entrance requirement is an undergraduate degree. On the National Framework for Qualifications the qualification is at Level 9 or Level 7 on the European Qualifications Framework. Singapore In support of the SkillsFuture movement, the has launched a graduate certificate programme (GradCert). This is a higher education qualification at an equivalent level to a bachelor's degree but more limited in scope, taking less time to complete. The graduate certificates is designed with working professionals in mind, helping these learners acquire knowledge and skills essential for their workplace. SMU Academy the professional training arm of Singapore Management University has launched \\"Bite Sized Credit Bearing\\" modules that can be combined towards earning a graduate certificate and subsequently a master's degree. The National University of Singapore, Institute of Systems Science appointed for National Continuing Education & Training (CET) Institute (NCI) for the National Infocomm Competency Framework (NICF) by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) also launches its Stackable Certificate Programmes that provide alternative pathway for continuing education. The series consist of certificates that can be stacked towards earning a graduate certificate and subsequently the graduate diploma or a master's degree. Canada In Canada, a graduate certificate is a university credential usually offered to students who have completed an average of 15 credits of . Admission requirements vary tremendously among Canadian universities, but in general both graduate students, as well as undergraduate students having completed a Bachelor's degree, can apply to such a program. In some cases, the graduate certificate can represent part of the coursework required for obtaining a Master's degree. United States In the United States, a graduate certificate can be awarded by universities upon completion of certain coursework indicating mastering of a specific subject area. Graduate certificates represent training at the Master's degree or doctoral level, generally consisting of 12 to 18 semester units of coursework. An accredited bachelor's degree in a related field is a standard prerequisite for entry into a graduate certificate program. In some cases, the graduate certificate can represent part of the coursework required for obtaining a Master's degree or Doctorate. In teaching, holding a graduate certificate may satisfy program specific education requirements not met with some interdisciplinary degrees. Australia In Australia, a Graduate Certificate is a Level 8 qualification alongside the Bachelor (Honours) degree. Entry to a Graduate Certificate typically requires completion of a bachelor's degree or higher. In some cases, admission may be on the basis of significant work experience. Graduate Certificates typically take six months of full-time study to complete. These courses are usually delivered by universities and private providers.

Gates, first published in 1931. The inventory of glyphs used in Gates' analysis was compiled and drawn from the Madrid, Dresden and Paris codices, rather than from monumental inscriptions and stelae. It was published at a time when the Maya script remained wholly undeciphered and the type of writing system the script represented was unknown and much debated among Mayanists. Gates' work represented one of the major attempts in this pre-decipherment era of Mayanist scholarship to catalogue and analyse Maya glyphs as a prelude to uncovering their meaning. In comprehensiveness it was later superseded by G√ºnther Zimmermann's Die Hieroglyphen der Maya-Handschriften (1956), and then in particular by J. Eric S. Thompson's A Catalogue of Maya Hieroglyphs (1962), which became established as the de facto standard catalogue and analysis of its day. Once it was realised in the latter half of the 20th century that the Maya script was largely logosyllabic in nature, Mayanist epigraphers beginning with Yuri Knorozov began a process of breakthroughs in the script's decipherment. Other key contributions and realisations--such as establishing that the stelae texts recorded actual history and real personages and events-- led to the decipherment of a significant number of glyphs and texts, particularly from the 1970s onwards. While many of the interpretations put forward in the early catalogues by Gates et al. have been made redundant by the modern knowledge of the script, catalogues such as Gates' have retained their significance and utility as references and records--particularly for calendrical and astronomical data and interpretation. The original edition was limited to 207 copies. The book was subsequently reprinted by Dover in 1978, and by Kessinger in 2003. 1931 non-fiction books Maya script Mesoamerican studies books English bilingual dictionaries Johns Hopkins University Press books ","title":"An Outline Dictionary of Maya Glyphs"},{"id":"18569257","text":"Gardens of Maayan Baruch Ma'ayan Baruch (, lit. Blessed Spring) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located near the intersection of the Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese border, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In 2014 it had a population of 720. History The kibbutz was founded in March 1947 on the land of Hamara, a moshav abandoned in 1920. The founders were members of other kvutzot who had met in Kfar Giladi; members of the HaTenua HaMeuhedet youth movement, members of Habonim who immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine as Ma'apilim (illegal immigrants of Aliyah Bet), and members of a garin of pioneering soldiers from South Africa who fought in the British Army during World War II. After the 1948 Palestine war, Ma'ayan Baruch took over part of the land belonging to the newly depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Sanbariyya. Development projects A new neighborhood in Ma'ayan Baruch was built to attract newcomers and bring money into the kibbutz coffers in the wake of the socio-economic problems that have affected many kibbutzim since the 1980s. The newcomers are from other kibbutzim and townships in the region, as well as other parts of the country.Depression in Margaliot, Hope in Maayan Baruch Haaretz, 11 July 2008 Landmarks A museum which holds a collection of prehistoric artifacts found in the Hula Valley, The Prehistoric Man Museum, is located on the kibbutz.

Since 1959 he cooperated closely with Czech conductor Libor Pe≈°ek and with Chamber Philharmony. However, after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Klus√°k was condemned as a \\"politically undesirable\\" person (he composed music for prohibited films). During the normalization Klus√°k was engaged in the J√°ra Cimrman Theatre, but he was forced to leave in 1975. In the 1980s Klus√°k focused more on vocal compositions. He began to compose song cycles, cantatas, and wrote an opera.Vyslou≈æil, p. 257 Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, he began to participate in public life again, and worked as a member and director of various cultural institutions in the Czech republic.

It focuses on brothers Sam and Dean Winchester as they track down their father, John, who is on the trail of the demon who killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend. During their travels, they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family business‚Äîsaving people and hunting supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles star as Sam and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring as their father, John, and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only season to air on The WB, with all subsequent seasons airing on The CW, a joint venture of The WB and UPN. As of 2019, Supernatural is also the only continuing series that originated on The WB, and by far the longest running show ever to have aired on that network with over 300 episodes produced. The first sixteen episodes of the season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm ET in the United States, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays. Overall, the season averaged about 3.81 million American viewers. The season gained many award nominations, among them two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the pilot episode. While some critics did not like the mostly anthology-like format, others praised the show for the emotional moments and noted the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors. The season was internationally syndicated, airing in the United Kingdom on ITV, in Canada on Citytv, and in Australia on Network Ten. The first season was released on DVD as a six-disc box set on September 5, 2006, by Warner Home Video in Region 1. Although the season was split into two separate releases in Region 2, the complete set was released on October 2, 2006, and in Region 4 on October 2, 2007. The episodes are also available through digital retailers such as Apple's iTunes Store, Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace, and Amazon.com's on-demand TV service. Cast=Starring= * Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester * Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester =Guest stars= Episodes  In this table, the number in the first column refers to the episode's number within the entire series, whereas the number in the second column indicates the episode's number within this particular season. \\"U.S. viewers in millions\\" refers to how many Americans watched the episode live or on the day of broadcast. Production=Writing= The first season's mythology mainly follows Sam and Dean's search for their missing father. Series creator Eric Kripke summarized this storyline as merely \\"find Dad\\", which he deemed \\"simple\\", \\"emotional\\", and \\"clean\\". However, he found the self-enclosed episodes‚Äîindependent stories which attain closure at the end of each episode and add little to the overarching storylines‚Äîto be \\"hit and miss\\". Because the first ten episodes consist of self-enclosed stories, the series mythology does not begin until the eleventh episode, \\"Scarecrow\\". This episode introduces the demon Meg Masters, which executive producer Kim Manners felt was \\"desperately needed\\".Knight, p. 66 Though uncertain at exactly what direction to take the character, the writers intended Meg to be an antagonist for the Winchesters throughout her story arc.Knight, p. 140 The series mythology further expands with the addition of the demon-killing Colt handgun near the season's end, lending to the \\"modern American Western\\" theme the producers were going for. Although the weekly adversaries for the Winchesters were often based on urban legends, the writers tried to put their own spin on the stories for each of the episodes. For example, Kripke combined the well- known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot.Knight, p. 26 The episode \\"Hook Man\\", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided for the purposes of the show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest star‚Äîshe wears a cross made from his melted hook.Knight, p. 54 Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that Supernaturals vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangs‚Äîthese were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharks‚Äîas well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.Knight, p. 109 Other aspects grew out of basic concepts or ideas. For the episode \\"Skin\\", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change into one of the lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder at the end of the episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was \\"a great layer to add\\", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in \\"The Benders\\", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons.Knight, p. 43 Another element that would influence future episodes came about in \\"Hook Man\\" when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the \\"perfect combination of occult element\\", as it brought together a \\"folkloric repellent of evil\\" with the \\"blue-collar aspect of shotguns\\".Knight, p. 47 The episode \\"Asylum\\" later established iron as another weapon against ghosts.Knight, p. 63 \\"Faith\\", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, \\"[Layla's] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it.\\"Knight, p. 71 Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create \\"scary\\" sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaper‚Äîhooded and carrying a sickle‚Äîto be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as \\"the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine\\".Knight, p. 94 Although the villain of the episode \\"Hell House\\" has supernatural origins, the basis of the story came from a situation writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. The children would often go there to scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost.Knight, p. 95 The human antagonists of \\"The Benders\\", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before.Knight, p. 82 For \\"Nightmare\\", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in deciding how to end the episode. The writers eventually decided to have him kill himself to prevent him from doing more harm.Knight, p. 81 Starting off on the series, Kripke excluded vampires due to their affiliation to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He wanted Supernatural to have its own identity, but became more comfortable with it over time. The writers intended for the vampire-episode \\"Dead Man's Blood\\" to be a self-enclosed episode, but Kripke's introduction of the Colt tied it to the final two episodes of the season.Knight, pp. 104‚Äì05 This addition pleased the writers of the penultimate episode \\"Salvation\\" because the Colt gave the brothers a way to fight Meg and also provided a reason for her to kill the Winchesters' friends.Knight, p. 111 Gamble and Tucker crafted the latter storyline because they felt Kripke would only allow their inclusion if they died. When the writers could not come up with something for the Winchesters to be doing while Meg is on the loose, they split the episode into two stories; John would go after Meg while the brothers protect another family from Azazel. Tucker felt that this opened \\"all this emotional stuff with the guys\\", as well as \\"brought back all the themes of the show and tied the season up into a nice big bow\\".Knight, p. 110 Similarly, Kripke believed that the revelation of John being possessed by Azazel in \\"Devil's Trap\\" had to be, as it completed the two main storylines of the season‚Äîfinding their father and tracking down the demon‚Äîat the same time, but had them find both characters in one body.Knight, p. 119 =Influences by popular culture= While supernatural and urban legends inspired many episodes, some storyline aspects were influenced by popular culture. The inspiration for the wendigo's appearance in \\"Wendigo\\" came from the creature featured in the music video for the Aphex Twin song \\"Come to Daddy\\". Human features were added to the design due to the wendigo's human origins, and the creature was given the ability to mimic human voices to create a \\"creepy effect\\".Knight, p. 27 However, Kripke was not pleased with the final appearance of the wendigo, deeming him as \\"Gollum's tall, gangly cousin\\". Because of this, the creature is not seen throughout most of the episode.Knight, pp. 23‚Äì24 For shapeshifting scenes in the episode \\"Skin\\", Kripke chose to base the transformation on that of An American Werewolf in London, using prosthetics and makeup rather than computer-generated imagery.Knight, p. 45 The Rings Samara influenced the titular villain in \\"Bloody Mary\\", though Kripke felt that she ended up looking too similar to the character due to her grisly appearance and the use of speed ramping to create a time-manipulation effect. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden, on the other hand, believes it was more of an homage. =Filming= Though the pilot was shot in Los Angeles, principal filming for the rest of the season took place in Vancouver, British Columbia.Knight, p. 14 Local sites often served as shooting locations, with much of \\"Dead in the Water\\" taking place at Buntzen Lake and the climax of \\"Wendigo\\" occurring in a Britannia Beach mine.Knight, p. 28Knight, p. 25 Likewise, Riverview Hospital functioned as a mental institution in \\"Asylum\\".Knight, p. 60 Though production has sometimes recycled sets from other television series‚Äî\\"The Benders\\" made use of a previously-built Western town,Knight, p. 85 while the warehouse-loft set of \\"Shadow\\" originated from the series Tru CallingKnight, p. 86‚Äîmost episodes usually require the construction of new sets due to the constant change of setting.Knight, p. 150 The production team, however, created reusable standing sets in the form of the motel rooms frequented by the Winchesters. Each episode presents a different theme to disguise the motel-room set's repeated use, with different colors, bedspreads, and curtains being used. The episode \\"Provenance\\", for instance, displayed a disco-themed motel room.Knight, p. 103 =Music= The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode,Knight, p. 147 with about a third of each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend. For example, off-angle shots in \\"Dead in the Water\\" are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes. As well, spoken words such as \\"water\\" and \\"die\\" are followed by a lower pitch because Lennertz felt it created a \\"gurgly\\" water sound. An electric cello and woodwinds helped to create a big emotional tone in the episode \\"Home\\", with Lennertz feeling that the final cue \\"became a very cinematic musical moment\\".Knight, p. 59 To fit in with the episode's ambiance in \\"Asylum\\", Gruska made the music very subtle; Lennertz felt that it was \\"creepy-crawly\\" like \\"a snake sneaking along the ground\\".Knight, p. 61 Conversely, Lennertz matched the theme of traveling evangelists in \\"Faith\\" by using a small 76-key piano that was damaged and slightly out of tune. He attached small items such as coins and paper clips to the keys to create a rattling noise, making the piano seem \\"old and crappy\\". Lennertz then played \\"bluesy gospel music\\" during the sermon scenes involving the Reapers. Because he felt that there was also a \\"snake-oil salesman vibe\\" to the episode, he included an Armenian duduk due to its association with snake charming.Knight, p. 73 The score of \\"Hell House\\", on the other hand, had a much lighter tone to coincide with the episode's humor. For example, music for the scenes involving the \\"professional\\" ghost hunters used percussion instruments to slightly mimic the Mission: Impossible theme. However, recurring characters often have certain musical themes attached to them. For the pilot episode, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a \\"really nasty\\"-sounding echo effect for the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon Azazel.Knight, p. 21 Lennertz returns to this in \\"Nightmare\\", including it when Sam realizes the connection he shares with the demon and Max.Knight, p. 78 The episode \\"Dead in the Water\\" was the first to use what Kripke feels is the \\"Winchester emotion\\", which involves sorrowful and reverberating piano notes on top of strings. It plays when the brothers make connections with other characters. As well, there are variants of a guitar line used as the \\"humorous brothers' theme\\" in many episodes, including \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Hell House\\", when the brothers are having fun.Knight, pp. 91‚Äì92 With Gruska writing Meg Masters' theme for \\"Scarecrow\\", Lennertz reused the music in \\"Shadow\\" but \\"took the scary up a notch\\" to imply to the viewers that she is both \\"more important and more devilish\\" than the other creatures in the episode.Knight, p. 89 For the penultimate episode \\"Salvation\\", Lennertz incorporated musical elements used throughout the season.Knight, p. 113 In addition to the score, the series makes use of rock songs, with most being selected from Kripke's private collection. Among the many bands featured in the first season are AC/DC, Blue √ñyster Cult, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bad Company. Rock songs are also usually featured in \\"The Road So Far\\" montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events. This was first done with the episode \\"Salvation\\", in which the entire season was recapped to Kansas' \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", with the subsequent episode‚Äîthe season finale‚Äîusing Triumph's \\"Fight the Good Fight\\". =Effects= CGI was found to be more practical.Knight, pp. 30‚Äì31 To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. While various companies were contracted for the Los Angeles-based production of the pilot episode, subsequent episodes being filmed in Vancouver required a new crew to be hired. The company Entity FX performed the visual effects for the pilot episode, with Ivan Hayden taking over as visual effects supervisor for the rest of the season.Knight, p. 144 The crew was required to design all of the external airplane shots in \\"Phantom Traveler\\" from scratch using computer-generated imagery (CGI).Knight, p. 34 As well, they created a time-manipulation effect for the titular villain in \\"Bloody Mary\\" by altering the capture frame rate of the camera.Knight, p. 37 Randy Shymkiw acted as special effects supervisor, and the department found the episode \\"Asylum\\" to be quite a challenge because one scene has the vengeful spirit collapse into dust. They made casts of the character's torso and hands, and had to find the perfect mixture in order to have the casts remain solid but disintegrate when needed.Knight, pp. 60‚Äì61 The visual and special effects departments often overlap, such as in Mary Winchester's death scene in the pilot episode. Because the character is pinned to the ceiling and burned to death, actress Samantha Smith was required to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a papier-m√¢ch√© body was ignited on a fake ceiling.Knight, p. 20 When the burning of the titular creature in the episode \\"Wendigo\\" was not sufficient using special effects, a wire-frame mannequin wrapped in steel wool was then burned, with the scene being composited into the original footage to draw out the wendigo's death. To make it appear that the Hook Man is invisible as he scrapes his hook along the wall for one of the scenes in \\"Hook Man\\", a wire was placed inside plaster walls and then pulled out; the wire later was digitally removed in post- production.Knight, p. 48 In the episode \\"Bugs\\", the cast had to be sealed in a small area with hundreds of bees, and were stung despite wearing special costumes with cuffs sewn into their sleeves and pants.Knight, pp. 50‚Äì51 However, the bees did not show up well on camera, so most of them that appear in the final version were added with CGI.Knight, pp. 52‚Äì53 In addition to the digital effects, the series also features stuntwork. Lou Bollo took over as stunt coordinator after the pilot episode,Knight, p. 41 and big scenes often involved the actors, though stunt doubles were used for certain moments. For the final lake scene in \\"Dead in the Water\\", in which Dean must save a boy after he is pulled underwater by a vengeful spirit, Jensen Ackles had to hold onto the young actor as they were pulled down ten feet into the water by divers.Knight, p. 29 The actor portraying the vengeful spirit had to wear a wetsuit under his costume due to the extended period of time he was required to spend in the lake.Knight, p. 30 Ackles and Jared Padalecki performed most of the fight scene featured in \\"Skin\\", and only took four hours to learn the fight choreography. However, stunt doubles were brought in for the scenes in which they are thrown into bookshelves and through a coffee table.Knight, pp. 42‚Äì43 For the episode \\"Shadow\\", rather than filming at the exterior location for the scene of Meg Masters being thrown out of a window to the street below, it was decided to not depict the impact, instead having the Winchesters look down at her body after the landing. Thus, filming of it was allowed to take place in the studio using a body double.Knight, pp. 88‚Äì89 Throughout filming, various scenes make use of all three effects departments. For scenes involving the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in \\"Home\\", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith stood in front of a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production.Knight, pp. 56‚Äì57 Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale \\"Devil's Trap\\". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them.Knight, p. 121 For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look \\"pretty real\\".Knight, pp. 121‚Äì22 Reception After the first four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18‚Äì34 and 12‚Äì34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18‚Äì49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls. Supernatural's first season averaged about 3.81 million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series. On Metacritic, the season scored 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 87% approval rating with an average rating of 7.32/10 based on 31 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, Supernatural's vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares.\\" Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B, saying the show \\"comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series\\", but that \\"Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack\\". Tom Gliatto of People Weekly ranked the show at number five on his list of the Best TV Shows of 2005. Peter Schorn of IGN gave the season a score of 7 out of 10. While he found the self-enclosed episodes to be \\"passably entertaining\\", he enjoyed the story arcs introduced later in the season. Schorn also deemed the \\"stormy relationship between Sam and his father\\" to be \\"compelling\\", and noted that the lead stars have \\"good chemistry together\\". Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that while the season had its \\"share of emotional moments\\", it also \\"[scared] the pants off\\" of viewers \\"surprisingly well\\". He also believed that it did a good job at balancing mythology episodes with self-enclosed ones, comparing it to the early seasons of The X-Files. However, Eric Neigher of Slant Magazine highly criticized the self-enclosed episodes for being \\"almost totally linear, without any B- or C-stories\\", and felt that the episodes were mainly \\"watered- down rehashes of classic weird fiction or popular urban legends\\". Work on the pilot episode garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations in 2006, composer Christopher Lennertz being nominated in the category of \\"Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)\\" and the sound editors receiving a nomination for \\"Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series\\". The pilot episode also brought in a nomination for a Golden Reel Award in the category of \\"Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form ‚Äì Sound Effects and Foley\\", with work on the episode \\"Salvation\\" gaining the same nomination in 2007. Additionally, the season was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category of \\"Best Network Television Series\\". For the Teen Choice Awards, the series was nominated for \\"TV ‚Äì Choice Breakout Show\\" and Jensen Ackles for \\"TV ‚Äì Choice Breakout Star\\". Home media release The first season of Supernatural was released as a six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on September 5, 2006, three weeks before the premiere of the second season. The cover art incorporated a stylized shot of the Winchester brothers in front of their car. Including all 22 episodes of the first season, the set also featured DVD extras such as episode commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, featurettes, and a DVD-ROM sneak-peek at the second season. The season was ranked No. 14 in DVD sales for its week of release, and slipped to No. 28 the following week, with cumulative sales during those two weeks coming to 150,376 sets for $5,264,942. The set was later packaged with the first season of Smallville as a \\"Season One Starter Pack\\", which was released on September 18, 2007. For Region 2, the season was split into two parts, being released on May 22, 2006, and August 21, 2006; the complete set was released on October 2, 2006. The season was also released in Region 4 on September 6, 2006, though the special features were removed. A \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" was later released on October 2, 2007, with the extras restored. The first season was released on Region A Blu- ray Disc on June 15, 2010, including new special features‚Äì\\"The Devil's Road Map\\", an interactive guide featuring interviews about every episode and a Paley Festival panel discussion featuring the cast and crew.

He prepared the definitive survey of the North and South Carolina Colonies prior to the start of the American Revolutionary War. He served as an Officer of the Continental Line and as a Militia Officer in Francis Marion‚Äôs Brigade, where he distinguished himself in the Battle of Black Mingo. Early life Mouzon‚Äô s family was of French Huguenot ancestry. His parents were William Henry Mouzon, I (born 1713) and Anne Videau. The family immigrated to Mouzon, South Carolina which is located in present-day Williamsburg County. Their son William Henry II was born on May 18, 1741 at the Mouzon Plantation.http://south-carolina-plantations.com/williamsburg/mouzon.html William Henry II spoke fluent French. Following his father‚Äôs death in 1749, eight-year-old Henry II was sent to France to further his education. The Mouzon Map Mouzon subsequently graduated from the Sorbonne as a civil engineer and surveyor of the first rank. He received his first important public commission in 1771, when he and Ephraim Mitchell were appointed by Governor Lord Charles Grevill Montague to survey the boundaries of the civil districts of South Carolina. In May 1774, Mouzon advertised a proposal for a new map of South Carolina with corrections to the two extant maps of the Colony (James Cook‚Äôs 1771 A Map of South Carolina with all the islands, marshes... and Cook's 1773 A Map of the Province of South Carolina, with all the rivers...). When Mouzon's map was published in May 1775 by Sayer and Bennett, it also included North Carolina, likely a decision by the publishers in anticipation of their 1776 American Atlas. Mouzon‚Äôs map became an important military asset for those fighting in the Southern theater of operations during the American Revolutionary War. The copy of the Mouzon map carried by George Washington is preserved at the American Geographical Society Library in Milwaukee, WI.http://collections.lib.uwm.edu/cdm/ref/collection/agdm/id/2583 The copy of the Mouzon map carried by Sir Henry Clinton, the British Commander, is preserved at the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The Mouzon map remained the chief map of the region until the 1808 map of North Carolina by Price & Strother, and the 1822 map of South Carolina by John Wilson. Santee Canal The South Carolina Commons House of Assembly proposed a survey in 1770 to determine the most favorable routes for a canal to connect the Santee River with the Cooper River which would provide a direct outlet to Charleston Harbor. To this end, Henry Mouzon Jr. was commissioned in 1773 to survey routes for such an inland waterway. His five suggested routes were later abandoned Colonel Johann Christian Senf, However, Mouzon played a seminal role in the creation of America's first true canal system. Family life Mouzon married Susannah Taylor on January 10, 1769 at Black Mingo, South Carolina. Henry and Susannah were the parents of 10 children: Ann, Peter, William Henry III, Samuel Ruffin, Susannah Videau, Sarah Elizabeth, Mary Bonneau, Henry Videau, Edward, and James. Service in the Revolutionary War Mouzon‚Äôs life is closely connected to that of his first cousinBoddie, William W. Traditions of the Swamp Fox. and closest friend, General Francis Marion, the \\"Swamp Fox.\\" Francis and Mouzon served together as Lieutenants under Colonels Montgomery and Grant in the colonial campaigns against the Cherokee Indians. Mouzon was commissioned by the Continental Congress as a lieutenant in the Continental Army in 1777. He served in the Third South Carolina Regiment until the fall of Charleston, South Carolina to the British on May 12, 1780. Soon after the fall of Charleston, the British sent three armies from the city to establish garrisons of soldiers in every thickly-settled community in the province. In support of this effort, the Legion of Lieutenant Colonial Banastre Tarleton was sent from Georgetown, South Carolina to Camden, South Carolina by way of Kingstree. Tarleton burned Mouzon's plantation, reportedly because Mouzon was a French Huguenot; this marked the only action of Tarleton's in this campaign that Cornwallis approved.Boddie, William W. Traditions of the Swamp Fox: 71-2. Boddie cites Tarleton‚Äô s own memoirs in support of this passage. Following the destruction of the Mouzon Plantation on August 7, 1780, the citizens of Williamsburg sent Major James to Georgetown, South Carolina to inquire of the British Commander, Naval Captain Ardesoif, of the conditions of their parole. James was informed by Ardesoif that the paroled officers of Williamsburg would be expected to take up arms against their countrymen. James left the meeting in a great state of agitation and returned to Williamsburg, where a battalion was organized under Captain Mouzon and several others. Mouzon and two other men left to find Colonel Francis Marion and bring him to Williamsburg to command the battalion.Boddie, William W. Traditions of the Swamp Fox. On September 14, 1780, Marion's forces attacked those of Colonel Cumming Ball at the Battle of Black Mingo Creek. Mouzon was severely injured in this battle; his injuries would affect him for the rest of his life.Boddie, William W. Traditions of the Swamp Fox: 98-9.

Originally described from an isolated pygidium (the posterior body part or shield), the first complete articulated specimen of E. erbeni revealed the presence of extraordinarily tall eyes: Number of lenses has been estimated at 560 or 450 incomplete preservation accounting for the uncertainty. A lens count of 18 lenses per file is unusually high (twice that of closely related genus) and accounts for the height of the eye, as opposed to a noticeable increase in the size of the individual lenses. A recently found species (E. issoumourensis) has smaller eyes, with fewer files (33-35) and fewer lenses per file (13-14 max) than E. erbeni. E. erbeni eyes allow full 360 degree coverage in the horizontal plane and were high enough to allow the trilobite to see backwards over its thorax. The presence of eye shades, blocking glare from over head, validates the suggestion that (at least some) trilobites were diurnal and not nocturnal,  Distribution  * E. erbeni has been found in the latest Lower Devonian of Algeria (upper Emsian strata at Ougarta) and Morocco (Timrhanrhart Formation at section Foum Zguid III). * E. issoumourensis is known from the latest Lower Devonian or possibly earliest middle Devonian of Morocco (upper Emsian or lower Eifelian, Erbenochile bed, El Otfal Formation, Jbel Issoumour, near Alnif southeastern Morocco 30¬∞58'14.5 N - 05¬∞01'44.3W).  Description  Erbenochile issoumourensis, rear view, collected near Foum Zgid, Morocco, late Emsian, 45mm body lengthErbenochile is a trilobite with very large eyes, with 33‚Äì36 vertical rows of 13‚Äì19 lenses each. The lower edge of eye slightly overhangs the adjacent part of the free cheek. The most backward part of the glabella (or occipital ring), the rings of the thorax, and rings on the pygidium each have a prominent median spine. The thorax consists of 11 segments. The frontal band of each of the lateral parts of the thorax segments (in the so-called pleural region) are not adorned. The posterior bands have a row of distinct small spines. The large tailshield (or pygidium) has 11 pairs of spines along the edge, and one in the middle, and 10‚Äì11 pairs of well-defined segments. The frontal pleural bands of each segment on the pygidium is lower compared to the posterior pleural band, and lacks the small spines of the posterior pleural band. The posterior border of pygidium is longer medially than laterally.  Taxonomy  Erbenochile was originally designated as a subgenus to Odontochile, the type of the subfamily Odontochilinae, which was later synonymised with the subfamily Dalmanitinae. Morzadec promoted Erbenochile to full genus status and moved it to Asteropyginae, by virtue of having pygidial spines, a character unknown in Odontochilinae. Erbenochile also differs from all other Asteropyginid genera in a number of characters. The much larger number of segments of the pygidium, as expressed in the number of axial rings, pleural rib pairs and pygidial spines (23 versus 11, and in Gourdonia 13 spines) is most conspicuous. Also, the pygidial border has a smooth connection with the pygidial spines, while in the Asteropyginae the connection with the pygidial lappets have relief. Furthermore, in Erbenochile the split of the lateral glabellar furrow and the second and third transglabellar furrows (confusingly called S2 and S1) are very deep, comparable the situation in Dalmanitinae.

Background After their victory at the Battle of Pangal, the Loyalist forces, composed of approximately 2,400 guerrilla and Mapuche Allies under the command of Vicente Benavides, decided to attack and destroy the city of Los Angeles. This city was defended by around 400 line soldiers under the command of Marshal Pedro Andr√©s del Alc√°zar, and had already survived four attempts by the same enemy. At this juncture, Marshal del Alc√°zar received forged orders from General Ram√≥n Freire to evacuate the city and move his forces to reinforce Chill√°n and meet with the main Army that was operating out of Concepci√≥n. Marshal del Alc√°zar, ignorant of the defeat suffered by the Patriot army at Pangal decided to evacuate the city, taking with him all the inhabitants, who otherwise would have been massacred by the guerrillas. He left the city on the 25th at the head of the Cazadores de Coquimbo battalion, 50 artillery troops, approximately 150 friendly Mapuche allies and about a thousand civilians, with their properties and animals. The long train made for a very slow speed. The battle As he was crossing the Laja River at the Tarpellanca ford, early on the morning of the 26th, the column was attacked by the troops of Benavides at the point where the river branched into two inlets leaving an islet in the middle. Marshal del Alc√°zar and almost all of his column were trapped there at the islet. A defense was hastily organized by making a circle out of the carts, but after 13 hours of battle, just as night was falling, the patriots started to run out of ammunition. In order to try to save the many civilians that were traveling with his column, he decided to negotiate with Benavides. The Patriots surrendered in exchange for their lives and free passage for all the civilians, while Marshal del Alc√°zar and his officers were to remain as hostages and the surviving soldiers were to incorporate themselves to the guerrilla. The final truce was agreed at 2AM on the 27th. Aftermath After the surrender of the troops, Benavides ordered the prisoners to restart the march towards Yumbel. On the morning of the 28th, Benavides ordered all the prisoners executed, which were then shot, lanced and the bodies torn apart. The city of Los Angeles was torched.

Views Smith is concerned about fixed odds gambling machines which fuel problem gambling, leading to people losing their homes, their savings and sometimes taking their own lives. Smith blames the UK government for not limiting the amount people can gamble on those machines to ¬£2, Smith stated the government delay was out of step with, ‚Äúpoliticians and campaigners [who] are united in seeking the earliest possible introduction of the maximum ¬£2 stake for FOBTs which will alleviate some of the devastating consequences of people addicted to gambling on them, some who can lose their homes and savings to them and then take their lives in desperation. Bookmakers taking huge profits and football clubs taking sponsorship from gambling and leaving the NHS to pick up the bill and families to face grief is privatising profit and nationalising consequences. It has to stop.‚Äù Smith also stated, ‚ÄúI am not anti-business. I am pro-victims.

The source code of the Apple Worm is the first program printed in its entirety in Scientific American. The Apple Worm was designed and developed by James R. Hauser and William R. Buckley. Other example Apple Worm programs are described in the cover story of the November 1986 issue of Call_A.P.P.L.E. Magazine. Because the Apple Worm performs dynamic self-relocation within the one main memory of one computer, it does not constitute a computer virus, an apt if somewhat inaccurate description. Although the analogous behavior of copying code between memories is exactly the act performed by a computer virus, the virus has other characters not present in the worm. Such programs do not necessarily cause collateral damage to the computing systems upon which their instructions execute; there is no reliance upon a vector to ensure subsequent execution. This extends to the computer virus; it need not be destructive in order to effect its communication between computational environments. Programs A typical computer program manipulates data which is external to the corporeal representation of the computer program. In programmer-ese, this means the code and data spaces are kept separate. Programs which manipulate data which is internal to its corporeal representation, such as that held in the code space, are self-relational; in part at least, its function is to maintain its function. In this sense, a dynamic self-relocator is a self- referential system, as defined by Douglas R. Hofstadter. Other examples The instruction set of the PDP-11 computer includes an instruction for moving data, which when constructed in a particular form causes itself to be moved from higher addresses to lower addresses; the form includes an automatic decrement of the instruction pointer register. Hence, when this instruction includes autodecrement of the instruction pointer, it behaves as a dynamic self-relocator. A more current example of a self-relocating program is an adaptation of the Apple Worm for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor and its derivatives, such as the Pentium, and corresponding AMD microprocessors.

William Railton (1800‚Äì77) was an English architect, best known as the designer of Nelson's Column. He was based in London, with offices at 12 Regent Street for much of his career. Life He was born in Clapham (then in Surrey) on 14 May 1800, the son of Isaac Railton and his wife, Margaret Maria Railton, n√©e Scott. He was a pupil of the London architect and surveyor William Inwood. In 1825 Railton set off for a tour of Greece and Egypt. On his return to England he prepared for publication some drawings he had made of the remains of the recently excavated Kardaki Temple on Corfu. They were printed as a supplementary volume to James Stuart's Antiquities of Athens under the title of The newly-discovered Temple at Cadachio Illustrated. In the mid-1830s, Railton carried out several commissions for Ambrose March Phillipps, a Leicestershire landowner who had converted to Catholicism at an early age.Purcell 1900, p. 14 On his marriage his father, Charles March-Phillipps of Garendon Park, had given him one of the family's other Leicestershire estates, on which stood the ruins of Grace Dieu Priory. There, Railton built the neo-Tudor Grace Dieu Manor, complete with chapel.Purcell 1900, pp. 61-2 Meanwhile, Ambrose Phillipps bought - with borrowed money - a tract of land in nearby Charnwood Forest to build a monastery for a community of Trappist monks,Purcell 1900, p. 66 to be named Mount St Bernard. Railton designed a church and monastic buildings, once again employing a neo-Tudor style. The church was consecrated in October 1837. Railton's buildings were, however, soon replaced by a more ambitious monastic complex to plans by Augustus Pugin. For Charles March Phillipps, Railton designed lodges and gatehouses for Garendon Park, which have survived the demolition of the main house. Railton also designed two identical Anglican churches in Charnwood Forest, at Copt Oak and Woodhouse Eaves, (consecrated on 3 September and 5 September 1837). He built further churches nearby at Groby (c.1840) and Thorpe Acre (1845), the latter on land donated by Charles March Phillipps. Also in Leicestershire, he designed Beaumanor Hall for the Herrick family. At Ripon he designed a palace for the bishop. The foundation stone was laid at a ceremony in October 1838, and by the end of 1841 it was ready for the bishop to move in. Four years later, Railton was asked to add a chapel, slightly separate from the palace, to allow the local population to worship there. In deference to the Tudor style of the palace, he chose the perpendicular style, battlemented like the main building. Between 1838 and 1848 he was employed as architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for whom he produced two standard designs for parsonages. During this time he also remodelled Riseholme as a house for the Bishop of Lincoln.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography accessed 9 Jan 2009 In 1836 he won the fourth prize in the competition to design a replacement for the Houses of Parliament which had recently been destroyed by fire, and in 1839 came first in the competition to design a monument to Admiral Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square, London. His winning design ‚Äì a simple Corinthian column topped with a statue of Nelson ‚Äì was constructed between 1839 and 1842; the lions on the base, although part of the original plan, were not added until 1867. Railton exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1829 and 1851. He built nothing after 1850. He lived at 65 Onslow Square, Kensington, in the later part of his life, and died on 13 October 1877, while visiting Brighton. Works *Randalls, Surrey.

In service in the Pacific during the war, she earned one battle star. After her February 1946 decommissioning, she was sold to France as Commandant Charcot. Her fate is not reported in secondary sources.  Career  Lancewood (YN-67) was laid down as Ironwood 15 October 1942 by Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, Stockton, California; renamed Lancewood 3 April 1943; launched 2 May 1943; and commissioned 18 October 1943, Lt. Tyler Kaune in command. After shakedown off the California coast, Lancewood was assigned to the 12th Naval District, San Francisco, California. Reclassified AN-48 on 20 January 1944, she tended nets and repaired net lines until departing San Francisco 1 December. Loaded with fleet moorings, she steamed via San Pedro, California, to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived the 16th. Lancewood sailed for the western Pacific Ocean 24 January 1945. After touching Eniwetok and Guam, she reached a holding area off Iwo Jima 20 February and 3 days later began pulling damaged landing craft off the beaches to facilitate unloading operations. She placed moorings, laid nets, and salvaged landing craft off Iwo Jima until 12 April when she departed for the Mariana Islands. Lancewood served at Guam from 19 April to 10 June; then she proceeded to Ulithi, where she arrived 12 June for duty as net repair ship. She began to remove net defenses 30 August, then steamed to Yap Island 2 September for the surrender of Japanese forces there the following day. She remained at Yap until 7 September, returned to Ulithi the 8th, and resumed net removal operations. Loaded with net panels, Lancewood sailed to Saipan 14 to 17 October and unloaded her cargo. Departing 26 October, she steamed via Midway Islands and Pearl Harbor for the U.S. West Coast, arriving San Francisco 25 November. Remaining at San Francisco, she decommissioned 11 February 1946. Berthed at Suisun Bay, California, she was sold 28 April 1947 to Robert A. Martinolich, San Francisco, and transferred 3 May to the U.S. Maritime Commission for simultaneous delivery to her purchaser, the French government, and commissioned as Commandant Charcot.

Soon Susan and Smudge fall in love. Shortly after, Tom and Trudy marry, as do Susan and Smudge. Joan and Bob date despite her mother's wishes that she only go out with men of her class. Smudge is fired from his job as a truck driver because there is not enough work and Susan loses her job because she is married. Meanwhile, Tom and Trudy have a baby. Mr. Harper is implicated in a trust failure and kills himself, leaving his family in reduced circumstances. To ensure the financial security of her family, Joan decides to sacrifice her own happiness and set her love for Bob aside to instead accept a proposal from wealthy Stephen Hornblow (Charles Starrett). Completely desperate, Smudge impulsively robs a pawnshop of ten dollars in order to buy food and he is shot running away. Smudge dies, but Bob at least manages to keep his identity out of the papers; Susan returns to her parents. When Joan meets Bob at Tom and Trudy's, where they have gone to visit the new baby, she tells him that she has changed her mind about Stephen's proposal since she knows he won't make her happy. Rather than worry about her family, she will follow her heart and marry Bob.

In many cases, self- relocating code is also a form of self-modifying code. Overview Self- relocation is similar to the relocation process employed by the linker-loader when a program is copied from external storage into main memory; the difference is that it is the loaded program itself rather than the loader in the operating system or shell that performs the relocation. One form of self- relocation occurs when a program copies the code of its instructions from one sequence of locations to another sequence of locations within the main memory of a single computer, and then transfers processor control from the instructions found at the source locations of memory to the instructions found at the destination locations of memory. As such, the data operated upon by the algorithm of the program is the sequence of bytes which define the program. Self-relocation typically happens at load-time (after the operating system has loaded the software and passed control to it, but still before its initialization has finished), sometimes also when changing the program's configuration at a later stage during runtime. Examples=Boot loaders= As an example, self-relocation is often employed in the early stages of bootstrapping operating systems on architectures like IBM PC compatibles, where lower-level chain boot loaders (like the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR) and initial boot stages of operating systems such as DOS) move themselves out of place in order to load the next stage into memory. =x86 DOS drivers= Under DOS, self-relocation is sometimes also used by more advanced drivers and RSXs/TSRs loading themselves \\"high\\" into upper memory more effectively than possible for externally provided \\"high\\"-loaders (like LOADHIGH/HILOAD, INSTALLHIGH/HIINSTALL or DEVICEHIGH/HIDEVICE etc. since DOS 5) in order to maximize the memory available for applications. This is down to the fact that the operating system has no knowledge of the inner workings of a driver to be loaded and thus has to load it into a free memory area large enough to hold the whole driver as a block including its initialization code, even if that would be freed after the initialization. For TSRs, the operating system also has to allocate a Program Segment Prefix (PSP) and an environment segment. This might cause the driver not to be loaded into the most suitable free memory area or even prevent it from being loaded high at all. In contrast to this, a self-relocating driver can be loaded anywhere (including into conventional memory) and then relocate only its (typically much smaller) resident portion into a suitable free memory area in upper memory. In addition, advanced self-relocating TSRs (even if already loaded into upper memory by the operating system) can relocate over most of their own PSP segment and command line buffer and free their environment segment in order to further reduce the resulting memory footprint and avoid fragmentation. Some self-relocating TSRs can also dynamically change their \\"nature\\" and morph into device drivers even if originally loaded as TSRs, thereby typically also freeing some memory. Finally, it is technically impossible for an external loader to relocate drivers into expanded memory (EMS), the high memory area (HMA) or extended memory (via DPMS or CLOAKING), because these methods require small driver-specific stubs to remain in conventional or upper memory in order to coordinate the access to the relocation target area, and in the case of device drivers also because the driver's header must always remain in the first megabyte. In order to achieve this, the drivers must be specially designed to support self-relocation into these areas. Some advanced DOS drivers also contain both a device driver (which would be loaded at offset +0000h by the operating system) and TSR (loaded at offset +0100h) sharing a common code portion internally as fat binary. If the shared code is not designed to be position-independent, it requires some form of internal address fix-up similar to what would otherwise have been carried out by a relocating loader already; this is similar to the fix-up stage of self-relocation but with the code already being loaded at the target location by the operating system's loader (instead of done by the driver itself). = IBM DOS/360 and OS/360 programs = IBM DOS/360 did not have the ability to relocate programs during loading. Sometimes multiple versions of a program were maintained, each built for a different load address. A special class of programs, called self-relocating programs, were coded to relocate themselves after loading. IBM OS/360 relocated executable programs when they were loaded into memory. Only one copy of the program was required, but once loaded the program could not be moved (so called one-time position-independent code). =Other examples= As an extreme example of (many-time) self-relocation it is possible to construct a computer program so that it does not stay at a fixed address in memory, even as it executes. The Apple Worm is a dynamic self-relocator.

It was also utilized dynamically by the CP/M debugger Dynamic Debugging Tool (DDT) to relocate itself into higher memory. The same approach was independently developed by Bruce Van Natta of IMS Associates to produce relocatable PL/M code. As paragraph boundary relocation of this method was later utilized by dynamically HMA self-relocating TSRs like KEYB, SHARE, and NLSFUNC under DR DOS 6.0 and higher. A much more sophisticated and byte-level granular offset relocation method based on a somewhat similar approach was independently conceived and implemented by Matthias R. Paul and Axel C. Frinke for their dynamic dead-code elimination to dynamically minimize the runtime footprint of resident drivers and TSRs (like FreeKEYB).) * (33 pages)  Computer programming ","title":"Self-relocation"},{"id":"18569807","text":"National Route 239 is a national highway of Japan connecting Abashiri, Hokkaid≈ç and Rumoi, Hokkaid≈ç in Japan, with a total length of 346.6 km (215.37 mi).

He uses small toys and props with dramatic lighting to construct miniature environments for subject matters varying from war scenes to voyeurism to racial and political references to American pop culture. Levinthal's major series include Hitler Moves East (1972‚Äì1975), Modern Romance (1983‚Äì1985), Wild West (1986‚Äì1989), Desire (1991‚Äì1992), Blackface (1995‚Äì1998), Barbie (1997‚Äì1998), Baseball (1998‚Äì2004), and History (2010‚Äì2018). Biography Levinthal was born in 1949 in San Francisco, California. He received a Scienti√¶ Magister in Management Science from the MIT Sloan School of Management (1981), an MFA in Photography from Yale University (1973), and a BA in Studio Art from Stanford University (1970). He was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1995 and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1990‚Äì1991.Diawara, Manthia. David Levinthal: Blackface. Santa Fe: Arena Editions, 1999 He has had retrospective exhibitions of his work at the International Center of Photography and the George Eastman Museum. Levinthal has produced a diverse oeuvre, utilizing primarily large-format Polaroid photography. His works touch upon many aspects of American culture, from Barbie to baseball to X-rated dolls. Levinthal's major series include Hitler Moves East (1972‚Äì1975), Modern Romance (1983‚Äì1985), Wild West (1986‚Äì1989), Desire (1991‚Äì1992), Blackface (1995‚Äì1998), Barbie (1997‚Äì1998), Baseball (1998‚Äì2004), and History (2010‚Äì2018).Nice Boy Shares Toy His politically charged series, Blackface, consists of close-ups of black memorabilia, household objects infused with African-American stereotypes, and caused such a controversy that the Institute of Contemporary Art of Philadelphia was forced to cancel the exhibition while still in its early planning stages. On his use of toys, Levinthal said that \\"Toys are intriguing, and I want to see what I can do with them. On a deeper level, they represent one way that society socializes its young.\\" Furthermore, Levinthal is aware of the power of toys: ‚ÄúEver since I began working with toys, I have been intrigued with the idea that these seemingly benign objects could take on such incredible power and personality simply by the way they were photographed. I began to realize that by carefully selecting the depth of field and making it narrow, I could create a sense of movement and reality that was in fact not there.Hallanan, Blake. \\"Toy Story\\" Books * Hitler Moves East: A Graphic Chronicle, 1941-43 (Sheed, Andrews & McMeel, 1977).

The festival runs a roughly twelve-week repertory season each year, operating under a large open-air theater tent. Its productions attract a total audience of about 50,000 from the Hudson Valley, New York City, and 40 US states. The company will move to a new permanent location in Garrison, New York in 2022. HVSF also performs William Shakespeare's works and live theater throughout the tri-state area by touring. The company has limited runs of its most popular programs through its \\"HVSF On The Road\\" series and brings student-oriented productions and education programs to about 50,000 elementary, middle, and high school students and teachers each year. HVSF's arts education programs also include training for early-career theater artists by way of its Conservatory Company, professional development for educators, and free audience engagement offerings before and after performances throughout the summer. History HVSF was founded by Melissa Stern and Terry O‚ÄôBrien in September 1987 with an outdoor production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at Manitoga, home of industrial designer Russel Wright, in Garrison, New York. The following year, Boscobel House and Gardens agreed to host HVSF's mainstage season on the estate's expansive grounds, and that summer's production of Shakespeare's As You Like It was performed under a tent overlooking the Hudson River. In 1994, the festival added a second show to its season and began hands-on, performance-driven education programs within area schools. In 2004, HVSF began to tour productions to middle and high schools. In 2006, HVSF acquired a custom-designed, open-air theater tent with seating for 540. The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival was the subject of a one-hour documentary and two hour film of a performance of Twelfth Night which premiered on the PBS affiliate WNET (Channel 13 in New York City) on September 18, 2008. The program also aired on WLIW (Channel 21 on Long Island).PBSPlaybill More than 500,000 patrons have been served since HVSF's first season in 1987. Terry O‚ÄôBrien led the theater for 27 years, directing more than 30 productions, and stepped down as Artistic Director in December 2013. After a search for his successor, HVSF's Board of Directors appointed Davis McCallum as Artistic Director in May 2014. In 2016, the festival produced a community-driven production of Thornton Wilder's Our Town with a cast of about 40 citizen actors from the Hudson Valley region, directed by John Christian Plummer. In 2017, the festival mounted its first new plays: Pride and Prejudice by Kate Hamill (adapted from the novel by Jane Austen), and Lauren Gunderson's The Book of Will. Location With its plays performed in an open-air theater tent on the grounds of the Boscobel, the festival is known for its backdrop. The stage, a rough patch of dirt that is on the same level as the first few rows of the audience, recedes into lawns with a view of the Hudson River and West Point in the distance. The company uses the vast open space behind the stage as scenery for the plays. According to Ben Brantley of The New York Times, \\"nature and Shakespeare are the stars\\" in this festival. The company received a gift of a land parcel of 50 acres in Garrison in August 2020 and will move to that location permanently in time for the 2020 season. HVSF plans to build a permanent open air structure that will preserve the river views it is famous for at its current Boscobel location. Recognition The festival was named among The New York Times' \\"50 Essential Summer Festivals\\" in 2016, was Hudson Valley Magazine's 2016 Editors‚Äô Pick for Best Summer Theater, and was nominated for a Drama League Award for its 2015 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. It produces classic and new works with an economy of style, focusing on script, actors and audience with the Hudson River and Hudson Highlands as its set and setting. The Wall Street Journal hails it as, \\"The most purely enjoyable summer Shakespeare festival in America,\\" while The New York Times comments, \\"If anyone wonders about the future of live theater or asks where the audience is, the answer is 'Under that tent.\\"New York Times It is listed as a \\"Major Festival\\" in the book Shakespeare Festivals Around the World by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004. Education programs In addition to its summer productions, the festival sponsors year-round education programs to about 50,000 students and teachers annually. These programs include in- school residencies and theater arts workshops for students, resource workshops for educators, a fall touring production for students in grades K-5, a spring touring production for students in grades 6-12, its annual Shakespeare Summer Camp for ages 8‚Äì16, and the Teachers' Shakespeare Institute. HVSF's Conservatory Company, a performance based training program for 6 - 8 early career actors, offers on- and off-stage opportunities to work alongside the festival's acting company.

The highway begins at an intersection with National Route 5 in Hakodate, then crosses the Tsugaru Strait on a ferry from Hakodate to ≈åma, Aomori, that it shares with National Route 279, where it then travels south through eastern Aomori Prefecture, passing through the city of Mutsu before ending at an intersection with National Route 4 in Noheji. National Route 279's path across Aomori follows one of the oldest roads in northern Japan, a pilgrimage path called the to Mount Osore, a caldera believed in Japanese mythology to be a gate to the underworld. Route description=Hakodate= National Route 279 begins at an intersection with National Route 5 in central Hakodate, east of Hakodate Station. The highway travels southwest through the city, then curves to the northwest, and turns northeast towards the former site of the city's ferry terminal, which was moved to the northwest of Hakodate Station. The highway's brief route in Hokkaido ends at the former terminal, which has since been converted into a retail area. Aside from the last of the highway near the ferry terminal, the highway also carries the Main Line of the Hakodate City Tram in its median. =Aomori Prefecture= National Route 279 along the coast of the Tsugaru Strait The highway is then carried south across the Tsugaru Strait via the Tsugaru Kaiky≈ç Ferry to ≈åma on the northern tip of Aomori Prefecture's Shimokita Peninsula. From the route's northern terminus in Hakodate to ≈åma, National Route 338 runs concurrent with National Route 279; however, in ≈åma, National Route 338 leaves the concurrency, traveling south while Route 279 heads southeast towards Mutsu. In Aomori, Route 279 is known as the Mutsu Hamanasu Line, named after the hamanasu, known in English as the Rosa rugosa, a shrub-like rose that grows on the beaches of Japan. In Mutsu, it intersects with the northern end of the Mutsu Bypass, an auxiliary parallel route of the highway, and routes 279 and 338 briefly meet again, sharing a short concurrency. After traveling through the central district of the city together, National Route 338 leaves National Route 279 at the southern end of the Mutsu Bypass. It continues its path southeast across the peninsula while National Route 279 heads south towards Yokohama, and eventually Noheji at the southern base of the peninsula. The highway reaches a rest area on the north shore of the Miho River in Yokohama. Between Yokohama and Noheji, National Route 279 is closely paralleled by the Shimokita Expressway, a highway signed as an auxiliary route of National Route 279 that has supplanted the original route as the main thoroughfare between Yokohama and Noheji. The two highways meet at junction in southern Yokohama, where the original route continues south along Mutsu Bay while the expressway takes a more inland route through the village of Rokkasho. Upon entering Noheji, the route travels southwest through sparsely populated coastal woodlands before entering the central part of the town where it curves to the south. After passing by the town hall, the route terminates at an intersection with National Route 4. =Average daily traffic= National Route 279 is maintained by the Road Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), which conducts surveys on the Japan's national routes and expressways every five years to measure their average daily traffic. In 2015, the most utilized point along the route, was at the junction between it and Aomori Route 7 in Mutsu, where a daily average of 9,440 vehicles traveled on National Route 279. The least busy section of the highway was between the ferry terminal at ≈åma and the intersection where the highway meets National Route 338, it carried an average of only 1,337 vehicles. History National Route 279 near the old ferry terminal in Hakodate National Route 279 was preceded by the , a road established by the Nanbu clan during the Edo period as a branch of the longer ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç (now known as National Route 4). It traveled between Noheji-shukuba and the Buddhist temple and folk religion pilgrimage destination of Mount Osore, believed to be a mystical gate to the underworld in both Ainu mythology and Japanese Buddhism, near the former town of Tanabu (now part of Mutsu). The road appears on maps as early as 1647, and by 1699 it was labeled as the Tanabu-kaid≈ç on a map produced by the Nanbu. Pilgrimages along the Tanabu- kaid≈ç to Mount Osore date back to 862, but its uncertain if the establishment of a maintained road took place before the Nanbu built it. National Route 279 was established by the Cabinet of Japan in 1970 along the Tanabu-kaid≈ç between Noheji and ≈åma, the ferry linking ≈åma and Hakodate, and the short section in Hakodate. Since its designation, bypasses of the original route have been built, these include the incomplete, limited-access Shimokita Expressway between Noheji and Yokohama, as well as the Nimaibashi Bypass in Mutsu. On 1 February 2012, a blizzard trapped 329 people on the highway in Aomori Prefecture. Major intersectionsAuxiliary routes=Shimokita Expressway= The Shimokita Expressway is an incomplete two-lane national expressway in Aomori Prefecture that is signed as an auxiliary route of National Route 279. The expressway travels south from Yokohama through the municipalities of Rokkasho and Noheji, where the main section of the expressway currently ends at an interchange with National Route 4. A short expressway stub opened in Mutsu in December 2019. When completed, the expressway will stretch from Mutsu south to the town of Shichinohe. =Mutsu Bypass= The Mutsu Bypass is a auxiliary route of National Route 279 in the central district of Mutsu. From its northern terminus with its parent route, it heads southeast and crosses over the Jotachi River. It has a junction with the ≈åminato Bypass, an auxiliary route of National Route 338. After this junction the Mutsu Bypass travels south, paralleling the main line of National Route 279 until it reaches its southern terminus at the junction of National Routes 279 and 338.

It currently is made up of two sections that travel from Aomori, north across the Tsugaru Peninsula to Sotogahama where the first section ends at the site of a former ferry to across the Tsugaru Strait to the town, Fukushima. The other section begins at the corresponding former ferry terminal in Fukushima. The road then travels alongside the southern coast of Hokkaido concurrently with National Route 228 to Hakodate where the route meets its northern terminus. National Route 280's path across Aomori and Hokkaido follows one of the oldest roads in northern Japan, the Matsumaed≈ç. It was established by Tokugawa Ieyasu for government officials traveling through the area as a branch of the Edo Five Routes and it had some defensive importance to the Japanese who feared a Russian incursion into Ezo, which was ruled by the Matsumae clan. Route description=Aomori Prefecture= The southern terminus of Japan National Route 280 in Aomori The southern terminus of National Route 280 lies at an intersection with National Route 7 just over southwest of Aomori Station to the west of the central district of Aomori. From there, the route generally travels northwest through the city streets as it makes its way out of the city. Near Aburakawa Station, the route begins closely paralleling the coast of Aomori Bay, it continues paralleling the coast throughout its path on the Tsugaru Peninsula. In Minmaya at the northern end of the peninsula, the roadway designation switches to National Route 339. At this point a ferry once carried the route across the Tsugaru Strait, but it has ceased operation. =Hokkaido= National Route 280's path through Hokkaido begins at the port where the ferry from Minmaya used to travel to in Fukushima. The road briefly travels southwest to National Route 228. From that junction, National Route 280 runs concurrently with National Route 228 the rest of the way to its northern terminus in Hakodate. The routes run parallel to the southern coast of Hokkaido along the Tsugaru Strait on their way to Hakodate. The northern terminus of National Route 280 lies about north of Hakodate Station at a junction with National Route 5. History What is known today as National Route 280 was originally established during the Edo period by Tokugawa Ieyasu as the Matsumaed≈ç. Its primary purpose was for government officials traveling through the area as a branch of the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, one of the Edo Five Routes connecting the capital to the rest of Japan. It also had defensive importance to the Japanese who feared a Russian incursion into Ezo, which was ruled by the Matsumae clan; however, the main threat to Japanese control of the area was rebellion by the native Ainu. National Route 280 was established by the Cabinet of Japan along the Edo period road and the ferry linking Sotogahama and Fukushima in 1970. The ferry service along National Route 280 was discontinued in 1998, leaving the non-contiguous sections of the route without a direct road link.

It is designed to transmit torque (by connecting two shafts) while damping system vibrations and accommodating misalignment, which protects other components from damage. Jaw couplings are composed of three parts: two metallic hubs and an elastomer insert called an element, but commonly referred to as a \\"spider\\". The three parts press fit together with a jaw from each hub fitted alternately with the lobes of the spider. Jaw coupling torque is transmitted through the elastomer lobes in compression. Coupling The elastomer of the spider can be made in different materials and hardness, which allows the user to customize the coupling to best serve their application. Considerations for elastomer selection include ability to dampen vibration, ability to handle misalignment, operational temperature range, speed of equipment, and chemical conditions. Jaw couplings are considered \\"fail-safe\\" because, should the elastomer fail or wear away, the jaw coupling hub teeth will mate, much like teeth on two gears, and continue to transmit torque. This may or may not be desirable to the user depending on the application. Jaw couplings elastomers are wearing elements that do need to be inspected and replaced. Jaw coupling elastomers often have signature wear patterns, and failures can often be root caused based on the condition of the elastomer and hubs. Common failure causes include misalignment, over-torque, chemical exposure, temperature exposure, torsional vibrations, and hub failure. Jaw couplings are available in both straight tooth jaw and curved jaw design. The straight tooth design enables elastomers to be attached and removed radially, including a \\"not fail-safe\\" jaw elastomer in-shear design. For the elastomer in-shear design, the coupling hub teeth are no longer inter- meshed, so an elastomer failure will result in no torque being transmitted. When used with a stiff elastomer, the curved jaw design can maintain a zero- backlash fit required for many motion control applications. Zero-backlash curved jaw couplings are best suited for applications that rely on a stop-and- go type of movement, where accuracy needs to take place upon stopping in order to perform any number of precision tasks, such as taking a high resolution picture (machine vision system). Absorbing vibrations decreases the settling time the system needs, which increases through-put. The curved jaw coupling is less suited for applications that rely on a constant scanning type of motion, where accuracy is required during movement, which requires a torsionally stronger coupling. Like other flexible couplings, jaw couplings are limited in the shaft misalignment that they can accommodate. Too much axial motion will cause the couplings to come apart, while too much angular or parallel misalignment will result in bearing loads that may lead to premature system wear or failure. With its damping capability, interchangeable spiders, and wide variety of custom options, jaw couplings make a great solution for shock absorption and torque transmission in many applications.

Sun Jian, Yuan Shu's nominal subordinate returning from his triumphant capture of the abandoned capital of Luoyang, became involved in Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu's personal feud as the former allies turned against one another. Yuan Shao's forces, under Zhou Yu, first got the upper hand against Sun Jian's forces, but was beaten back by Sun's counterattack. Background In 190, regional warlords and officials from across China formed a coalition against Chancellor of State Dong Zhuo, who controlled state power and held Emperor Xian hostage. Yuan Shao was elected leader of the alliance. To participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Sun Jian led an army north to join Yuan Shu, who was part of the coalition. Yuan Shu appointed Sun Jian as Acting General Who Smashes the Caitiffs (Á†¥ËôúÂ∞áËªç) and Inspector of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤), and sent him to attack Dong Zhuo at the capital city of Luoyang. Sun Jian defeated Dong Zhuo's forces, causing Dong to set fire to Luoyang and force its people to move to Chang'an, where the new capital was situated. Sun Jian's capture of Luoyang, in ruins, was militarily untenable since the other members of the alliance had no mind to reinforce his position, while they themselves were on the verge of dissolution. Sun abandoned Luoyang and made his way back south. Yuan Shu, apparently dissatisfied that his cousin Yuan Shao was elected coalition leader and received all the prestige that came with his appointment, insulted his cousin as \\"a family slave\\" and \\"not a true son of the Yuan clan\\".de Crespigny (1990), p. 119 Yuan Shao was predictably angry at this. In 191, he named Zhou Yu (Renming) as Inspector of Yu Province, a title to which Sun Jian was entitled, and sent him to attack Sun's territories in Yu Province while Sun was away. Zhou Yu decided to attack Yangcheng of Yingchuan Commandery (ÊΩÅÂ∑ù; southeast of present-day Dengfeng, Henan). Originally, an outpost was set up here by Sun Jian during his march north against Dong Zhuo, and the outpost remained to watch for possible attacks from Dong Zhuo from the west after Sun Jian left Luoyang. Although the city of Yangcheng belonged under Sun Jian's government in Yu Province, it was also within Yuan Shao's sphere of influence in Ji Province (ÂÜÄÂ∑û), and thus it was a sensible target for Yuan's aggression.de Crespigny (1990), p. 121 The battle Not expecting an attack from a nominal ally, Yangcheng was taken by surprise. When Sun Jian heard of the attack, he sighed and commented: The northern warlord Gongsun Zan sided with Yuan Shu, and sent his cousin Gongsun Yue with 1,000 horsemen to Yuan Shu. Gongsun Yue and his horsemen were to accompany Sun Jian in the battle to retake Yangcheng, but in the initial skirmishes Gongsun Yue was killed by an arrow. Despite the setbacks, Sun Jian recovered some time later and defeated Zhou Yu in several battles. Then Yuan Shu led an attack southeast on Zhou Yu's brother Zhou Ang in Jiujiang, which compelled Zhou Yu to abandon Yangcheng to go to his brother's aid. There Zhou Yu was defeated again, and he abandoned the campaign to return to his hometown of Kuaiji (modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang). Aftermath The first battles between Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu ended in the latter's favour: he had engaged and defeated Yuan Shao's forces in both Yangcheng and Jiujiang, restored the position in Yingchuan under Sun Jian, and eliminated Zhou Yu as a threat once and for all although Jiujiang was not yet conquered. For Yuan Shao, on the other hand, the situation was extremely difficult: besides the failure in the south, he was also under threat from Gongsun Zan, who held Yuan Shao responsible for the death of Gongsun Yue and declared war against him, rejecting all of Yuan Shao's protestations of goodwill.de Crespigny (1990), p. 123 This led to the clash between Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan in the Battle of Jieqiao. The battle of Yangcheng, being the first moves in the struggle between the two Yuans, marked the beginning of a new stage in the confusion of wars which brought the end of the Han dynasty. The battle was notable as a confirmation of the death of the alliance against Dong Zhuo as the warlords of the North China Plain start to battle each other for the ultimate dominion of China.

The line later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, and, where still in use, is operated by CSX Transportation and the First Coast Railroad. The highway corridor of SR 24, US 301, and SR A1A/SR 200 closely parallels the former Florida Railroad. History Fernandina Beach's original Florida Railroad Station, now the Amelia Island Visitor Center. 1939 image of Cedar Key showing the Florida Railroad's former right of way and trestle remnants The shipping route between the east coast and gulf coast of the United States passes through the Straits of Florida, close to the Florida Reef that lies just off the Florida Keys. Prior to the 20th century many ships were wrecked around the southern end of the Florida peninsula. A railroad across the northern end of the Florida peninsula would allow cargoes from ships in the Gulf of Mexico to be transferred to ships in the Atlantic Ocean, and vice versa, without the risk of passage through the Straits of Florida, while cutting 800 miles off the trip.Turner. 27-8 In 1842 the United States Congress commissioned a survey of a route for a railroad between the St. Mary's River and Cedar Key in the Territory of Florida. In 1853 the Florida Legislature chartered the Florida Railroad to build a Confederate Railroads - Florida gauge rail line from Fernandina (near the mouth of the St. Mary's River) to Tampa, Florida, with a branch to Cedar Key. The president and chief stockholder of the Florida Railroad was U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee. Yulee decided to complete the line to Cedar Key first, leaving the connection to Tampa for later. Construction started in Fernandina in 1855. By 1858 the rail line was open between Fernandina and Starke, but the Panic of 1857 had left the railroad on the edge of bankruptcy. Yulee had to surrender a majority interest in the railroad to a northern investment syndicate headed by Edward Dickerson to save the company. The line was completed to Gainesville in 1859 and Cedar Key in 1861. Other towns served by the railroad included Callahan, Baldwin, Waldo and Archer. At 156 miles in length, it was the longest railroad to be completed in Florida before the start of the American Civil War.Turner. 27-31Watkins. 451-52 Tracks on Cedar Key The Florida Railroad was adversely affected by the Civil War. The USS Hatteras raided Cedar Key in January 1862, destroying the railroad's rolling stock and buildings. In March 1862 a Union squadron seized Fernandina. Shells fired by the USS Ottawa damaged the last train leaving Fernandina, killing or injuring several passengers, and almost killing Senator Yulee. In 1864, the Confederate States Army pulled up rails from the Florida Railroad to use on a new rail line from Live Oak, Florida to Lawton, Georgia. Union forces had also destroyed 30 miles of track leading from Cedar Key.Turner. 34-7, 40 The Dickerson syndicate resumed operation of the Florida Railroad after the war, but with much of the railroad's equipment, facilities and track destroyed or seized, the company did not do well, and defaulted on its bonds to the Internal Improvement Fund in 1866. The railroad was auctioned off, and bought back by the Dickerson syndicate for twenty percent of the original value of the bonds. In 1872 the Florida Railroad was reorganized as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company, still under the control of the Dickerson syndicate. The newly reorganized company began construction of the long- promised line to Tampa through subsidiary companies: the Peninsular Railroad operated the line from the connection with the Florida Railroad at Waldo to Ocala and Silver Springs, while the Tropical Florida Railroad ran from Ocala to Wildwood. In the meantime, the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company had leased the Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, providing a connection from its tracks at Hart's Road (later Yulee, Florida) to Jacksonville, Florida. Due to financial difficulties, the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company was reorganized as the Florida Transit Company in 1881, under the control of Sir Edward James Reed. The company was restructured again as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad in 1883.Turner. 40-1, 47, 49-52 The Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad was merged with the Florida Central and Western Railroad, Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, and Leesburg and Indian River Railroad in 1884-85 to form the Florida Railway and Navigation Company.Turner. 52 See also *Cross Florida Barge Canal NotesReferences *Turner, Gregg.

The highway begins as a concurrent route with National Route 7 in central Hirosaki, it then leaves National Route 7 in Fujisaki and travels north through the municipalities of Itayanagi, Tsuruta, Goshogawara, and Nakadomari before ending at an intersection with National Route 280 in Sotogahama. In a unique feature, a section of the route on Cape Tappi is a staircase. Route description National Route 339 has a section of highway on Cape Tappi that is a staircase. National Route 339 begins as a concurrent route with National Route 7 in central Hirosaki, northeast of Und≈çk≈çenmae Station. Shortly after, the highway has an interchange with National Routes 102, 394, and Aomori Route 109. After passing through the city and entering the town of Fujisaki, it leaves National Route 7 and turns northwest, paralleling the downstream path of the Iwaki River. In Itayanagi, the route curves to the north again, heading directly towards central Goshogawara. After entering Goshogawara, the highway intersects National Route 101. The two highways parallel one another in central Goshogawara before diverging, Route 101 turns west and Route 339 curves northeast. North of the central district of Goshogawara, the highway connects to the Tsugaru Expressway, a limited-access bypass of the city, at Goshogawara-kita Interchange. Continuing north, the highway begins its journey across to the Tsugaru Peninsula to Cape Tappi at its northern tip. In the former town of Kanagi, the highway draws closer to the parallel Tsugaru Railway. They parallel one another, crossing out of Goshogawara, until they reach central Nakadomari, where the railway terminates while the highway continues north out of the town. Upon leaving Nakadomari the first time, the highway re-enters Goshogawara and curves northwest along the northern shore of Lake J≈´san. Eventually the route arrives at the Sea of Japan coast of the peninsula, it curves north here and eventually enters Nakadomari once again. As the highway approaches Cape Tappi, it winds its way across the western Tsugaru Mountains into the former town of Minmaya (now part of Sotogahama); due to the sharp curves and rapid changes in elevation, this section of the highway is closed during the winter when weather conditions would make the feature impassable. At Cape Tappi, a section of the highway is a staircase made up of 362 stairs, the only one of its kind among the national highways of Japan. This section of the highway is open only to pedestrian traffic and is subject to closure in the winter. After the staircase section ends, the highway continues southeast away from the cape along the coast of the Tsugaru Strait. The route terminates at an intersection with National Route 280, just short of Sotogahama's border with Imabetsu. History The staircase at Cape Tappi was built as a joint effort between local people and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. When the national government was looking for local roads to incorporate into the planned National Route 339, the stairs were left in place and designated as part of the proposed highway because a normal road would be too steep and narrow. National Route 339 was established by the Cabinet of Japan in 1975 along the stairway and other local roads between Hirosaki and then-extant Minamaya (now part of Sotogahama). On 18 July 2018, a section of the highway was realigned just north of central Goshogawara as a measure to improve its level of safety and its access to the Tsugaru Expressway.

In addition to the spring, the park has a log cabin built by a former slave, Milton Leach. The park was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1973. History=Royal Spring= Royal Spring Royal Spring is a large spring in Georgetown, Kentucky that has been a main source of water since the first settlements in the area. In 1889, the Georgetown Water Works Company was incorporated, and distributed the spring water until the City of Georgetown purchased that company and established the Municipal Water Works Plant in 1945. Currently, more than 13,000 customers of Georgetown Municipal Water and Sewer Service rely on water from the spring as their primary water supply. =Early settlements= In 1774 John Floyd of Fincastle County, Virginia led a surveying party into Kentucky to locate land to be used as \\"compensation for soldier in the French and Indian War\\". On July 7, 1774, Floyd found the spring and he received it and of land as payment for his surveying work. This spring's earliest known name was \\"Mr. Floyd's Spring\\". In October 1775, Floyd transferred ownership of the spring to John McClelland (1745‚Äì1776), from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, after McClelland surveyed and built a cabin on the land earlier in the year. In 1776 McClelland's Fort, an army outpost was built on a nearby cliff to have close proximity to the spring. The fort was abandoned in 1777 after the Indian attacks increased in frequency and severity. =Kentucky Bourbon developed= Baptist preacher Elijah Craig set up a grain mill and used the spring water to first distill bourbon whiskey using the sour mash process on this site in 1789. Craig has long been credited with the creation of bourbon though more recent research suggests alternative explanations. View of Royal Spring from W. Main Street Royal Spring Park, located off West Main Street (U.S. Route 460) in the downtown area, features an outdoor recreation area, viewing of Royal Spring, and an authentic restored log cabin museum.

He coined the term \\"Neo-Impressionism\\" in 1886 to identify a group of artists led by Georges Seurat, and ardently promoted them. The F√©n√©on Prize was established in 1949 by his wife from proceeds from the sale of his art collection.  Life  F√©n√©on was a prominent literary stylist, art critic, and anarchist born in Turin, Italy in 1861. He was raised in Burgundy, presumably because his father was a travelling salesman. After placing first in the competitive exams for jobs, F√©n√©on moved to Paris to work for the War Office where he achieved the rank of chief clerk. During his time in the War Office he edited many literary works, including those of Rimbaud and Lautr√©amont, and helped to advance the fledgling pointillist movement under Georges Seurat.Introduction to Novels in Three Lines translated by Luc Sante, New York Review of Books, 2007 He was a regular at Mallarm√©'s salons on Tuesday evenings, and active in anarchist circles. Paul Signac, Portrait of F√©lix F√©n√©on, 1890, Museum of Modern Art, New York City F√©n√©on, ironically, worked for 13 years at the War Office while remaining heavily active in supporting anarchist circles and movements. In March 1892 French police talked about F√©n√©on as an 'active Anarchist', and they had him shadowed. In 1894 F√©n√©on was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy because of an anarchist bombing of the Foyot restaurant, a popular haunt of politicians. He was also suspected of being connected with the assassination of the French President, Sadi Carnot, by an Italian anarchist. He and twenty- nine others were arrested on charges of conspiracy in what became known as the Trial of the Thirty. F√©n√©on was acquitted with many of the original thirty. However, the trial was a high point in publicity for F√©n√©on, normally behind the scenes, as he championed his wit to the amusement of the jury. Of the courtroom scene, Julian Barnes writes, \\"When the presiding judge put it to him that he had been spotted talking to a known anarchist behind a gas lamp, he replied coolly: Can you tell me, Monsieur le Pr√©sident, which side of a gas lamp is its behind?\\" After the trial, F√©n√©on became even more elusive. In 1890 the Neo-Impressionist Paul Signac asked permission to produce a portrait of the lauded critic. F√©n√©on refused several times before agreeing, on the condition that Signac produced a full face effigy. Signac refused, painting instead a famous profile of F√©n√©on with his characteristic goatee, a picture that became a well-known symbol of the anarchist movement, spawning many variations. F√©n√©on, though displeased, hung the picture on his wall until Signac's death 45 years later. Aside from Novels in Three Lines that first appeared as clippings in the Parisian liberal newspaper Le Matin in 1906 and later as a collection, only because his mistress Camille Pateel had collected them in an album, F√©n√©on published only a 43-page monograph in Les Impressionists (1886). When asked to produce Les Nouvelles en Trois Lignes as a collection, F√©n√©on famously replied with an angry \\"I aspire only to silence\\". As Luc Sante points out, F√©n√©on, one might say, is invisibly famous, having affected so much without being recognizable to many. F√©lix F√©n√©on by F√©lix Vallotton (1898) F√©n√©on's lawyer, Thad√©e Natanson, offered him a post at La Revue Blanche after the trial and his subsequent expulsion from the War Office; he worked for that magazine until 1903. In that time, he went on to promote the works of Seurat and Signac through the magazine. He organized the first retrospective of Seurat's work in 1900. Seurat is known for a number of works, most significantly La Grande Jatte. Hajo D√ºchting, the author of Seurat, The Master of Pointillism notes that \\"Actually he [F√©n√©on] was the only critic who proved capable of articulating an appreciation of Seurat's picture, and the new method of painting it exemplified, in words notable for their objective tone\\".Hajo D√ºchting. Georges Seurat ,1859-1891: The Master of Pointillism, Taschen, 2000, After La Revue Blanche failed, F√©n√©on went to work for Le Matin, where he anonymously composed daily news \\"fillers\\", what the French call \\"faits-divers\\" or \\"sundry events\\", of three lines each. His authorship was not revealed until the 1940s. In these fillers he captured the complex subtleties of French daily life. The following examples highlight the wit typical of this critic of the mundane: * A criminal virago, Mlle Tulle, was sentenced by the Rouen court to 10 years hard labor, while her lover got five. * In a caf√© on Rue Fontaine, Vautour, Lenoir, and Atanis exchanged a few bullets regarding their wives, who were not present. * \\"If my candidate loses, I will kill myself,\\" M. Bellavoine, of Fresquienne, Seine-Inferieure, had declared. He killed himself. * Women suckling their infants argued the workers' cause to the director of the streetcar lines in Toulon. He was unmoved. After his post at Le Matin, F√©n√©on directed the Galerie Bernheim- Jeune and became increasingly involved with Neo-Impressionism, especially the art of Georges Seurat. He was the director of the gallery from 1906 to 1925. Before his retirement from the gallery, he is reported to have told a friend that he was \\"ready for idleness\\", and then he abruptly quit at the age of 63.

The former village development committee (VDC) was converted into a municipality on 18 May 2014 by merging the existing Sandhikharka, Wangla, Narapani, Khanchikot, Kimadada, Argha and Dibharna VDCs evdo. It is located, in a valley surrounded by hills, in the western part of the capital, Kathmandu. Geography Sandhikharka is situated between the two hills Argha and Khanchi, from which the district's name is derived. Sandhikharka has made a significant progress in road building and the training of people through various national and international non-governmental organisations. Although Sandhikharka is a small town, in recent years migration to developed countries has increased, with migrants sending billions of remittance to their families every year. Development of new houses, privately own luxury vehicles and the modern atmosphere itself have shown that the town has marvellously progressed in terms of economy and other sectors. Three small rivers; the Bangi, Ghoche and Bhadri merge at Chutrabeshi, within Sandhikharka. Therefore, people sometimes call the rivers Tribeni. There is one pitched road that connects to the national highway at Gorusinghe. However Arghakhanchi district was the first district in Nepal where all the VDCs were officially linked with the motorable roads. Sandhikharka is located around 960 meters above sea level. The climate changes from season to season. During summer, the maximum temperature reaches about 37¬∞C which can be significantly warm for some visitors and in the winter season the temperature is usually between 1-10¬∞C. In summer the rainfall is high hills in winter the surrounding higher hills remain cold and sometimes are covered in snow. History=Background= Many years ago the region was fully covered by the wild grasses called \\"Kharka\\". Farmers used to bring their cattle to graze on the land. This area was a boader of two small kingdoms i.e. Argha and Khanchi during Chaubisi rajya (24 principalities). There was always conflict about the ownership of the land between the two monarchs of this place. Later, in the interest of public welfare, the kings decided to make a treaty between the two little kingdoms. Treaty is the English translation of Sandhi which means a formally concluded and ratified agreement between states. The two states created the treaty for the land of \\"Kharka\\" which eventually led to the name of Sandhikharka, the headquarter of Arghakhanchi district. =Attack during Maoist insurgency= On September 8, 2002, the town was involved in a massive battle between the government forces and \\"thousands\\" of Maoists, reportedly led by the two most wanted terrorists of that time Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and Pampha Bhusal who come from the district. Heavily armed rebels engaged the bases of civilian police, armed police and the Royal Nepalese Army and overpowered them following a few hours of gunbattle. They torched all government buildings except the hospital, most never being rebuilt. About 50 policemen and 70 rebels were killed in the night-long battle, with almost 36 police injured. However, doubts remain over how many of the dead were actually Maoists. A second attack was launched on September 10, 2002, in which guerillas killed at least 65 security personnel, including soldiers, through 12 hours of fighting. Forty-one personnel were reported as injured in this attack. A telecommunication tower was destroyed as a result of the second attack, and reinforcements were rushed in by helicopter as well as a government-sponsored effort to hold the town. Unnamed leaders said lack of communication and a failed response from authorities which led to the government's defeats. CNN speculated that these attacks were aimed at disrupting the upcoming election by forcing the Nepali government to impose a state of emergency. =2005 Maoist attack= Maoists launched a third attack on March 4, 2005. This operation backfired, and the Nepali military killed 30 Maoists in what BBC called \\"one of the bloodiest clashes since the royal coup.\\" There were no casualties of troops. After forcing rebels into retreat, the military recovered \\"some crude bombs, terrorist documents and equipment used to operate mines\\". Despite his military's success, King Gyanendra of Nepal imposed a state of emergency, detained political party leaders and imposed censorship of the press. Nepal's military released a statement on the fighting: Demographics At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 8921. It had 6703 married people, with 185 having more than one spouse as of that census. Sandhikharka had 7706 literate people, and 2272 were attending school as of that census. This high literacy rate once drew people from outside Arghakhanchi District to Sandhikharka for its good schools. Education \\"'Shree Janajyoti Higher Secondary School\\"' and \\"'Shree Bhagawati Secondary school\\"' are two of the oldest public schools in Sandhikharka. Both of these institutions have successfully produced thousand of skilful graduates providing first class education with a focus on practical skills and professional relevance, which have helped its graduates giving excellent prospects for career development. The first English boarding school was \\"'Tribeni English Boarding school\\"' in Chutrabesi Sandhikharkha which was established in 1981 by a gentleman called Indra Gopal. After successfully running for few years this school shut down its operation due to some poor management problems. Later some existing members of Tribeni school formed another great school called Himali Children Academy which produced a very talented scholars. In the private sector '\\"Sandhikharka Green English Boarding School\\",\\"Arghakhanchi Higher Secondary boarding School\\",\\"Motherland English Boarding School\\" and \\"Gauri Shankar English boarding School\\"' have been able to hold a successful reputation to provide quality education. \\"'Panini Multiple Campus\\"' is the first and oldest college affiliated by Tribhuvan university in this district which is founded by Mr. Gyan Hari Acharya. This college is running many graduate and undergraduate courses covering various sectors of education. =Closure of schools= In October 2004, the Maoists ordered the closure of all private schools in Sandhikharka, as well as the rest of Arghakhanchi District. This came a year after they promised to keep the schools open if they cut their tuition fees by at least 20 percent, which was what occurred. According to schoolchild Pratiba Acharya, \\"Maoists thought that only rich people study in boarding schools like mine, so they want to close them.\\" Further, they destroyed schools who were operated by their enemies and those they disagreed with, after trying to change their curricula was to no avail. Many students were sent to public schools, which teach in Nepali. This posed two problems. For one thing, Nepali, though widely spoken and understood, is not invariably the mother tongue of all students in multilingual, multi-ethnic Nepal. In addition, private school students are accustomed to English as the primary medium of instruction. Government The purpose of Village Development Committees is to organise village people structurally at a local level and creating a partnership between the community and the public sector for improved service delivery system. A VDC has a status as an autonomous institution and authority for interacting with the more centralised institutions of governance in Nepal. In doing so, the VDC gives village people an element of control and responsibility in development, and also ensures proper utilization and distribution of state funds and a greater interaction between government officials, NGOs and agencies. The village development committees within a given area will discuss education, water supply, basic health, sanitation and income and will also monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.. In VDCs there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority. From each ward, there is also a chief that is elected along with these there are also four members elected or nominated. Media There are 4 radio stations, 1 community television and few local newspapers published weekly.

Plot Wanda Howard (Kay Francis) and Marie Bailey (Lilyan Tashman) go out with two balding, middle-aged businessmen from out of town (for $500 apiece) to help Jerry Chase (Alan Dinehart) close a sale. However, the women, who share a luxurious suite in an apartment building, have their African-American maid Hattie (Louise Beavers) disguise herself as their mother, waiting at the window, to avoid having to invite the men inside. Wanda is getting tired of how she makes a living, but she and Marie go aboard a yacht the next night to divert rich practical joker Benjamin Thomas (Eugene Pallette) and his handsome business associate Jim Baker (Joel McCrea). Jim knows that the women are paid \\"entertainment\\", but quickly finds himself falling for Wanda anyway, and vice versa. (When Jerry pays her for her efforts, Wanda tears up the check.) Once Jim realizes she genuinely loves him, he asks her to marry him. Although she is initially reluctant, she agrees. However, she informs Jim that there is one complication: her estranged husband Alex (Anderson Lawler). She asks him for a divorce, and he agrees. Meanwhile, Benjamin's wife, who is divorcing him because of his stinginess, shows up and asks Marie to stop making a fool of him. Marie realizes that Mrs Thomas (Lucille Gleason) is still in love with her husband, and comes up with a plan to cure him of his tightfisted ways. The next day, Marie steers Benjamin to the jewelry store where Mrs Thomas is waiting. Mrs Thomas, pretending not to see him, complains (in a loud voice) how cheap her husband is. Benjamin becomes so angry he buys Marie some expensive merchandise for about $50,000. That night, Alex crashes the birthday party Marie has arranged for Benjamin. He tells Jim that he wants $10,000 or he will name Jim as the co-respondent in the divorce. Alex insinuates that Wanda is part of the blackmail scheme. Believing the lie, Jim breaks up with Wanda. Wanda visits Alex in Brooklyn and demands he give the money back. He introduces her (as \\"cousin Wanda\\") to the ailing Mrs. Howard and their baby, the reasons he needs the money so desperately. He confesses that he got a divorce in Mexico 2 years before, and promises to pay her back once he is back on his feet financially. Touched, Wanda leaves without the check. Wanda decides to auction off enough of her possessions to her friends to raise $10,000 and pay Jim back. She also asks Marie to return her jewelry. Wanda gives Jim the proceeds; even before that, however, he has come to his senses, and the couple reconcile. Marie gives Benjamin's gifts to his wife and reunites that couple.

Early life and career  He attended the public schools and St. Joseph's College in Buffalo, New York. Then he became a saloon-keeper, first he opened two saloons on the waterfront, later another at the corner of Pearl and Eagle Streets. He was an alderman of Buffalo from 1885 to 1910, and at times president of the board of aldermen and acting mayor. As a Democrat, he was New York State Treasurer from 1911 to 1914, elected in 1910 and 1912. Kennedy had been the resident vice president at Buffalo of the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company of Baltimore, a bonding company connected with Tammany, but upon his election in 1910 had turned over his business to his son William who became Resident Secretary at Buffalo of the company. William Kennedy was linked in the bonding business with Charles F. Murphy, Jr., the nephew of Tammany Hall boss Charles F. Murphy. Both Kennedys, Murphy and others had been investigated by Governor Martin H. Glynn's Special Graft Investigator James W. Osborne and questioned by the Manhattan Grand Jury and District Attorney Charles S. Whitman.

Excavations  Archaeological excavations beneath San Giovanni in Laterano in 1934‚Äì1938Josi 1934; Colini 1944 uncovered part of the principia of the castra nova (new fort) of the Equites singulares Augusti. The building was square in shape and was fronted by a portico on the north side, creating a monumental fa√ßade that lead directly into the central courtyard. A rear range with the aedes at its centre occupied the southern end and short wings of two or three rooms formed the east and west sides. The room forming the northern end of the east wing could be identified as the schola curatorum by the inscriptionAE 1935.156 = 1954.83 = 1968.8b; HD023434; Lugli 1957 146a, b & c; Speidel 1994.54; Spinola 441; von Domaszewski 1967 p296 found in situ within, recording the consecration of the schola on January 1 AD 197. The inscription was incised on an inverted ionic capital, found lying beside a column of African granite that rose above ground level by 75 cm, with a foundation depth of 48 cm. That the capital and column were connected seems certain, particularly as the column supports the capital perfectly. On the plan prepared by Gismondi and published by ColiniColini, A. M. 1944. Storia e Topografia del Celio nell‚Äôantichit√† (APA (3rdseries) 7). Vatican: Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana. the room where the inscription was found contains the letter Œµ (p344 Fig 284), but this is only a label for the room and there is no indication as to where within it the inscription was actually discovered. Spinola,Spinola, G. 1998. ‚ÄòSculture, rilievi, decorazione architettonica iscrizioni e reperti ceramici‚Äô, in P. Liverani (ed.), Laterano I: Scavi sotto la Basilica di S.Giovani in Laterano.1: Material. Vatican: Citta del Vaticano. however argued that the location of the monument within this room was coincidental, being simply a side room to which outdated and unwanted inscriptions could be relegated. Instead he suggested that the inscription originally came from the aedes Colini 1944: 344 Fig 284: Room Œ¥ on the grounds that a dedication to the imperial cult would be more appropriately housed there. This hypothesis is not plausible, as dedications by military collegia to the domus divina occur in rooms throughout the principia at Lambaesis. This shows that monuments set up by individual associations were usually located in their own private space, rather than in a communal area. The room measured 7 meters long and 4.60 meters wide, with a doorway slightly off-centre in the west wall, 1.80 meters wide. There is no evidence for any other structural features or architectural embellishments to the room and the niche reported by Speidel Speidel, M. P. 1994. Die Denkm√§ler der Kaiserreiter Equites singulares Augusti. Cologne: Rheinland-verlag. p77. is a result of his misunderstanding of Josi's report. Josi Joshi, E. 1934. ‚ÄòScoperte nella Basilica Constantiniana al Laterano‚Äô, RAC, 11, 353-358. p351. in describing the door into the schola states that it is \\"√® posta quasi al centro della parete che guarda l‚Äôabside.\\" This does not mean, as Speidel is believed to have translated it, that the doorway was in the wall opposite an apse. Rather, Josi is referring to the apse of the cathedral above, as throughout his report he relates his discoveries to the features of the Basilica San Giovanni, which were at the time clearly visible to him. Following this interpretation the doorway is indeed in the wall that faced the apse of the basilica, so that his observation was not referring to the schola at all. Certainly it is difficult to identify any structural feature altering the rectangular aspect of the room in any of the excavation photographs or from visiting the remains today. Part of the wall decoration survives as plaster painted dark red with a geometric pattern marked out in thin white lines. The frescoes are badly damaged and survive only to about two meters in height, with the lower footings missing and the upper destruction level roughly even, though irregular. The only discernible decorative element appears as three white lines rising vertically, with the outer two lines then turning at opposing right angles to form the horizontal upper edge of a rectangular panel. The fresco, along with the remains of the principia itself, were destroyed only a few feet above the floor level. The dating of the fresco is also uncertain, though it reflects a general scheme visible in the other rooms, of geometric patterns in white picked out on a dark red background. There is no evidence for the floor and it must have consisted of materials that were able to be recycled prior to its demolition. The column and capital may have acted as an altar, comparable to an example of an ionic capital employed in such a way at the mithraeum of the domus on Via Giovanni Lanza.Gysens 1996: 260‚Äì261 Speidel1994: 78 suggested it could have once supported a statue of Minerva, more likely Minerva Augusta as the dedication to the goddess contained in the text suggests. Spinola 1998: 88; Personal communication 2001 argues against this view, noting that there is no sign on the surface of the capital of dowel-holes by which the statue could be securely attached. These, however, may have been unnecessary as the statue would have been placed on a firm broad base in safe location. In general, the schola of the curatores indicates that a functional room could easily be adapted to the purposes of a schola without causing any radical change in its nature, nor, it follows, does it need to identify itself as a schola by adopting any obvious structural indications of this role.

He was elected to D√°il √âireann as an independent Teachta D√°la (TD) at the 1957 general election for the Dublin South-Central constituency. Murphy was a former member of the Irish Republican Army who had been interned in the 1940s.Joe King, \\"When the unemployed elected their own TD\\" , Workers Solidarity 33 (1991) At the time of his election, he was an unemployed carpenter. He was the candidate of the Unemployed Protest Committee (UPC), which had been formed on 12 January 1957. He resigned his seat on 13 May 1958 in protest at the indifference of the main political parties to the plight of the unemployed. After his resignation he subsequently emigrated with his family to Canada but returned to Ireland in 1964. He died on 11 July 1984. Early years Murphy was born in 1920 at the back of Synge Street, Dublin. He was the second youngest son of a carpenter and had five brothers and five sisters. His father, a well-known athlete who won the all-Ireland walking championship in 1903, was active in the republican movement and was a founder-member of the National Union of Woodworkers.Who Is Jack Murphy?, Martin Mooney (The Irish Democrat, April 1957) Murphy joined Fianna √âireann at the age of 10. Up to the age of 14 he attended St Mary's National School, Rathmines, and then started work as an apprentice carpenter, while attending Bolton Street Technical College, now Dublin Institute of Technology in the evenings. He became a member of the Irish Republican Army at 16. He was also an active trade union member from an early age as demonstrated when, as a carpenters apprentice, he became one of the leaders of a strike on the River Liffey Reservoir Scheme (popularly known as the Poulaphouca Scheme). The strike lasted several months until only three of the original committee remained, with Murphy being one of them. Arrested in 1941 by the Fianna F√°il government, he was interned with a number of other republicans in the Curragh until the end of The Emergency in 1945. These four years afforded him time to study, broadening his interest and outlook. A fluent Irish speaker, he was interviewed in Irish for his entry into the National College of Art and Design after his release from the Curragh. In the Mansion House Exhibition of 1950 he won an arts and crafts certificate for his leather and craftwork. He returned to his trade of carpentry where he was quickly re-elected shop steward after he took a leading part in several actions and strikes for better conditions, most notably the strike to end the campaign of sackings by employers which took place in 1953. However, in 1956, during which record unemployed figures were reached in Ireland,A Story of Victory, Samuel Nolan (The Irish Democrat, April 1957) he found himself one of the many thousands out of work. He emigrated to England, but returned after four months as he missed his family. He later said: \\"I am against emigration for many reasons, one is that it wrecks family life. When I worked in England I nearly broke my heart thinking of my wife and youngsters all the time I was there. Here in Ireland the clergy and politicians are always preaching about the sanctity of the Christian family, but they do nothing about the unemployment and emigration that is breaking up thousands of families.\\" Protest committee Murphy came to the conclusion that the only way to fight unemployment was to do it in Ireland with an organised movement. As he saw it, with national emigration running at 40‚Äì50,000 per year, \\"Irish capital is being exported abroad and the Irish working class are being exported with it.\\" On 12 January 1957 with 11 other Dublin men they formed the Unemployed Protest Committee (UPC) for the purpose of protesting against the unemployment situation, and Murphy was named as secretary....The issue was clear. So, hardly more than twelve weeks ago, with 11 other men, typical Dublin workers of the best type, like himself, he (Jack) was involved in forming the committee for the purpose of protesting against unemployment. It was decided to focus the eyes of the country on their plight. He became secretary. From the very first, the movement had the support of the Trade Unions..., Mairin Mooney (The Irish Democrat, April 1957) While some articles and papers written after the event later imply that the UPC had been a political organisation, Murphy himself never intended the UPC to be either a political organisation or political party. He explained: \\"The UPC was not a political organisation as such. It was intended to spotlight the problem of unemployment and emigration. That was my intention when I went to the D√°il\\".Why I've left Ireland, Jim Flanagan (Sunday Review, 29 March 1959) To focus the eyes of the nation on the plight of the unemployed the committee organised a series of well-attended orderly marches through Dublin streets of a colourful yet serious nature. The marches were usually preceded by a home made-coffin; \\"We organised marches through the city. We hoped to arouse the conscience of the Nation. We carried a black coffin, symbolising our only hope if we did not fight.\\".Emigrate, Starve or Fight, Jack Murphy (Protest ‚Äì Organ of the Unemployment Protest Committee, Vol 1, No 1, July 1957) However, despite their pageantry the UPC marches seem to have had limited impact on the employment situation and on the policy makers. 1957 general election The fall of the government on 4 February 1957, due to the withdrawal of support by Se√°n MacBride's Clann na Poblachta, led to the 1957 general election and provided an opportunity for the UPC to dramatically escalate their protests. Seeing the need to put employment on to the political agenda the UPC decided to run a candidate. Murphy said at the time: \\"We thought of all types of schemes to approach the politicians, we would ask them to make a statement from their election platforms on their policy to solve unemployment. But again we knew that they would easily agree to such a suggestion during the election campaign , just as easily as they would forget the unemployed after they were elected. No, the only way to make these people understand that we were a force to be reckoned with was to contest a seat in the election.\\" Two names were put forward as possible candidates at a meeting in Parnell Square: Sam Nolan, and Jack Murphy. After much consideration it was decided that Murphy would be more suitable. When some Committee members suggested that Nolan might be the better choice, Peadar O'Donnell argued that, with a background as a leading member of the Communist party, his candidacy might frighten voters away. Nolan himself pointed out that his Communist credentials would have a negative impact as anti-communist hysteria was rife following the Soviet invasion of Hungary of 1956. It was decided that Murphy, with his republican background, would run in the Dublin South-Central constituency, firstly because this inner city constituency had a high population density which would be more convenient to canvass compared than a large sprawling area, and secondly it housed the largest Labour Exchange in Dublin City, Werburgh Street. This location offered a platform for the UPC to get their message across. They distributed leaflets outside Werburgh Street while across the River Liffey on Dublin's North side, they broadcast election messages from a UPC office at the Dublin Trades' Union Council in Gardiner Street, with hired and borrowed loadspeakers, to men signing on at the nearby Gardiner Street Labour Exchange. The task of raising the ¬£100 deposit necessary to stand as a candidate was taken on by Peader O'Donnell. He received ¬£25 each from four friends including Fr. Counihane, a Jesuit priest who sympathised with the cause of Labour;, Digby, the owner of Pye Radio; a Fianna F√°il politician called Murry; and Toddy O'Sullivan, manager of the Gresham Hotel. It has been said of Dublin City that \\"a good cause will always find support in an unexpected way\\"; the campaign was run on a shoestring budget. Murphy said of their financial situation, \\"We had no funds. With bobs and pennies sacrificed from doles and unemployment money we fought on\\". After an appeal for volunteers to help in the campaign, the UPC soon found that they had a willing army of unemployed people who helped out in what ever way they could. They canvassed over 14,000 houses during the campaign. Teams of unemployed painters hand painted hundreds of posters and got their message across with very effective whitewash slogan writing. The campaign lifted the spirits of all involved as it gave them a feeling of hope and a sense of direction. The idea of unemployed people finally standing up and taking control of their own lives aroused great enthusiasm and support. Encouraging letters of support and subscriptions from well wishers began arriving at the Protest office in Derby Square, Dublin. One woman by the name of Elizabeth Faye typed thousands of letters on her portable typewriter every night after she'd put her children to bed. With his trademark black beret and straight talking approach, Murphy proved a popular candidate. He emerged victorious with 3,036 votes thus becoming the first unemployed man ever elected to a national legislature. His seat was gained at the expense of the Labour Party who had fielded Roddy Connolly (son of James Connolly) as their candidate, though many Labour activists in the area campaigned for Murphy. Murphy was considered an independent as he was not affiliated to any of the established political parties like Fianna F√°il, which won the majority of seats at the 1957 general election. The 16th D√°il While many of his unemployed supporters considered the fact that Murphy had been elected as victory in itself, neither they nor Murphy had anticipated the task he faced inside the D√°il. His maiden speech was greeted by sneers and sniggers from the professional politicians in the D√°il and set the scene for what was to follow. The suspicion and disdain with which Murphy was regarded with by established parliamentary members meant that initially he could not get answers to even to the most basic of his queries ‚Äì such as how much unemployment relief money was to be spent in Dublin. In contrast, the same politicians had no problem in addressing trivial concerns like those raised by Fine Gael's Jack Belton when he asked about the \\"hardship imposed on cricket clubs because of the cost of cricket balls\\". Despite this, over his term, Murphy stubbornly persisted and used every opportunityto ignite serious consideration within the D√°il on questions surrounding poverty, emigration and unemployment assistance. He also used his vote in protest to remind the established parties of their pre- election promises; as exemplified by his statement on 20 March 1957 in opposition to the election of the Fianna F√°il leader √âamon de Valera as Taoiseach: > I do not propose to support the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, > despite the fact that Deputy de Valera has publicly stated that his first > task will be to solve unemployment. I have heard these promises before and > my presence here is a symbol of broken promises and should be taken as a > warning that emigration and unemployment will no longer be suffered in > silence. This election proves that the people have given Fianna F√°il the > task of solving unemployment. I realise that that problem will not be solved > in a few weeks and that any Government should be given an opportunity of > putting its programme into effect. I will support fully any scheme which > will reduce unemployment and emigration. I hope my simple statement will be > met with understanding, both inside and outside the House. Murphy did not limit his role to criticism. He also made suggestions for new projects which could create jobs > \\"In view of the fact that there is still widespread unemployment in the > building industry, would the Taoiseach consider taking more drastic measures > to bring about a revival of house building? In Dublin City, we have no > concert hall, no proper Houses of Parliament and we need more modern > municipal buildings. The country needs these things very badly and they > would give much-needed employment to building workers. I speak, Sir, with a > sense of urgency which springs from looking at unfortunate men trying to > survive in present conditions.\\" On occasion he also attempted to force votes on issues he was concerned with, such as the motion for increasing assistance to the unemployed on 25 March 1958: > \\"I wish to state that I am appalled at the callous indifference of the > Parliamentary Secretary... The statement that there is no money to give > these unfortunate people a further increase will be regarded by decent > Christian people as a downright lie. I am still convinced that, with any > kind of honest effort, the lot of the poorer sections of our people could be > improved. The unemployed and the old age pensioners will continue to press > for elementary Christian justice. I have asked, and I now repeat my request, > for a free vote of the House on this issue.\\" Despite his best efforts it quickly became obvious that his perceived status within the D√°il as a \\"street politician\\" meant he was seen as a threat to the established order. Established politicians were more concerned with the votes he had taken away from existing political dynasties than the national issues he was trying to address. When he not being strategically ignored within the D√°il he was under attack from the members of the house, as demonstrated by Fine Gael's Stephen Barrett, who on 12 June 1957 declared the UPC (and therefore Murphy himself) part of \\"a new communist assault\\" on Ireland. As a result, Murphy made little headway in the political process within the D√°il. In the end he admitted in despair that \\"I found that Leinster House was more a centre of political activity and useless talk than a place where plans could be made to ease the lot of the unfortunate\\". Hunger strike Murphy's troubles were greatly multiplied once the new Fianna F√°il government's budget was revealed to be a particularly severe one, and including planning for the ending of food subsidies which was going to hit his support base of the unemployed and low paid workers particularly hard. Murphy later said: \\"In my time in the D√°il and even before that, I was in many of their [the unemployed] homes. I saw hunger and misery, ill-nourished children and despairing parents. That is still continuing. I knew when the 'famine budget' of 1957 was brought in that their position would be worsened.\\" Murphy tried first to oppose the impending budget within the D√°il. In his statement of 15 May 1957 he contrasted the budget sharply with the unfilled pre-election promises of Fianna F√°il : \\"On behalf of my unemployed colleagues, I want to make it quite clear that we are opposed completely to this Budget, firstly, because it does nothing to relieve unemployment and there is no indication of any plans by the Government to bring about increased employment. In fact, this Budget will worsen the unemployment position by reducing the purchasing power of the people. Secondly, we are opposed to it because it inflicts a greater hardship on the suffering unemployed, old age pensioners, widows and the lower income groups. The demands of the unemployed are quite simple and realistic: that the Government should immediately take what measures it intends taking to alleviate unemployment. We do not want merely words and paper proposals; we want action based on concrete proposals.\\" However given the majority that Fianna F√°il enjoyed within the government, Murphy realised that even if he could force a vote on the budget he would inevitably lose and so further debate on the issue would serve little purpose but to waste time. He next tried to put pressure on the government to scale back the proposed cuts via \\"people power\\", stating \\"the unemployed are a force to be reckoned with. Flesh and blood, not just something the statistician jumbles around with.\\", he began mobilising supporters to stage a series of high profile street demonstrations. To escalate things further, along with two other members of the UPC (Tommy Kavanagh and Jimmy Byrne) Murphy began a hunger strike in opposition to the budget. Each evening they addressed thousands of supporters who assembled at protest meetings in Dublin at the corner of Abbey Street and O'Connell Street. The hunger strikers initially garnered much support from trade unions. Against this background a series of one day industrial strikes and actions against the government became a real possibility. However, on the fourth day of the protest, after winning the small concession from the Government with the announcement that it would reintroduce controls on the price of bread, it was decided to end the hunger strike. The ending of the hunger strike meant organised industrial strike action was no longer considered possible. Resignation Realising he could not stand against the proposed budget on his own in the D√°il and that the demonstrations on the streets were not having the desired political impact, Murphy then tried another approach by contacting established society figures in an effort to garner support to lobby against the cuts. Unfortunately he made the mistake of attempting to enlist the aid of the powerful and conservative Catholic Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid. McQuaid eventually did meet with Murphy alone but instead of providing any assistance to the embattled TD he began to put pressure on Murphy to break with the UPC on the basis that communists were using him via the committee. McQuaid's official response to his meeting with Murphy was that he could not interfere in political decisions ‚Äì an announcement which flew in the face of his actions the previous year when he publicly dictated to the previous Government over the ill-fated Mother and Child Scheme. Shortly afterwards McQuaid formally denounced the unemployment movement ‚Äì a move which at a single stroke ended the possibility of Murphy enlisting any support from other church figures or from any other high profile individuals. In addition to such major public reversals, Murphy also faced with a growing dissatisfaction at the lack of political progress coming from supporters. Moreover, he was by now being forced to defend against pressure coming from within the ranks of the UPC itself for him to take a more left-leaning agenda. Murphy himself had been adamant since the beginning that the UPC had been formed solely to spotlight the issues of emigration and unemployment in Ireland and therefore was never intended to be \\"a political entity as such\\" ‚Äì but its surprise election success had attracted many new supporters, not all of whom shared his views. Once Murphy had been elected to Leinster House, he became largely removed from the day-to-day operations of the committee. Without his stewardship the UPC itself had become increasingly dominated by other individuals who saw the UPC not as he did, as a vehicle solely dedicated to highlighting emigration/unemployment issues, but rather as a potentially viable platform for wider agendas and sweeping political change in Ireland. Their repeated attempts to influence Murphy to promote their agenda ‚Äì and his steadfast refusal to do the same ‚Äì meant that the UPC meetings became characterised by growing friction, with clashes between the highly charged- political committee and the increasingly marginalised Murphy becoming more common. Under severe strain and personal attack from all sides Murphy thus began to disassociate himself from UPC activities. In August 1957 he formally broke with the committee. Ultimately, less than a year later, on Saturday 13 May 1958 he yielded to the mounting pressure and resigned his seat in protest at the indifference of the main political parties to the plight of the unemployed. The subsequent by-election was won by Patrick Cummins of Fianna F√°il. Of his resignation Murphy later stated: \\"I was fed up with the callous indifference of the big parties to the situation of the workers. I resigned as a protest against appalling indifference of those parties to the unemployed... When Mr de Valera was nominated for Taoiseach, I opposed him because he had broken his promise on unemployment and emigration. I told the house that my presence there was a symbol of broken promises. I said that I would support any scheme to put an end to mass unemployment and emigration. But in my 15 months in the D√°il, no-one put forward such a scheme.\\" Emigration to Canada Immediately following his resignation as a TD, Murphy, now once again unemployed, discovered to his dismay that as a result of his cards not being stamped during his time in office he was no longer eligible for full assistance and was reduced to living on the meagre sum of ¬£2 1 shilling per week for his entire family. Faced with this situation he reluctantly made the decision to emigrate to Canada in 1959. He stated \\"Since Christmas I have been unable to get any work, apart from a couple of weeks. The building trade is finished. But there is plenty of work if only the Government would put up the money for it instead of putting millions into the purchase of jet planes. Irish tradesmen have emigrated in thousands. And they will continue to go. There is no hope for them here. Many people will say that I am quitting, pulling out in failure. But mostly they will be people with good, solid jobs. IF I SAW THE SLIGHTEST HOPE, I WOULD STAY. I REPEAT THAT. But it broke my heart to see my wife trying to get along on a few shillings a week.\\" Canada Following his resignation, Murphy emigrated to Saskatchewan, Canada, where his sister Molly and her husband Micheal Durnin lived. Once he arrived he set about seeking employment but carpentry work in Saskatchewan at that time was hard to get. In January 1960 he was visited by another Dublin man from Francis St named Joe Johnston who at the time was in the Canadian Armed Forces, Signal Corps. Johnston had just been posted to Regina after a large winter army exercise near Alberta, he heard about an Irish family who were living in Regina and tracked them down. He says \\"The first time I met Jack, I was shocked to find him and his family living in a small 1 bedroom shack without heating buried under huge snow drifts. It was bitterly cold and their situation was grim. It turns out that while Jack had managed to get some work as a carpenter with a company called \\"Sash And Door\\" during the Spring, he had been laid off in the winter due to the seasonal nature of Canadian construction (which of course he hadn't been aware of before his arrival)\\". Johnston noted wryly at the time that despite Murphy's emigration to Canada \\"It seemed things were going from bad to worse for Jack, and he was just as unemployed in Regina as he had been in Dublin\\". However, despite these initial difficulties, Murphy eventually did find part-time work in carpentry. His woodworking skills were ably demonstrated by a detailed carving he did for a Sergeant Stankey of the Canadian Army NCO's mess which he was introduced to by Johnston. Thanks to this and other jobs he did for members of the same establishment, Murphy was eventually voted in as an associate member. Johnston recalled later \\"Being an associate member of the NCO's mess was a much sought- after honour in that region. It was quite funny to me at the time, although not to some others who voted against us, that Jack (who was after all a convicted republican) was invited to be an associate member of an army mess. For his part, Jack made some notable contributions ‚Äì some beautiful carvings ‚Äì including one particular one I remember which had a maple leaf and shamrock intertwined which was proudly put by Stankey behind the bar on display\\". \\"It's true Jack had a colourful past, but the great thing about Canada was that at that time they didn't hold sins committed in the \\"old world\\" against you. In the final analysis I think the most people there recognised right away that regardless of his political background Jack was an honest man, with an excellent work ethic and a real craftsman who held his own work and that of others to very high standards. In fact once word got out about his experience and skills, he became very much sought after by the staff and regulars alike because of his first rate advice on any building project or maintenance of houses. And of course he was a terrific speaker and debater, and unlike many he was good company no matter on which side of the political debate you stood. So despite the stiff initial opposition to him from some quarters, eventually everyone came around and he became very popular.\\" Murphy made a number of other friends while in Regina including Al Thompson, who was from a very old famous building company family, and was married into the Lavery family who had very strong attachments to Ireland. He was also a friend of Arthur Lavery who later returned to Ireland and became a solicitor. After a number of years, due to homesickness, Murphy returned with his family to Ireland as the economic situation in his native country had improved and there was more opportunities for work than existed in 1959 when emigration was at its peak. Return to Ireland Murphy returned to Ireland with his family in 1964. He lived for a short spell in Dublin's York Street before moving out to the suburbs of Coolock, on the north side of Dublin City. He continued working as a carpenter on various building sites around Dublin. His last place of employment was at Cadburys in Coolock. He worked there until 1982 when he took ill. He died on 11 July 1984, aged 64 years. Accusations In the wake of his resignation and emigration to Canada, Murphy became a convenient scape-goat and was pilloried by established politicians, rivals and even certain former supporters. Indeed for the remainder of his life he endured an unrelentingly hostile and negative campaign from many quarters which attempted to put an unfavourable \\"spin\\" on both his intentions and his actions as a TD. He later responded to several of the chief accusations laid against him in the article \\"Why I left Ireland\\" as told to Jim Flanagan which was published in The Sunday Review on 29 March 1959. One accusation is he used his influence as a TD to cheat the system and assist supporters. However Murphy himself stated emphatically to Jim Flanagan in this article how he was careful to avoid abusing his influence as a TD. For example, he refused to get jobs for people, as other TDs both before and after him did as a matter of course, rather electing to help people via existing support structures: \\"I did what I could, for they were all my friends... [but] there was far too much place hunting, [however] as far as I could I helped those who were in trouble, mainly through the labour exchange.\\" Another allegation of note which was circulated against Murphy after his emigration to Canada was that over the fifteen months he worked as a TD he had secretly hoarded large amounts of money from his monthly salary at the expense of his supporters and then \\"ran off to Canada with a fortune\\". This accusation is evidently disproved by even the most cursory examination of Murphy's later status and circumstance. Immediately following his resignation he was once again unemployed and in a move contrary to his own avowed principles and stated desires he was forced to emigrate due to a combination of a lack of funds and being blacklisted by employers for being too political. His subsequent dire initial situation in Canada, his continued lack of money upon his return to Ireland, and the telling fact that he worked for the remainder of his life in factories and building sites as a carpenter until his premature death all clearly demonstrate daily financial struggle. Moreover, during his time in office, articles of the period saluted Murphy for distributing the majority of his salary in donations to families in distress and old persons in dire poverty ‚Äì with he himself drawing from his parliamentary pay no more than the equivalent salary of a qualified carpenter. Other charges later laid against Murphy take the form of more direct ad hominem attacks. There were several examples of these, most notably those catalogued in \\"The Communist Party of Ireland, A Critical History, Part 3O'Connor Lysaght, \\"CPI, A Critical History\\", The Communist Party of Ireland, A Critical History, Part 3 (1976)\\" which bewails Murphy's \\"political inexperience\\" along with implied egotism behind the assertion that he resigned and emigrated because he could \\"neither act as D√°il mouthpiece for or national leader of the movement\\". This article attributes an egotism to Murphy which is notably absent in any other recorded sources. Indeed, independent articles of the day (that is written and published by neither the UPC nor its associates) refer to Murphy as \\"quite free from personal vanity or presumption\\" and speak of his \\"honesty, integrity and sincerity\\". In addition on no occasion did Murphy ever seek, or claim, \\"leadership\\" of the unemployed or any other movement ‚Äì on the contrary it is very noticeable that in both his own published writings and in his speeches to the D√°il he very seldom refers to himself at all (preferring to talk in terms of \\"we, the unemployed\\") but whenever he does speak of himself in first person, he referred to himself as merely a \\"representative\\" of the unemployed. A final accusation made against Murphy in absentia after his emigration was that he resigned and left Ireland because he was not up to the task of solving the emigration and unemployment issues or that he reneged on promises to do the same. In fact Murphy himself explicitly stated at the time of his election that he never intended to solve the unemployment crises. Instead he specifically says that his sole purpose in the D√°il is to allow the unemployed voice their concern and put pressure on the political parties in government to make good on election promises to address these critical issues: \\"We shall continue to focus the plight of the unemployed in D√°il √âireann by our representation, who was not put there to solve this scourge of unemployment, but to put added pressure on the political parties who have it in their power to bring about some measure of relief to the unemployed and to ensure the future of the employed.\\" Murphy's repeated his efforts to bring these same urgent national issues to debate in the D√°il during his term. The numerous recorded speeches he made during his term in office show his integrity, sincerity and the commitment he had to fulfilling his promise to highlighting the plight of the unemployed ‚Äì a commitment which ultimately exacted a heavy toll on both his own health and his family. \\"I tried hard all along and no one can say that I did not try to spot-light the problems and evils of our country.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * 1920 births 1984 deaths Independent TDs Irish carpenters Irish republicans Members of the 16th D√°il Politicians from County Dublin People from Portobello, Dublin ","title":"Jack Murphy (Irish politician)"},{"id":"18570554","text":"National Route 391 is a national highway of Japan connecting Kushiro, Hokkaid≈ç and Abashiri, Hokkaid≈ç in Japan, with a total length of 152.6 km (94.82 mi).

She provided target service to ships training at this great base until 5 February 1945, when she was outward bound for action waters. Arriving at Eniwetok 15 February, she reported for duty with the U.S. 5th Fleet, and sailed to Iwo Jima, where she had mooring and salvage duty from 28 February to 12 April. The first portion of this duty came as bitter action raged ashore, and enemy air attacks still menaced American shipping. =End- of-war operations= After routine repairs at Guam, Canotia arrived at Ulithi 14 June to install and maintain nets. After the Japanese surrender, Canotia cruised the small islands of the western Caroline Islands searching for American and Allied ex-prisoners of war, or Japanese soldiers. She received the surrender of the garrison on Lamotrek, and destroyed a Japanese supply dump on Olimarao. Between 23 September and 1 October, she removed net defenses at Ulithi and Kossol Roads.

It is a development of the SIAI Marchetti S.211/Aermacchi S-211. Development=Origins= During 1997, Italian aircraft manufacturer Aermacchi acquired SIAI Marchetti; this purchase included the rights to the latter's S-211, a jet-powered trainer aircraft. In 2004, the company announced its intention to develop an improved version of the S-211, then referred to as the S-311. At the time, Aermacchi was also developing the M-346 Master, which serves as a lead-in fighter trainer; while vaguely similar to the M-311, the latter is considerably smaller and intended to perform both the basic and advanced training syllabus, as well tactical training functions, as an alternative to single-engined turboprop-powered competitors.Collins, Peter. \\"FLIGHT TEST: Alenia Aermacchi M-311 - Bridging the gap.\\" Flight International, 7 May 2007.Doyle, Andrew. \\"M-311 set to face pilot scrutiny.\\" Flight International, 13 September 2005. Being based on the S-211, the M-311 features an advanced new cockpit, various structural enhancements (including the increased use of composite materials) and a new powerplant in the form of the Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5C turbofan engine.\\"Aermacchi chapter.\\" Flight International, 21 July 2004. The changes allowed for an extended fatigue life of 15,000 flight hours, increased intervals between overhauls and a reduced turnaround time between sorties. According to the manufacturer, the M-311's life-cycle costs may be brought into line with those of its turboprop rivals, the direct operating cost is only 5% higher despite a fuel-burn penalty of roughly 30%. Aermacchi's competitive analysis director Sergio Coniglio stated low maintenance costs shall be a decisive factor in the M-311's competitiveness against increasingly sophisticated competition. On 1 June 2005, the first prototype aircraft conducted its maiden flight.. A second aircraft, which had previously been used as a technology demonstrator during the 1990s, incorporating most features of the envisioned production model, was also produced. By September of that year, the prototype had reportedly flown 30 flights, and was set to receive software upgrades to enhance its cockpit displays. During July 2006, one of the prototypes was displayed at the Royal International Air Tattoo.Hoyle, Craig. \\"RIAT: Alenia Aermacchi M-311 jet trainer in the black at Fairford.\\" Flight International, 14 July 2006. During mid-2006, the company announced that it had forecast demand for a production run of up to 350 M-311s by 2030.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Fresh sales prompt MB-339 advanced jet trainer revival.\\" Flight International, 1 August 2006. On 28 May 2008, Boeing and Alenia signed a joint agreement to cooperate on marketing, sales, training and product support for both the M-346 and M-311. =Relaunch= During 2012, the M-311 was re-designated by Alenia Aermacchi as the M-345 HET. During October 2014, it was announced that the Williams International FJ44-4M turbofan engine had been selected to power the in-development trainer, having overcome rivaling bids from both Honeywell and Pratt & Whitney. The company stated that Williams' engine has been selected due to its performance in the business aviation sector and with the Swedish Air Force's re-engined fleet of Saab 105 trainers. Shortly thereafter, Alenia Aermacchi begun installing the 3,400lb- thrust FJ44-4M onto its flight-test aircraft, replacing the existing P&W; Canada JT15D units. In March 2015, Alenia and ENAER of Chile signed an agreement to jointly manufacture and sell the M-345 HET in South America.\\"Enaer signs a Memorandum of Understanding with largest Italian Aeronautics company Finmeccanica-Alenia Aermacchi.\\" Leonardo S.p.A., 25 March 2015. On 1 June 2015, Alenia Aermacchi presented the M-345 to the DGA for the nascent French replacement program for its Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets. On 20 September 2018, Alenia Aermacchi signed an agreement with South African defense company Paramount Group to evaluate and develop a combat-orientated model of the M-345 to suit the requirements of prospective African customers.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Leonardo eyes African market for armed M-345.\\" Flight International, 27 September 2018. The M-345 first flew on 29 December 2016. During January 2017, the first order for the type was placed by the Italian Air Force.Hoyle, Craig. \\"Italian deal opens M-345 order book.\\" Flight International, 16 January 2017. The first production-standard M-345 was flown from Venegono Superiore in December 2018; at this point, service entry with the Italian Air Force was anticipated to occur during 2020. Design The Aermacchi M-345 is a compact twin-seat shoulder-wing monoplane trainer aircraft. It is based on the earlier SIAI-Marchetti S.211, which features both structural and equipment improvements. The airframe has been strengthened, while a glass cockpit and modern avionics have been installed. It is furnished with a retractable tricycle landing gear, powered by a single Williams FJ44-4M-34 turbofan engine. As a basic trainer, the M-345 is designed to complement the Aermacchi M-346 advanced trainer. It has been designed with a secondary close air support capability, being furnished with five underwing hard points. Both the pilot and instructor, which are seated in a tandem configuration, are provided with hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. Both crew are seated upon Martin-Baker-built 10LKs 'zero-zero' ejection seats. The cockpit's internal dimensions have been increased to be broadly identical to those of the BAE Systems Hawk. The displays and all light sources have been selected for compatibility with night-vision goggles (NVG). The environmental control system cools the cockpit for ground operations in temperatures up to ISA +35¬∫C (95¬∫F); the presence of an on-board oxygen-generating system (OBOGS) removes the need for oxygen bottles. The M-345's glass cockpit features various avionics and electronics. Displays include three identical 5 x 7in (125 x 180mm) colour multifunction liquid-crystal displays, a forward-mounted wide-angle head-up display (HUD), while the rear position is provided with a full-sized HUD repeater via a fourth dedicated multifunction display. The integrated avionics suite includes dual mission computer]s, embedded Global Positioning System/inertial navigation system, integrated data recorders and, optionally, a digital moving map, stores management system, and an embedded simulation capability (identical to that offered on the M-346); the latter being able to display virtual radar targets and radar warning receiver (RWR) threats. Conventional ailerons are hydraulically-boosted, with provisions for manual reversion, while both the elevator and rudder are mechanically actuated via pushrods, with three-axis electrical trimming. Secondary flight controls are simple trailing edge flaps, which are electrically actuated, and a belly- mounted air brake, which is electrically controlled and hydraulically actuated. The 207bar (3,000lb/in2) hydraulic system is used to operate the landing gear, wheel brakes, air brake and aileron boost; the electrical system is DC with internal-battery engine start. The M-345 is suited for 'on- condition' maintenance via a health and usage monitoring system, while its most common maintenance and serving requirements are intended to be suitable for semi-skilled personnel. Operational history During January 2017, Italy placed an initial order for five M-345s for the Italian Air Force (IAF). The service has a requirement for up to 45 aircraft to replace Aermacchi MB-339s used in both the basic training role and by the Frecce Tricolori aerobatic team.Nicolli Air International July 2017, p. 11. In June 2019, Italy placed an follow-on order for an additional 13 M-345s, bringing the total up to 18. In May 2020, the M-345 achieved its initial military certification.

John Nutt's most famous publication was the first three editions of Jonathan Swift's A Tale of a Tub, but he and Elizabeth were important both as publishers and sellers of many works of English law and literature. John Nutt remains an obscure individual, with only his death well attested in 1716. Elizabeth Carr married John Nutt in 1692, and she was at that time already a practicing \\"mercury,\\" or seller of newspapers and pamphlets. Independent of her husband, she is referred to as a significant and honest seller by John Dunton in 1705. She therefore brought a retailing business to the marriage, and John brought a printing house. The couple lived in the Savoy off of the Strand in London for nearly all of their adult lives, and they sold books, pamphlets, and news sheets by the Royal Exchange. John Nutt had a shop in the Savoy at least by 1705, when he published Swift's first major satire the year before (1703/4 and 1704). That same year, he obtained an exclusive patent to print law books. When John Nutt died in 1716, Elizabeth took over the printing business and had her son, Richard, manage the presses, and Richard took over the publication of legal writings in 1722. Elizabeth also worked with Anne Dodd, the most famous distributor of books of the day. She would print books and sell them to Dodd for retail sale, as well as sell them in her own stalls. The Nutts were allied with Tory and general opposition causes during the Hanoverian period, and she and her family were arrested for selling London Evening Post, which Richard Nutt published, The Craftsman, and Mist's Weekly Journal. Nevertheless, Elizabeth and her family prospered and extended their ownership of news shops, stalls, and book sellers. Her name continued to appear as a printer on imprints to 1741, and she is listed as a book seller until her death in 1746.
