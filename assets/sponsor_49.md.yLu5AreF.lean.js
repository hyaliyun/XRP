Electric current through the element encounters resistance, resulting in heating of the element. Unlike the Peltier effect, this process is independent of the direction of current.  Heating elements types  Tubular electric heater A folded tubular heating element from an espresso machine A coiled heating element from an electric toaster Metal Resistance wire: Metallic resistance heating elements may be wire or ribbon, straight or coiled. They are used in common heating devices like toasters and hair dryers, furnaces for industrial heating, floor heating, roof heating, pathway heating to melt snow, dryers, etc. The most common classes of materials used include: * Nichrome: Most resistance wire heating elements use nichrome 80/20 (80% nickel, 20% chromium) wire, ribbon, or strip. Nichrome 80/20 is an ideal material, because it has relatively high resistance and forms an adherent layer of chromium oxide when it is heated for the first time. Material beneath this layer will not oxidize, preventing the wire from breaking or burning out. * Kanthal (FeCrAl) wires * Cupronickel (CuNi) alloys for low temperature heating * Etched foil: Etched foil elements are generally made from the same alloys as resistance wire elements, but are produced with a subtractive photo-etching process that starts with a continuous sheet of metal foil and ends with a complex resistance pattern. These elements are commonly found in precision heating applications like medical diagnostics and aerospace. Ceramic and semiconductor  * Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) an intermetallic compound, a silicide of molybdenum, is a refractory ceramic primarily used in heating elements. It has moderate density, melting point 2030 ¬∞C (3686 ¬∞F) and is electrically conductive. At high temperatures it forms a passivation layer of silicon dioxide, protecting it from further oxidation. The application area includes glass industry, ceramic sintering, heat treatment furnaces and semiconductor diffusion furnaces. * Silicon carbide, see silicon carbide ¬ß heating elements * Silicon nitride, see silicon nitride in automotive industry. New generation hot surface igniter for gas furnace and diesel engine glow plug are made of silicon nitride material. Such heating element or glow plug reach a maximum temperature of 1400 ¬∞C and are quick to ignite gas, diesel or kerosene. https://plug.fkk- corporation.com/en/products/sin-ceramic-igniter * PTC ceramic elements: PTC ceramic materials are named for their positive thermal coefficient of resistance (i.e., resistance increases upon heating). While most ceramics have a negative coefficient, these materials (often barium titanate and lead titanate composites) have a highly nonlinear thermal response, so that above a composition-dependent threshold temperature their resistance increases rapidly. This behavior causes the material to act as its own thermostat, since current passes when it is cool, and does not when it is hot. Thin films of this material are used in automotive rear-window defrost heaters, and honeycomb-shaped elements are used in more expensive hair dryers , space heaters and most modern pellet stove.Such heating element can reach a temperature of 950-1000 ¬∞C and are praised for the speed of temperature and stability.https://plug.fkk-corporation.com/en/products/pellet-ceramic-igniter * Quartz halogen heaters are also used to provide Radiant heating and cooling.  Thick film heaters  A thick film heater printed on a mica sheet. Thick film heaters are a type of resistive heater that can be printed on a thin substrate. Thick film heaters exhibit various advantages over the conventional metal-sheathed resistance elements. In general, thick film elements are characterized by their low profile form factor, improved temperature uniformity, quick thermal response due to low thermal mass, low energy consumption, high watt density and wide range of voltage compatibility. Typically, thick film heaters are printed on flat substrates, as well as on tubes in different heater patterns. These heaters can attain watt densities of as high as 100 W/cm2 depending on the heat transfer conditions. The thick film heater patterns are highly customizable based on the sheet resistance of the printed resistor paste. These heaters can be printed on a variety of substrates including metal, ceramic, glass, polymer using metal/alloy-loaded thick film pastes. The most common substrates used to print thick film heaters are aluminum 6061-T6, stainless steel and muscovite or phlogopite mica sheets. The applications and operational characteristics of these heaters vary widely based on the chosen substrate materials. This is primarily attributed to the thermal characteristics of the heater substrate. There are several conventional applications of thick film heaters. They can be used in griddles, waffle irons, stove-top electric heating, humidifiers, tea kettles, heat sealing devices, water heaters, iron and cloth steamers, hair straighteners, boilers, 3D printer heated beds, thermal print heads, glue guns, laboratory heating equipment, clothes dryers, baseboard heaters, deicing, or defogging devices, warming trays, car side mirrors, fridge defrosting, heat exchangers, etc. For most applications, the thermal performance and temperature distribution are the two key design parameters. In order to avoid any hotspots and to maintain a uniform temperature distribution across a substrate, the circuit design can be optimized by changing the localized power density of the resistor circuit. An optimized heater design helps to control the heater output and modulate the local temperatures across the heater substrate. In cases where there is a requirement of 2 or more heating zones with different output power over a relatively small area, a thick film heater can be designed to achieve a zonal heating pattern on a single substrate. Thick film heaters can largely be characterized under two subcategories- negative temperature coefficient (NTC) or positive temperature coefficient (PTC) based on the effect of temperature increase on the element's resistance. The NTC type heaters are characterized by a decrease in resistance as the heater temperature increases and thus have a higher output power at higher temperatures for a given input voltage. The PTC heaters behave in an opposite manner with an increase of resistance and decreasing heater power at elevated temperatures. This characteristic of the PTC heaters make them self regulating too, as their output power saturates at a fixed temperature. On the other hand, NTC type heaters generally require a thermostat or a thermocouple in order to control the heater runaway. These heaters are used in applications which require a quick ramp-up of heater temperature to a predetermined set- point as they are usually faster acting than the PTC type heaters. Thick film heater printed on a metal substrate  Polymer PTC heating elements  A flexible PTC heater made of conductive rubber Resistive heaters can be made of conducting PTC rubber materials where the resistivity increases exponentially with increasing temperature. Such a heater will produce high power when it is cold, and rapidly heat up itself to a constant temperature. Due to the exponentially increasing resistivity, the heater can never heat itself to warmer than this temperature. Above this temperature, the rubber acts as an electrical insulator. The temperature can be chosen during the production of the rubber. Typical temperatures are between . It is a point-wise self- regulating heater and self-limiting heater. Self-regulating means that every point of the heater independently keeps a constant temperature without the need of regulating electronics. Self-limiting means that the heater can never exceed a certain temperature in any point and requires no overheat protection.  Liquid  Electrode_boiler  Composite heating elements  Tubular Oven Heating Element * Tubular (sheathed) elements normally comprise a fine coil of nichrome (NiCr) resistance heating alloy wire, that is located in a metallic tube (of copper or stainless steel alloys such as Incoloy) and insulated by magnesium oxide powder. To keep moisture out of the hygroscopic insulator, the ends are equipped with beads of insulating material such as ceramic or silicone rubber, or a combination of both. The tube is drawn through a die to compress the powder and maximize heat transmission. These can be a straight rod (as in toaster ovens) or bent to a shape to span an area to be heated (such as in electric stoves, ovens, and coffee makers). * Screen-printed metal‚Äìceramic tracks deposited on ceramic insulated metal (generally steel) plates have found widespread application as elements in kettles and other domestic appliances since the mid-1990s. * Radiative heating elements (heat lamps): A high-powered incandescent lamp usually run at less than maximum power to radiate mostly infrared instead of visible light. These are usually found in radiant space heaters and food warmers, taking either a long, tubular form or an R40 reflector-lamp form. The reflector lamp style is often tinted red to minimize the visible light produced; the tubular form comes in different formats: ** Gold coated - Made famous by the patented Phillips Helen lamp. A gold dichroic film is deposited on the inside that reduces the visible light and allows most of the short and medium wave infrared through. Mainly for heating people. A number of manufacturers now manufacture these lamps and they improve constantly. ** Ruby coated - Same function as the gold-coated lamps, but at a fraction of the cost. The visible glare is much higher than the gold variant. ** Clear - No coating and mainly used in production processes. * Removable ceramic core elements use a coiled resistance heating alloy wire threaded through one or more cylindrical ceramic segments to make a required length (related to output), with or without a centre rod. Inserted into a metal sheath or tube sealed at one end, this type of element allows replacement or repair without breaking into the process involved, usually fluid heating under pressure.  Combination heating element systems  * Heating elements for high-temperature furnaces are often made of exotic materials, including platinum, tungsten disilicide/molybdenum disilicide, molybdenum (vacuum furnaces) and silicon carbide. Silicon carbide igniters are common in gas ovens. Laser heaters are also being used for achieving high temperatures.

In his translation of the Qur'an, one of the most widely known and used in the English-speaking world, Abdullah Yusuf Ali says ‚ÄúChronologically it belongs to the late early middle Makkan period, possibly soon after Surah 69.‚Äù Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi in his Tafsir work Tafhim al-Qur'an writes: ‚ÄúThe subject matter bears evidence that this Surah too was sent down in conditions closely resembling those under which Surah Al Haaqqah was sent down‚Äù.

Umar ibn Khattab accepted Islam in 616 ADUmar ibn Khattab#Converting to Islam so the surah Al-Ma'arij thus appears to reveal before 616 AD. Israr Ahmed, a Pakistani Islamic theologian, philosopher, and one of the noted Islamic scholar also holds the opinion that this surah was revealed in the 5th or 6th year of revelation and cites Fakhr al-Din al- RaziFakhr al-Din al-Razi#List of works and Abdul-Qadir Gilani in reference.Theodor N√∂ldeke places this chapter immediately after chapters lvi. and liii., probably because of the allusion of the first verse of this chapter to the beginning of chapter lvi.

Asbab al-nuzul AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l, an Arabic term meaning \\"occasions/circumstances of revelation\\", is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. Nasa'i and other traditionists have related a tradition from Ibn 'Abbas, and Hakim hold it as authentic, that Nadr bin al-Harith Kaladah had said \\"O God, if it is really the Truth sent dawn by You, then rain down stones on us from the heavens, or send down any other painful torment on us.\\" (AI-Anfal: 32).Asbab al-Nuzul By: Ali ibn Ahmad al-Wahidi TRANSLATED BY Mokrane Guezzou Edited and with a brief Introduction by Yousef Meri The person here meant is generally supposed to have been al Nud√°r Ibn al H√°rith, who said, ‚ÄòO God, if what Muhammad preaches be the truth from thee, rain down upon us a shower of stones, or send some dreadful judgment to punish us.‚Äô Others, however, think it was Ab√∫ Jahl, who challenged Muhammad to cause a fragment of heaven to fall on them.\\"‚ÄîSale,Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896) Baidawi.The Secrets of Revelation and The Secrets of Interpretation (Asrar ut- tanzil wa Asrar ut-ta'wil) Abdul-Qadir Gilani an influential Islamic Sufi religious figure, teacher, preacher and writer however holds the opinion that the demand for torment referred in the 1st ayah of this surah was made by Prophet Muhammad himself for the disbelievers due to the increasing Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans. And for example Dr.Israr Ahmed cites the demand of torment by prophet N≈´·∏• against his people in the next surah which is also the pair of surah Al-Ma'arij. For references Dr. Israr Ahmed cites the works of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Abdul-Qadir Gilani. Theme and subject matter Sayyid Qutb an Egyptian author, educator and Islamic theorist in his magnum opus, Fi Zilal al-Quran (In the shade of the Qur'an), a 30-volume commentary on the Qur'an summarizes the overview of surah Al-Ma'arij in these words.\\" We may say that this surah represents a round in the long, hard battle the Qur'an fights within the human soul, going deep inside it to eradicate all lingering traces of jahiliyyah. This battle is greater and longer lasting than the wars the Muslims later had to fight against their many enemies.\\".Fi Dhilal al-Quran. Beirut: Dar al-Shurruq (1981) He further elaborates: > The major issue the surah focuses on is that of the hereafter and peoples > requital for what they do during their lives on earth, particularly the > punishment suffered by the unbelievers. In order to establish the truth of > the hereafter, the surah speaks of how the human soul reacts to situations > of hardship and comfort. Such reactions differ greatly between a believer > and one who is devoid of faith. The surah also provides an outline of the > believers' main features, their feelings and behaviour, and it states how > they deserve to be honoured. It also shows that the unbelievers are held in > disregard by God, and gives a picture of the humiliation prepared for them. > It is a humiliation the arrogant thoroughly deserve. Furthermore, the surah > establishes the fact that values, standards and scales applied by God are > different from those which human beings uphold. \\" ‚ÄîSayid Qutb, Fi Zilal al- > Qur'an Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (b. 1951), a well-known Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar and exegete, and educationist, classifies surah Al-Ma'arij as a pair with the last one with regard to the subject discussed in them. He also suggests that the primary audience of surah Al-Ma'arij is leadership of the Quraysh. Regarding the central theme of the surah Ghamidi summarizes: > The central theme of Surah Ma‚Äòarij is to warn those among the Quraysh of > their fate who are making fun of the consequences of denying the Inzar of > the Qur‚Äôan about the Day of Judgement and are asking to hasten their advent, > and to urge the Prophet (sws) to persevere in the cause of truth and to tell > the unbelievers that Paradise is the reward of all good deeds; a person > whose evil deeds outnumber his good ones even if he is from the high ups of > the society shall never enter this everlasting kingdom.‚ÄîGhamidi The major scholars of Islam agree(Ijma) about the theme and subject matter of this surah.http://www.alim.org/library/quran/surah/introduction/70/MAL In fact the study of surah AL-Marij stated by various scholars overlaps each other. Just like the above-mentioned exegetes, Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik states his understanding of the Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance in surah Al- Ma'arij as: > \\"The whole Surah is meant to answer this question saying: \\"Resurrection, > which they desire to be hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when > it comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits. At that time they > will even be prepared to give away their wives and children and their > nearest kinfolks in ransom to escape the punishment, but they will not be > able to escape it. On that Day, the destinies of mankind will be decided > strictly on the basis of their belief and their conduct. Those who turn away > from the Truth in this world, amass wealth and withhold it from the needy, > will be doomed to hell; and those who fear the punishment of Allah, believe > in the Hereafter, establish Salah (keep up the prayers), discharge the > rights of the needy out of their wealth, strictly avoid immoral and wicked > deeds, practise honesty in all their dealings, fulfill their pledges and > trust and bear true witness, will have a place of honor in paradise\\" - > Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam MalikMuhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik (translator), Al- > Qur'an, the Guidance for Mankind - English with Arabic Text (Hardcover) Contents The Quranic text has been divided into separate rukus in terms of thematically related Ayah. This surah contains 2 rukus. The contents of the 1st Ruku states that the day of judgement will be equal to fifty thousand years and disbelievers will wish to save themselves from the punishment at the expense of their children, wives, brothers and relatives, but it will not happen. 2nd Ruku starts from ayah 36 and continues uptill the end of the surah and it states that the Paradise is not for the disbelievers and Disbelievers will have downcast eyes and countenances distorted with shame.http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/theme/70 Another noticeable fact about this surah needs to be addressed that passage 70:29 to 70:32 is completely identical to the passage Al-Mu'minoon 23:5 to 23:8. About this presence of repetition\\"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order.... This has given rise in the past to a great deal of criticism by European and American scholars of Islam, who find the Quran disorganized, repetitive and very difficult to read.\\" Approaches to the Asian Classics, Irene Blomm, William Theodore De Bary, Columbia University Press, 1990, p. 65 Michael Sells, citing the work of the critic Norman O. Brown, acknowledges Brown's observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression ‚Äì its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells's phrase ‚Äì is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated.Michael Sells, Approaching the Qur'an (White Cloud Press, 1999)Norman O. Brown, \\"The Apocalypse of Islam.\\" Social Text 3:8 (1983‚Äì1984) Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device. A text is self-referential when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself. According to Stefan Wild the Quran demonstrates this meta-textuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages when the Quran refers to itself as revelation (tanzil), remembrance (dhikr), news (naba'), criterion (furqan) in a self- designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, \\"And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?\\" (21:50), or in the frequent appearance of the 'Say' tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g. \\"Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance' \\", \\"Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?' \\"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan chapters.Quran#Literary style Abul A'la Maududi (September 25, 1903 ‚Äì September 22, 1979) was a journalist, theologian, Muslim revivalist leader and political philosopher, and a 20th-century Islamist thinker in India, and later Pakistan.Zebiri, Kate.

He was also a political figure in Pakistan and was the first recipient of King Faisal International Award for his services in 1979.Abul A'la MaududiAbul A'la Maududi#Legacy He summarizes the contents of the surah in these words: > It admonishes and gives warning to the disbelievers who made fun of the news > about Resurrection and the Hereafter, and Hell and Heaven, and challenged > the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) to cause Resurrection with which he > threatened them to take place if what he said was true and they had become > worthy of the punishment in Hell by denying it. The whole Surah is meant to > answer this denial. The Surah opens with words to the effect:\\"A demander has > demanded a torment, the torment which must befall the deniers; and when it > takes place, there will be none to prevent it, but it will take place at its > own appointed time. Allah has His own way of doing things, but He is not > unjust. Therefore, have patience, O Prophet, at what they say. They think it > is far off, but We see it as near at hand.\\" Then it is said:\\"Resurrection, > which they desire to be hastened out of jest and fun, is terrible, and when > it comes, it will cause great distress to the culprits. At that time they > will even be prepared to give away their wives and children and their > nearest kinsfolk in ransom to escape the punishment, but they will not be > able to escape it. Then the people have been warned to the effect; \\"On that > Day the destinies of men will be decided strictly on the basis of their > belief and their conduct.

It is about the Islamic prophet N≈´·∏• and his complaint about his people rejecting all warning Allah gave them through Nuh. Nuh's themes include: belief in Allah, signs of Allah (the Earth, Sun, Moon), and punishment of denying Allah's message. Summary In Nuh, the seventy-first surah, the Quran refers to Nuh‚Äôs prophethood in snippets. Nuh is a messenger of Allah. When Nuh realizes the messages are not accepted by the community, he supplicated to Allah, who planned to flood the community of Nuh at a specified time. Allah commanded Nuh to warn the people of the flood. Allah brings forth the water from the skies to prove Nuh‚Äôs message to be accurate. In the Quran, the flood is a symbolization of the mercy of Allah to the believers. Allah gives the world a new beginning. The disbelievers disbelieved Allah's message and messenger Nuh so they were drowned. Because his people are unable to grasp the idea of the existence of one God, the lives of Muhammad and Nuh are parallel to each other for the time of the revelation of this surah. The surah was used to increase the faith of the believers; it shows that Nuh before Muhammad had difficulties in dealing with the disbelievers of his time. Exegesis=Q71:1-4 Noah receives message from God Verses 1‚Äì4 discuss the message Nuh received from God (Allah) to share with his community, to serve God. Q71:5-20 the Earth, the sun, the moon are signs of God's existence. In Verses 5‚Äì20, Nuh informs Allah that his people are not accepting his message. Nuh tries to make clear to the people that all of the Earth, the Sun, the Moon are signs of God's existence. Q71:21-25 rid the world of the evildoers  In Verses 21‚Äì24, Nuh asks Allah to rid the world of the evildoers because they refused to abandon their idols and encourage others to do the same. Q71:26-28 disbelievers all drowned In Verses 26‚Äì28, the disbelievers were all drowned and sent to hell (as a result of the flood). Nuh asks Allah to forgive the believers and to destroy the disbelievers because their faith will lead many astray. Surah chronology The surah is entirely Meccan meaning it was revealed while Muhammad was trying to create a Muslim community in Mecca. According to the Tanzil version, it was the seventy-first surah revealed. It was revealed after the sixteenth surah, An-Nahl (\\"The Bee\\") and before the fourteenth Ibrahim (\\"Abraham\\"). According to Theodor N√∂ldeke, N≈´·∏• was the fifty-third surah to be revealed. It was revealed after the thirty- seventh surah Saaffaat (\\"Those Who Set The Ranks\\"), and before the seventy- sixth surah, Insaan or Dahr (\\"Man\\" or \\"Time\\").

The figure illustrates how mass deficits are measured, using the observed brightness profile of a galaxy The density of stars increases toward the center in most galaxies. In small galaxies, this increase continues into the very center. In large galaxies, there is usually a \\"core\\", a region near the center where the density is constant or slowly rising. The size of the core ‚Äì the \\"core radius\\" ‚Äì can be a few hundred parsecs in large elliptical galaxies.Dullo, Bililign T.; Graham, Alister W. (2014) Depleted cores, multicomponent fits, and structural parameter relations for luminous early- type galaxies The greatest observed stellar cores reach 3.2 to 5.7 kiloparsecs in radius. It is believed that cores are produced by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Binary SMBHs form during the merger of two galaxies. If a star passes near the massive binary, it will be ejected, by a process called the gravitational slingshot. This ejection continues until most of the stars near the center of the galaxy have been removed. The result is a low-density core. Such cores are ubiquitous in giant elliptical galaxies. The mass deficit is defined as the amount of mass that was removed in creating the core. Mathematically, the mass deficit is defined as :M_\\\\mathrm{def}= 4\\\\pi\\\\int_0^{R_c} \\\\left[\\\\rho_i(r) - \\\\rho(r) \\\\right]r^2 dr, where œÅi is the original density, œÅ is the observed density, and Rc is the core radius. In practice, the core-Sersic model can be used to help quantify the deficits. Observed mass deficits are typically in the range of one to a few times the mass of the central SMBH, and observed core radii are comparable to the influence radii of the central SMBH. These properties are consistent with what is predicted in theoretical models of core formation and lend support to the hypothesis that all bright galaxies once contained binary SMBHs at their centers. It is not known whether most galaxies still contain massive binaries, or whether the two black holes have coalesced. Both possibilities are consistent with the presence of mass deficits.

It was developed to as a computer display device for compact portable devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and digital cameras, which have sufficient storage capacity to handle presentation materials but are too small to accommodate a display screen that an audience can see easily. Handheld projectors involve miniaturized hardware, and software that can project digital images onto a nearby viewing surface. The system comprises five main parts: the battery, the electronics, the laser or LED light sources, the combiner optic, and in some cases, scanning micromirror devices. First, the electronics system turns the image into an electronic signal. Next, the electronic signals drive laser or LED light sources with different colors and intensities down different paths. In the combiner optic, the different light paths are combined into one path, defining a palette of colors. An important design characteristic of a handheld projector is the ability to project a clear image on various viewing surfaces.  History  Major advances in imaging technology have allowed the introduction of hand-held (pico) type video projectors. The concept was also introduced by Explay in 2003 to various consumer electronics players. Their solution was publicly announced through their relationship with Kopin in January 2005. Insight Media market research has divided the leading players in this application into various categories:Brennesholtz 2008, p.84. * Micro- display makers (e.g., TI's DLP, Himax, Microvision, Lemoptix and bTendo MEMS scanners) * Light source makers (e.g., Philips Lumileds, Osram, Cree LEDs and Corning, Nichia, Mitsubishi Lasers) * Module makers (e.g., Texas Instruments (DLP), 3M Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS)) Various manufacturers have produced handheld projectors exhibiting high-resolution, good brightness, and low energy consumption in a slightly larger format than pico since 2008. However, most handheld LED projectors, as of December 2017, have been widely criticized for having insufficient brightness for everyday use in a normally lit room. In 2011, Texas Instruments DLP announced improved chipsets that enable brighter images, and LED advances were such that pico projectors using that technology were also increasing in brightness. The DLP chip sets are designed to enhance image brightness without increasing power usage for both WVGA (native DVD resolution) devices, such as mobile phones, and VGA devices, such as digital cameras and camcorders. The chip sets have the ability to project an image up to (1270 mm) on any surface in optimum lighting conditions. In 2014 Texas Instruments DLP's imagers occupied a significant portion of the handheld projector market share. In combination with Osram's Ostar series LEDs optical engines based on DLP technology have achieved over 15 lumens per watt for high brightness applications (300‚Äì500 lumens with 0.45\\" imager) and over 20 lumens per watt in low brightness applications (10‚Äì50 lumens with 0.2\\" or 0.3\\" imagers).  Technologies  Three major image technologies for micro projectors are commonplace: * Texas Instruments's Digital Light Processing (DLP) * MicroVision, Inc.'s laser beam-steering (LBS)Freeman, Champion, Madhaven‚ÄîScanned Laser Pico-Projectors: Seeing the Big Picture (with a Small Device) http://www.microvision.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/07/OPN_Article.pdf * LCoS (Liquid crystal on silicon) manufacturers including Syndiant, Himax, Micron Technologies and Omnivision can usually supply companies with both LED and laser solutions. Most micro projectors employ one of these imagers, combined with color-sequential (RGB) LEDs in either a single or triple architecture format. Manufacturers that have adopted this technology include Digislide, Optoma's PK201 / PK301 (DLP), 3M's MPro 160 / 180 (LCoS), Aiptek's V50 (DLP), AAXA's M2 (LCoS), Bonitor MP302 (LCos), Micron's PoP Video (LCoS), and Vivitek's High Definition Qumi (DLP). Some older models incorporated a single LCoS imager chip with single white LED which is recognized to offer lower cost, high resolution, and fast response at the expense of color quality. Other models such as the Dell M109S employed a color wheel plus white LED technology which improves color quality but generally requires a larger form factor. Other micro projectors such employ RGB laser technology such as Microvision's beam-steering plus laser technology and AAXA's laser plus LCoS technology. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. For example, while DLP typically has slightly lower resolution than their LCoS counterparts due to the tiny mirrors used in DLP technology, 3-LED DLP projectors are generally regarded as having a higher contrast, better efficiency and lower power consumption as opposed color-sequential LCoS units and better color quality than white LED LCoS units. Laser scanning projectors such as Microvision's ShowX and AAXA's L1 offer very good color gamut and low power consumption due to the use of lasers as the light source and also present an image that is always in focus. However, high speckle noise along with thermal instability in the image remains a major challenge, primarily due to the pumped green laser. The new \\"Direct Green Laser\\" (DGL) technologies that replace the \\"pumped green laser\\" in next generation laser projectors, in combination with improved hardware optics, MEMS Mirror designs and other operational methods, are being deployed or are under development. Speckle noise should be reduced significantly, and thermal issues and power consumption greatly reduced.  Applications  Handheld projectors can be used for different applications from small conventional projectors. Since 2008A. Hang, E. Rukzio, and A. Greaves \\"Projector Phone: A Study of Using Mobile Phones with Integrated Projector for Interaction with Maps \\" Proceedings of the Conference on Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services (MobileHCI), 2008. researchers are studying applications that are specifically designed for handheld projectors often using prototypes of mobile phones with an integrated projector.

Gaming  Handheld projectors, in particular projector phones, could offer new possibilities for mobile gaming, as demonstrated by the adaptation of the PlayStation 3 game LittleBigPlanet. Players can sketch a world on a sheet of paper or use an existing physical configuration of objects and let the physics engine simulate physical procedures in this world to achieve game goals.M.

It is the most common rabbit species in North America. Distribution The eastern cottontail can be found in meadows and shrubby areas in the eastern and south-central United States, southern Canada, eastern Mexico, Central America and northernmost South America. It is abundant in Midwest North America, and has been found in New Mexico and Arizona. Its range expanded north as forests were cleared by settlers.Godin, Alfred J. (1977). Wild mammals of New England. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press Originally, it was not found in New England, but it has been introduced and now competes for habitat there with the native New England cottontail. It has also been introduced into parts of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. In the mid-1960s, the eastern cottontail was introduced to northern Italy, where it displayed a rapid territorial expansion and increase in population density. Habitat Optimal eastern cottontail habitat includes open grassy areas, clearings, and old fields supporting abundant green grasses and herbs, with shrubs in the area or edges for cover.Hon, Tip. (1981). \\"Effects of prescribed fire on furbearers in the South\\", pp. 121‚Äì128 in: Wood, Gene W. (ed.) Prescribed fire and wildlife in southern forests: Proceedings of a symposium; 1981 April 6‚Äì8; Myrtle Beach, SC. Georgetown, SC: Clemson University, Belle W. Baruch Forest Science Institute The essential components of eastern cottontail habitat are an abundance of well-distributed escape cover (dense shrubs) interspersed with more open foraging areas such as grasslands and pastures. Habitat parameters important for eastern cottontails in ponderosa pine, mixed species, and pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands include woody debris, herbaceous and shrubby understories, and patchiness. Typically eastern cottontails occupy habitats in and around farms including fields, pastures, open woods, thickets associated with fencerows, wooded thickets, forest edges, and suburban areas with adequate food and cover. They are also found in swamps and marshes and usually avoid dense woods. They are seldom found in deep woods. Home range The eastern cottontail home range is roughly circular in uniform habitats. Eastern cottontails typically inhabit one home range throughout their lifetime, but home range shifts in response to vegetation changes and weather are common. In New England, eastern cottontail home ranges average for adult males and for adult females but vary in size from , depending on season, habitat quality, and individual. The largest ranges are occupied by adult males during the breeding season. In southwestern Wisconsin adult male home ranges averaged in spring, increased to in early summer, and decreased to by late summer. Daily activity is usually restricted to 10% to 20% of the overall home range.Allen, A. W. (1984). Habitat suitability index models: eastern cottontail. FWS/OBS 0197-6087. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Biological Sciences, Western Energy Land Use Team In southeastern Wisconsin home ranges of males overlapped by up to 50%, but female home ranges did not overlap by more than 25% and actual defense of range by females occurred only in the immediate area of the nest. Males fight each other to establish dominance hierarchy and mating priority. Cover requirements Winter coat, Ottawa, Ontario Eastern cottontails forage in open areas and use brush piles, stone walls with shrubs around them, herbaceous and shrubby plants, and burrows or dens for escape cover, shelter, and resting cover. Woody cover is extremely important for the survival and abundance of eastern cottontails. Eastern cottontails do not dig their own dens (other than nest holes) but use burrows dug by other species such as woodchucks. In winter when deciduous plants are bare eastern cottontails forage in less secure cover and travel greater distances. Eastern cottontails probably use woody cover more during the winter, particularly in areas where cover is provided by herbaceous vegetation in summer. In Florida slash pine flatwoods, eastern cottontails use low saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens) patches for cover within grassy areas.Komarek, Roy. (1963). \\"Fire and the changing wildlife habitat\\", pp. 35‚Äì43 in: Proceedings of 2nd annual Tall Timbers fire ecology conference; 1963 March 14‚Äì15; Tallahassee, FL. Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research Station In nest, under production Most nest holes are constructed in grasslands (including hayfields). The nest is concealed in grasses or weeds. Nests are also constructed in thickets, orchards, and scrubby woods. In southeastern Illinois tall-grass prairie, eastern cottontail nests were more common in undisturbed prairie grasses than in high-mowed or hayed plots. In Iowa most nests were within of brush cover in herbaceous vegetation at least tall. Nests in hayfields were in vegetation less than tall. Average depth of nest holes is , average width , and average length . The nest is lined with grass and fur. Description The eastern cottontail is chunky, red-brown or gray-brown in appearance, with large hind feet, long ears, and a short, fluffy white tail. Its underside fur is white. There is a rusty patch on the tail. Its appearance differs from that of a hare in that it has a brownish-gray coloring around the head and neck. The body is lighter color with a white underside on the tail. It has large brown eyes and large ears to see and listen for danger. In winter the cottontail's pelage is more gray than brown. The kits develop the same coloring after a few weeks, but they also have a white blaze that goes down their forehead; this marking eventually disappears. This rabbit is medium-sized, measuring in total length, including a small tail that averages .GAWW: Species Description . Naturalhistory.uga.edu. Retrieved 2012-12-20.Mikita, K. (1999).

There may be some slight variation in the body size of eastern cottontails, with weights seeming to increase from south to north, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. Adult specimens from the Florida Museum of Natural History, collected in Florida, have a mean weight of . Meanwhile, 346 adult cottontails from Michigan were found to have averaged in mass.Craighead, J.J. & Craighead, F.C. (1956) Hawks, Owls and Wildlife. Wildlife Management Institute, . Behavior The eastern cottontail is a very territorial animal. When chased, it runs in a zigzag pattern, running up to . The cottontail prefers an area where it can hide quickly but be out in the open. Forests, swamps, thickets, bushes, or open areas where shelter is close by are optimal habitation sites for this species. Cottontails do not dig burrows, but rather rest in a form, a shallow, scratched-out depression in a clump of grass or under brush. It may use the dens of groundhogs as a temporary home or during heavy snow.Merritt, Joseph E. (1987) Guide to the Mammals of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh Press, p. 123, . Eastern cottontails are crepuscular to nocturnal feeders; although they usually spend most of the daylight hours resting in shallow depressions under vegetative cover or other shelter, they can be seen at any time of day. Eastern cottontails are most active when visibility is limited, such as rainy or foggy nights. Eastern cottontails usually move only short distances, and they may remain sitting very still for up to 15 minutes at a time. Eastern cottontails are active year-round. Reproduction Litter and nesting material Three-week-old kit Juvenile, unknown age, showing white blaze on forehead The onset of breeding varies between populations and within populations from year to year. The eastern cottontail breeding season begins later with higher latitudes and elevations. Temperature rather than diet has been suggested as a primary factor controlling onset of breeding; many studies correlate severe weather with delays in the onset of breeding. In New England breeding occurs from March to September. In New York the breeding season occurs from February to September, in Connecticut from mid-March to mid-September. In Alabama the breeding season begins in January. In Georgia the breeding season lasts nine months and in Texas breeding occurs year-round. Populations in western Oregon breed from late January to early September. Mating is promiscuous. The nest is a slanting hole dug in soft soil and lined with vegetation and white fur from the mother‚Äôs underside. The average measurements are: length , width , and depth . The average period of gestation is 28 days, ranging from 25 to 35 days. Eastern cottontail young are born with a very fine coat of hair and are blind. Their eyes begin to open by four to seven days. Young begin to move out of the nest for short trips by 12 to 16 days and are completely weaned and independent by four to five weeks. Litters disperse at about seven weeks. Females do not stay in the nest with the young but return to the opening of the nest to nurse, usually twice a day. Reproductive maturity occurs at about two to three months of age. A majority of females first breed the spring following birth; but 10% to 36% of females breed as juveniles (i.e., summer of the year they were born). Males will mate with more than one female. Female rabbits can have one to seven litters of one to twelve young, called kits, in a year; however, they average three to four litters per year, and the average number of kits is five. In the South, female eastern cottontails have more litters per year (up to seven) but fewer young per litter.Nowak, Ronald M.; Paradiso, John L. (1983). Walker's mammals of the world. 4th edition. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press In New England female eastern cottontails have three or four litters per year. The annual productivity of females may be as high as 35 young.Wainright, Larry C. (1969). \\"A literature review on cottontail reproduction\\". Special Report 19. Denver, CO: Colorado Department of Game, Fish and Parks Diet The diet of eastern cottontails is varied and largely dependent on availability. Eastern cottontails eat vegetation almost exclusively; arthropods have occasionally been found in pellets. Some studies list as many as 70 to 145 plant species in local diets. Food items include bark, twigs, leaves, fruit, buds, flowers, grass seeds, sedge fruits, and rush seeds. There is a preference for small material: branches, twigs, and stems up to . Leporids including eastern cottontails are coprophagous, producing two types of fecal pellets, one of which is consumed. The redigestion of pellets greatly increases the nutritional value of dietary items. In summer, eastern cottontails consume tender green herbaceous vegetation when it is available. In many areas Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratense) and Canada bluegrass (P. compressa) are important dietary components. Other favored species include clovers (Trifolium spp.) and crabgrasses (Digitaria spp.). In Connecticut important summer foods include clovers, alfalfa, timothy (Phleum pratense), bluegrasses (Poa spp.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens), crabgrasses, redtop (Agrostis alba), ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), goldenrods (Solidago spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), chickweed (Stellaria media), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). Eastern cottontails also consume many domestic crops. During the dormant season, or when green vegetation is covered with snow, eastern cottontails consume twigs, buds, and bark of woody vegetation. In Connecticut, important winter foods include gray birch (Betula populifolia), red maple, and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra). Mortality In Kansas, the largest cause of mortality of radiotracked eastern cottontails was predation (43%), followed by research mortalities (19%), and tularemia (18%). A major cause of eastern cottontail mortality is collision with automobiles. In Missouri, it was estimated that ten eastern cottontails are killed annually per mile of road. The peak period of highway mortality is in spring (March through May); roadside vegetation greens up before adjacent fields and is highly attractive to eastern cottontails. Annual adult survival is estimated at 20%. Average longevity is 15 months in the wild; the longest-lived wild individual on record was five years old. Captive eastern cottontails have lived to at least nine years of age. Eastern cottontails are hosts to fleas, ticks, lice, cestodes, nematodes, trematodes, gray flesh fly larvae, botfly larvae, tularemia, shopes fibroma, torticollis, and cutaneous streptothricosis. Further summary of diseases and pests is available.Chapman, Joseph A.; Hockman, J. Gregory; Edwards, William R. 1982. Cottontails: Sylvilagus floridanus and allies. In: Chapman, Joseph A.; Feldhamer, George A., eds. Wild mammals of North America. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press: 83‚Äì123 Predators The eastern cottontail has to contend with many predators, both natural and introduced. Due to their often large populations in Eastern North America, they form a major component of several predators' diets. Major predators of eastern cottontail include domestic cats and dogs, foxes (Vulpes and Urocyon spp.), coyote (C. latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), weasels (Mustela spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), mink (M. vison), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), barred owl (Strix varia), hawks (principally Buteo spp.), corvids (Corvus spp.), and snakes. Predators that take nestlings include raccoon, badger (Taxidea taxus), skunks (Mephitis and Spilogale spp.), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). In central Missouri, eastern cottontails comprised the majority of biomass in the diet of red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) during the nesting season. In Pennsylvania, the chief predator of eastern cottontails is the great horned owl.Rue, Leonard Lee, III. (1965). Cottontail. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company In the Southwest cottontails including eastern cottontail comprise 7 to 25% of the diets of northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). In Texas, eastern cottontails are preyed on by coyotes more heavily in early spring and in fall than in summer or winter. In southwestern North Dakota, cottontails (both eastern and desert cottontail Sylvilagus auduboni) were major prey items in the diets of bobcats. Juvenile eastern cottontails are rare in the diet of short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Trace amounts of eastern cottontail remains have been detected in black bear (Ursus americanus) scat.Hellgren, Eric C.; Vaughan, Michael R.

He completed a PhD in agricultural sciences at the university's Department of Animal Husbandry in 1972. Professional career As a trained agronomist, Snegur worked as the director of kolkhoz in the village of Lunga, Flore»ôti District, from 1961 to 1968. From 1968 to 1973, he was the director of the Experimental Station of Field Cultures, and 1973 to 1978, he was the director of the Main Agricultural Science Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture. From 1978 to 1981, he worked as the general director of the Selectia Research Institute of Field Crops. Political career Snegur first became a member of the Communist Party of Moldova in 1964. In 1981, he became the Secretary of the Communist Party committee of Edine»õ district, serving until 1985. That year, he became Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Moldavia SSR, serving until 1989. On 29 Jul 1989, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Moldavia, serving in this role until 27 April 1990.

In August 1991, Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union, and on 27 August 1991, Snegur was elected as the first President of Moldova as an independent state. Snegur was opposed to immediate reunification with Romania, which led to a split with the Popular Front of Moldova in October 1991. Snegur decided to run as an independent candidate in the December 1991 presidential election, running unopposed after the Popular Front's efforts to organize a voter boycott failed. On 3 September 1991, Snegur created the National Army of Moldova. In December 1991, Snegur signed the act that made Moldova a full member of the Confederacy of Independent States (CIS), and on 2 March 1992, Moldova became a member of the United Nations. On 29 June 1994, a new Constitution of Moldova was adopted, and on 26 June 1995, Moldova was admitted as a member of the Council of Europe. In 1995, Snegur founded the Party of Rebirth and Conciliation of Moldova with former members of the Agrarian Party of Moldova.

They are often remembered annually. The human and divine Pitris The most complete accounts about the s are found in the Vayu Purana and Brahmanda Purana and both are practically identical. The account in the Harivamsha is shorter but agrees closely with them. The similar but brief accounts are also found in the Matsya Purana and Padma Purana. According to these accounts there are different classes of the s and they have different origins, forms, grades and abodes. A broad distinction exists between the ' (divine s) and the ' (s who were deceased human beings). Some of the s dwell in the heavenly abodes while other dwell in the netherworlds. The former who dwell in the heaven were considered as the gods and the gods were also considered as the s. The s are most primeval deities and they never cease to exist. The ' (ancestors of human beings) can attain the same level of the divine s and live with them in heaven by righteousness.

History Scotland Road was created in the 1770s as a turnpike road to Preston, Lancashire, via Walton and Burscough. It became part of a stagecoach route to Scotland, hence its name. It was partly widened in 1803, and streets of working-class housing were laid out on either side as Liverpool expanded. Scotland Road was at the centre of working-class life for the people of the surrounding Everton and Vauxhall areas near the north Liverpool docks and the city centre. The population in the Victorian era was swelled by the arrival of thousands of Irish immigrants, many of whom had fled Ireland's Great Famine. The area became known for having a large number of Irish-Catholic residents, and the Liverpool Scotland UK Parliament constituency was represented by an Irish Nationalist MP for 44 years until 1929, becoming the first and only constituency outside of Ireland to continuously vote for an Irish nationalist. Decline The area had a vibrant community but was often associated with poor housing, poverty, violence, and sectarian divisions. Many dwellings in the area were demolished in the 1930s, and replacement housing included corporation flats. After the Second World War ended, in 1945, many residents were rehoused in new council houses in areas such as Croxteth, Halewood, Huyton, Kirkby, Norris Green, and Stockbridge Village, leaving Scotland Road in a state of steady decline. Housing was further cleared by the construction of the second Mersey tunnel. There were once over 200 pubs in the Scotland Road area, but most of them have now gone. Scotland Road Free School Scotland Road Free School was a short-lived example of democratic education established 1970 by two local teachers. It was based at Major Street, just off Scotland Road. A related project, Liverpool Community Transport was established in a disused transport depot in nearby Leeds Street. Liverpool John Moores University At its southern end, Scotland Road becomes Byrom Street, the location of the largest campus of Liverpool John Moores University.http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/ Famous natives *Tom Baker (born 1934), actor best known for playing the Fourth Doctor in Doctor Who *Cilla Black (1943‚Äì2015), singer and television personality *Thomas Cecil Gray (1913‚Äì2008), pioneering anaesthetist *Holly Johnson (born 1960), singer best known for fronting Frankie Goes to Hollywood *Rt.

It begins in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as Fletcher Avenue crosses the US 1‚Äì9, US 46, and the Interstate 95 (I-95) approaches to the George Washington Bridge, and heads north up the west side of the Hudson River to US 9 in Albany, New York. As its \\"W\\" suffix indicates, US 9W is a westerly alternate route of US 9 between the two locations. US 9W directly serves three cities‚ÄîNewburgh, Kingston, and Albany‚Äîand enters the vicinity of several others. As the route heads north, it connects to several highways of regional importance, including I-84, US 209, New York State Route 23 (NY 23), and US 20\\\\. Much of US 9W parallels the New York State Thruway and NY 32; additionally, the latter overlaps with US 9W in four different locations. Route description For much of its length, US 9W is a two-lane surface road. However, some stretches in New Jersey and New York widen to four lanes, and much of the highway in Orange County is like an expressway even if not so designated. New Jersey View north along US 9W between The Esplanade and Hillside Avenue in Alpine, New Jersey. US 9W begins as a four lane road. Heading north on Fletcher Avenue (from Kelby Street intersection, near the George Washington Bridge) in Fort Lee, US 9W occupies the right-of-way of the Palisades Interstate Parkway (PIP) to Lemoine Avenue, the northern terminus of Route 67\\\\. US 9W exits the right-of-way, turning north onto Lemoine Avenue, later Sylvan Avenue, in Englewood Cliffs, where it passes the headquarters of Ferrari of North America, Unilever, and CNBC. As the roadway enters Tenafly from Englewood Cliffs, it reduces to a two lane roadway from four lanes. It continues to parallel the PIP to its west as they progress northward along the west bank of the Hudson River until reaching the border with New York State. Both roads run very near the top of the Palisades, occasionally offering views of New York City and the river. Lemoine Avenue is heavy with commercial development in the Coytesville section of Fort Lee, but as the road runs into Englewood Cliffs it transitions to corporate office buildings, and into the affluent community of Alpine in the state's northeastern corner, it becomes more residential. Near Norwood, just south of the state line, US 9W crosses under the parkway and enters New York. Before the construction of the PIP, US 9W used to follow a route through the State Line Lookout at the New Jersey‚ÄìNew York border which is now accessible only from the parkway. The entire route of US 9W in New Jersey is within Bergen County. New YorkRockland County= Across the state line, US 9W continues in Palisades as Highland Avenue, a two-lane road through mostly residential suburban surroundings. It passes Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and then Tallman Mountain State Park. Bending westward to Sparkill, it meets NY 340\\\\. It returns to the riverside at Piermont, where it takes the name Broadway Avenue. Running due north, it enters Nyack and meets with the New York State Thruway (I-87 and I-287) just west of the Tappan Zee Bridge. It then runs along the Thruway to the east terminus of NY 59 in downtown Nyack, where it becomes North Highland Avenue once again. North of Upper Nyack, it passes Rockland Lake thru Valley Cottage and then Rockland Lake State Park. Alongside the park, it crosses town lines again. NY 303 reaches its north end just after the park, and after a tight curve NY 304, reaches its northern terminus as well. US 9W then returns to the riverside briefly, trending away from it into Haverstraw under the name Congers Avenue. The village is followed immediately by West Haverstraw, where US 202 comes in at an oblique angle and joins US 9W, creating the first concurrency along the route. Hudson River Mothball Fleet The combined highways head north from the Haverstraws as South, then North, Liberty Drive, passing Stony Point Battlefield. They return to the Hudson at Tomkins Cove, where the Hudson River National Defense Reserve (Mothball) Fleet was moored from 1947 to 1971. Between Tomkins Cove and Jones Point there are two large ships anchor surrounding a monument alongside the road that marks the spot which is just across from the Indian Point Energy Center in Buchanan. US 9W climbing Dunderburg Mountain in northern Rockland County. At Jones Point the road curves and bends above the river as it works its way around Dunderberg Mountain, the southernmost peak of the Hudson Highlands and part of Bear Mountain State Park. At Iona Island, it levels out again briefly and then US 9W/202 climbs to the heart of the state park at Bear Mountain Inn and Hessian Lake, where the Appalachian Trail crosses beneath the road in the only man-made tunnel along its entire route. The Orange County line is crossed just before Bear Mountain Circle. =Orange County= US 9W, as seen from the north end of Palisades Interstate Parkway at the Bear Mountain Circle in Fort Montgomery The circle marks the northern terminus of the Palisades Parkway and the junction with US 6\\\\. US 202 leaves US 9W to join US 6 here and cross the Bear Mountain Bridge. North of the circle, US 9W continues as an undivided four-lane road, crossing Popolopen Creek and affording views of the similarly named Torne. It passes first the historic Fort Montgomery, then enters the small hamlet of the same name, distinguished by a post office, gas station, and some other small businesses. A half-mile (1 km) further north, NY 218 (Storm King Highway), the former route of US 9W, forks off to the right, carrying traffic to Highland Falls and the United States Military Academy at West Point. At this point US 9W becomes a divided limited-access highway as it starts to climb the highlands above the village and the academy. The first exit is NY 218, which joins US 9W for a mile just north of the village. It leaves the highway at the northern terminus of NY 293 to run alongside Storm King Mountain. West Point viewed from US 9W just before passing over Crow's Nest From here, US 9W continues its ascent, offering sweeping views over the river and Highlands, with an overlook available to northbound drivers. The surrounding land is all woods, part of the vast USMA property. After passing Crow's Nest, Storm King and the rocky cliff faces of Butter Hill dominate the northward view. Another parking lot allows travelers to stop and sightsee, as well as hike the Stillman Trail up the two peaks. After Storm King, the road begins a long descent into the Town of Cornwall. Just outside the village of Cornwall-on-Hudson and the fields of New York Military Academy, NY 218 ends its loop. Shortly afterwards, the division ends and grade intersections resume, although the road remains four lanes as it enters the Town of New Windsor. US 9W winding through the Hudson Highlands It descends again where Breakneck Ridge and Bull Hill tower across the river. Traffic begins to slow down at the center of town, where NY 94 ends its journey across the county. After this traffic light, the road begins to narrow. Once across Quassaick Creek and into Newburgh, it is Robinson Avenue, a wide urban arterial with parking along the sides. It ascends gently past Delano-Hitch Stadium and the associated park to the center of its passage across Newburgh, the intersection with Broadway. Here NY 17K has its eastern terminus, and NY 32, the other main surface route west of the Hudson, begins its first concurrency with US 9W. Passing Broadway School, a former elementary school which is in the process of being converted into the City of Newburgh Court House, the two routes head into a more residential sector of the city, marked by the Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Downing Park. The road's climb continues until the North campus of Newburgh Free Academy, where it starts to descend to the busy exit at I-84, visible ahead, just west of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. This junction, also including NY 52, is the city's northern limit. Downing Park in the city of Newburgh Immediately after it, NY 32 leaves to the northwest while US 9W continues northwards. It passes Powelton Country Club, part of the affluent community of Balmville, the first of several within the Town of Newburgh that 9W will pass. Middle Hope follows, as the road becomes a two- lane route with a rural feel. Development continues along the road, but there are increasingly large unbroken fields or woodlots and finally, in the northern reaches of the town, orchards. At Roseton, past the access road to the nearby power plants, the highway reaches the county line just past the turnoff to the Gomez Mill House, the earliest surviving Jewish home in the U.S. =Ulster County= Traffic is slowed when it passes through the hamlet of Marlboro, but otherwise there is little change in US 9W until it widens to four lanes again just south of the Mid-Hudson Bridge approach overpass. At this point, US 44 and NY 55 join the highway from the east. The road becomes a busy commercial strip for the next mile to the concurrency's end, where NY 44 and NY 55 go down into Highland. The four lanes continue, however, for several more miles until well past the eastern terminus of NY 299, the road that carries traffic west toward the Thruway and New Paltz. About north of that intersection, the road returns to two lanes through West Park and Esopus, passing primarily through largely undeveloped, primarily wooded countryside. It becomes more built up at Port Ewen, just south of Kingston, which it enters by crossing Rondout Creek via the John T. Loughran Bridge and becoming Frank Koenig Boulevard and four lanes with limited access. US 9W entering Kingston. It runs right through Kingston this way and meets NY 32 again at the city's northern boundary. Turning left, US 9W's second concurrency with NY 32 is only long as it almost immediately turns right onto East Chester Street. The road widens again, becoming a busy commercial strip. At the freeway interchange ahead for the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge, US 209 comes to its northern end and NY 199 its western. In Lake Katrine, the road begins to narrow and traffic lightens. US 9W stays on a straight northward course, following alongside Esopus Creek but not crossing it, until it veers northeast to merge, once again, with NY 32\\\\. This third concurrency finally brings the road over the Esopus and into the riverside village of Saugerties. Here US 9W follows Partition Street and then Main Street when the routes part again, with NY 32 carrying NY 212 out of this junction. As Malden Avenue, the highway continues north alongside the river once again, passing through the hamlet of Malden-on- Hudson on its way up into Greene County. =Greene County and north= In Catskill, US 9W meets with NY 23A, then NY 385 at its southern terminus, then a mile north, NY 23\\\\. In Coxsackie, US 9W meets this time with the northern terminus of NY 385, as well as the eastern terminus of NY 81\\\\. In West Coxsackie, US 9W meets with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Further north, the route meets NY 144, and in the village of Ravena, it meets NY 143\\\\. NY 396 meets US 9W in Selkirk. After briefly joining with NY 32 again, US 9W meets I-787 south of Albany. Immediately thereafter, NY 443 joins US 9W until Madison Avenue (US 20), where NY 443 ends. US 9W, however, continues on, meeting with NY 5 (junction not signed on NY 5) before ending at US 9 (Clinton Avenue). History=Origins In New York, much of what is now US 9W was designated as Route 3, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. The route extended from the New Jersey state line at Orangetown and went northward through the Hudson Valley to the city of Albany. Route 3 broke from modern US 9W in several locations, mostly in areas where the route has since been moved onto bypasses. In Clarkstown, Route 3 veered west to serve Congers via Lake and Old Haverstraw Roads. From Highland Falls to Cornwall-on-Hudson, Route 3 followed modern NY 218 around Storm King Mountain. Lastly, Route 3 utilized current NY 385 between Catskill and Coxsackie. Route 3 was altered slightly on March 1, 1921, to bypass Congers on modern US 9W. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 3 south of Ravena was designated as part of NY 10\\\\. From Ravena to Albany, however, NY 10 followed a more easterly alignment along what is now NY 143, NY 144, and NY 32. The New Jersey segment of modern US 9W was originally designated as part of Route 18N in 1923, a route that ran from Hoboken to the New York state line at Alpine via Fort Lee. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 18N was truncated northward to Fort Lee. At the time, present-day County Route 501 (CR 501) north of Fort Lee was part of Route 1.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. In 1929, Route 18N was supplanted by a realigned Route 1.ROUTE NO. 1. Alpine to Bayonne. Beginning at the New York state line on state highway route heretofore designated as Route No. 18--north in Alpine and terminating in Bayonne, by way of Alpine, Tenafly, Fort Lee and Ridgefield, in Bergen county, North Bergen, Jersey City and Bayonne, in Hudson county. L. 1929, c. 126, p. 215, s. 1. The Route 1 designation remained in place until the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering when it was removed to eliminate overlaps with several routes, including US 9W. Designation In the original 1925 plan for the U.S. Highway System, US 9 was designated along the west bank of the Hudson River from Fort Lee to Albany, utilizing Route 18N in New Jersey and NY 10 in New York. The alignment of US 9 in northern New Jersey and New York remained unchanged in the final system alignment approved on November 11, 1926. However, when US 9 was commissioned in 1927, it was split into two branches between Bergen County, New Jersey, and Waterford, New York. The west branch began in Ridgefield and continued to the New York state line on modern Route 93 and CR 501, bypassing Fort Lee to the west. At the state line, the west branch of US 9 became US 9W and followed a short piece of what is now NY 340 to Sparkill. Past Sparkill, US 9W used what was originally planned as US 9 north to Waterford, utilizing modern NY 32 from Albany to Waterford. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The east branch of US 9 initially followed Route 5 east from Ridgefield to Edgewater, where it followed the Edgewater Ferry to the New York state line in the Hudson River. The branch resumed at the northern New York City line as US 9E and continued to Waterford on what is now US 9 and US 4 along the eastern side of the river. At Waterford, the two branches converged and continued north toward the Canada‚ÄìUS border as a unified US 9. Early changes The two branches of US 9 in New Jersey were altered several times over the next decade. At some point between 1927 and 1929, the west branch of US 9 was reconfigured in Bergen County to enter Fort Lee from the south on Palisade Avenue (current Route 67) and proceed north from Fort Lee to New York on Route 18N (later Route 1). The portion of US 9W in New York south of Sparkill was altered accordingly to meet the realigned US 9. In the early 1930s, the east branch of US 9 was shifted southward to reach New York via modern Route 139 and the Holland Tunnel while the west branch of the route was realigned to follow what is now US 1‚Äì9 between Tonnele Circle and Fort Lee. US 9W was extended southward into New Jersey , replacing the west branch of US 9. US 9 was rerouted to follow US 9W and the George Washington Bridge to New York; as a result, US 9W was cut back to its current southern terminus in Fort Lee. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US 9W was truncated southward to end in Albany while US 9E was redesignated as just US 9 and reconfigured to bypass Waterford to the west in favor of a direct alignment between Albany and Round Lake.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering At the same time, US 9W was realigned through New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY 144 instead. The portion of what is now US 9W from New Baltimore to Albany was originally designated as NY 144 as part of the 1930 renumbering while the segment from Catskill to Coxsackie was assigned NY 385 . The alignments of US 9W and NY 385 were swapped by the following year while the routings of US 9W and NY 144 were flipped in April 1935 Bypasses In the early 1930s, plans were made by the state of New York to construct a new highway between the Bear Mountain Bridge and Cornwall- on-Hudson that would bypass both Cornwall-on-Hudson and Highland Falls and bypass the narrow Storm King Highway, US 9W's original routing between the two. On April 8, 1934, three people were killed by a rockslide on the Storm King Highway, expediting plans for the new highway, known as the Storm King Cut-off. The southernmost of the highway‚Äîfrom the bridge to just north of Fort Montgomery‚Äîutilized the existing right-of-way of US 9W, which was widened from two to four lanes and straightened through the construction of rock cuts. Construction on this segment was completed in 1937. The portion of the bypass from Fort Montgomery to Cornwall-on-Hudson, with the exception of a stretch northwest of Highland Falls, was constructed on a new alignment. It was built with four lanes and constructed along the sides of Storm King Mountain and other, smaller hills in the area. The high elevation of the roadway gave rise to a bevy of scenic, panoramic views that stretched for several miles into the distance; as a result, a fifth lane was added in some areas to allow motorists to stop and view the scenery. Like the section south of Fort Montgomery, the one-mile stretch that utilized the original US 9W was widened to four lanes as well. Several interchanges were built along the route, including with NY 293 and NY 307. The cut-off was opened to traffic from Fort Montgomery to NY 293 sometime in 1939 or 1940 and to Angola Road (CR 9) on September 26, 1940. The last section, from Angola Road north to Blooming Grove Turnpike north of Cornwall-on-Hudson, was opened to traffic on May 31, 1941. US 9W was realigned to follow the cut-off while its old route via the Storm King Highway became NY 218. Bypasses have also been proposed or constructed in other locations. In Kingston, US 9W was originally routed on Wurts Street, McEntee Street, Broadway, and East Chester Street. An easterly bypass of the city between Wurts Street and NY 32 was constructed in the late 1970s and completed as a realignment of US 9W by 1981. The portion of US 9W's former alignment south of Abeel Street in Kingston became NY 984D, an unsigned reference route. In Albany, the north end of US 9W and part of US 9 would have been rerouted onto a proposed limited-access highway called the Mid-Crosstown Arterial. The project was eventually cancelled.

According to a 17th-century source, a total of 21 passengers were aboard during its initial expedition.http://www.historyisfun.org/pdf/Jamestown- Ships/Jamestown_Ships_2013.pdf When Captain Newport returned to London, England, he left Discovery behind for the use of the colonists. In the summer of 1608, in the months between the first and second supply missions, Captain John Smith left Jamestown on the ship to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food, covering an estimated , producing a map that was of great value to explorers for more than a century. These explorations were commemorated in the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, established in 2006.

A new Discovery, built in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, was launched in September 2006. The previous replica, built in 1984 in Jamestown, was shipped to the United Kingdom for a tour of the UK as part of the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of Virginia's founding. After its tour, which finished in September 2007, the ship was laid up in Ipswich Marina awaiting a move to a more permanent home. On 19 December 2008, 402 years to the day she left London Docks bound for Virginia, she was officially handed to Westenhanger Castle in Kent by the Jamestown UK Foundation, who had brought the replica vessel to the UK.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Arizona Diamondbacks. The son of former major league infielder Ed Crosby, he batted and threw right-handed. He was Rookie of the Year in 2004. Career Crosby first attended Pacifica High School, then later graduated from La Quinta High School in Westminster, California. In 1998, Bobby Crosby was selected by the Anaheim Angels in the thirty-fourth round of the Major League Baseball Draft. Crosby chose not to sign with the Angels, however, opting instead to play college baseball for California State University, Long Beach. In the 2001, Crosby was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the first round (25th pick) of the Major League Baseball Draft. Oakland Athletics In 2004, his first full MLB season, he took over the Athletics' shortstop duties from 2002 American League Most Valuable Player Miguel Tejada, who signed with the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent. That year, Crosby hit .239 with 22 home runs and 64 RBIs. He also led American League rookies in hits (130), doubles (34) and walks (58). These numbers earned Crosby Rookie of the Year honors, the sixth Athletics player to do so after Harry Byrd (1952), Jos√© Canseco (1986), Mark McGwire (1987), Walt Weiss (1988), and Ben Grieve (1998). In addition to becoming the sixth Athletics player to be named Rookie of the Year, he was the second shortstop in a row to win the award (after √Ångel Berroa of the Kansas City Royals). He was also the eighth shortstop in 22 seasons to earn top rookie honors, the others being Cal Ripken, Jr. (1982), Ozzie Guill√©n (1985), Walt Weiss (1988), Pat Listach (1992), Derek Jeter (1996), Nomar Garciaparra (1997), and Berroa (2003). Crosby was just a vote shy of being a unanimous pick, despite his batting average being the lowest ever for a Rookie of the Year. He also struck out 141 times, fourth-most in the AL, and the team's most since Canseco had 152 in 1991. Crosby and the Oakland Athletics agreed to a five-year, $12.75 million contract on April 22, 2005. Due to the signing of free agent shortstop Orlando Cabrera prior to the 2009 season, Crosby was moved into a utility infielder role. However, with injuries to everyday second baseman Mark Ellis, third baseman Eric Chavez and infielder Nomar Garciaparra (another free agent signing), Crosby was expected to see significant starting roles at third base, as well as at second base. Pittsburgh Pirates and Arizona Diamondbacks The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Crosby as a free agent on December 9, 2009. He appeared in 61 games, with a batting average of .224. The Pirates traded Crosby, D. J. Carrasco and Ryan Church to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Chris Snyder and Pedro Ciriaco on July 31, 2010.Pirates, D'Backs Agree On Chris Snyder Trade Crosby appeared in only nine games for the Diamondbacks, batting just .167, and was released on August 24, 2010. Milwaukee Brewers On January 22, 2013, Crosby signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers, although after again hitting very poorly in Spring Training and not showing any improvement, the Brewers released him. Coaching career Crosby served as a coach for the Midland RockHounds in 2019. Crosby was named the manager of the Stockton Ports for the 2020 season.

Bell series were introduced and developed by Eric Temple Bell. Given an arithmetic function f and a prime p, define the formal power series f_p(x), called the Bell series of f modulo p as: :f_p(x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty f(p^n)x^n. Two multiplicative functions can be shown to be identical if all of their Bell series are equal; this is sometimes called the uniqueness theorem: given multiplicative functions f and g, one has f=g if and only if: :f_p(x)=g_p(x) for all primes p. Two series may be multiplied (sometimes called the multiplication theorem): For any two arithmetic functions f and g, let h=f*g be their Dirichlet convolution. Then for every prime p, one has: :h_p(x)=f_p(x) g_p(x).\\\\, In particular, this makes it trivial to find the Bell series of a Dirichlet inverse.

CNG channels are nonselective cation channels that are found in the membranes of various tissue and cell types, and are significant in sensory transduction as well as cellular development. Their function can be the result of a combination of the binding of cyclic nucleotides (cGMP and cAMP) and either a depolarization or a hyperpolarization event. Initially discovered in the cells that make up the retina of the eye, CNG channels have been found in many different cell types across both the animal and the plant kingdoms. CNG channels have a very complex structure with various subunits and domains that play a critical role in their function. CNG channels are significant in the function of various sensory pathways including vision and olfaction, as well as in other key cellular functions such as hormone release and chemotaxis. CNG channels have also been found to exist in prokaryotes, including many spirochaeta, though their precise role in bacterial physiology remains unknown. An example of the role of cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated ion channels in sea urchin sperm chemotaxis.  Discovery  The discovery of CNG channels is related to the discovery of intracellular messengers responsible for the mediation of responses in retinal photoreceptors. Before their discovery, it was thought that cyclic nucleotides played a role in phosphorylation. In 1985, it was discovered that cGMP was able to directly activate the light-dependent response of rod ion channels by studying light-adapted retina of frogs. CNG channels were also found in cone photoreceptors, chemo sensitive cilia of olfactory sensory neurons, and the pineal gland. After the identification of amino acids from purified proteins, cloning and functional expression of CNG channels were performed. Molecular cloning allowed for the discovery of similar channels in many other tissues. In 2000, scientists performed studies using mouse retina and molecular cloning to find a new subunit of the channel, CNG6.  Function  CNG channels have important functions in signal transduction in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory receptor neurons. They are directly activated by cyclic nucleotides, and approximately 4 cyclic nucleotides are needed to activate each channel. CNG channels are nonselective and allow many alkali ions to flow into or out of a cell expressing CNG channels on its membrane. This flow of ions can result in either depolarization or hyperpolarization. CNG channels can be activated by cAMP or cGMP exclusively, or sometimes by a combination of both cNMPs, and some channels are more selective than others. Even though the activity of these channels show little voltage dependence, they are still considered voltage-dependent channels. Calcium, calmodulin, and phosphorylation modulate the opening of CNG channels. The main role of CNG channels is sensory transduction in various tissues. Many studies have shown CNG channels in rod and cone photoreceptors, and they have also been found in the brain, the heart, the kidneys, and gonads. CNG channel homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Limulus polyphemus have unknown functions. Studies have shown homologs in C. elegans might have functions in chemosensation. Color blindness and retinal degeneration result when CNG channels have mutations. Mutations specifically in the subunits A and B result in complete and incomplete achromatopsia. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate Cyclic guanosine monophosphate Structure A CNG channel consists of four subunits around a central pore. Each protein subunit consists 6 transmembrane segments (S1-S6), a P-loop, intracellular amino terminal region, and carboxy terminal region. The P-loop and S6 segments around the pore, which plays a role in ion conduction. There is a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) and connection region to the S6 segment in the carboxy terminal. There is a post-CNDB region in the amino terminal. Alpha subunits Cyclic nucleotide gated channel alpha-subunits include *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1 *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 2 *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 3 *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 4 Beta subunits Cyclic nucleotide gated channel beta-subunits include: *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 1 *Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta 3 Pore The structure of the pore is similar to other ion channels that contain P-loops. The P-loop enters the membrane of the pore from the extracellular side and exits to the intracellular side. The P loop enters as an alpha helix and exists as an uncoiled strand. Helices that cover the inner membrane line the channel. These also form a 6 helix bundle that signifies the entrance. In order to open the pore, a conformational change must occur in the inner 6 helix bundle. Cyclic nucleotide binding domain A Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain is an intracellular domain located in the C-terminus region and has a similar sequence to other cyclic nucleotide- binding proteins. The domain is believed to be made up of a Œ≤-pleated sheet and two Œ±-helices. The Œ≤-pleated sheet is made up of eight antiparallel strands. The Œ± helices are named the B and C helices. A ligand initially binds to the Œ≤-pleated sheet, and through allosteric regulation causes the movement to an Œ±-helix toward the Œ≤-pleated sheet. The Œ±-helix is flexible in closed channels. When an Œ±-helix of a CNGA1 subunit is in close proximity to another Œ±-helix, they form intersubunit disulfide bonds. This occurs mainly in closed channels, inhibiting movement of the Œ±-helix towards the Œ≤-pleated sheet. When a ligand binds to the Œ≤-pleated sheet, this bound cyclic nucleotide stabilizes the movement of the Œ±-helix toward the Œ≤-pleated sheet in each subunit, pulling the Œ±-helices away from each other. Illustration of a cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated ion channel with a cAMP binding domain. C-linker The C-linker is a region that connects the CNBD to the S6 segment. The C-linker region contributes to the contact between channel subunits as well as promotes tetramerization, the forming of tetramers. There are many residues that play a role in modulation of CNG channels. This process uses metals such as nickel, zinc, copper, and magnesium. The C-linker region is involved in the coupling of ligand binding to the opening of the pore. The C linker region forms disulfide bonds with N-terminal regions. Disulfide bonds alter the channel function therefore they most likely lie close to the tertiary structure. Disulfide bonds decrease the free energy of the open state compared to the closed state. The specific cysteine residue C481 on the C-linker region is located only a few amino acids away from the binding domain. In the closed state C481 is nonreactive; C481 must undergo a conformational change so that it is accessible for the opening of the channel. Disulfide bonds form between neighboring subunits and C481. Simultaneously there is a C35 cysteine residue at the N-terminal of the C-linker region that can reach two C481 residues, making a favorable disulfide bond compared to a C481-C481 bond. S6 region Spontaneous disulfide bond formation is state-dependent, implying that the conformational change in the helix bundle is affiliated with channel gating. When the CNG ion channels are closed, the cytoplasmic ends of the S6 helices are in close proximity to each other. Small cations are able to move through an opening, which implies that the gate is beyond the helix bundle and that S6 helices are in conjunction with conformational changes in the selectivity filter. P region The P region forms a loop, the pore loop, connecting the S5 and S6 regions, which extend to the central axis of the channel. Ionic properties are determined by the residues in the loop between S5 and S6 transmembrane segments. The P region dictates the ion selectivity of the cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel, which also determine the pore diameter of CNG channels. The P region functions as a channel gate since it prevents ion permeation in the closed state. The pore may be hindered by small conformational changes in this region. The P region acts as an ion selectivity filter that changes structure in the open conformation. In the open state, four identical subunits contribute a single P-loop region, which forms a selectivity filter.  CNG channel family  In vertebrates, the CNG channel gene family consists of six members. These genes are divided based on sequence similarity into two subtypes CNGA and CNGB. Additional genes that code for CNG channels have been cloned from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. A subunit of a CNG channel CNGA1, previously called the rod Œ± subunit, was expressed in rod photoreceptors and produced functional channels that were gated by cGMP when expressed externally in either Xenopus oocytes or in a human embryonic kindney cell line (HEK293). In humans, mutated CNGA1 genes result in an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative form of blindness. CNGB1, previously called the rod Œ≤ subunit, is a second subunit of the rod channel. Unlike CNGA1, CNGB1 subunits expressed alone do not produce functional CNG channels, but coexpression of CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits produces heteromeric channels with modulation, permeation, pharmacology, and cyclic-nucleotide specificity comparable to that of native channels. CNG channels form tetramers, and recent studies indicate that native rod channels consist of three CNGA1 subunits and one CNGB1 subunit. CNGA3 subunits, previously called the cone Œ± subunits, form functional channels when its expression occurs exogenously. On the other hand, CNGB3, previously called the cone Œ≤ subunit, does not. Mutations in human CNGA3 and CNGB3 are involved in complete achromatopsia, which is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited and congenital disorder characterized by the complete failure in color distinction. CNGA2, previously called the olfactory Œ± subunit, CNGA4, previously called the olfactory Œ≤ subunit, and CnGB1b are involved in transduction of odorant signals in olfactory sensory neurons for which the subunit stoichiometry and arrangement are unknown. In invertebrates, a CNG channel subunit called CNG-P1 has been cloned from D. melanogaster and is expressed in antennae and the visual system, an indication that CNG channels may be linked to the transduction of light in invertebrates. A second putative CNG-like subunit called CNGL, cloned from D. melanogaster, is found to be expressed in the brain. Two CNG channel subunits, Tax-2 and Tax-4, have been cloned in C. elegans and are responsible for chemosensation, thermosensation, and normal axon outgrowth of some sensory neurons in C. elegans. The binding event  The ligand might be placed at the bottom of the cavity due to interactions with the phosphate binding cassette (PBC). This cavity refers to a region in the CNBD formed by the Œ≤ roll, a two-looped Œ≤ helix. Changes induced by ligand binding occur in Œ± helices (Œ±A, Œ±B, and Œ±C and PBC helix). The Œ≤ roll only undergoes small changes during binding. After the ligand is seated, Œ±B and Œ±C helices arrange themselves so that they form a cap over the cavity. How binding affects the Œ±A helix is still unclear. Cooperative and non-cooperative activation The steep concentration between CNG channels and ligand concentration shows that at least two or three cyclic nucleotides are needed. It is believed that the second ligand is required for the channel to transition from closed to open. When the third and fourth ligands bind, the open state of the channel becomes stabilized. In bacteria, the opening CNG channels is the result of non-cooperative binding. With differing concentrations of ligands, cooperative binding and non-cooperative binding arise to adapt to these differing environments. At low ligand concentrations, it is rare for a ligand to cooperatively bind, because cooperative binding at low concentrations weakens the binding between channel and ligand, reducing channel sensitivity.  Ligand selectivity  By measuring the currents activated in excised inside-out membrane patches upon superfusion with varying ligand concentrations, the ligand sensitivity and selectivity of both endogenously and exogenously expressed CNG channels have been studied. All native CNG channels react to both cAMP and cGMP, but smaller concentrations of cGMP than of cAMP are needed to activate and open the channels. CNG channels are sharply selective between cGMP and cAMP in rods and cones, whereas in OSNs, the channels respond equally well to both ligands. CNG channels found in OSNs are much more sensitive to both cGMP and cAMP than photoreceptor CNG channels. Studies of dose response relations showed that channel activation is greatly dependent on cGMP concentration; several cGMP molecules bind to the channel in a cooperative manner. Since each subunit contains a single cNMP- binding site, and homomeric and heteromeric channels most likely form a tetrameric complex, a maximum of four ligand molecules can bind to the channel. Selectivity can be achieved by differential control of the affinity for binding of the ligand, efficacy of gating, or a combination of both. Binding affinity means how tightly cyclic nucleotides bind to the channel. Efficacy refers to the ability of ligand to activate and open the channel once it is bound. Although these processes are useful in understanding selectivity, they are inextricably coupled to each other that it is very difficult to experimentally separate one from another. CNG channels do not discriminate between Na+ and K+ ions, and they also allow Ca2+ and Mg2+ to pass through, although at a slower rate. The passage of these divalent ions inhibit the current carried by Na+ and K+. A highly conserved residue of glutamic acid in the selectivity filter of CNG channels has been found to form a high-affinity binding site for Ca2+. Moreover, a bacterial nonselective cation channel called the NaK channel hosts a selectivity filter sequence similar to that of CNG channels. In the crystal structure of the NaK channel, a discrete Ca2+-binding site at the extracellular opening of the pore has been identified. Inhibition of CNG channels  Studies have shown the differential inhibition of CNG channels by diacylglycerol (DAG) in Xenopus oocytes. DAG can be used as a closed state inhibitor. Using DAG to inhibit homomultimeric rod channels, or those that contain two or more identical peptide chains, was similar to the inhibition of native rod channels. Using DAG to inhibit the homomultimeric olfactory channels was not as effective, even with a high concentration of DAG. More than one molecule of DAG is needed to inhibit a channel effectively. DAG molecules position themselves to stabilize the close state of a CNG channel, by binding to the channel or by changing the interaction between the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and the channel. Studies with chimeras rod and olfactory channels suggest that differences in DAG inhibition are due to differences in the attached loop of the transmembrane segment.  Physiological significance = Photoreceptors  In the absence of light, cGMP binds to CNG channels in photoreceptors. This binding causes the channels to open, which allows sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) ions to flow into the cell causing the outer segment of the photoreceptor to depolarize. This depolarizing flow of ions is known as the dark current. When the retina of the eye detects light, a reaction known as a phototransduction cascade occurs. It is a signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which hydrolyzes cGMP into 5‚Äô-GMP, decreasing the concentration of cGMP. In the absence of cGMP, the CNG channels in the photoreceptors close preventing the flow of the aforementioned dark current. This in turn causes a hyperpolarization of the outer segment of the photoreceptor, preventing the propagation of an action potential and the release of glutamate. Studies have shown that over activation of cGMP-dependent CNG channels in photoreceptors can lead to their degeneration. If the CNG channels on a photoreceptor are continuously activated, Ca2+ and Na+ ion flux into the outer segment of the photoreceptor will increase so that it depolarizes beyond the dark current. Through a positive feedback loop, this would then increase the current of Ca2+ into the cell. High concentration of Ca2+ in the photoreceptor cell would lead to its death programmed cell death or apoptosis. =Retinitis pigmentosa= Fundus of patient with retinitis pigmentosa, mid stage (Bone spicule-shaped pigment deposits are present in the mid periphery along with retinal atrophy, while the macula is preserved although with a peripheral ring of depigmentation. Retinal vessels are attenuated.) Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic disease in which patients suffer degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. The loss starts in the patient's peripheral vision and progresses to the central visual field, leaving the patient blind by middle age. About 1% of RP patients have mutations in cGMP alpha-subunit. Eight mutations have been identified- four are nonsense mutations, one is a deletion that includes most of the transcriptional unit. The other three are missense mutations and frameshift mutations, which lead to a shortening of amino acid sequence in the C terminus. It is still not known why the absence of cGMP-gated cation channels causes photoreceptor degradation. Mutations causing RP have also been found in the rhodopsin gene and in the alpha- and beta-subunits of rod phosphodiesterase, which encode rod phototransduction cascades. The mutation of these subunits indirectly impairs rod cGMP-gated channel function, which implies that there is a common mechanism of photoreceptor degradation.  Pacemaker cells  In the nervous system, heart, and some visceral organs, cells contain cyclic nucleotide gated channels which determine the rhythm of the organ. These channels, formally called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated channels (HCN channels), are also termed \\"pacemaker channels\\" because of this critical function. As their name implies, they are open during conditions of hyperpolarization and closed during depolarization. The significance of this in the sinoatrial node (and, as backup, in the atrioventricular node) is that as the heart resets, or hyperpolarizes, after each beat, HCN channels open, allowing positive ions to rush into the cell (the so-called funny current), triggering another depolarization event and subsequent cardiac contraction. This gives the heart its automaticity. The primary cyclic nucleotide operating in conjunction with the HCN channel is cAMP.  Olfactory sensory neurons  Almost all responses to odorants in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are facilitated by CNG channels. When an odorant binds to its specific receptor in the chemosensitive cilia membrane, it activates a G protein, which causes a downstream reaction activating the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (AC). This enzyme is responsible for an increase in cAMP concentration within the OSN. cAMP binds to the CNG channels in the OSN membrane, opening them, and making the cell highly permeable to Ca2+. Calcium ions flow into the cell causing a depolarization. As in all other cell types, CNG channels in OSNs also allow Na+ to flow into the cell. Additionally, the increased Ca2+ concentration inside the cell activates Ca2+-dependent chloride (Cl‚àí) channels, which causes intracellular Cl‚àí ions to also flow out of the cell augmenting the depolarization event. This depolarization stimulates an action potential that ultimately signals the reception of the odorant. In addition to cAMP gated ion channels, a small subset of OSNs also has cGMP- selective CNG channels that contain the CNGA3 subunit.  Spermatozoa  cAMP and cGMP mediate several cellular responses such as acrosomal exocytosis, or the fusion of the male sperm to the female egg, and chemotaxis. In the sea urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, speract, a short peptide, was studied. Speract activates a receptor-type guanylate cyclase (GC) and stimulates a rise in intracellular cGMP concentrations. Speract also increases the concentration of calcium. Although there has yet to be any establishment of a direct causal relationship, the previously mentioned observations suggest that cGMP activates calcium conductance. CNG channels are prime candidates for the calcium-entry pathway, due to their high calcium permeability. CNG channels have yet to be detected by homology screening. In mammals, the testicular CNG channel subunits that are expressed are A3, B1, and B3. Heterologous expression of the A3 subunit was cloned from testis and produced channels that were cGMP sensitive and selective. It is possible that these channels are involved in a cGMP-stimulated calcium flux into the sperm. However a more extensive characterization of the channel has not been accomplished due to the low success rate of detecting channel activity. Since A3 subunit knockout mice are fertile, CNG channels could be involved in some form of motility control and even in chemotactic swimming behavior or in the acrosomal exocytosis. However, a receptor-type GC in mammalian sperm has yet to be identified. Mouse sperm express other channels such as CatSper1. Male sterility can be accomplished by disrupting the CatSper1 gene; additionally, the cAMP-induced calcium influx is abolished in mutant mice. Although CatSper need additional subunits to become functional, they are unrelated to CNG channels because CatSper lacks a cAMP/cGMP-binding site. It is possible that CNG and CatSper subunits assemble to form calcium-permeable and cyclic nucleotide-sensitive ion channels.  Kidney  cGMP-sensitive channels have been analyzed in the renal medulla, specifically in collecting duct cells, which influence the body's electrolyte and fluid balance. CNG channel activity is controlled by the interaction between cGMP-dependent protein kinase and G1 protein because of cGMP's involvement in phosphorylation mechanisms. In the cells from an inner medullary collecting duct, CNG channels exhibit cation selectivity unit conductance, calcium permeability, and pharmacology very similar to cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. A stimulant, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) increases cGMP production in the kidneys, which increases function of the glomerulus by a combination of relaxing and contracting arterioles. Differences between retinal and renal cDNA have been implicated in the functional differences between CNG channels in these two tissues. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone There has been identification of CNG ion channel subunits A2, A4, and B1 in a neuronal cell line that secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GrH). The three subunits make up the CNG channels on chemosensitive cilia of OSNs. In high extracellular calcium, the unit conductance of CNG channels in rods and OSNs are significantly smaller than those measured in the neuronal line. It seems doubtful that CNG channels would create large unit conductance. CryoEM Structure of a prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel. Plants CNG ions channels in plants are similar in amino acid sequence and structure to non-selective cation CNG channels in animals, as well as trans-membrane-domain K+-selective shaker family channels. However, there are drastic differences that are seen exclusively in plant CNG channels. The amino acid sequence of the pore sequence in plant CNG channels lacks the selectivity filter found in animal CNG channels as well as lacks a glycine-tyrosine-glycine-aspartate (GYGD) motif in the K+-selectivity filter sequence. Other sequence differences are seen in plant CNG channels, particularly in the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). In plants, the Calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) is found to overlap Œ±-helix C in the CNBD of CNG channels. In animals the CaMBDs are located far away from the CNBD.CNG channels play a large role in plant immunity and response to pathogens or external infectious agents. They have also been implicated in apoptosis in plants. CNG ion channels are also thought to be involved in pollen development in plants, however its exact role in this mechanism is still not known. Unlike animal CNG channels, plant CNG channels have not been extensively analyzed biochemically with respect to their structure.  Prokaryotes  CNG ion channels share a high degree of sequence and structural similarity to mammalian CNG channels. Like mammalian CNG channels, binding of cyclic nucleotides to the CNBDs has been shown to regulate channel activity and alter the channel conformational state. Because these channels were only recently identified in spirochaeta and leptospira species, their precise physiological function remains unknown in these organisms. In combination with photoactivated adenylyl cyclases, they have been used as optogenetic tools to inhibit action potential generation in neurons.  Current and future research  Researchers have answered many important questions regarding CNG ion channels functions in vision and olfaction. In other physiological areas, the role of CNG channels is less defined. With technological growth, there now exists more possibilities for understanding these mechanisms. Because nitric oxide (NO) is involved in stimulating the synthesis of cGMP, further research is being conducted to understand the physiological interaction of NO with CNG channels, particularly in the covalent modification of CNG channels in OSNs. Scientists are adding on to the mechanism involved in the interaction of binding sites and interfaces of subunits. This might be nonexistent in non-cooperative CNG channels. It is also possible that binding site and gate are attached to a single subunit. In order to develop these ideas, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) and rapid fixing techniques can show these mechanistic movements. A 2007 study suggests that because of the various and complex regulatory properties in addition to the large number of CNG channels in plants, a multidisciplinary study to research plant CNG channels should be conducted. Another study in March 2011 recognizes recent reverse genetics data that has been helpful in further understanding CNG channels in plants, and also suggests that additional research be conducted to identify the upstream and downstream factors in CNGC-mediated signal transduction in plants. Scientist are speculating whether DAG directly binds with CNG channel during inhibition. It is possible that DAG may insert itself into the transmembrane domains in the channel. It is also possible that DAG inserts itself into the interface between the channel and bilayer. The molecular mechanism of DAG inhibition is still not fully understood.

It is one of the most famous Shiva temples in South India, and is said to be the site where Kannappa was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Siva linga before the Siva stopped him and granted him moksha. Srikalahasti temple, situated 36 km away from Tirupati is famous for its Vayu linga, one of the Panchabhoota Sthalams, representing wind. The temple is also regarded as Rahu-Ketu kshetra and Dakshina Kailasam. The inner temple was constructed around 5th century and the outer temple was constructed in the 11th century by the Rajendra Chola I, later Chola kings and the Vijayanagara kings. Shiva in his aspect as Vayu is worshiped as Kalahasteeswara. Legend During the early days of creation, Vayu performed penance for thousands of years to \\"Karpoora lingam\\" (Karpooram means camphor). Pleased with his penance, Shiva manifested before him and said, \\" O Vayu Deva! Though you are dynamic in nature, you stayed here without movement and did penance for me. I'm pleased with your devotion. I shall grant you three boons\\". Vayu said, \\"Swami! I want to be present everywhere in this world. I want to be an integral part of every Jiva who is none other than the manifestation of Paramatma. I want to name this Karpoora Linga, which represents you, after me. Samba Siva said,\\" Your are qualified for these three boons. As per your wish, you will be spread throughout this world. Without you there will be no life. This linga of mine will forever be known all over through your name, and all Suras, Asuras, Garuda, Gaandharvas, Kinneras, kimpurushas, Siddhas, Saadhvis, humans and others will worship this Lingam\\". Shiva disappeared after granting these boons. Thereafter, this Karpoora Vayu Lingam is worshipped by all Lokas (worlds). There are several other legends connected to the glory of the temple. Prominent among them is of Parvati who was cursed by Shiva to discard her heavenly body and assume the human form. To get rid of the above curse Parvati did a long penance here. Pleased with her deep devotion Shiva again recreated her body ‚Äì a hundred times better than her previous heavenly body and initiated various mantras including the Panchakshari. Consequent to this, Parvati gained fame and came to be known as Shiva-Gnanam Gnana Prasunamba or Gnana Prasunambika Devi. Cursed to become a ghost, Ghanakala prayed at Srikalahasti for 15 years and after chanting the Bhairava Mantra many times Shiva restored her original form. Mayura, Chandra and Devendra were also freed from their curses after taking bath in the river Swarnamukhi and praying at Srikalahasti. To Bhakta Markandeya, Shiva appeared in Srikalahasti and preached that a Guru alone could make esoteric teachings and, therefore he is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara. As per another legend, Vayu and Adishesha had a dispute to find out who is superior, to prove the superiority Adishesha encircled the Kailasam, Vayu tried to remove this encircle by creating Twister. Because of the twister, 8 parts from kailasam fell into 8 different places which are Trincomalee, Srikalahasti, Thiruchiramalai, Thiruenkoimalai, Rajathagiri, Neerthagiri, Ratnagiri, and Suwethagiri Thirupangeeli.http://www.gneelivaneshwarartemple.tnhrce.in/History.html History Around the 11th century, the Chola king Rajendra Chola I king renovated the temple and constructed the main structure. The temple received contributions from various ruling dynasties like Chola Dynasty and Vijayanagar Empire. The hundred pillared hall with intricate carvings was commissioned during the regime of Krishnadeva Raya during 1516 AD. Architecture The temple was built by Rajendra Chola I, The high main gopuram and the 100 pillar mandapam were constructed by Krishnadevaraya, the Vijayanagara king in 1516. The presiding image of Shiva in the form of Linga is made of white stone in a shape resembling trunk of elephant. The temple faces south, while the sanctum faces west. The temple is located on the foothills of a hill, while there is also a belief that the temple was carved out of a monolithic hill. There is a rock cut shrine of Vinayaka, below the ground level. Vallaba Ganapathi, Mahalakshmi-Ganpathi and Sahasra Lingeswara are some of the rare images found in the temple. There is a large shrine of Jnanaprasanammba, the consort of Kalahatisvara. There are smaller shrines in the temple for Kasi Viswanatha, Annapurna, Suryanarayana, Sadyoganapathi and Subramanya. There are two large halls namely Sadyogi Mandapa and Jalkoti Mandapa. There are two water bodies associated with the namely, Surya Pushkarani and Chandra Pushkarani. Religious importance The temple is revered as one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalam where the presiding deity is worshipped as Vayu linga (air). This temple is considered \\"Kashi of the South\\". Saivaite saints of the first century sang about this temple. This is the only temple in India which remains open during Solar and lunar eclipses, while, all other temples are closed. This temple is famous for Rahu-Kethu pooja. It is believed that performing this pooja will ward the people from astrological effects of Rahu and Kethu. As per Hindu legend, Kalahatiswara was worshipped at this place by Brahma during all four Yugas. Arjuna, the Pandava prince during Mahabharata is believed to have worshipped the presiding deity. The legend of Kannappa, who was a hunter and turned into an ardent devotee of Shiva accidentally, is associated with the temple. The temple also finds mention in the works of Nakeerar and the Nalvars, namely, Appar, Sundarar, Sambandar and Manickavasagar in the canonical works of Tirumura. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Culture The shrine of Amman located parallel to the Shiva shrine The temple follows Saivite tradition. Maha Shivaratri is the most important festival when lakhs of devotees offer prayers to seek the blessings of the Lord. Mahasivaratri Brahmotsavams are celebrated in par with Maha Shivaratri for 13 days during which the Utsava murtis of Siva and Parvati will be taken on Vahanams in a procession around the temple streets. Temple tower collapse and Reconstruction The temple in reconstruction, view from Kannappa Hill near the ...river (2016) The 15 century iconic Rajagopuram of Srikalahasti Temple, built by Sri Krishnadevaraya, collapsed on 26 May 2010.

It is further divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee (T. m. latirostris) and the Antillean or Caribbean manatee (T. m. manatus), based on genetic and morphological studies. The Florida subspecies is primarily found along the coasts of Florida, but its range extends as far west as Texas and as far north as Massachusetts.Manatees , Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program The Antillean subspecies has a sparse distribution throughout the Caribbean, ranging as far north as Mexico and as far south as Brazil. Manatees are obligate herbivores, have developed vocal communication abilities, and are covered in highly sensitive vibrissae that are used for feeding and navigation. In breeding season, several males form mating herds around an individual female; on average, one calf is born to a female manatee every two to three years. The West Indian manatee was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in the 1970s, when there were only several hundred left, and the decades since have witnessed significant efforts by federal, state, private, and nonprofit organizations to protect these species from natural and human-induced threats, particularly collisions with watercraft. On March 30, 2017, the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced the federal reclassification of the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened, citing a substantial increase in the total population. Description The average West Indian manatee is about long and weighs , with females generally larger than males.Trichechus manatus , Animal Diversity Web The largest individual on record weighed and measured long.Wood, G.L. (1983). The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. 3rd revised edition. Sterling Pub Co Inc., Manatees , Busch Gardens Manatees are estimated to live 50 years or more in the wild, and one captive Florida manatee, Snooty, lived for 69 years. Skull of a West Indian manatee on display at The Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Since manatees are mammals, they breathe air, have warm blood, and produce milk. Like the other sirenians, the West Indian manatee has adapted fully to aquatic life, having no hind limbs. Instead of hind limbs, the manatee has a spatula-like paddle for propulsion in the water. Manatees have evolved streamlined bodies which lack external ear flaps, thus decreasing resistance in the aquatic environment. Pelage cover is sparsely distributed across the body, which may play a role in reducing the build-up of algae on their thick skin. Manatee skin is gray but can vary in coloration due to algae and other biota, like barnacles, that opportunistically live on manatees. Scar tissue on manatees is white and persists for decades, allowing for easy identification. The Florida manatee has three to four nails on each flipper.Reep, R. L. & Bonde, R. K. (2006). The Florida manatee: Biology and conservation. Gainesville: The University Press of Florida. The West Indian manatee has a prehensile snout, like their relative the elephant, for grabbing vegetation and bringing it into their mouths. Manatees have six to eight moliform teeth in each jaw quadrant. These moliform teeth are generated at the back of the mouth and slowly migrate towards the front of the mouth, at a rate of 1‚Äì2 mm per month, where they then fall out. This tooth ‚Äòconveyor belt‚Äô provides unlimited tooth production which is beneficial for the manatee which feeds on vegetation four to eight hours per day and consumes 5-10% of its body weight per day. Manatees have 3‚Äì5 cm hairs that cover their whole body and provide somatosensory information. Manatee bones are dense and solid which allows them to act as ballast and promote negative buoyancy. This helps counteract the positive buoyancy which comes from their high fat content. These two buoyancy counterparts, along with air in the lungs, helps manatees achieve neutral buoyancy in the water. This makes breathing, foraging, and swimming easier for the manatee. Manatees are unique, compared to other mammals, in that they have a longitudinally oriented diaphragm that is spit in half to form two hemidiaphragms. Each hemidiaphragm is capable of independent muscular contractions. Distribution and habitat The West Indian manatee inhabits mostly shallow coastal areas, including rivers and estuaries. Manatees can withstand large changes in salinity and have been found in highly brackish and saline waters. Manatees' extremely low metabolic rate and lack of a thick layer of insulating body fat limits them to locations with warm waters, including tropical regions. Although most commonly found along the Florida coast, the West Indian manatee has been spotted as far north as Dennis, Massachusetts, and as far west as Texas. A manatee was spotted in the Wolf River (near where it enters the Mississippi) in Memphis, Tennessee in 2006. An analysis of mitochondrial DNA patterns indicates there are actually three primary geographic groups of the West Indian manatee: (1) Florida and the Greater Antilles; (2) Mexico, Central America and northern South America; and (3) northeastern South America. The seasonal distribution of the West Indian manatee varies with water temperatures. Temperatures below approximately 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F) increase the risk of cold-induced stress or mortality for manatees. Consequently, Florida manatees seek out warm-water refuges during the winter, concentrated primarily along the Florida peninsula. Many of these refuges are artificial, created by the runoff from nearby power plants. In contrast, the Antillean manatee is less susceptible to cold-induced stress due to the warmer waters across its range. Manatee from Crystal River, Florida Florida manatees inhabit the most northern limit of sirenian habitats. There are four recognized subpopulations of the Florida manatee, termed the Northwest, Southwest, Atlantic Coast, and St. John's River populations. Large concentrations of Florida manatees are located in the Crystal River and Blue Springs regions in central and north Florida. The Antillean manatee is sparsely distributed throughout the Caribbean and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, from Mexico, east to the Greater Antilles, and south to Brazil. Populations can also be found in The Bahamas, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. Behavior and diet Basking at Haulover Canal, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, Florida  Behavior  Because manatees evolved in habitats without natural predators, they lack predator avoidance behavior. The large size and low metabolic rates of manatees lends to their capacity for long and deep dives, as well as their relative lack of speed. Manatees are frequently solitary creatures, but they do aggregate at warm-water habitats during the winter and during the formation of breeding herds. Communication Manatees have been shown to form large mating herds when males come across estrous females, indicating that males may be able to sense estrogen or other chemical indicators. Manatees can communicate information to each other through their vocalization patterns. Sex and age-related differences are apparent in the vocalization structure of common squeaks and screeches in adult males, adult females, and juveniles. This may be an indication of vocal individuality among manatees. An increase in manatee vocalization after a vocal playback stimulus shows that they may be able to recognize another manatee's individual voice. This behavior in manatees is found mostly between mother and calf interactions. However, vocalization can still be commonly found in a variety of social interactions within groups of manatees, which is similar to other aquatic mammals. When communicating in noisy environments, manatees that are in groups experience the same Lombard effect as humans do; where they will involuntary increase their vocal effort when communicating in loud environments. Based on acoustic and anatomical evidence, mammalian vocal folds are assumed to be the mechanism for sound production in manatees. Manatees also eat other manatees' feces; it is assumed that they do this to gather information about reproductive status or dominance, indicating the important role chemoreception plays in the social and reproductive behavior of manatees. Diet Manatees are obligate herbivores that feed on over 60 species of aquatic plants in both fresh and salt water. Seagrass is a staple of the manatee diet, particularly in coastal areas. In addition, when the tide is high enough, they will also feed on grasses and leaves. Manatees typically graze for five or more hours per day, consuming anywhere from 4% to 10% of their body weight in wet vegetation per day, though the exact amount depends on their body size and activity level. Because manatees feed on abrasive plants, their molars are often worn down and are replaced many times throughout their lives, thus earning the nickname \\"marching molars.\\" The molar teeth are similar in shape, but of varying sizes. Manatees do not have incisors; these have been replaced by horny gingival plates. Manatees are nonruminants with an enlarged hindgut. Unlike other hindgut fermenters, such as the horse, manatees efficiently extract nutrients, particularly cellulose, from the aquatic plants in their diet. Manatees have a large gastrointestinal tract with contents measuring about 23% of its total body mass. In addition, the passage rate of food is very long (about seven days). This slow process increases the digestibility of their diet. It is suggested that chronic fermentation may also provide additional heat and is correlated with their low metabolic rate. Vibrissae Sculpture of manatee showing vibrissae All the hairs of the manatee may be vibrissae Manatees have sensitive tactile hairs that cover their bodies and faces called vibrissae. Each individual hair is a vibrissal apparatus called a follicle-sinus complex. Vibrissae are blood filled sinuses bound by a dense connective tissue capsule with sensitive nerve endings that provides haptic feedback to the manatee. Usually vibrissae are found on the facial regions of terrestrial and non-sirenian aquatic animals and are called whiskers. Manatees, however, have vibrissae all over their bodies. The vibrissae located in their facial region are roughly 30 times denser than the vibrissae on the rest of their body. Their mouth consists of very mobile prehensile lips which are used for grasping food and objects. The vibrissae on these lips are turned outward during grasping and are used in locating vegetation. Their oral disks also contain vibrissae which have been classified as bristle-like hairs that are used in nongrasping investigation of objects and food.Hartman DS. (1979). Ecology and behavior of the manatee (Trichechus manatus) in Florida. American Society of Mammalogists Special Publication No. 5. 1‚Äì153. Manatee vibrissae are so sensitive that they are able to perform active touch discrimination of textures. Manatees also use their vibrissae to navigate the turbid waterways of their environment. Research has indicated that they are able to use these vibrissae to detect hydrodynamic stimuli in the same way that fish use their lateral line system.  Reproduction  Male manatees reach sexual maturity at 3‚Äì4 years of age, while females reach sexual maturity at 3‚Äì5 years of age. Manatees appear capable of breeding throughout their entire adult life, although most females first breed successfully at ages 7‚Äì9. Breeding occurs in ephemeral mating herds, where several males aggregate around an estrous female and compete for access to her. Larger males, presumably older, have been observed to dominate mating herds and are likely responsible for most successful copulation events. The gestation period in manatees lasts for 12‚Äì14 months, after which they give birth to one calf at a time, or rarely twins. When a calf is born, it usually weighs and is long. Manatees do not form permanent pair bonds and the male contributes no parental care to the calf, which remains with the mother for up to two years prior to weaning. A single female can reproduce once every 2‚Äì3 years. Wild manatees have been documented producing offspring into their late 30s, and a female captive manatee has given birth in her 40s. Threats and conservation Manatees in a conservation project in Brazilian northeastern coast The West Indian manatee has been included on the US Endangered Species List since the 1970s. In October 2007, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed the West Indian manatee as vulnerable, and both the Florida and Antillean subspecies as endangered. The full species and both subspecies qualified for their respective classifications due to a combination of a low number of mature individuals, and a significant projected decline in total population numbers over the next two generations (about 20 years per generation in manatees). Threats to the Florida and Antillean subspecies are relatively separate, though sometimes overlapping. The greatest causes of Florida manatee deaths include collisions with watercraft, high perinatal mortality, the loss of warm-water habitat, and red tide. Antillean manatees face severe habitat fragmentation, as well as continued pressure from illegal hunting. The 2017 decision to reclassify the West Indian manatee from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act cited increases in the populations of both subspecies. The decision was not without controversy, however: according to Save the Manatee Club, the US Fish and Wildlife Service failed to adequately consider data from 2010 to 2016, during which time manatees suffered from unprecedented mortality events linked to habitat pollution, dependence on artificial warm water sources, and record deaths from watercraft strikes. The official notice of the reclassification made clear that, even with the downlisting, all federal protections for the West Indian manatee under the Endangered Species Act would remain in place. The West Indian manatee is also protected by the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978 and the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.  T. m. latirostris (Florida manatee)  A 1997 population viability analysis of the Florida manatee projected a 44% chance of extinction within the next 1,000 years without improvements in habitat conditions and new protective regulations. Since then, prospects for the subspecies have improved. In 2016, the US Geological Survey collaborated with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service to re-evaluate the status of the Florida manatee under the Core Biological Model, which is used to estimate population viability. This assessment analyzed total population on the east and west coasts of Florida and estimated that the likelihood of either population falling under 500 adults within 100 years was about 0.42%. The projected improvement of population numbers and stability is contingent on continued intervention and monitoring efforts. At least 35% of Florida manatee deaths are estimated to result from watercraft collisions. Manatees respond to approaching vessels by orienting towards deeper waters and increasing their speed, but they are nevertheless frequently struck due to their large size and sluggishness. Aerial surveys of Florida manatee and boat distribution have been conducted to map the areas in which collisions are most likely to occur, accounting for environmental and seasonal factors. Watercraft can frequently avoid hitting manatees simply by reducing speed, allowing time for the manatee to escape out of range. Despite improvements in modeling and changes to local regulations, a 2017 report found that 104 manatees were killed by collisions with watercraft in the previous year, one of the highest totals on record. Projected long-term loss of warm-water habitats presents a significant risk to manatees, who are unable to tolerate temperatures lower than . Florida manatees frequently congregate around the warm discharge given off by power plants throughout the winter months; however, as older plants are replaced with more energy-efficient structures, manatees could become at risk of cold-induced death due to reduced availability of warm-water refuges. Manatees can recall previous refuge sites and frequently return to them in successive winters, but some conservationists fear that manatees may become overly reliant on warm-water locations generated by power plants that may shut down soon. In areas where manatees lack access to power plants or natural warm springs, they instead seek out natural deep water zones that passively remain above tolerable temperatures. Red tide is a common name for algal blooms, deriving its distinctive color from pigmentation molecules in the algae. The blooms produce brevetoxins which are potentially fatal to marine life. Most manatee deaths from red tide occur when manatees ingest the red tide alongside seagrass, their primary food source. Red tide blooms and related manatee mortality tend to co-occur during the spring. West Indian manatee skeletons on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina  T. m. manatus (Antillean manatee)  There is relatively little data on the Antillean manatee compared to its Florida counterpart. Phylogenetic studies on the Antillean manatee have revealed low genetic diversity among its populations, likely due to limitations on dispersal. Captive breeding, as well as the rehabilitation of manatee calves discovered without their mothers nearby, can supplement local conservation strategies, but populations are nevertheless at risk of inbreeding depression and local extinction. Whereas the population trends of the Florida manatee are relatively well monitored, population data for the Antillean manatee is sparse due to its patchy distribution, as well as the relative turbidity and low levels of light in its habitat which can mitigate the effectiveness of aerial or sonar-based surveys, often resulting in inaccurate or erroneous measurements. A 2016 study on the Antillean manatee population of Brazil found a potential range for current population size between 485 and 2,221 individuals. The US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in 2017 that as many as 6,782 individuals might exist in the Antillean subspecies, but these results rely in large part on personal anecdotes and may overestimate the true population number. A 2012 study of the Antillean population documented significant human-related causes of mortality, and projected that if the share of human-caused manatee deaths per year rose to 5% or more, the population would face a severe decline and eventual extinction.

It was originally developed as a web-based cartoon by Microsoft's then-new MSN, in partnership with Sp√ºmc√∏ studio. After failing to receive approval for publishing from Microsoft, all properties were released to Sp√ºmc√∏, and the web-based cartoon was spun out directly by the Sp√ºmc√∏ studio. Michael Pataki voiced Liquor in the series. Sp√ºmc√∏ produced eight one-minute shorts. Premiering on October 15, 1997, The Goddamn George Liquor Program was the first cartoon series to be produced exclusively for the internet. George appeared on the series with his nephew, Jimmy The Idiot Boy; Jimmy's cousins, Slab and Ernie; Jimmy's love interest, Sody Pop; and George and Jimmy's pet dog, Dirty Dog. Without the control of a network, the series could be made as Kricfalusi wanted. The Goddamn George Liquor Program won the 1999 Annie Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Interactive Production\\". Later the show was being developed as a series of cartoon commercials for Pontiac Vibe. The new series remained unreleased after General Motors discontinued the Pontiac Vibe auto line in 2009.

It infects the livers of various mammals, including humans. The disease caused by the fluke is called fasciolosis or fascioliasis, which is a type of helminthiasis and has been classified as a neglected tropical disease. Fasciolosis is currently classified as a plant/food-borne trematode infection, often acquired through eating the parasite's metacercariae encysted on plants. F. hepatica, which is distributed worldwide, has been known as an important parasite of sheep and cattle for decades and causes significant economic losses in these livestock species, up to ¬£23 million in the UK alone. Because of its relatively large size and economic importance, it has been the subject of many scientific investigations and may be the best-known of any trematode species. F. hepatica's closest relative is Fasciola gigantica. These two flukes are sister species; they share many morphological features and can mate with each other.  Life cycle  Galba truncatula, an amphibious freshwater lymnaeid snail that serves as the main intermediate host of Fasciola hepatica in Europe The lifecycle of Fasciola hepatica Fasciola hepatica occurs in the liver of a definitive host and its lifecycle is indirect. Definitive hosts of the fluke are cattle, sheep, and buffaloes. Wild ruminants and other mammals, including humans, can act as definitive hosts as well. The life cycle of F. hepatica goes through the intermediate host and several environmental larval stages. Intermediate hosts of F. hepatica are air-breathing freshwater snails from the family Lymnaeidae. Although several lymnaeid species susceptible to F. hepatica have been described, the parasite develops only in one or two major species on each continent. Galba truncatula is the main snail host in Europe, partly in Asia, Africa, and South America. Lymnaea viator, L. neotropica, Pseudosuccinea columella, and L. cubensis are most common intermediate hosts in Central and South America. Several other lymnaeid snails may be naturally or experimentally infected with F. hepatica, but their role in transmission of the fluke is low. The list of lymnaeid snails that may serve as natural or experimental intermediate hosts of F. hepatica include: * Austropeplea ollula * Austropeplea tomentosa * Austropeplea viridis * Fossaria bulimoides * Galba truncatula * Lymnaea cousini * Lymnaea cubensis * Lymnaea diaphana * Lymnaea humilis * Lymnaea neotropica * Lymnaea occulta * Lymnaea stagnalis * Lymnaea viatrix * Omphiscola glabra * Pseudosuccinea columella * Radix auricularia * Radix lagotis * Radix natalensis * Radix peregra * Radix rubiginosa * Stagnicola caperata * Stagnicola fuscus * Stagnicola palustris * Stagnicola turricula The metacercariae are released from the freshwater snail as cercariae, and form cysts on various surfaces including aquatic vegetation. The mammalian host then eats this vegetation and can become infected. Humans can often acquire these infections through drinking contaminated water and eating freshwater plants such as watercress. Inside the duodenum of the mammalian host, the metacercariae are released from within their cysts. From the duodenum, they burrow through the lining of the intestine and into the peritoneal cavity. They then migrate through the intestines and liver, and into the bile ducts. Inside the bile ducts, they develop into an adult fluke. In humans, the time taken for F. hepatica to mature from metacercariae into an adult fluke is roughly 3 to 4 months. The adult flukes can then produce up to 25,000 eggs per fluke per day. These eggs are passed out via stools and into freshwater. Once in freshwater, the eggs become embryonated, allowing them to hatch as miracidia, which then find a suitable intermediate snail host of the Lymnaeidae family. Inside this snail, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, then to rediae, then to cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail to form metacercariae and the life cycle begins again.  Morphology and anatomy  Fasciola hepatica is one of the largest flukes of the world, reaching a length of 30 mm and a width of 13 mm (Fasciola gigantica, though, is even bigger and can reach up to 75 mm). It is leaf-shaped, pointed at the back (posteriorly), and wide in the front (anteriorly). The oral sucker is small but powerful and is located at the end of a cone-shape projection at the anterior end. The acetabulum is a larger sucker than the oral sucker and is located at the anterior end. A simple diagram to show the difference between the teguments of free-living and parasitic flatworms: a. shows the syncytial epithelial tegument found in parasitic flatworms, such as F. hepatica. b. shows the multicellular, nonsyncytial, epithelia, found in nonparasitic, free- living flatworms. Tegument The outer surface of the fluke is called the tegument. This is composed of scleroprotein, and its primary function is to protect the fluke from the destructive digestive system of the host. Its also used for renewal of the surface plasma membrane and the active uptake of nutrients, and the uptake of some compounds (e.g. taurine) make flukes even more resistant to be killed by the digestive system of host. On the surface of the tegument are also small spines. Initially, these spines are single- pointed, then, just prior to the fluke entering the bile ducts, they become multipointed. At the anterior end of the fluke, the spines have between 10 and 15 points, whereas at the posterior end, they have up to 30 points. The tegument is a syncytial epithelium. This means it is made from the fusion of many cells, each containing one nucleus, to produce a multinucleated cell membrane. In the case of F. hepatica, no nuclei are in the outer cytoplasm between the basal and apical membranes. Thus, this region is referred to as anucleate. Instead, the nuclei are found in the cell bodies, also known as tegumental cells, these connect to the outer cytoplasm via thin cytoplasmic strands. The tegumental cells contain the usual cytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria, Golgi bodies, and endoplasmic reticulum). The tegument plays a key role in the fluke's infection of the host. Studies have shown that certain parts of the tegument (in this case, the antigen named Teg) can actually suppress the immune response of the mammalian host. This means that the fluke is able to weaken the immune response, and increase its chances of a successful infection. A successful infection is needed for the fluke to have enough time to develop into an adult and continue its lifecycle. Digestive system Image showing the location of the mouth, labelled mo, and the anterior sucker, as labelled sckr The alimentary canal of F. hepatica has a single mouth which leads into the blind gut; it has no anus. The mouth is located within the anterior sucker on the ventral side of the fluke. This mouth leads to the pharynx, which is then followed by a narrow oesophagus. The oesophagus, which is lined with a thin layer of epithelial cells, then opens up into the large intestine. As no anus is present, the intestine branches, with each branch ending blindly near the posterior end of the body. Flukes migrate into smaller capillaries and bile ducts when feeding within the host. They use their mouth suckers to pull off and suck up food, bile, lymph, and tissue pieces from the walls of the bile ducts. F. hepatica relies on extracellular digestion which occurs within the intestine of the host. The waste materials are egested through the mouth. The nonwaste matter is adsorbed back in through the tegument and the general surface of the fluke. The tegument facilitates this adsorption by containing many small folds to increase the surface area. Respiratory system Diagram of the main organ systems of F. hepatica throughout the progressive life stages of the fluke (1938). A - egg; B - miracidium; C - sporocyst; D - rediae, E - immature cercaria, F - cercaria, G - encysted stage, H - adult fluke (nervous and reproductive systems omitted) F. hepatica has no respiratory organs: the adult flukes respire anaerobically (without oxygen). Glycogen taken from within the host is broken down by glycolysis to produce carbon dioxide and fatty acids. This process provides the fluke with energy. In contrast, the free-living miracidia stages of the parasite generally develop within oxygen-rich environments. The free-living stages of the parasite are thought to respire aerobically, to gain the most energy from their environment. Excretory system F. hepatica's excretory system contains a network of tubules surrounding one main excretory canal. This canal leads to the excretory pore at the posterior end of the fluke. This main canal branches into four sections within the dorsal and ventral regions of the body. The role of F. hepatica's excretory system is excretion and osmoregulation. Each tubule within the excretory system is connected to a flame cell, otherwise known as protonephridia. These cells are modified parenchyme cells. In F. hepatica, their role is to perform excretion, but more importantly, osmoregulatory functions. Flame cells are therefore primarily used to remove excess water. Nervous system and sensory organs The nerve system of F. hepatica consists of a pair of nerve ganglia, each one is located on either side of the oesophagus. Around the oesophagus is a nerve ring, which connects the two nerve ganglia together. The nerves stem from this ring, reaching the posterior end of the body. At the posterior end, one pair of nerves becomes thicker than the others; these are known as the lateral nerve cords. From these lateral nerve cords, the other nerves branch. Sensory organs are absent from F. hepatica. Reproductive system F. hepatica adult flukes are hermaphrodite; each contains both male and female reproductive organs. The male and female reproductive organs open up into the same chamber within the body, which is called the genital atrium. The genital atrium is an ectodermal sac which opens up to the outside of the fluke via a genital pore. The testes are formed of two branched tubules, these are located in the middle and posterior regions of the body. From the epithelium lining of the tubules, sperm is produced. The sperm then passes into the vas deferens and then into the seminal vesicle. From the seminal vesicle projects the ejaculatory duct, and this opens into the genital atrium, and many prostate glands surround this opening. The right side of the anterior testis has a branched, tubular ovary. From here, a short oviduct passes to the vitelline duct. This duct connects, via a junction, the ovaries, the uterus, and the yolk reservoir. From this junction, the uterus opens into the genital atrium; this opening is surrounded by Mehlis glands. In some flukes, the terminal end of the uterus is strengthened with muscles and spines. F. hepatica reproduces both sexually, via the hermaphrodite adult flukes, and asexually. The miracidia can reproduce asexually within the intermediate snail host. Genome With its draft genome sequence published in 2015, F. hepatica is known to have the largest nuclear genome size among trematodes so far sequenced. It is about 1.3 Gb, which is two times that of Opisthorchis viverrini with 634.5 Mb, the second largest genome among trematodes. The genome is contained in 10 pairs of chromosomes. The protein-coding sequence covers about 21.8 Mb and repetitive DNA sequence about 32% of the total genome. The number of genes predicted is 14,642. The mitochondrial genome consists of 14462 bp, containing 12 protein- encoding, 2 ribosomal and 22 transfer RNA genes. Prevalence Fasciola hepatica prevalence. The countries in red are those with high prevalence, those in orange have low-medium prevalence. Currently, F. hepatica has one of the widest geographical spread of any parasitic and vector-borne disease. Originating in Europe, it has expanded to colonize over 50 countries, covering all continents except Antarctica. In contrast, F. gigantica is generally considered more geographically restricted to the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with some overlap between the two species. Climate affects both F. hepatica and its intermediate host, the snail. For example, the development of F. hepatica miracidia and larvae, and the reproduction of Galba truncatula, require a temperature range of 10 to 25 ¬∞C. In addition, they both require high levels of moisture in the air, as both are at risk of desiccation. Due to this, the prevalence, along with the intensity of infection, of F. hepatica is primarily dependent on rainfall levels and temperature. Parasitic adaptations The left image shows the free-swimming cercariae, the flagella is clearly visible. The right side of the diagram shows the cysts attached to grass. F. hepatica's tegument protects it from the enzymes of the host's digestive system, whilst still allowing water to pass through. Free-swimming larvae have cilia and the cercariae have a flagellum- like tail to help them swim through the aquatic environment and also allow them to reach the plants on which they form a cyst. To attach within the host, F. hepatica has oral suckers and body spines. Their pharynges also help them to suck onto the tissues within the body, particularly within the bile ducts. The adult fluke's respiration is anaerobic; this is ideal, as no oxygen is available in the liver. F. hepatica is adapted to produce a large number of eggs, which increases its chances of survival, as many eggs are destroyed on release into the environment. Also, F. hepatica is hermaphrodite, thus all flukes can produce eggs, increasing the number of offspring produced by the population. The genome for F. hepatica was published in 2015.https://web.archive.org/web/20160322185558/http://parasite.wormbase.org/Fasciola_hepatica_prjeb6687/Info/Index At 1.3 Gb, its genome is one of the largest known pathogen genomes. The genome contains many polymorphisms, and this represents the potential for the fluke to evolve and rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, such as host availability and drug or vaccine interventions.  Epidemiology  For more information on the epidemiology ‚Äì see the disease page, fasciolosis Infection begins when cyst-covered aquatic vegetation is eaten or when water containing metacercariae is drunk. In the United Kingdom, F. hepatica frequently causes disease in ruminants, most commonly between March and December. Humans become infected by eating watercress or by drinking 'Emoliente', a Peruvian drink that uses drops of watercress juice. Cattle and sheep are infected when they consume the infectious stage of the parasite from low-lying, marshy pasture. Human infections have been reported from more than 75 countries around the world. In Asia and Africa, people are infected both by F. hepatica and F. gigantica whereas human fasciolosis is caused only by F. hepatica in South and Central America and Europe. The presence of F. hepatica can interfere with the detection of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Cattle co-infected with F. hepatica, compared to those infected with M. bovis alone, react weakly to the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test.Skin Test. Animal and Plant Health Agency, UK Therefore, an infection from F. hepatica can make it difficult to detect bovine tuberculosis; this is, of course, a major problem in the farming industry.  Fasciolosis  Slide showing Fasciola hepatica's internal organs Both F. hepatica and F. gigantica can cause fasciolosis. Human symptoms vary depending on whether the disease is chronic or acute. During the acute phase, the immature worms begin penetrating the gut, causing symptoms of fever, nausea, swollen liver, skin rashes, and extreme abdominal pain. The chronic phase occurs when the worms mature in the bile duct, and can cause symptoms of intermittent pain, jaundice, and anemia. In cattle and sheep, classic signs of fasciolosis include persistent diarrhea, chronic weight loss, anemia, and reduced milk production. Some remain asymptomatic. F. hepatica can cause sudden death in both sheep and cattle, due to internal hemorrhaging and liver damage. Fasciolosis is an important cause of both production and economic losses in the dairy and meat industries. Over the years, the prevalence has increased and it is likely to continue increasing in the future. Livestock are often treated with flukicides, chemicals toxic to flukes, including bromofenofos, triclabendazole, and bithionol. Ivermectin, which is widely used for many helminthic parasites, has low effectivity against F. hepatica, as does praziquantel. For humans, the type of control depends on the setting. One important method is through the strict control over the growth and sales of edible water plants such as watercress. This is particularly important in highly endemic areas. Some farms are irrigated with polluted water, hence, vegetables farmed from such land should be thoroughly washed and cooked before being eaten. The best way to prevent fasciolosis is by reducing the lymnaeid snail population or separating livestock from areas with these snails. These two methods are not always the most practical, so control by treating the herd before they are potentially infected is commonly practiced. Diagnosis F. hepatica egg in stool sample. A diagnosis may be made by finding yellow-brown eggs in the stool. They are indistinguishable from the eggs of Fascioloides magna, although the eggs of F. magna are very rarely passed in sheep, goats, or cattle. If a patient has eaten infected liver, and the eggs pass through the body and out via the faeces, a false positive result to the test can occur. Daily examination during a liver-free diet will unmask this false diagnosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is the diagnostic test of choice. ELISA is available commercially and can detect antihepatica antibodies in serum and milk; new tests intended for use on faecal samples are being developed. Using ELISA is more specific than using a Western blot or Arc2 immunodiffusion. Proteases secreted by F. hepatica have been used experimentally in immunizing antigens.

The festival is permanently housed in the Carolyn Blount Theatre in Montgomery, Alabama. ASF puts on 6-9 productions annually, typically including three works of William Shakespeare. Other plays sample various genres and playwrights, classical and modern, sometimes with an emphasis on Southern works. ASF's Southern Writers Project nurtures the creation of new plays that reflect Southern themes. The festival stages more than 400 performances each year that attract more than 300,000 visitors from throughout the United States and more than 60 countries. History The ASF began in 1972 as a summer-stock theater project in Anniston. Its first performance was in the Anniston High School auditorium, before a single critic and his wife; the critic considered the performance very poor and predicted that the ASF would not survive. But the project persisted, with a number of innovative performances - including Taming of the Shrew set in 1950's New York City. Eventually, the Shakespeare Festival grew to garner critical acclaim, but lacked the financial support to keep it afloat. In December 1985, the ASF moved to Montgomery, as the result of Mr. and Mrs. Winton Blount's $21.5-million gift of a performing-arts complex set in a 250-acre (1-km¬≤) landscaped park, the Winton M.

There are now about sixty ParknShop stores in northern and southern China, including locations in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan and Zhuhai. History=Labour outsourcing In April 2005, the ParknShop chain, including the rebranded Taste superstore in Festival Walk, controversially dismissed 525 employees, when the company outsourced the labour for its fresh foods counter; most of the employees were dismissed just before the Chinese New Year in 2006. The aggrieved employees included many low-paid workers of longtime service. The employees' union complained that although 90% of the dismissed workers were rehired at the same position as before, their wages were lowered (some reportedly by as much as 44%), and their working hours were increased from 10 to 12 hours by the outsourcing subcontractor. The resulting average hourly rate was HK$18. Proposed sale by Hutchison In 2013, Hutchison invited bids for the entire ParknShop chain, during \\"a strategic review\\" of the ParknShop business, for an expected price of US$3 billion to US$4 billion.

He discovered the existence of two types of electricity and named them \\"vitreous\\" and \\"resinous\\" (later known as positive and negative charge respectively). He noted the difference between conductors and insulators, calling them 'electrics' and 'non-electrics' for their ability to produce contact electrification. He also discovered that alike-charged objects would repel each other and that unlike- charged objects attract. He also disproved certain misconceptions regarding electric charge, such as that of Dr. Stephen Gray who believed that electric properties of a body depended on its colour. Du Fay's observations on electricity were reported in a paper written in December 1733 and printed in Volume 38 of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1734.

Bramalea was created as an innovative \\"new town\\", and developed as a separate community from the city. Located in the former Chinguacousy Township, it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, Bramalea Consolidated Developments (later Bramalea Limited), formerly known as Brampton Leasing. The name \\"Bramalea\\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who integrated the BRAM from Brampton, MAL from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now a part of Mississauga), and the LEA, an old British word meaning meadow or grassland. He sold the land to Brampton Leasing developers and built one of Bramalea's first houses on the intersection of Bramalea Road and Avondale Boulevard. Mr. Sheard owned a large parcel of cattle grazing land that was purchased by the new venture. The community had an extensive Master Plan, which included provisions for a parkland trail system of \\"green belts\\" that followed small rivulets that feed the Etobicoke Creek and a \\"downtown\\", which would include essential services and a shopping centre. The downtown area's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, which included the township's council chamber, a library, live stage theatre, fire dispatch control centre, post office, and the fledgling Rogers Cable community production centre. This building was funded and built by Bramalea's agreement to maintain a particular balance of residential/industrial taxation base. In default, and in lieu of cash payment, Bramalea offered the Civic Centre as recompense. The township accepted. Shortly thereafter, the Township of Chinguacousy was merged along with the township of Toronto Gore with the Town of Brampton, to become the City of Brampton. Directly across Team Canada Drive from the Civic Centre, Bramalea Limited had built a shopping centre starting in the late 1960s named Bramalea City Centre. The two centrepieces were connected by a short underground passageway under Team Canada Drive, which has long since been sealed due to hooligan activities. Other features included a police station, which was built before the other structures, (closed in 2008 in order to move into the new Peel Region offices), a bus terminal which was built as a \\"dial- a-bus\\" hub, a Holiday Inn (closed and being converted into a senior's residence), and a collection of seniors' retirement homes. Chinguacousy Park was created nearby, to the northeast of Bramalea Road and Queen Street. A ski hill was built up using fill excavated from residential basements. Each phase of the new city was built with progressing first letters of street names. Development started with the \\"A\\" section, with street names like Alderbury, Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Then a \\"B\\" section was created, \\"C\\" section, and so forth. Eventually development reached the M-, N- and P-sections south of Bovaird Drive. Most incorporated local schools, greenspace and pathways. The Zero Lot Line housing concept was pioneered in the G- and H-sections (\\"The Villages of Central Park\\"), in an affordable housing joint venture between developers and the Ontario Government called the Home Ownership Made Easy (\\"HOME\\") project. Bramalea is the location of the Brampton Assembly automobile factory, which is now owned by Chrysler but was developed by American Motors for the manufacture of its large Eagle Premier sedan (a joint venture with Renault). The district is served by the Bramalea GO Station on GO Transit that was located at on Steeles Avenue west of Bramalea Road.

This was the first known balanced binary search tree data structure.. Beginning in 1963, Adelson-Velsky headed the development of a computer chess program at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. His innovations included the first use of bitboards (a now-common method for representing game positions) in computer chess.. The program defeated Kotok- McCarthy in the first chess match between computer programs, also in 1966, and it evolved into Kaissa, the first world computer chess champion.. On page 50, G. M. Adelson-Velskii is listed as one of Kaissa's authors. In August 1992, Adelson-Velsky moved to Israel, and he resided in Ashdod.

It is one of the Northern European short-tailed sheep breeds. It remains physically similar to the wild ancestors of domestic sheep, the Mediterranean mouflon and the horned urial sheep of Central Asia.Ryder, M L, (1981), \\"A survey of European primitive breeds of sheep\\", Ann. G√©n√©t. S√©l. Anim., 13 (4), pp 381‚Äì418. It is much smaller than modern domesticated sheep but hardier, and is extraordinarily agile, tending to take refuge amongst the cliffs when frightened. Soays may be solid black or brown, or more often blonde or dark brown with buffish-white underbelly and rump (known as lachdann in Scottish Gaelic, which is cognate to the Manx loaghtan); a few have white markings on the face.St Kilda Summer, by Kenneth Williamson and J Morton Boyd, Hutchinson and co. Ltd 1960 In the early twentieth century, some Soay sheep were relocated to establish exotic flocks, such as the flock of \\"Park Soay\\" at Woburn Abbey, established by the Duke of Bedford in 1910, and selected for \\"primitive\\" characteristics. A number of Soay sheep were translocated from Soay to another of the St Kilda group, the island of Hirta by the Marquess of Bute in the 1930s, after the human population and their sheep were evacuated. The name of the island is from Old Norse Sey√∞oy, meaning \\"Island of Sheep\\". The breed was introduced to and live wild on Holy Isle off Arran. Soay sheep were introduced from St. Kilda to Lundy, an island in the Bristol Channel, by Martin Coles Harman soon after he purchased the island in 1925. There is also a small population living wild in and around the Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. The Soays are particularly hardy and have been allowed to become largely feral. The breed is listed in \\"Category 4: At Risk\\" by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, because there are only between 900 and 1500 registered breeding Soay ewes. The Soay is distinct from two other short-tailed breeds also associated with St. Kilda: the Boreray (from Boreray, another of the islands, and formerly also living on Hirta), and the \\"St. Kilda\\", a former name for the Hebridean sheep (which is probably not from St. Kilda at all). Scientific study Soay sheep of varied colours Urban grazing and ecopastoralism on a Historical Monument, provided by Soay sheep who practices restorative and differentiated management of the vegetation covering the fortifications. This small sheep, light and rustic, very comfortable on the slopes ideally replaces the mechanical machines, while playing a role of and ecological corridor traveling 'by carrying seed s and propagule s in its coat, its digestive tract and under its hooves. The Hirta population is unmanaged and has been the subject of scientific study since the 1950s. The population makes an ideal model subject for scientists researching evolution, population dynamics and demography because the population is unmanaged, is closed (no emigration or immigration) and has no significant competitors or predators. The sheep exhibit a phenomenon known as overcompensatory density dependence, in which their population never reaches equilibrium. The population growth is so great as to exceed the carrying capacity of the island, which eventually causes a dramatic population crash, and then the cycle repeats. For example, in 1989, the population fell by two thirds within 12 weeks. The age and sex structure of the population are important in determining when a crash happens; for instance, adult males enter winter in a poor condition after the autumn rut, whereas females have been grazing all summer and so enter winter in a good condition. Survival rates of males (and lambs) are influenced by weather throughout winter (dependent on the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation), whereas survival rates of females (and adolescents) are influenced most strongly by rainfall at the end of winter, when they will normally be heavily pregnant (the rain soaks the wool, increasing energy expenditure). Another factor in mortality rates is the loading of intestinal nematode parasites, particularly damaging in malnourished hosts. The breed was used in experimental archaeology at Butser Ancient Farm because it closely resembles British prehistoric breeds. The breed is becoming smaller because of the change in climate. Breed characteristics A Soay lamb The sheep have short tails and naturally shed their wool, which can be hand plucked (called rooing) in the spring and early summer. About one kilogram of wool can be obtained from each animal per year. Ewes are polled, scurred or horned and rams are either horned or scurred. They are most commonly brown or tan with a white belly, white rump patch and/or white patch under the chin (referred to as the Mouflon or wild pattern). Occasionally white markings on the face and/or body and legs occur. Rarely self-colored (solid color with no markings) black or tan individuals are seen. This breed has extremely fine fleece and, in contrast to mouflon, the inner fleece is highly developed and it is difficult to distinguish an outer coat. This is a clear indication that the Soay are indeed the product of a domesticated breed in prehistoric times. The breed also lacks the flocking instinct of many breeds. Attempts to work them using sheep dogs result in a scattering of the group. The lambs are late maturing and produce smaller carcasses relative to commercial breeds. The meat from the Soay is lean, tender and low in cholesterol. It has a stronger flavour with a gamey taste when compared to more common sheep breeds. Crossing with larger breeds, such as the Suffolk or Mule, can produce larger carcasses which will be lean and still retain much of the flavour. The Soay is very similar to another feral type from the island of L√≠tla D√≠mun in the Faroe Islands, which became extinct in the mid-nineteenth century, partially due to overhunting.

In the book, Lamarck named two supposed laws that would enable animal species to acquire characteristics under the influence of the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths. Lamarck was largely ignored by the major French zoologist Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Charles Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection. Context Lamarck by Charles Th√©venin (c. 1802) Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744‚Äì1829) was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a professor of botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the new Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, Lamarckism, and in particular his view that the environment (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vert√®bres, (1815‚Äì1822). Book Lamarck used the blind mole rat (Spalax) as an example of the loss of function through disuse. The animal's tiny eyes are completely covered by a layer of skin. In the Philosophie zoologique, Lamarck proposed that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would cause them to grow or shrink in the course of several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments. He gave names to a number of vestigial structures in the book, among them \\"Olivier's Spalax, which lives underground like the mole, and is apparently exposed to daylight even less than the mole, has altogether lost the use of sight: so that it shows nothing more than vestiges of this organ.\\" Lamarck described speciation as follows:Packard, Alphaeus Spring (1901). Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution. Longmans, Green. p. 240. > as new modifications will necessarily continue to operate, however slowly, > not only will there continually be found new species, new genera, and new > orders, but each species will vary in some part of its structure and form > ... individuals which from special causes are transported into very > different situations from those where the others occur, and then constantly > submitted to other influences ‚Äì the former, I say, assume new forms, and > then they constitute a new species. He argued that gaps between differing kinds of animals resulted from the extinction of intermediate forms, in: > a branching series, irregularly graduated which has no discontinuity in its > parts, or which, at least, if its true that there are some because of lost > species, has not always had such. It follows that the species that terminate > each branch of the general series are related, at least on one side, to the > other neighboring species that shade into them.\\"Outlines of evolutionary > biology\\", by Arthur Dendy and Maurice Burton on page 387 Lamarck proposed the transmutation of species (\\"transformisme\\"), but did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.

The historian of science Richard Burkhardt argues that this was because Lamarck was convinced his views would be poorly received, and made little effort to present his theory persuasively. In the French-speaking world in his lifetime, Lamarck and his theories were rejected by the major zoologists of the day, including Cuvier. However, he made more of an impact outside France and after his death, where leading scientists such as Ernst Haeckel, Charles Lyell and Darwin himself recognised him as a major zoologist, with theories that presaged Darwinian evolution. In 1830‚Äì1833, Charles Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, carefully summarised Lamarck's theory (in about 6 pages, with cross-references to the Philosophie zoologique) and then roundly criticised it. Lyell begins by noting that Lamarck gives no examples at all of the development of any entirely new function (\\"the substitution of some entirely new sense, faculty, or organ\\") but only proves that the \\"dimensions and strength\\" of some parts can be increased or decreased. Lyell says that with this \\"disregard to the strict rules of induction\\" Lamarck \\"resorts to fictions\\". Lyell goes on, assuming for the sake of argument that Lamarck was right about the creation of new organs, that Lamarck's theory would mean that instead of the nature and form of an animal giving rise to its behaviour, its behaviour would determine (Public Domain) Lyell similarly criticises the way Lamarck supposed the antelope and gazelle acquired \\"light agile forms\\" able to run swiftly; or the \\"camelopard\\" (giraffe) became \\"gifted with a long flexible neck\\". Lamarckism was popularised in the English-speaking world by the speculative Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844. In 1887 Thomas Henry Huxley, the comparative anatomist known as \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" for his energetic advocacy of Darwinian evolution, wrote that  Versions  * Lamarck: Contents * 1809, vol.

Little damage was done to either side. By the end of April 1861, USS Cumberland and a small number of supporting ships were enforcing the Union blockade of the southeastern Virginia ports at the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay and had captured several ships which attempted to pass the blockade. USS Monticello's bombardment of the Sewell's Point battery was one of the earliest Union Navy actions against Confederate forces during the Civil War. While it has been suggested by some sources that the Monticello's action may have been the first gunfire by the Union Navy during the Civil War, a brief exchange of cannon fire between the U.S. gunboat USS Yankee and shore batteries manned by Virginia volunteer forces which had not yet been incorporated into the Confederate States Army at Gloucester Point, Virginia on the York River occurred on May 7, 1861.Although sources differ on the date of the Gloucester Point engagement, the reports of the commanders clearly state the date as May 7, 1861.Rush, Lt.

Background Although providing for a vote on May 23, 1861, the Virginia state convention voted for and effectively accomplished the secession of that state from the Union on April 17, 1861, which was three days after the surrender of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces and two days after President Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers to reclaim federal property and to suppress the rebellion. During the night of April 20, 1861, the Commander of the U. S. Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk County, Virginia (now the Norfolk Naval Yard in the City of Portsmouth, Virginia) Charles S. McCauley, fearing he could not hold the yard against the rebels and although without instructions from authorities in Washington, D.C., ordered the evacuation and burning of the yard and any ships that could not be sailed away, including the . This ended the presence of Union land forces in the Norfolk area of south Hampton Roads for over one year. On April 27, 1861, President Lincoln ordered the Union blockade of the Confederacy extended to the coasts of Virginia and North Carolina, which were already in the process of joining the Confederate States of America although they did not officially do so until May 1861. Virginia Militia Major General and, effective May 1, 1861, Virginia Provisional ArmyAlthough this army was organized as a state establishment that was something more than a militia and which would become part of the Confederate Army, it was not the Provisional Army of the Confederacy and did not become part of it until after the May 23, 1861 Virginia secession vote. Gwynn never held a rank above colonel in the PACS. Brigadier General Walter Gwynn, a former U.S. Army engineering officer and former railroad engineer and surveyor, sited and supervised the construction of batteries to defend Norfolk, Virginia in late April and early May 1861, including the battery at Sewell's Point. Gwynn commanded the defense of Norfolk until he was relieved by regular Confederate forces on May 23, 1861. Battle Map of Sewell's Point Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. As part of the Union blockade of Chesapeake Bay during the American Civil War, the Union gunboat USS Monticello, commanded by Captain Henry Eagle with Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Daniel L. Braine second in command, exchanged cannon fire with Confederate batteries on Sewell's Point, Virginia,Some early sources spell the name of this location as Seawell's Point. in Norfolk County, Virginia (present day City of Norfolk, Virginia), in an attempt to enforce the blockade of the Hampton Roads area in southeastern Virginia. The two sides did each other little harm. On May 18, 1861, the Monticello fired on the unfinished Confederate battery at Sewell's Point, which commanded the entrance to the Elizabeth River and the harbor at Norfolk, Virginia but which had no guns yet in place, with little effect. By 5:00 p.m. on May 19, 1861, the Confederates had installed three 32-pound guns at the Sewell's Point battery. When the Monticello began to fire on the works at about 5:30 p.m., the battery returned fire, which drove off the Monticello. Captain Peyton H. Colquitt of the Columbus Light Guard from GeorgiaCaptain Colquitt should not be confused with Brigadier General Alfred Holt Colquitt, who also was from Georgia. commanded the battery. Captain Colquitt raised a Georgia state flag at the battery since he did not have a Confederate flag. On May 21, 1861, the Monticello fired two shots at the battery but again drew off when the battery returned fire. Aftermath After the battle, the USS Thomas Freeborn joined the Federal Potomac Flotilla. Under the command of Commander James H. Ward, the Thomas Freeborn attacked the Confederate batteries at the confluence of the Potomac River and Aquia Creek in the Battle of Aquia Creek on May 29 and 30 and June 1, 1861, to little effect. The Sewell's Point battery and other batteries in the area engaged Union vessels on other occasions over the next 12 months, including engagements of Union vessels or supporting fire against them during the clash of the ironclads (the Union's USS Monitor and the Confederacy's CSS Virginia, formerly USS Merrimack) during the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862. Union Navy gunboats, including the Monitor, shelled the Sewell's Point batteries and other targets in the area again on May 8, 1862. Because of the threat of invasion by the large Union Army force at Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads from the threatened cities of Norfolk, Virginia and Portsmouth, Virginia and the County of Norfolk, Virginia, although many of the Union soldiers were then engaged in the Peninsula Campaign, the Confederates evacuated the Norfolk area on May 9, 1862 and the early morning of May 10, 1862. Federal troops occupied Norfolk and Portsmouth on May 10, 1862. When they arrived at Norfolk and Portsmouth, the Federal troops found that the Confederates had abandoned the batteries at Sewell's Point and other fortified positions in the vicinity. No sign of the Sewell's Point battery exists today. The location is within the U.S. Navy's Norfolk Naval Base. NotesFootnotesReferences  Rush, Lt. Commander Richard and Robert H. Woods.

The community is entirely located in Maricopa County, Arizona, within the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 Census, Anthem's population was 21,700. The 2014 estimate was around 30,000 people. History Anthem was developed by Del Webb in 1999 as a master-planned community in the foothills approximately 34 miles north of downtown Phoenix. Anthem has been described as one of the best places to raise a family by Parenting magazine and one of the best family friendly neighborhoods in the Phoenix area by Phoenix Magazine. Anthem is well known for the year-round activities, primarily geared towards families. The community center offers youth soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, various forms of martial arts, and swimming amongst other activities for ages as early as toddler years. Homeowner's association dues cover a pool larger than Olympic size, a community water park with slides and various depths for all swimming levels, paths that crisscross the town, bike paths that circle all major streets, and pocket parks scattered throughout the town. In addition, there is a 63-acre community park complete with an amphitheater, many grassy areas, volleyball, soccer, football, baseball and little league fields along with a train, pavilion, lakes and pagodas. On July 31, 2012, a storm dropped 5.01 inches of rain on Anthem in the span of 90 minutes, causing widespread flooding that damaged homes and required the rescue of nine people. A subsequent investigation into the flood concluded that the storm was a \\"one- in-1,000 year rain catastrophe.\\" Geography Anthem is built on at the base of Daisy Mountain and Gavilan Peak.

(\\"Come Wander with Me\\", however, was the final episode to be filmed.) It originally aired on June 19, 1964 on CBS. Opening narration Right before the end of the introduction, as in a typical episode, Rod Serling appears on-screen and says: After the opening credits are finished rolling, Serling, in voice-over, says: Plot Sport Sharewood (Mary Badham) and her younger brother Jeb (Jeffrey Byron) live in a large, expensive house, but their parents are cold, ill- tempered, self-centered, and constantly bickering with each other. While Sport and Jeb are sitting beside their swimming pool, Whitt (Kim Hector), a young boy in a straw hat, pops up from the deep end of the pool and invites them to follow him. The children dive underwater only to come back up in a swimming hole bordering a rustic, simple homestead. An assortment of children are playing in the yard. In contrast to their lavish home of neglect and insults, they are welcomed and loved from the moment they arrive at this humble children's paradise. There is only one adult there, \\"Aunt T.\\" (Georgia Simmons), a kind and patient elderly woman who loves children. She explains that she has many children there who came from parents who did not deserve them. Sport and Jeb go home, for fear that their parents will be worried. \\"Aunt T.\\" advises them that they likely will not be able return as few children can find their way back. But Jeb later returns to Aunt T's, and Sport is sent by her mother to go and find him because she has something to tell them about some decisions that are made that will make all their lives better. Sport finds Jeb at Aunt T's but he refuses to go back. Sport convinces him by telling him that their mother has promised everything will be better; he reluctantly agrees to return with her. Back home their parents inform them they are planning to divorce and they must decide which parent they will live with. The children refuse and dive back into the pool, and are able to escape. When they do not reemerge, their father jumps in to rescue them, but discovers they have disappeared. Sport and Jeb are now happily living with Aunt T. Sport hears the distant and remorseful voice of her mother, but ignores it and focuses on her new life. Closing narrationCast * Mary Badham as Sport Sharewood * June Foray as dubbed voice of Sport Sharewood, in outdoor scenes only * Jeffrey Byron (as Tim Stafford) as Jeb Sharewood * Kim Hector as Whitt * Georgia Simmons as Aunt T * Dee Hartford as Mrs. Gloria Sharewood * Tod Andrews as Mr. Gil Sharewood Episode notes This was the final episode of the original Twilight Zone series to be broadcast, though not the last to be filmed. The last episode filmed was \\"Come Wander with Me\\", while, according to Marc Scott Zicree's \\"The Twilight Zone Companion\\", the reediting of An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (including the addition of new footage of Serling) was the last episode \\"produced\\" before cancellation. The last episode broadcast during the original run ‚Äì as a repeat ‚Äì was \\"The Jeopardy Room\\". Numerous production problems delayed the premiere of this episode, which was originally scheduled for March 20, 1964. Most noticeably, back-lot noise rendered much of the outdoor dialogue unusable ‚Äì only the indoor scenes with Aunt T were considered audible. The entire cast (except Aunt T) consequently re-dubbed their outdoor dialogue in September 1963, but Mary Badham's voice was still deemed not right. Unfortunately, by the time this decision had been made, Badham had returned to her home in Alabama, and the cost of flying her back to Los Angeles to re-record her lines yet again was ruled to be too expensive. Eventually, voice actress June Foray, best known as the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel in the Bullwinkle cartoons, dubbed Sport Sharewood's lines for all the scenes that take place outdoors. In the finished episode, the change in Sport's voice is noticeable when she moves indoors, and Badham's own deeper voice and more authentic accent are heard in place of Foray's overdubbed voice characterization. Another production peculiarity is that \\"The Bewitchin' Pool'\\" is the only episode of The Twilight Zone to open with a teaser scene that is repeated in its entirety later in the episode. This opening teaser scene (which is well over two minutes in length) was not included in Earl Hamner's original episode script; it appears to have been included to lengthen the episode after some other footage was dropped. Note that actor Harold Gould is listed in some sources as a cast member for this episode, but does not appear in any capacity in the finished production. (In one account, Gould is given credit for having played a radio announcer, but there is no radio announcer in the actual completed episode.) Other re-used footage in the episode includes an identical 10-second shot of Sport and Jeb swimming up to the foot of a tree on two occasions; Sport and Jeb's mother twice telling them in the space of a minute \\"Darn you loudmouth kids\\" ‚Äì using exactly the same footage of her dialogue, as well as of the kids' reaction; and the first and final shots of various children playing in front of Aunt T's house. Earl Hamner, Jr., got the idea for \\"The Bewitchin' Pool\\" while living in the San Fernando Valley region of California and witnessing an alarming divorce rate and the effect it had on children. The episode was one of the first shows on television to really address the problem of divorce and bad parenting, and in part it represents wish fulfillment or escapism for children in such situations.

He is best known as the inventor of the Maksutov telescope. Biography Dmitry Dmitriyevich Maksutov was born in 1896 in either Nikolayev or the port city of Odessa, Russian Empire. His father, was a naval officer serving with the Black Sea Fleet, who came from a family with a long and distinguished naval tradition. His great-grandfather, Peter Ivanovich Maksutov, was given the title of prince, thereby raising the family to hereditary nobility as a reward for bravery in combat. His grandfather, Dmitri Petrovich Maksutov, was the last Russian governor of Russian Alaska, before it was purchased by the United States in 1867. Dmitri became interested in astronomy in early childhood, and constructed his first telescope (a 7.2 inch / 180 mm reflector) when he was twelve years old. Later he read publications by the Russian optician Alexander Andreevich Chikin (1865‚Äì1924), who became his teacher. He constructed a much better 10 inch (210 mm) reflector and began serious astronomical observation. At 15 years of age he had already been accepted as a member of the Russian Astronomical Society. Three years later he graduated from the Military Nikolayev Engineering Institute in what was then Petrograd (a.k.a. Saint Petersburg, Russia), now the Saint Petersburg Military Engineering-Technical University. Between 1921 and 1930 he worked at the Physics Institute of the University of Odessa in the field of astronomical optics. In 1930 Maksutov established the Laboratory of Astronomical Optics at the State Optical Institute of Leningrad and led it until 1952. This laboratory was one of the leading astronomical research groups in the USSR. While there he published –ê–Ω–∞–±–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞—é—â–∏–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –∏ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–µ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±—ã –∏—Ö –∏—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è [Aberration-free reflective surfaces and systems and new methods of testing them] (1932), in which he analyzed aplanatic double mirror systems and introduced the compensating method, which he proposed as early as 1924. This became the main control method of mirror study along with the shadow method. In 1944 he became a professor as a result of his paper, and from 1946 a Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. From 1952 he worked in Pulkovo Observatory. Maksutov died in what was then Leningrad (a.k.a. Saint Petersburg) in 1964. Inventions Cassegrain version of the Maksutov telescope Maksutov's most well known contribution in the field of optics was made in 1941, when he invented the Maksutov telescope. Like the Schmidt telescope, the Maksutov corrects for spherical aberration by placing a corrector lens in front of the primary mirror. However, where the Schmidt uses an aspheric corrector at the entrance pupil, Maksutov's telescope uses a deeply curved full diameter negative meniscus lens (a \\"meniscus corrector shell\\"). He published the design in 1944 in a paper entitled \\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –∫–∞—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–ø—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–µ–Ω–∏—Å–∫–æ–≤—ã–µ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã\\" [New catadioptric meniscus systems].Dmitri Maksutov: The Man and His Telescopes by Eduard Trigubov and Yuri Petrunin. This method was adopted not only by his own laboratory for many of the most important observatories in the Soviet Union, but also internationally. Several commercial telescope-making companies produce Maksutovs, including Celestron, Meade, and Questar. He created many objective lenses, mirrors, and prisms of various sizes and purposes. He also created a photo-gastrograph (used for photographing the stomach), a needle- microscope, shadow instruments for aerodynamic tubes, telescopic spectacles, and other instruments.

The battle took place from May 29, 1861 to June 1, 1861 during the early days of the American Civil War. The Confederates set up several shore batteries to block Union military and commercial vessels from moving in the Chesapeake Bay and along the lower Potomac River as well as for defensive purposes. The battery at Aquia also was intended to protect the railroad terminal at that location. The Union forces sought to destroy or remove these batteries as part of the effort to blockade Confederate States coastal and Chesapeake Bay ports. The battle was tactically inconclusive. Each side inflicted little damage and no serious casualties on the other. The Union vessels were unable to dislodge the Confederates from their positions or to inflict serious casualties on their garrisons or serious damage to their batteries. The Confederates manning the batteries were unable to inflict serious casualties on the Union sailors or cause serious damage to the Union vessels. Soon after the battle, on Sunday, July 7, 1861, the Confederates first used naval mines, unsuccessfully, off the Aquia Landing batteries. The Confederates ultimately abandoned the batteries on March 9, 1862 as they moved forces to meet the threat created by the Union Army's Peninsula Campaign. The U. S. National Park Service includes this engagement in its list of 384 principal battles of the American Civil War.National Park Service list of principal battles of the American Civil War. Background Although providing for a referendum on May 23, 1861, the Virginia state convention voted for and effectively accomplished the secession of that state from the Union on April 17, 1861, three days after the surrender of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces and two days after President Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers to suppress the rebellion.Hansen, Harry.

Lynch of the Virginia state navy to examine the defensible points on the Potomac River, and to take measures for the establishment of batteries to prevent Union vessels from navigating that river.Scharf, John Thomas.

On April 24, 1861, Major Thomas H. Williamson of the Virginia Army engineers and Lieut. H. H. Lewis of the Virginia Navy examined the ground at Aquia Creek,Some early sources spell the name of this location as Acquia Creek. and selected Split Rock Bluff as the best point for a battery, as the channel there could be commanded from that point by guns of sufficient caliber.Scharf, 1887, p. 95.

On May 8, 1861, Major Williamson began construction on fortifications at the Aquia Creek landing, mainly to protect the terminus of the Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, which had its northern terminus at the landing, from seizure by Union Army forces.Salmon, John S. The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2001. . p. 10. About May 14, 1861, Captain Lynch and Lieutenant Lewis, along with Commander Robert D.

The battery also was a threat to close the navigation of the Potomac River in line with the original mission to site guns to command the river.Scharf, 1887, p. 96. On May 10, 1861, Confederate authorities appointed General Lee to command Confederate troops in Virginia.Long, 1971, p. 73.

The Confederate battery at Aquia Landing was first spotted by the USS Mount Vernon on May 14, 1861, but the Mount Vernon made no attack on the position. Since the first battery at Aquia was at the river level and intended mainly to protect the railroad terminal, the Confederates strengthened defenses at Aquia before May 29, 1861 by the addition of a second battery atop the bluffs to the south of the confluence of the Aquia Creek with the Potomac River as originally selected by the scouting party.

Confederate Captain Lynch reported that the Thomas Freeborn fired 14 shots and only wounded one man in the hand. On the following day, May 30, 1861, the Thomas Freeborn returned with the , a 200 ton vessel with 2 guns, and , which was half the size of the Anacostia, and engaged the Confederate batteries for several hours, again with little effect.Long, 1971, p. 80. The largest guns of the squadron were 32-pounders. On June 1, the Thomas Freeborn, Anacostia, Resolute, and the sloop-of-war bombarded the batteries for almost 5 hours, firing over 500 rounds.Salmon, 2001, p. 11.Long, 1971, p. 81. Captain Lynch reported no deaths or injuries from the second and third days of shelling, only the death of a chicken and a horse.Scharf, 1887, p. 97. Lynch added that his works sustained some damage, houses in the rear were \\"knocked about\\" and the railroad was torn up in three or four places. Lynch said that he returned fire sparingly in order to save ammunition and because he could fire only when the ships came in view and range of his embrasures as the big guns could not be turned.Some newspaper reports and later sources said that the Union vessels had silenced the lower batteries. Scharf says that the batteries were not silenced by Federal gunfire but that Lynch reported firing sparingly as noted in the text above. Nonetheless, during the fight both the Thomas Freeborn and the Pawnee took minor damage from the batteries and required repairs. No Federal sailors were seriously wounded or killed. Aftermath On June 27, 1861, Commander James Harmon Ward became the first United States Navy officer killed during the American Civil War. He was killed while his vessel, the Thomas Freeborn was giving close support to a landing party which was attempting to silence another Confederate battery and to set up a Union battery along the Potomac River at nearby Mathias Point in King George County, Virginia.Scharf, 1887, p. 98. Following the battle of Aquia Creek, the Confederates reinforced their defenses in the area by constructing a third battery on the bluff at Aquia and a fourth across the mouth of Aquia Creek at Brent Point. On July 7, Confederates placed mines off Aquia Creek in the Potomac River, marking the first such use in the war. The mines, which were 80-gallon casks supporting a boiler-iron torpedo and enough gunpowder to blow up a ship the size of the Pawnee were spotted by Pawnee sailors as the devices were floating toward them.Barnes, 1911, p. 98. The mines were later removed from the river by sailors from the Resolute, although one of the mines actually sank into the river. By the end of October 1861, the Confederate batteries effectively closed the Potomac River for a short time until the Union Navy slowly discovered that the batteries could not hit passing vessels, probably due at least in part to poor quality gunpowder. Despite the Union Navy's conclusion about the lack of threat from the Confederate guns, the Navy forbade civilian traffic on the Potomac River while the batteries were in operation in the event the Confederates might score a lucky hit. After Major General George B. McClellan took command of the Union Army on November 1, 1861, President Lincoln repeatedly requested that McClellan oust the Confederates from these positions but McClellan did not move. By the time Lincoln ordered McClellan to take action against the batteries in General War Order No. 3 on March 8, 1862 and McClellan moved against them, the Confederates had abandoned the positions. The Confederates abandoned the batteries in early March 1862 when General Joseph E. Johnston recalled their garrisons in preparation to defend Richmond at the start of the Peninsula Campaign. On March 9, 1862, sailors on the Anacostia and noted unusual fires and explosions at the Confederate batteries at Cockpit Point and Shipping Point and Union forces discovered that the Confederate batteries at Aquia and along the Potomac River had been abandoned.Salmon, 2001, p. 15. The Union Army used the wharves and storage building at Aquia Landing until June 7, 1863 when the army headed north for the Battle of Gettysburg.Salmon, 2001, pp. 11-12.

His athletic efforts resulted in his induction into the Rowing Hall of Fame in 1976. Goddard graduated in 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. Soon after graduation, Goddard enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps as a private for World War II service. He was commissioned by the Air Corps in 1942 and served as an operations and communications officer in England, India, North Africa, and the South Pacific. He was discharged from the Air Corps in 1946 as a major, remained active in the Air Force Reserve, and rose to a final rank of colonel. Goddard married Julia \\"Judy\\" Hatch of Springfield, Illinois, in 1944. The couple chose to settle in Arizona upon a doctor's recommendation that the dry climate would help relieve Judy's rheumatoid arthritis. The marriage resulted in three sons, Terry (a recent Attorney General of Arizona), Tim and Bill. In 1946, Goddard purchased land in Tucson, near Swan Road and 22nd Street and built a home for his family. He also developed the land into a unique subdivision that included extra large lots, homes that were set back from the street and restrictions that kept the addition residential. He called the subdivision Aldea Linda or Beautiful Little Village.David Leighton,\\"Street Smarts: Midtown neighborhood one of Tucson's most unusual,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Nov. 16, 2015 Goddard earned his law degree at the University of Arizona in 1949 and began practicing in Tucson.

He died in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Political career He became a community leader, helped organize the Tucson Civic Chorus and the Tucson Watercolor Guild, and took an active role in charitable fundraising. In 1959, he became the chairman of the Tucson Youth Study Group and was selected as a member of the White House Conference on Youth and Children. His community efforts earned him the title Tucson Man of the Year 1959. He first was elected chairman of the Arizona Democratic State Committee in 1960. In 1961-1962 he served as president of the 11 state Western Conference of United Funds.

He ran for governor again in 1964, and this time won, beating future U.S. Attorney General Richard Kleindienst by 53%-47%. Goddard's campaign symbol, the Arizona roadrunner, became familiar throughout the state, and it helped bolster his reputation as a man of energy who got things done. As Governor, Goddard helped to organise a compromise amongst regional governors supporting the Colorado River Basin Project including the Central Arizona Project. This secured a reliable water source for the state, providing a foundation for the subsequent rapid economic population and economic growth that has occurred.

A constitutional amendment, approved by Arizona voters in 1968, resulted in Williams serving eight years as governor and being the first governor of Arizona to serve a four-year term. As Mayor of Phoenix, Williams led efforts to grow the city that produced a series of annexations and construction of new governmental buildings. As governor he focused primarily on economic development within the state. His final term as governor was marred by a recall effort, led by Cesar Chavez, in response to his signing of a farm labor bill into law. Early life Williams was born to James and Laure (LaCossette) Williams in Los Angeles on October 29, 1909. His parents, who had met while both working at a Wells Fargo office in Los Angeles, were assigned to the Wells Fargo office in Ash Fork, Arizona at the time of his birth but still made periodic trips to Los Angeles to visit his mother's family. While still a child, his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona where Williams was raised. In 1915, while visiting Los Angeles, Williams was diagnosed with a malignant tumor behind his right eye. At that time, Marie Curie was in the city giving lectures and demonstrating the use of radium pellets. After surgical removal of the eye and tumor, his physicians ‚Äî unsure how to proceed ‚Äî asked Curie to assist with Williams' treatment. Radiation therapy administered by Curie was successful in halting the cancer but left his eye socket unable to accept a glass eye. Williams instead became known for wearing glasses with a frosted lens. In 1924, Williams' father died suddenly. Williams graduated from Phoenix Union High School and enrolled at Phoenix Junior College (now Phoenix College). While in college he helped his family financially by writing press releases and holding part-time positions at the Phoenix Public Library and a local supermarket. Williams graduated from Phoenix Junior College in 1929. Early career As he prepared for graduation in 1929, Williams found a job posting for a radio announcer at KOY (AM). He applied for the position and was hired, beginning with a two-hour on-air shift each day. Williams began his radio career announcing songs and performing live advertisements for KOY. A couple months after starting, the station replaced him with a British actor. When the actor moved away from Phoenix several weeks later, Williams was rehired. By 1931 he had added news announcer to his list of duties with Williams rewriting stories from the Los Angeles Examiner or radio news services for the local audience. With the election of 1932 approaching, Williams created a news program titled I Vote For in which he asked people from around the state who they intended to vote for and later played the recorded answers. This program was the first time either of Phoenix's two radio stations (KTAR being the second) left their studios to interact with the public. In 1936, KOY underwent a change of ownership. With the new management, Williams received a promotion to program director, a job title he would hold for the next 30 years. In his role at KOY, he would go on to host the commentary show Yours Sincerely. Williams opened each show with his signature line, \\"It's a beautiful day in Arizona. Leave us all enjoy it!\\". On June 5, 1942, Williams married Vera May. The union produced three children: John Richard Jr, Micheal M. and Nikki. City politics A member of the Phoenix Union High School Board of Education approached Williams in 1942, asking him to run for a seat on the Phoenix Elementary School District No. 1 board. Williams was initially reluctant but eventually agree to run, only to lose. The next year one of the three members of the Elementary School board was removed from office and Williams was appointed to fill the empty seat. Shortly after taking office he was made Board President, a position he would retain until 1952. In addition to his seat on the school board, Williams became active in other civic and governmental activities. In 1946 he became president of Phoenix Junior Chamber of Commerce while he was vice president of the Phoenix Housing Authority from 1944 till 1947. The Phoenix Advertising Club named Williams Man of the Year in 1953. Williams' biggest impact on the school board came in 1951 following passage of a law by the state legislature allowing districts to voluntarily desegregate. He joined with another board member to pass a measure, 2-1, that desegregated Phoenix elementary schools. To deal with concerns from the minority community that minority teachers would lose their jobs he announced a \\"quota system\\" for the hiring of teachers. To alleviate concerns of white parents with children assigned to predominately minority classrooms he announced an \\"open school policy\\" allowing students to transfer to any other school in the district. In 1952, one of Phoenix's city council members moved his residence outside city limits and was required to abandon his seat. Barry Goldwater, another member of the city council, nominated Williams to fill the remainder of the outgoing councilman's term. After his appointment to the seat, Williams quickly learned he did not enjoy the \\"squabbles\\" that dominated legislative process. An example of this came when the city council considered buying several privately held water companies from local businessman Spence Stewart in order to merge them into a municipal water company. Williams focused on whether the purchase made sense for the city while the majority of the council were concerned with \\"not making Spence Stewart a millionaire by buying his water companies\\". Williams declined to run when his partial term ended in 1954. Mayor of Phoenix The Charter Government Committee (CGC) asked Williams to run for Mayor of Phoenix in mid-1955. The CGC, which dominated Phoenix city politics during the 1950s and 1960s, was a group organized to establish favorable business conditions in Phoenix and fight government corruption. Williams continued to host his daily radio show, Yours Sincerely during the campaign. He avoided speaking about campaign issues during the show, instead encouraging listeners to vote for the candidate of their choice in the days leading up to the election. A big issue raised in early October was the city council voting to give all 411 city workers a pay raise. Williams' three opponents condemned the vote with one candidate saying \\"It looks to me like the council is trying to buy an election with the taxpayer's money\\" while a second candidate said it was a \\"Cheap political device aimed at getting votes at the cost of the city's welfare.\\" Williams countered that the pay raise had been in consideration for several months and only came close to the election because of delays in the city council's vote. He attacked his opponents focus on the pay raise, claiming they were employing \\"oratorical gimmicks\\" and instead tried to focus on other problems facing Phoenix, including an antiquated sewage system. When the election results became available the morning after the election, Williams was found to have received more than twice as many votes as his three opponents combined. The day after the election, Williams used his radio show to thank the voters for their support. Williams was sworn in as mayor on January 3, 1956. He also continued his radio work while in office. As mayor, he described his two major roles as helping \\"fill up head tables\\" and serving as the city's \\"official greeter\\". Shortly after taking office, Williams asked the people who had asked him to run what they thought was the city's greatest need. They told him the city needed to annex surrounding areas to prevent small enclaves from forming in areas that should become part of Phoenix. Towards this need, Williams called a number of special sessions where the city council voted to annex adjacent land into the city. The CGC renominated Williams for a second term in 1957. Only a single challenger chose to run against him. As in his previous campaign, Williams avoided using his radio show to discuss campaign issues. In addition to races for various political offices, the voters in Phoenix were asked to approve a US$70 million bond package. On election day, Williams won a majority in every precinct within the city. The bond package was also approved. Williams became more aggressive in his efforts to annex new areas during his second term. He also used his radio show to discuss the advantages of living in an incorporated area, including police and fire protection, health and sanitation services, parks and playgrounds, street repair, and zoning controls. His efforts to enlarge Phoenix were largely successful with the city adding of new territory during his two terms. The bond package approved by the voters in 1957 was completed in late 1958. The resulting funds resulted in construction of a variety of public buildings in 1959. As his second term came to an end, Williams chose not to run for a third term. Governorship Soon after he left office as mayor, Republican leaders within Arizona began lobbying Williams to run for Governor. He instead returned to working full-time at KOY. Williams also began writing a regular column in the Phoenix Gazette. The combination of his work on radio and the newspaper kept him involved with state-wide politics. This changed in 1965 when Barry Goldwater and Paul Fannin convinced Williams to make a run. As part of the agreement between the men, Fannin, who had received assistance from Williams during his 1958 run for Governor, promised to help Williams in his run. As he began campaigning, Williams took a leave of absence from his position at KOY. This was done to avoid violating a 1959 change to the equal- time provision of the Fairness Doctrine and to allow him to campaign full- time. His opponents during the Republican primary were Arizona House Speaker John Haugh and former Arizona Attorney General Robert Pickrell. Haugh's political power was based in the southern section of the state. Williams was aided in Maricopa County by his increased name recognition from his time as Mayor of Phoenix. Pickrell would quickly fall out of contention as the campaign developed. Williams and Haugh meanwhile ran on virtually identical platforms with both men promising to work more closely with the state legislature than the sitting governor. Results of the primary gave Williams a narrow victory over Haugh, with Pickrell finishing a distant third. Campaign for the general election quickly turned nasty with the incumbent, Sam Goddard, accusing Williams of running a \\"scurrilous\\" campaign predicated on \\"invective and accusation and character assassination.\\" Williams responded by claiming Goddard had \\"made more mistakes in twenty months than all the other governors since statehood\\" and accusing him of \\"behaved like a petty tyrant scolding his subjects.\\" Mudslinging continued for the course of the campaign with both candidates questioning the qualifications of the other. Williams used self- deprecating humor to deflect his opponent's attacks and as election day approached claimed \\"For the past two months Sam Goddard has been so busy thinking up new names to call me he's forgotten to talk about the issues.\\" In addition to his own victory, Williams saw his party do well in races for the state legislature. This resulted in Republicans winning control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time in Arizona history. As governor, Williams kept a relatively low profile. As explained by the Arizona Republic, \\"...partly because the state constitution doesn't give the governor very much power. But it's more because Williams is neither charismatic nor flamboyant. He is basically a team player who believes in appointing good men to top posts and then allowing them to run their departments.\\" Politically, he was a hard- line conservative who worked to minimize taxes, balance the state budget, and provide a favorable business environment. As a measure of his efforts toward economic development, Arizona saw state-wide employment rise from 548,00 to 803,400 during his three terms, while manufacturing employment rose 103% and bank deposits saw a two-and-a-half fold increase. The primary achievement of Williams' first term was an overhaul of the assessment process for property taxes. The process for determining assessed values varied between the state's counties, as Williams pointed out in his 1967 State of the State speech. The legislature responded to Williams by enacting a single assessment methodology to be used by all counties throughout the state. Additionally, his administration created the Indian Development District of Arizona to promote economic development on the states' reservations and Williams visited the tribal council of each of the state's 17 Indian tribes. Second term During the election of 1968, Williams once again faced Sam Goddard. The mudslinging and rhetoric that typified their previous campaign began again in early September. Williams used the results of his two years in office to deflect his opponent's attacks. In response to claims that he was \\"anti- education\\", Williams pointed out that the state's three universities had seen a 42 percent increase in spending during his two years in office. Challenges to changes in the state's tax code were met with Williams claiming he had produced the \\"first fair and equitable tax program for real property the State of Arizona has ever enjoyed.\\" With a presidential election, U.S. Senate race, and three contested seats in the U.S. House of Representatives sharing the ballot with the governor's race, voter turn out was unusually high. Williams again received strong support from Maricopa County and won the rematch by roughly 89,000 votes. On November 18, 1968, Williams returned to producing his radio show, Yours Sincerely. In addition to his previous commentary the show began including occasional reports from the Governor's office. The show was only occasionally aired until 1970 when KOY's newly hired general manager, Gary Edens, saw the governor's show as an opportunity to increase the station's audience size. At that point the show was broadcast every morning. By 1969, Vietnam War protests on the campuses of the state universities were threatening to become disruptive. Williams responded by developing a plan where any demonstration that appeared likely to turn violent generated a response by city police. County sheriffs deputies were then positioned behind the police with state Highway troopers announcing the Arizona National Guard would constitute the third line of defense. The system was expensive but following the period of social unrest Williams would state \\"I didn't have to kill anybody.\\" Third term Williams opponent in the election of 1970 was Ra√∫l H. Castro. Unlike the previous two elections, both campaigns were fairly low key. The Arizona Republic called the race a contrast in personal styles with the primary issue being \\"whether the voters are in a mood for a change at the capitol.\\" Another change, due to a constitutional amendment approved by the voters in 1968, was that Williams was running for a four-year term instead of the previous two-year terms. Polls shortly before election day were unable to determine a clear front runner but predicted that Williams needed a strong result in Maricopa County if he was to win reelection. Williams achieved a narrow victory, winning by 7,406 votes. Williams' final term was marked by controversy over a state law dealing with farm labor. Among the provisions of the Farm Labor Bill (HB 2134), which the governor signed into law on May 11, 1972, was legal authorization for farm workers join labor unions and enter into collective bargaining agreements. The United Farm Workers, led by Cesar Chavez, however was unhappy about a provision of the farm bill that limited a union's ability to strike at harvest times and began a recall effort against Williams. Other concerns with the bill was a prohibition on secondary boycotts and the establishment of mediation board to deal with labor disputes on farms. In response to Chavez's call to action, 43 religious organizations labelled the bill \\"unfair\\" and asked for its repeal. From there a groundswell of support developed for the recall effort. Groups that joined the recall effort included various African-American, Chicano, and Native American groups along with the AFL‚ÄìCIO and National Organization for Women. Williams supports countered with claims that the recall was aimed at the \\"wrong target\\" and did not have the ability to overturn an act of the state legislature. The recall effort began collecting petition signatures in mid-1973. By the time they were done recall supporters turned in over 176,152 to the Arizona Secretary of State for verification. The verification process found many of the signatures to be questionable, invalid, or to have been collected by petition circulators who were not registered to vote. As a result, the state Attorney General issued a ruling declaring the drive for a recall unsuccessful. The ruling was challenged, but it was not until 1976 that a federal judge ruled the Arizona Secretary of State's office had improperly rejected a number of signatures. Among his other activities during his third term, Williams lobbied against daylight saving time in Arizona, informing the U.S. Congress that with the state's climate it would exchange a low-energy usage morning hour with a high- energy usage evening hour. Williams chose not to seek reelection in 1974. Stress of dealing with the recall effort was partially responsible for his decision. As part of his announcement not to run, Williams stated \\"I have served longer consecutively than other governors in Arizona's history, and during some extremely trying times.\\" Upon leaving the governor's office, Williams left a 53-page report on his time in office entitled Facts about Governor Williams and his Administration. No previous administration had produced such a report but the Arizona Republic editorialized \\"If they had, the report on Williams would not suffer by comparison.\\" After office With his departure from public office, the state media editorialized that Williams had performed his duties well, the Arizona Republic saying he could retire safe in the knowledge of a \\"job well done\\". An indication of his ability to nominate quality department heads came when his successor, Raul Castro, asked for many of Williams' appointees to remain at their posts. Williams himself, upon leaving office, took his wife on an extended trip to South America. With radio having transitioned to a music format, Williams was unable to return to his previous role as an announcer. He instead wrote his newspaper column, authored a book, engaged in public speaking, and traveled. From 1981 till 1994, Williams was a member of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District board. Williams' wife died in December 1997. The former governor's health soon after took a noticeable decline. Williams died in his home on August 24, 1998. He was suffering from cancer and other ailments at the time of his death. References  External links *Arizona Governor John \\"Jack\\" R. Williams by National Governors Association.

It is an adaptation of the Albert Simonin book Grisbi or not grisbi. The film is the final installment in the Max le Menteur trilogy; it was preceded by Touchez pas au grisbi and Le cave se rebiffe. The film was not popular with critics upon its first release in 1963, but was popular with the public. Its reputation has grown over the years to cult status and it is now a French television classic, with snatches of dialogue and names of characters (like the whore Lulu la Nantaise) becoming part of popular culture. Its DVD version, released in 2002, sold 250,000 copies. One of the most famous scenes is set in a kitchen where the gangsters try to make conversation while drinking a vile and strong liquor. Screenwriter Michel Audiard considered the scene useless but Lautner director included it in homage to the film noir Key Largo..  Synopsis  Fernand is an ex- gangster with a plant hire business in Montauban. His modest, quiet life is disrupted when his childhood friend, Louis \\"the Mexican\\", who has become the boss of a gangster organisation in Paris, summons him to his deathbed. Louis appoints Fernand head of his business and guardian of his teenage daughter, Patricia, who only thinks about having fun and has never lasted in any school more than six months. Protected by the loyal hitman Pascal, Fernand moves into the Mexican's suburban mansion, where he is welcomed by Ma√Ætre Folace who is the organisation's lawyer, Jean the butler who is a former housebreaker and Patricia, who hopes to twist her new \\"uncle\\" around her finger. He learns that the business has four arms: a bowling alley, a brothel run by Madame Mado, a gambling den run by the brothers Raoul and Paul Volfoni and a distillery run by Th√©o. Both the Volfonis and Th√©o resent the newcomer and plan to get rid of him. Th√©o's first plot is to get Fernand to deliver a load of contraband liquor, which he then ambushes. However, Fernand escapes alive and makes his way home. There he finds Patricia holding a wild party for all her friends, including her boyfriend Antoine who wants to marry her. The Volfonis, having failed to blow up Fernand's car, come round for a showdown but are disarmed and invited to a conference round the kitchen table, where all get horribly drunk on illegal whisky. Next day, Th√©o and a henchman come round to finish the job but, as they besiege the mansion, an old gentleman walks up. He turns out to be Antoine's wealthy father, calling to arrange Patricia's marriage. While he talks to Fernand, bullets keep coming through windows. The wedding is set, but before the ceremony Fernand has to get rid of Th√©o. Going to the distillery, a battle rages in which all Th√©o's men are killed but he escapes. Fernand then rushes to the church to give away Patricia. While everybody is inside, Th√©o drives up with a sub-machine gun, waiting to fell the wedding party as they emerge. On guard outside, Pascal blows up the car and its blazing wreck greets the newly-weds.

A superiority complex is a defense mechanism that develops over time to help a person cope with painful feelings of inferiority.Alfred Adler, The Neurotic Constitution: Outlines of a Comparative Individualistic Psychology and Psychotherapy, trans. Bernard Glueck and John E. Lind (New York: Moffat, Yard & Co., 1917), xvii (\\"... so the traits of character, especially the neurotic ones, serve as a psychic means and form of expression for the purpose of entering into an account with life, for the purpose of assuming an attitude, of gaining a fixed point in the vicissitudes of life, for the purpose of reaching that security-giving goal, the feeling of superiority.\\"). Individuals with this complex typically come across as supercilious, haughty, and disdainful toward others. They may treat others in an imperious, overbearing, and even aggressive manner.Alfred Adler, The Neurotic Constitution: Outlines of a Comparative Individualistic Psychology and Psychotherapy, trans. Bernard Glueck and John E. Lind (New York: Moffat, Yard & Co., 1917), 327 (\\"Usually one sees deviations and circuitous paths in following which the sadistic trait seems wholly or in part lost. In this way the neurotic succeeds in gaining superiority over the weak, or he operates on this new line so skillfully as to manage to set up an aggression which enables him to dominate and torture others.\\"). In everyday usage, the term \\"superiority complex\\" is used to refer to an overly high opinion of oneself. Alfred Adler Alfred Adler was the first to use the term superiority complex. He claimed that a superiority complex essentially came from the need to overcome underlying feelings of inferiority: an inferiority complex. Throughout his works Adler intertwines the occurrence of an inferiority complex and a superiority complex as cause and effect.H Mosak, Primer of Adlerian Psychology (2013) p 83 Among his writings touching on the topic were Understanding Human Nature (1927), and Superiority and Social Interest: A Collection of Later Writings, a collection of twenty one papers written by Adler and published posthumously in 1964. Adler distinguished a normal striving to achieve from superiority complexes,R Sharf, Theories of Psychotherapy and Counselling (2011) p. 130 the latter being attempts in order to overcompensate a feeling of inferiority. He states that those with an inferiority complex develop a superiority complex to overcome the difficulties presented by the former, primarily by inflating their sense of self-importance in some way.R Scharf, Theories of Psychotherapy and Counselling (2011) p. 130 Dreams of heroism, and a false assumption of success,A Adler, Collected Clinical Works of Alfred Adler (2002) p. 78 revealed for Adler the reactive nature of such strivings.H Mosak, Primer of Adlerian Psychology (2013) p 83 While Adler considered what he refers to in his writing as striving for superiority was a universal of human nature, he thought sound-minded individuals do not strive for personal superiority over others, rather for personal ambition and success through work. By contrast, those with an actual superiority complex were riddled with conceited fantasies, and with dreams of immutable supremacy.R Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 368 and p. 6 Other interpretations  *In contrast, an edition of the DSM- IV-TR that was published about twenty years after Alfred Adler's works disagreed that superiority complex (under the formal name of grandiose delusion in the DSM IV) came solely from the effects of an inferiority complex. The DSM IV states that a second cause to this delusional disorder could stem from an exaggerated emotional state. *Ada Kahn has argued that the superiority and inferiority complexes cannot both be found in the same individual, since an individual with a superiority complex truly believes that they are superior to others. She claimed that - whereas an inferiority complex may manifest with the behaviors that are intended to show others that one is superior, such as expensive material possessions, or an obsession with vanity and appearances to conceal feelings of inadequacy - superiority complex sufferers do not always care about image or vanity, since they have innate feelings of superiority, and thus do not usually concern themselves with proving their superiority to others. *Vera Hoorens say that those exhibiting the superiority complex have a self-image of supremacy. Whereas individuals with an inferiority complex tend to present themselves in the best light possible, those with a superiority complex may not even attempt to make themselves look good, or to express their superiority to others. They may speak as if they are all-knowing and better than others, but ultimately do not care if others think so or not, much like with the cognitive bias known as illusory superiority. Accordingly, they may be viewed in a negative light by those around them, since they are not concerned with the opinions of others about themselves. Other people may not distinguish between those with low self-opinion who care deeply about the opinion of others, and those with the actual complex, who feel superior and with high self-esteem, and do not care at all about the opinion of others.

It took place on the Virginia Peninsula, near Newport News, on June 10, 1861. Virginia's decision to secede from the Union had been ratified by popular vote on May 23, and Confederate Col. (later Maj. Gen.) John B. Magruder was sent down the peninsula to deter any advance on the state capital Richmond by Union troops based at the well-defended post of Fort Monroe. This garrison was commanded by Maj Gen. Benjamin Butler, a former Massachusetts lawyer and politician, who established a new camp at nearby Hampton and another at Newport News. Magruder had also established two camps, within range of the Union lines, at Big Bethel and Little Bethel, as a lure to draw his opponent into a premature action. Butler took the bait, when he and an aide, Maj. Theodore Winthrop, devised a plan for a dawn attack on June 10, after a night march to drive the Confederates back from their bases. Butler chose not to lead the force in person, for which he was later criticized. The plan proved too complex for his poorly-trained subordinates to carry out, especially at night, and his staff had also omitted to communicate the passwords. They were trying to advance without knowledge of the layout or strength of the Confederate positions, when a friendly fire incident gave away their own. The commander in the field, Massachusetts militia Gen. Ebenezer Peirce, received most of the blame for the failed operation. The Union forces suffered 76 casualties, with 18 killed, including Maj. Winthrop and Lt. John T. Greble, the first regular army officer killed in the war. The Confederates suffered only eight casualties, with one killed. Although Magruder subsequently withdrew to Yorktown and his defensive line along the Warwick River, he had won a propaganda victory and local Union forces attempted no further significant advance until the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. While small in comparison to many later battles, Big Bethel attracted exaggerated importance because of the general feeling that the war would be short. The engagement was also known as the Battle of Bethel Church or Great Bethel. Background=Union holds, reinforces Fort Monroe After the American Civil War began with the formal surrender of Fort Sumter to Confederate forces on April 14, 1861, and President Lincoln's call for volunteers to suppress the rebellion on April 15, 1861, Virginia's political leaders quickly set in motion the process of seceding from the Union and joining the Confederacy.President Lincoln's call for volunteers to reclaim federal property and suppress the rebellion of the seven Deep South states after the surrender of Fort Sumter on the previous day set in motion the process of secession of the four Upper South states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas. Hansen, Harry. The Civil War: A History. New York: Bonanza Books, 1961. . p. 48 Even before secession was formally accomplished, Virginia agreed to coordinate its state military forces with the Confederacy and began to seize federal property. The United States Regular Army garrison under the command of Col. Justin Dimick held Fort Monroe, a nearly impregnable fortress at Old Point Comfort on the southern tip of the Virginia Peninsula between the York River and the James River where they empty into Chesapeake Bay. The bay was to the east of the fort and Hampton RoadsThe water area known as Hampton Roads is one of the world's biggest natural harbors (more accurately a roadstead or \\"roads\\"), and incorporates the mouths of the Elizabeth River and James River with several smaller rivers and itself empties into the Chesapeake Bay near its mouth leading to the Atlantic Ocean. was to the south. The fort was supported by the Union Navy at Hampton Roads and could be reinforced and resupplied by water without attack by shore batteries or harassment by the nearly non-existent Virginia or Confederate naval forces. The fort was nearly immune from attack from the land side since it could be approached only over a narrow causeway and a narrow isthmus and had massive walls and hundreds of cannons. An inlet called Mill Creek was the body of water that almost cut the fort off from mainland of the Peninsula. Col. Dimick refused to surrender the fort and the small and poorly equipped Virginia (soon to be Confederate) militia forces in the area had no hope of taking the fort by force, especially after April 20, 1861, when the small Union garrison was reinforced by two Massachusetts volunteer regiments within a few days of the Virginia convention voting to secede from the Union on April 17, 1861. This important fort would provide a base for the blockade of Norfolk, Virginia, and the Chesapeake Bay and for the recovery of southeast Virginia and the Virginia Peninsula for the Union.Poland, Jr., Charles P.

David W. Wardrop and the 4th Massachusetts Militia commanded by Col. Abner B. Packard, were able to reinforce Fort Monroe's garrison of 415 regulars within five days of the President's call. The 4th Massachusetts was the first to arrive. These reinforcements helped assure that this strong point and base of operations would be fully prepared for defense and saved for the Union.McKean, William Vincent.

On May 13, 1861, the 1st Regiment, Vermont Volunteer Infantry under Col. J. Wolcott Phelps joined the garrison and several other volunteer regiments from New York soon followed. On May 14, 1861 while Col. Dimick was still in command of the garrison, he seized a well just outside the fort in what was then Elizabeth City CountyIn 1952 Elizabeth City County was absorbed by the independent city of Hampton, which had been the county seat and largest town in the county. because the fort did not have enough water even for its original small garrison. His forces also occupied the Mill Creek Bridge, which was needed for access to the Peninsula from the fort and the nearby Clark farm.Quarstein, 2000, p. 30 The fort soon could not hold all of the arriving reinforcements so Union forces established Camp Troy, soon renamed Camp Hamilton in honor of an aide to General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, on the Segar farm on the Hampton side of Mill Creek, within range of the guns of Fort Monroe.Quarstein, 2000, pp. 31-32 Butler takes command, expands Union bridgehead While Col. Dimick remained in command of the 415 regular army soldiers, Volunteer Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts took command of Fort Monroe and the entire garrison on May 23, 1861.McKean, 1863, p. 547On that same day a popular vote ratified the secession of Virginia. With continuing reinforcements, Butler could not only retain the Union hold on Fort Monroe but support the Union blockade of Chesapeake Bay, move up the Peninsula and threaten to retake Norfolk, Virginia, and other locations on the south side of Hampton Roads from the Confederates. The 4th Massachusetts Regiment works to fortify Camp Butler. On May 27, 1861, Gen. Butler sent a force north to occupy the lightly defended adjacent town of Newport News at Newport News Point, an excellent anchorage for the Union Navy. This force established and significantly fortified Camp Butler and a battery at Newport News Point that could cover the entrance to the James River ship canal and the mouth of the Nansemond River. By May 29 Butler's force, which included the 1st Vermont Infantry, Col. John A. Bendix's 7th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (a regiment of German speakers), the 4th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Scott's Life Guards and a detachment of U.S. Regulars to man artillery, completed the mission.Lossing, Benson John and William Barritt.

Foreshadowing the further difficulties which would arise during the operation, Peirce was too ill to ride his horse and went to the fort by boat.Lossing, 1866, p. 504 Peirce was ordered to first send Col. Abram Duryee's 5th New York Volunteer Infantry (Dury√©e's Zouaves) from Camp Hamilton at Hampton to a point between Little Bethel and Big Bethel and then, after having cut the road to Big Bethel, to attack the Confederates at Little Bethel. Col. Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, with two howitzers, was to march from Hampton after the 5th New York Infantry had departed and provide support at Little Bethel. Meanwhile, Col. John W. Phelps, commanding at Newport News, would send detachments from his own 1st Vermont Infantry and Col. David W. Wardrop's 4th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment (90-day Militia) under the command of Lt. Col. Peter T. Washburn to approach Little Bethel from the opposite side. Washburn would be followed by Col. Bendix's German-speaking 7th New York Infantry Regiment and two artillery pieces manned by regulars from the 2d U.S. Artillery Regiment, commanded by Lt. John T. Greble. The plan was for this force to meet the 3rd New York Infantry under Townsend at a road junction about from Little Bethel and form a combined reserve.Tomes, Robert.

Peirce and his staff headed for Little Bethel with Townsend's 3rd New York Infantry Regiment.Cobb, 2013, p. 79. The column from Camp Hamilton was to start at midnight, and that from Newport News a little later, as its line of march would be shorter.Poland, 2006, pp. 208-209 Anticipating possible confusion during a night march by inexperienced troops, Butler ordered the watchword, \\"Boston,\\" to be given to each column and further ordered that all the troops should wear a white rag or handkerchief on their left arms so they would recognize each other. Any attacking regiment was supposed to first shout the watchword. Butler's aide and messenger to the Newport News command, Capt. Haggerty, forgot to advise Col. Phelps and the Newport News contingent of these precautions.Lossing, 1866, pp. 505, 506 Friendly fire incident Colonel Abram Dury√©e led the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry from their positions at Camp Hamilton and despite some delays arrived near Little Bethel at about 4:00 a.m. Part of this regiment under Captain (later Brigadier General) Judson Kilpatrick captured three Confederate pickets before dawn and were in position to continue the advance as planned. Before Dury√©e's men could advance close enough to the Confederate positions to open the attack, they heard gunfire behind them. Colonel Bendix's 7th New York Volunteer Infantry had opened fire on Colonel Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who were coming up the narrow road from the direction of Hampton to the south. The 3rd New York Infantry was being led down the road by General Peirce and his staff on horseback without an advance guard. Bendix knew that no cavalry was with the Union force and mistook the 3rd New York for a Confederate cavalry regiment.Lossing, 1866, p. 505 More importantly, the 3rd New York Infantry wore gray uniforms, with white bands on their arms such as had been seen previously on the hats, at least, of Confederates.Gordon, 1883, p. 28 says: \\"We had white bands on our hats to distinguish us from the enemy....\\" Bendix, who had not been given the watchword or the instructions on armbands, thought the Confederates were behind his regiment as well as in front and ordered his men to fire upon Townsend's men.Poland, 2006, p. 210Later, Bendix's men claimed the mistake was mutual and that Townsend's men had opened fire on them at the same time. Tomes says some of Townsend's men admitted this and blamed it on the absence of white bands on the arms of Bendix's men. Tomes, 1862-1867, p. 274 After the attack by Bendix's men, Peirce pulled his force back to south of the New Market Bridge, a counter-march of about to assess the situation and to await an expected further Confederate attack in a more advantageous position. To the dismay of all, it was soon discovered that Bendix had opened fire with muskets and an artillery piece on the 3rd New York Infantry and the commanding general's party, wounding 21 men (two mortally) and causing dozens of other men to flee the field.Poland, 2006, pp. 210-212 At this time, the colonels of various regiments, in particular Duryea and Washburn, advised Peirce to call off the operation.Gordon, 1883, p. 26 However, Butler's aides, Major Winthrop and Captain Haggerty, urged Peirce to move forward,Poland, 2006, p. 212 and he chose to continue with the attack. At least forty men of the 3rd New York Infantry had fled back to the fort at Hampton where they reported that their regiment was being cut to pieces by a large Confederate force. Before waiting for a request for reinforcement, Colonel William H. Allen then headed north with the 1st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment to help Townsend's regiment.Poland, 2006, p. 211Lossing, 1866, p. 506 Peirce also soon sent a message back to Hampton for the 2d New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment under Colonel Joseph B. Carr to come up to the area. They were ordered to stop at the New Market Bridge and ultimately acted as a rear guard. Thinking they had been cut off when they heard the gunfire from the road back to Hampton behind them, Dury√©e's men of the 5th New York Infantry withdrew from their advanced position and headed south to the sound of the guns, as did the other Union troops from the Vermont and Massachusetts regiments under Lieutenant Colonel Washburn. Those troops were approaching Little Bethel in front of the site of the incident.Major Whittemore of the 4th Massachusetts Infantry wrote that he had rode out in front alone, discovered the mistake and got the New Yorkers to cease firing.Schouler, William. A History of Massachusetts in the Civil War. Volume 1. Boston: E.P. Dutton & Company, 1868. . Retrieved June 12, 2011. p. 89 The Union forces had lost the element of surprise for their attack and delayed the timing of it as well. Little Bethel The friendly fire incident alerted the Confederates at Little Bethel, as well as Magruder's main force, of the Union movement.Quarstein, 1997, p. 38 Upon approach of the Union force and the sound of the gunfire from the New York regiments, the approximately 50 Confederates manning the outpost at Little Bethel Church abandoned that position and fell back to their entrenchments behind Marsh Creek (later Brick Kiln Creek), the branch of the Back River near Big Bethel Church. As it had turned out, only this small group was stationed at Little Bethel, not the large force that Butler expected to find there. Gordon, in discussing the mistakes of the Union commanders in this operation says: \\"But behind all this was the most serious mistake of all - a mistake in Butler's plan. The Confederates had no outpost of strength at Little Bethel, and the scheme to surround and capture it was an attack on a man of straw.\\" He says that Butler could have struck the road to Yorktown north of Big Bethel and compelled Magruder to withdraw to Yorktown without firing a shot.Gordon, 1883, p. 36 The 5th New York Infantry (Duryee's Zouaves) had again been sent by Peirce as the leading regiment. Finding the Confederates were in flight from Little Bethel, the 5th New York Infantry burned the church at Little Bethel so the Confederates could not use it as an outpost and also set fire to the homes of several secessionists. The Union force then continued toward Big Bethel. Confederate advance, return to Big Bethel By chance, Magruder had started a large part of his force toward Hampton to launch a surprise attack of his own on the Union forces.Hotchkiss, 1899, pp. 137-138The Union Army: Cyclopedia of battles, 1908. p. 121 After hearing the gunfire and being alerted by an elderly local lady that a Union force was only a few hundred yards down the road, Magruder hurried his men back to his fortifications at Big Bethel. The Confederates were now fully alerted to the Union Army movement and were able to get back into position well before Peirce's men arrived at Big Bethel. Almost the entire Confederate force was now behind earthworks and north of Marsh Creek (Brick Kiln Creek), the branch of the Back River at Big Bethel. The exception was that some of the 3rd Virginia Infantry were in an open field to the south of the branch to protect a howitzer position which was intended to block the main Yorktown-Hampton road. These men hurriedly tried to entrench and to find other cover, such as old mill dam, as the Union force approached.Quarstein, 2000, p. 46 The Confederate force consisted of the same units that Magruder had sent to Big Bethel a few days earlier: Colonel D. H. Hill's 1st North Carolina Volunteer Infantry (about 800 men), three companies of Lieutenant Colonel William D. Stuart's 3rd Virginia Infantry (208 men), a cavalry battalion of about 100 men under Major E. B. Montague, and the Richmond Howitzer artillery battalion of about 150 men under Major George W. Randolph.Poland, 2006, p. 237 Union attacks at Big Bethel Having determined to continue to Big Bethel without knowledge of the layout or strength of the Confederate positions, Peirce sent Duryee's 5th New York Infantry out first. Captain Kilpatrick along with Captain Charles G. Bartlett and skirmishers were sent forward to scout the Confederate position. They returned to the main body of the Union force and, after observation and talking to a black man and a local woman as well, told the officers in command that the Confederates had between 3,000 and 5,000 men and 30 pieces of artillery.Poland, 2006, p. 213 They actually had about 1,400-1,500 men and 5 artillery pieces, but Kilpatrick accurately reported that their position was well fortified.Hotchkiss, 1899, p. 136Tomes, 1862-1867, p. 276 If the Union forces had not done enough already to give up their plan and position, Kilpatrick gave notice of the arrival of the Union force at Big Bethel by shooting at Confederate scouts and pickets. As the Union force came up to the field, they could not see the Confederates behind their fortifications but the Confederates also did not have a good view of the Union force because of the shade from the woods behind the field on the right and small buildings on the left. However, they could see the bayonets and flag of a Union force about to the left. Major Randolph, commanding the Howitzer Battalion, fired a shot at this column which ricocheted through the Union line and killed a soldier standing next to Colonel Bendix.Poland, 2006, p. 214 The two forces then began an intermittent fight that began at 9:00 a.m. and lasted until 1:30 p.m. After the initial artillery shot, Bendix's men began to scatter into the trees for protection. The 5th New York Infantry under Colonel Duryee charged the left of the forward Confederate position with the apparent ultimate intent of crossing the stream and turning the Confederate flank but they were quickly discouraged and turned back by heavy Confederate fire.Quarstein, 1997 p. 39 Lieutenant Greble came up the road to place his three guns where he and his small detachment of regulars from the 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment could return fire, which he did resolutely but with little effect. Peirce then positioned the 5th New York (Duryee), 7th New York (Bendix) and the Massachusetts and Vermont companies (Washburn) to the right of the Hampton Road and the 3rd New York (Townsend) and 1st New York (Allen) to the left of the road. He would launch piecemeal attacks from these positions. Greble continued to fire at the Confederate positions while Peirce arranged his force and gave them some time to rest.Poland, 2006, p. 216Gordon, 1883, p. 30 said: \\"The Federal guns were well handled by Lieutenant Greble, of the regular United States army. Shot after shot struck our earthworks, and but for these defences our loss would have been considerable.\\" Union skirmishers went forward to try to determine the strength of the Confederate position. Most were driven back immediately. Two companies from the 5th New York led by Captain Kilpatrick and Captain John G. Butler, the General's nephew, advanced across an open field with only a few trees, a shed and a house for cover.One account states the skirmishers were under Captains Kilpatrick, Bartlett, and Winslow, and all were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Gouverneur K. Warren, who was acquainted with the ground. An artillery shot went through the house and killed one of the men. Around noon, the 3rd New York Infantry led by Colonel Townsend came forward to the skirmishers' position. They tried to attack the forward Confederate position but could advance only to within before being forced to lay down due to the heavy Confederate fire.Poland, 2006, pp. 216-217 Townsend feared he was being flanked and began to withdraw just as the Confederate howitzer facing his position broke and the Confederate commander in the redoubt, Colonel William D. Stuart, pulled his 200 men of the 3rd Virginia Infantry back to a hill near the church.Poland, 2006, p. 217Quarstein, 2000, p. 47 Stuart also feared he was being flanked. Part of the 5th New York Infantry which was attacking alongside the 3rd New York temporarily seized this position but were unable to hold it. Townsend had nothing to fear from the men on his left because they were a company of his own regiment who had become separated from the main body. By the time this was discovered, Townsend had pulled back. Magruder did not want to give up the advantageous forward position and sent Stuart back with another howitzer and reinforcements from the 1st North Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. This Confederate move and Townsend's retreat left the 5th New York unsupported and they had to withdraw from their captured position as well. Renewed fire from the regained Confederate position insured that neither Townsend nor Duryee would move forward against this position again. Meanwhile, Kilpatrick was trying to lead part of the 5th New York around the Confederates from the right but they came under heavy fire.Poland, 2006, p. 218 As men were falling, Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Gouverneur K. Warren came forward on a white mule and began to lead the men toward a ford through the creek from the main road to Hampton. A platoon guarding the ford was outnumbered by the Union force and retreated as they approached. Magruder ordered Captain W. H. Werth forward with a howitzer company. Werth hurried to the ford and arrived before the Zouaves of the 5th New York Infantry under Duryee and Kilpatrick. Werth drove them off from the ford with a howitzer shot but they continued to fight from the wood line. Grape shot tore the rectangle off Colonel Duryee's left shoulder, wounded Captain Kilpatrick in the thigh and killed a soldier behind them.Poland, 2006, pp. 218-219Tomes, 1862-1867, p. 277 The 5th New York Infantry was exhausted from being the first unit on the march and from heavy action in the day's fighting so the unit was pulled back.Poland, 2006, p. 219 Kilpatrick, who was badly wounded by the shot through his thigh, had to be rescued and carried away by Captain Winslow at the very end of the battle after his regiment had withdrawn. Otherwise, he would have fallen into Confederate hands.Lossing, 1866, p. 510 Duryea's Zouaves, by Thomas Nast, 1861 Deaths of Winthrop, Wyatt, Greble; end of battle The 5th New York Infantry was replaced for one last assault on the Union right by Major Theodore Winthrop, who was also an officer of the 7th New York Infantry but was serving on the staff of General Peirce, having been detailed from General Butler's staff since he helped Butler plan the attack. Winthrop led a detachment of troops from the 5th New York, 1st Vermont, and 4th Massachusetts infantry regiments.Some accounts such as Quarstein, 1997, p. 40 mention only Vermont and Massachusetts soldiers in Winthrop's attack. Though also very tired from the night march and increasingly hot day, Winthrop and his force also attempted to turn the Confederate left flank (from the Union right). Unlike the earlier unsuccessful Union attempts to cross the creek, Winthrop and his men crossed the creek uncontested because they tied their white cloths around their hats and pretended to be part of the Confederate force. Then they cheered and ran forward, somewhat prematurely giving away their identity. Two companies of the 1st North Carolina Infantry then turned to face them and their fire turned the Union force back with several casualties. One was Major Winthrop who had jumped onto a log and yelled \\"come on boys, one charge and the day is ours.\\" These were his last words as he sustained a bullet through his heart while his men fled back across the creek.Poland, 2006, pp. 219-220 After the battle, Colonel Hill praised Winthrop's courage while disparaging the efforts of the rest of the Union soldiers.Quarstein, 2000, p. 48 Maj. Theodore Winthrop, a noted American writer and Union officer, was killed in the Battle of Big Bethel Pvt. Henry L. Wyatt, the first Confederate soldier from North Carolina to be killed in the Civil WarWyatt, Henry Lawson by Daniel Burt Veazey, Dictionary of North Carolina Biography Advanced Union skirmishers continued to fire at the Confederate positions from the house on the field and other outbuildings on the south side of the creek. Colonel Hill asked four volunteers to go forward and burn the house. Fire from across the main road stopped them and they dove to the ground. One of them, Private Henry Lawson Wyatt, had been killed.Poland, 2006, p. 221 The others were called back and soon Major Randolph was able to destroy the house with artillery fire. Lieutenant Greble, whose guns had been hidden by the house, continued to fire and exposed his position. By this time the battle was ending and Peirce ordered all of his force to retire. It was clear that the Confederate position was too strong and his troops were too exhausted to continue a costly and increasingly futile attack.Poland, 2006, p. 222 Lieutenant John Trout Greble refused to pull back until the last, continuing to work his remaining gun, for he did not have enough able men left to man them both. This effort cost him his life as the Confederate artillery concentrated on his position and he was struck in the back of the head by a cannonball while finally winding up his work.Poland, 2006, pp. 222-223 When they received word of Greble's death, Lieutenant Colonel Warren, Captain Wilson and five of their men rushed back to recover Greble's body before they left the field. Greble was the first graduate of West Point and first U.S. Regular Army officer killed in the war.Tomes, 1862-1867, p. 280 After littering the road back to Fort Monroe with coats and equipment on a very hot afternoon, the Union troops arrived back at Fort Monroe about 5:00 p.m. that afternoon.Poland, 2066, p. 224 About 100 Confederate cavalry pursued the Union force but could not mount an attack and pulled back as they approached Hampton because the Union force had pulled up the New Market Bridge over the southern branch of the Back River to thwart the Confederate pursuit.Hotchkiss, 1899, p. 138-139 Aftermath Total Federal casualties at the Battle of Big Bethel and the friendly fire incident which preceded it were 76, including 18 killed, 53 wounded and 5 missing.Quarstein, 1997, p. 41Poland, 2006, pp. 225, 238Some accounts give the number of Union casualties as 79. Poland, 2006, p. 238 gives an account of the Union casualties by regiment as follows: Staff: 1 killed (Winthrop); 4th Massachusetts: 1 killed; 1st New York: 1 killed; 2d New York: 2 killed, 1 wounded; 3rd New York: 2 killed, 27 wounded or missing; 5th New York: 6 killed, 13 wounded; 7th New York: 3 killed, 7 wounded, 2 missing; 1st Vermont: 2 killed, 3 wounded, 1 missing; Second U.S. Artillery: 1 killed (Greble). Union forces attempted no further advance on the Virginia Peninsula until the Peninsula Campaign of 1862.Poland, 2006, p. 234 However, Butler did send an expedition up the Back River with naval support on June 24, 1861 which destroyed 14 transports and several small boats which had supplies for the Confederate forces.Quarstein, 2000, p. 49 Both sides generally continued to hold and improve their positions and works until the Peninsula campaign began. Butler soon had to return many of his men to Washington in order to reinforce the defeated Union force after the First Battle of Bull Run as fear for the security of the capital ran high. While Butler continued to maintain the camp at Newport News, he had to abandon the camp at Hampton for lack of men. When Magruder discovered this, on August 7, 1861, a Confederate force burned Hampton so it could no longer be used to shelter runaway slaves.Quarstein, 2000, p. 51 Butler did not attempt to shell the Confederates from the fort for fear he would be blamed, at least in part, for the burning of the town due to cannon fire.Poland, 2006, p. 235 Butler was criticized for the debacle at Big Bethel, including his decision not to lead the operation in person. His appointment as major general of volunteers was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by only two votes.Poland, 2006, p. 231 Most of the criticism fell on the Massachusetts militia general, Ebenezer Peirce. Many of the men even wrote to newspapers and others to condemn Peirce's handling of the operation, lack of coordination of forces, sporadic efforts at fighting, wasting of time and leaving too much discretion to subordinates. Even Butler spoke of Peirce's shortcomings in handling the matter, although in more restrained language than he is reported to have used in private.Poland, 2006, pp. 232-233 In the early stages of the war, uniforms had not been standardized, and some Union units wore some items of clothing which were gray in color, though gray had also begun to be adopted by the Confederate Army. William Y. W. Ripley, a company commander in the 1st Vermont who later received the Medal of Honor for heroism at the Battle of Malvern Hill while fighting with the 1st United States Sharpshooters, said a primary lesson for Union Army leaders was that \\"...the gray overcoats and soft hats had to go, lest they (Union soldiers) be shot by their own troops.\\"Roy Martin Marcot, Gerald Denning, Civil War Chief of Sharpshooters Hiram Berdan: Military Commander and Firearms Inventor, 1989, page 108 The Confederates suffered only one killed and seven wounded.Gordon (who was with the Howitzers Battalion), 1883, p. 34, says the Confederates had nine wounded.Some reports showed 9 wounded rather than 7. Many authors have stated that Private Henry L. Wyatt of the 1st North Carolina Volunteers, later the 11th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, the only Confederate soldier killed in the battle was the first Confederate soldier killed in combat in the Civil War. This is only correct to the extent a distinction is made between the first officer killed, Captain John Quincy Marr, who was killed at the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861) on June 1, 1861 and the first enlisted man killed, which Private Wyatt appears to have been.Norris, David. The Battle of Big Bethel pp. 226-227 In Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, edited by David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2000. Major Winthrop and several other Union dead were buried on the field by the Confederates.Gordon, 1883, pp. 33-34 says that 18 Union dead were left on the field and surmises the official Union casualty figures were too low, though the actual figures were nowhere near what were reported in the press, even in the accounts of Union soldiers. Soon thereafter, Magruder granted a request by Winthrop's brother and Union officers, under a flag of truce, to recover Winthrop's body. They returned the body on the field with a respectful escort.Poland, 2006, p. 227 Major Randolph's artillery and Colonel D. H. Hill's 1st North Carolina infantry troops were commended by Magruder for their actions.OR, Magruder's report, June 10, 1861. Within hours of the battle, Magruder withdrew his forces to Yorktown, where he established a line protected by the Warwick River. Magruder feared another larger and better planned Union attack on his position and felt he should maintain his defense at Yorktown and along the Warwick River. The press in the Confederate States in particular made the Confederate victory appear to be more momentous than it was and greatly exaggerated the number of Union soldiers killed in the battle, a common reaction by both sides to battles in 1861. At the time, the outcome of the battle was an important boost to Southern confidence and morale.Poland, 2006, p. 233 Along with the Confederate victory at the Battle of First Bull Run (Battle of First Manassas) six weeks later, it provided what proved to be undue encouragement and confidence in a quick victory in the war to the Confederates.\\"Coming at this juncture, the battle of Bethel flashed a bright gleam over the military situation in Virginia. It was like a glass of generous wine to a fainting man. The thunder of guns fought by Richmond men, bearing tidings of victory, reanimated all hearts in the homes of Richmond. It was the prelude, the prophesy, the earnest of the more signal and important victory on the plains of Manassas.\\" Gordon, 1883, Pamphlet 1, p. 15 Union morale was correspondingly damaged but as events proved, the Northern public and military showed resilience and determination in the face of several early defeats. Claim as first land battle of the American Civil War Big Bethel was one of the first Civil War land battles both in present-day Virginia and in the war after the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter. Although arguments have been made that either the Battle of Philippi, on June 3, 1861, in present-day West Virginia (then part of Virginia) or the Battle of Big Bethel was the first land battle of the entire war, the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861)Historian David J. Eicher in The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War, 2001, p. 74 described the engagement at Fairfax Court House as \\"ostensibly the first land battle of the war.\\" His use of the word \\"ostensibly\\" is made clearer on the next page where he distinguishes as \\"mere skirmishes\\" the battles at Fairfax Court House and Philippi and, on p. 75, describes the Battle of Big Bethel as the \\"first real land battle\\" of the war. On the other hand, on p. 77 he lumps all the engagements together as \\"these first minor skirmishes.\\" took place in Fairfax County, Virginia on June 1, 1861, two days earlier than the Battle of Philippi and nine days before the Battle of Big Bethel.The Battle of Arlington Mills, which undoubtedly was a small skirmish although one in which a few casualties were incurred, took place in present-day Arlington County, Virginia, also on June 1, 1861. Historian David J. Eicher discounts both the Battle of Fairfax Court House and the Battle of Philippi as \\"mere skirmishes\\" and says the first \\"real land battle of the conflict\\" was the Battle of Big Bethel, although after a brief summary of the Battle of Big Bethel he characterizes the early Civil War engagements without apparent distinction as \\"these first minor skirmishes.\\"Eicher, 2001, p. 75. He says on p. 75 in regard to the Battle of Philippi: \\"Although this minor skirmish was glorified in the press ... it had little significance.\\"Historian Charles Poland says the battle of Big Bethel was \\"what most Richmond papers called the first land battle of the war.\\" Poland, 2006, p. 207 The Baltimore riot of April 19, 1861 might also be considered a small Civil War battle, with several killed and wounded on each side, but the Confederate side in the affair was a civilian mob, not an organized military force like the force the mob attacked, which was several companies of the 6th Massachusetts Militia. Civilian mobs also were engaged with military forces in two similar riots in St. Louis in the early days of the war after the surrender of Fort Sumter. Compared to the large battles to come, all the engagements before the Battle of First Bull Run (Battle of First Manassas) are fairly characterized as mere skirmishes. Battlefield preservation Most of the Big Bethel battlefield, and the whole Little Bethel site, have not been preserved. Today the sites are generally covered with residential and commercial development. Marsh Creek or Brick Kiln Creek has also been dammed, creating the Big Bethel Reservoir on the battlefield site. The fragments of the site that remain are not readily identifiable.Salmon, John S. The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2001. . p. 72 The site of Lt. Greble's death is now a convenience store. A group of local preservationists has developed a plan to preserve areas, currently located on Langley Air Force Base, containing a remnant of an earthwork and the memorial to Henry Lawson Wyatt, the only Confederate soldier killed in the battle.Quarstein, John V. \\"First Blood at Big Bethel.\\" Civil War Times vol.

Biography He was the only son of Margrave Ottokar III of Styria (1124‚Äì1164) and his wife Kunigunde (d. 1184), a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold III of Vohburg and sister-in-law of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. His father bequested him extended estates stretching from the Danube down the Mur river to the March of Carniola. By the mid 12th century, the Otakars moved their residence from Steyr to the Castle Hill (Schlossberg) in Graz. A minor upon his father's death on a crusade in 1164, Ottokar IV was raised under the tutelage of his mother Kunigunde and Styrian ministeriales. The young margrave entered into several conflicts with the neighbouring Babenberg dukes of Austria and also with the Spanheim duke Herman of Carinthia. Backed by his maternal uncle Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, he made great efforts to secure the Imperial border against the Kingdom of Hungary in the east; he had his Graz residence rebuilt and the fortress of F√ºrstenfeld erected about 1170. When at the 1180 Imperial Diet of Gelnhausen the emperor declared the rebellious Bavarian duke Henry the Lion deposed, he detached the Styrian march from his duchy and elevated Ottokar to a duke in his own right. Childless and deathly ill, Ottokar IV, who had contracted leprosy while on crusade, was the first but also the last duke of the Otakars. With the consent of the emperor, he entered into the Georgenberg Pact with Duke Leopold V of Austria in 1186: both dukes met in Enns and agreed that Ottokar was to give his duchy to Leopold and to his son Frederick, under the stipulation that Austria and Styria would henceforth remain undivided. The inheritance contract brought Styria under joint rule with the Duchy of Austria after Ottokar's death in 1192. He was buried in his father's foundation of Seitz; in 1827 his mortal remains were transferred to Rein Abbey. 1163 births 1192 deaths 12th-century Austrian people Margraves of Styria ","title":"Ottokar IV, Duke of Styria"},{"id":"1349541","text":"Two ships of the United States Navy have been named Ammen for Daniel Ammen. * , was a Paulding-class destroyer launched in 1910 and served in World War I. * , was a Fletcher-class destroyer launched in 1942, served in World War II and decommissioned in 1960.

Monnette was also the Founder of the Bank of America, L.A..Ira Brown Cross, Financing an empire: history of banking in California (The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1927), 318. Early life Orra E. Monnette was born in southern Crawford County, Ohio to Mervin J. Monnette and Olive Hull Monnette. Monnette's father was involved in farming, raising stock, and banking. Mervin J. Monnette, along with his brothers established the town of Monnett in southern Crawford County, Ohio for the purposes of shipping cattle to the markets north of their farms. His family were staunch members of the Methodist Episcopal Church (aka \\"M.E. Church\\") which is now part of the modern United Methodist Church. Monnette's great-grandfather was the Reverend Jeremiah Crabb Monnett, an itinerant Methodist Episcopal preacher who led the settlement of Southern Crawford County by M.E. Church members. Monnette attended Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, where he joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.Grand Catalogue of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity: February 1, 1910, page 122 A first cousin of his grandfather ‚Äì Mary Monnett Bain ‚Äì had donated a sizable sum to the college in the 1850s which resulted in the building of Monnett Hall. In his youth, Monnette also helped in the organization of subscriptions for the building of Monnett Memorial M. E. Chapel in Crawford County Ohio. Monnette was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1896, practicing in Bucyrus, Ohio, and later relocating to Toledo, Ohio. He was admitted to the California bar in 1909. Banking business While Monnette was trained as an attorney, his father‚Äôs foray into mining in 1904-1906 changed his career path. In 1906, the elder Monnette struck a significant gold vein in the previously thought tapped out Mohawk Mine, Tonopah, Nevada (near Goldfield, Nevada). The strike, known as the Monnette-Hayes Lease, with mining expert G. H. Hayes and set records for the value of the ore shipped in 1906. Eventually, Mervin Monnette realized a $5,000,000 profit on the Mohawk, which he assigned to his son for investment. With his father‚Äôs mining proceeds, Orra Monnette began purchased stock in Los Angeles area banks. Eventually, this led to a controlling interest in the American National Bank of Los Angeles (ANB). In 1909, ANB was merged into Citizens Trust and Savings Bank of Los Angeles. In 1911, Monnette purchased the Broadway Bank and Trust Company, which when merged with the family‚Äôs other holdings formed the Citizens Bank and Trust Company, of which Orra E. Monnette was Chairman of the Board. Monnette left Citizens in 1922. His next venture, opening at the corner of Wilshire and Western Avenues in Los Angeles in 1923 was christened Bank of America, Los Angeles (BoA). On opening day, the bank posted an operating capital of one million dollars. Monnette‚Äôs intention was to build capital for national expansion; however, over the course of the 1920s, Bank of Italy's Amadeo Giannini began buying stock in BoA, L.A. In 1928 Monnette and Giannini, agreed that a merger of both entities under the Bank of America name promised the best opportunity for all concerned. As part of the deal, Monnette sold his rights to the \\"Foundation Story\\" of the combined entity. Monnette was growing concerned about the stock and financial markets.

During the early 1930s, with his interests elsewhere, Monnette was made a Vice President in the bank and retained his Board seat. Monnette also founded the Lincoln Mortgage Company of California, which was not included in the BoA merger. Monnette retained control of the company and continued to serve as its President until his death. Civic life Bronze plaque, dedicated to Orra E.

Throughout his life in Los Angeles, California, Orra Monnette served on numerous commissions and boards charged with public projects and the operation of various public organizations. Monnette was appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Annexation Commission in 1913, to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission in 1920 and was made a member of the Board of Freeholders which framed Los Angeles‚Äô city charter between 1923 and 1924. In 1914, Monnette was appointed to the Los Angeles Public Library Board, and reappointed every five years until his death in 1936. Monnette was elected President of the Library Board in 1916,Board of Directors, Los Angeles Public Library, Annual report of the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Public Library (No Printer Name Given, 1916), . and retained that office until his death as well. During the twenty-three years of his tenure, Monnette championed three major library bond packages which were supported by the citizens of Los Angeles. The bond packages allowed the city to build forty- eight (48) branches throughout the Los Angeles area as well as the landmark art deco Central Library in Downtown Los Angeles. In 1907, Monnette became a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of California. An avid genealogist, he brought experience and leadership to the evolution of the society's library, founded in 1893, which remains open free to the public as a public service of that organization.

Modern viewers, who may have cable or satellite services beaming down dozens if not hundreds or thousands of channels, are frequently channel surfing. It is common for people to scan channels when commercial broadcasters switch from a show over to running commercials. The term is most commonly associated with television, where the practice became common with the wide availability of the remote control. The first published use of the term is November 1986, in an article by The Wall Street Journal.Oxford English Dictionary The term has some connotations relating to laziness, inattentiveness, and hyperactivity. The behavior itself may also suggest attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Viewers' propensity to channel surf was apparently a factor leading toward the current ATSC standard for terrestrial television, digital television in North America. An ATSC signal can be locked onto and start being decoded within about one second, while it can take several seconds to begin decoding a Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) signal.  Zappers  Zappers are, according to media scholar Henry Jenkins, people who have a casual relationship with their televisions. Zappers do not remain on one channel for long, but continually skip from show to show, stopping for only a few minutes at a time on a particular channel. Jenkins, H. (2006). Convergence Culture, New York: New York University Press.  History  Referred to in Henry Jenkins' book, Convergence Culture, published in 2006, describes individuals who \\"constantly flit across the dial‚Äîwatching snippets of shows rather than sitting down for a prolonged engagement\\" (Jenkins 2006:75). More of a tendency than a defining characteristic, zappers can fluctuate from the habit, depending on what is on at any given time, personal feelings toward a show, amongst other variables. The concept was overstated in the 1990s when Phillip Swann \\"wrote in TV.com: How Television is Shaping Our Future: ‚ÄòFew viewers today can sit through an entire program without picking up the remote and checking out another channel . . . Today‚Äôs viewer needs constant gratification: If she‚Äôs not entertained or intrigued for any stretch of time, she will flip the dial'\\" (Jenkins 2006:75).  Media implications  After Initiative Media published its magazine The Initiative declaring that loyal fans are more valuable than zappers, television networks attempted to combat the zapper by increasing the personal appeal of their television shows, converting a zapper into a loyal fan (Jenkins 2006:75). This has led to a movement to slow down the zapper. Reality television has been suggested to be this bridge from zapper to loyal fan, being \\"built up of 'attractions,' short, highly emotionally charged units that can be watched in or out of sequence\\" (Jenkins 2006:77). American Idol is one such show, as it is \\"designed to pull in every possible viewer and to give each a reason not to change the channel\\" (Jenkins 2006:77). This technique has been perfected in American Idol via the cliffhanger commercial breaks and ending, convincing viewers to \\"stay tuned following these messages\\" or watch the show the next time it airs (Jenkins 2006:77). Zapping TV shows The format or genre was pioneered with the Italian tv show Blob, and was an instant great success. It was first broadcast on April 17, 1989, and shortly after adopted by CanalPlus in France with Le Zapping. Canal Plus will then spread the format to other EU countries.(2008) ‚ÄòZapping‚Äô: reaping the rewards of other people‚Äôs productions , Translation: Kate Stansfield, 18/11/08  France  * Le Zapping (Since September 1989) * Le Grand zapping de l'humour * Toutes les t√©l√©s du monde * Le Zapping de Tele7  Germany  * Premiere Zapping (from 1993 to 2006) Italy *Blob (Since April 1989) Poland *≈Åapu Capu Spain *Alguna pregunta m√©s? * Top Trending Tele  See also  *Scanner (radio)  References  External links  * The Initiative.

Background Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan assumed command of Union forces in western Virginia in June 1861. On June 27, he moved his divisions from Clarksburg south against Lt. Col. John Pegram's Confederates, reaching the vicinity of Rich Mountain on July 9. Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris's Union brigade marched from Philippi to confront Brig. Gen. Robert S.

Half escaped to Beverly and on over the Shawnee Trail, but Pegram and the others (including the \\"Sydney Boys\\", a regiment formed from the students of Hampden-Sydney College) surrendered on July 13. Aftermath Hearing of Pegram's defeat, Garnett abandoned Laurel Hill. The Federals pursued, and, during fighting at Corrick's Ford on July 13, Garnett was killed; he was the first general officer to be killed in the war.Kennedy, p. 8. On July 22, McClellan was ordered to Washington, and Rosecrans assumed command of Union forces in western Virginia.

The Acts of Barnabas is a non-canonical pseudepigraphical Christian work that claims to identify its author as John Mark, the companion of Paul the Apostle, as if writing an account of Barnabas, the Cypriot Jew who was a member of the earliest church of Jerusalem; through the services of Barnabas, the convert Saul was welcomed into the apostolic community. Three pseudepigraphical works are linked with the name of Barnabas: the Epistle of Barnabas, written between AD 70 and 135, this Acts and the medieval text Gospel of Barnabas.None of them have been accepted into the biblical canon.  Text  The language and the ecclesiastical politics of Acts of Barnabas reveal it to be a work of the 5th century, designed to strengthen the claims of the church of Cyprus to apostolic foundation as the site of Barnabas' grave, and therefore of its bishops' independence from the patriarch of Antioch. These are 5th century concerns, the independence of the Church of Cyprus having been declared by the First Council of Ephesus in 431 and confirmed by Emperor Zeno in 488.  Content  The text speaks of the multiple travels of Barnabas and Paul of Tarsus through the first Christian communities in Asia Minor and in Cyprus, full of miracles and preaching to the pagans, and adds the church foundations, the consecration of bishops and the tomb of the apostle in Cyprus. The first two chapters contain a preface by the inscribed author John (in chapter 3 identified as John Mark), who will tell the whole story in the first person. In the next two chapters John Marcos and Bernab√© is sent by visions on his missionary trips. In chapter 5, the story takes on the \\"itinerary style\\" of Acts of the Apostles and Acts of Paul: > After he instructed me on these things, we stayed in Iconium for many days. > [‚Ä¶] Then we arrived in Seleucia, and after the three-day stay we sailed to > Cyprus. [...] Departing from Cyprus, we landed in Perge of Pamphylia. Then I > stayed there for about two months, wanting to sail to the western regions, > but Holy Spirit wouldn't let me. So I went back to see the apostles and, > knowing that they were in Antioch, I went to them. Chapters 6 through 10 contain an elaborate version of the controversy between Barnabas and Paul reported in Acts 15: 36-41. John Mark begs Paul to go to Pamphylia. In two points of view Paul is warned that he will let Barnabas go to Cyprus, and he himself ordered him to travel to Jerusalem. The rest of the book can be seen as an extension of Acts 15,39. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/search=Hechos%2015&version;=RVR1960 John and Barnabas visit Isaura, Cilicia, Cyprus and Laodiceia, where they cure many sick people and baptize. (Acts of Barnabas 11 and 12). The figure of John Mark seems to have been consciously debased in the Acts of Barnabas. There is a tradition behind the text where he is commissioned as an apostle and charged with mysteries (whatever that really means) in a heavenly revelation. The tradition that John Mark introduced Christianity to Alexandria is attested from at least the beginning of the 4th century. It is said that Mark was sent to Egypt and preached the Gospel (which he also wrote) for the first time there, and founded the first church in Alexandria 59. It is said that seven years before his martyrdom he traveled to Marmarica and Libya. http://www.baptists.net/history/2011/11/27-mark-the-evangelist/ The Martyrs Mirror: 77-78.name = Martyrs Van Braght, Thieleman J. (1660) This tradition is elaborated in the Martyrdom of Mark and in the Acts of Mark. It is also notable that the Acts of Barnabas never identify John Mark with the writer or the Gospel who uses his name, but pays special attention to Gospel of Matthew, referring to the links between his author and Bernab√©. And the book ends:The travels and martyrdom of the saint Apostle Barnabas were thus accomplished by the grace of God. https://caminodigital.net/estudio-sobre-el-libro-apocrifo- hechos-y-martirio-de-bernabe/  The Acts of Barnabas , the Gospel of Barnabas and the Gospel of Matthew  Some have mistakenly assumed that the reference to a Gospel used by Barnabas referred to in the Acts of Barnabas was the medieval document, the Gospel of Barnabas However, this is clearly false, as the quote reveals: Barnabas, having unrolled the Gospel, which we have received from Matthew, his collaborator, began to teach the Jews. By omitting this emphasized phrase when quoting this passage, one may give the impression that there is a Gospel of Barnabas preceding the so-called Decretum Gelasianum, an agenda for those who would maintain the authenticity of the gospel late.

The battle resulted in a Union strategic victory that contributed to the eventual Confederate withdrawal from western Virginia, which in turn led to the creation of the State of West Virginia two years later. The battle took its name from a former settlement, which was named after the local Carnefix family. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=The battle In late August 1861, Confederate forces under Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd crossed the Gauley River and surprised the 7th Ohio Infantry under Col. Erastus Tyler at Kessler's Cross Lanes. Outnumbered, Tyler's inexperienced men routed, and Floyd camped near Carnifex Ferry. The Confederates began throwing up entrenchments on the Henry Patteson farm (located on the rim of the Gauley River Canyon near Summersville). Concerned about Floyd's drive to reclaim the Kanawha Valley, Union Brigadier General William S. Rosecrans led three brigades of infantry southward from Clarksburg to support Tyler's regrouped regiment. Moving into position on the afternoon of September 10, Rosecrans advanced against Floyd's campsite and attacked. The Confederate lines repulsed the attacks and the Federal casualties were significantly higher than the defenders. The strength of Rosecrans's artillery proved to be problematic however, and Floyd decided to retreat that night across the ferry to the south side of the Gauley River. He subsequently moved eastward to Meadow Bluff near Lewisburg. Floyd, seeking to deflect the blame, placed the responsibility for the defeat on his co- commander Brigadier General Henry A. Wise, furthering the dissension that marked the Confederate high command in western Virginia. Battlefield preservation In October 1935, the battlefield was preserved as Carnifex Ferry Battlefield State Park.

It was the first battle of the Civil War in which Robert E. Lee led troops into combat. During the battle, Lee attempted to surround the Union garrison atop Cheat Mountain, but the attack was never launched, due to false information from prisoners and poor communications among the various Confederate commands. Background Starting in May 1861, Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan advanced from Ohio into the western region of Virginia, both to protect Ohio and Pennsylvania from invasion from Confederate troops and to help the pro-Union government of West Virginia located in Wheeling defeat Confederate incursions from eastern Virginia. Following his victory at Rich Mountain, McClellan was transferred to command the Army of the Potomac, leaving Brig. Gen. William Rosecrans in command of western Virginia. Rosecrans concentrated his forces to protect the major transportation lines in the region. Brig. Gen. Joseph J. Reynolds was left in command of the Cheat Mountain district, defending the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike with four regiments totaling 1,800 men. One regiment, the 14th Indiana commanded by Col. Nathan Kimball, defended Fort Milroy on Cheat Mountain, while the remaining three were at Camp Elkwater near the Tygart Valley River, where Reynolds established his headquarters.Newell, p. 218; Lesser, pp. 134‚Äì35. Gen. Robert E. Lee was sent to western Virginia by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to coordinate the various Confederate forces in the region and regain lost Confederate territory. He arrived at the camps of the Army of the Northwest, commanded by Brig. Gen. William W. Loring, near the end of July; although he did not replace Loring, Lee did issue orders through him.Lesser, p. 159‚Äì60. After personally scouting the area around the Union positions, Lee devised a strategy that included a two-pronged simultaneous attack against Kimball's position on the summit of Cheat Mountain and against Reynolds's camp. The plan used Loring's Army of the Northwest, which was divided into six brigades for the battle. Brig. Gen. Henry R. Jackson's brigade would create a diversion in front of Fort Milroy while Colonel Albert Rust's brigade would make the main assault on the fort and Brig. Gen. Samuel Anderson's brigade would capture the turnpike west of the fort; Brig. Gen. Daniel Donelson and Col. Jesse S. Burke would seize the paths behind Camp Elkwater, with Col. William Gilham's brigade in reserve. Loring was given command of Burke's and Gilham's brigades during the battle.Newell, pp. 224‚Äì25; Lesser, p. 164‚Äì65, 195. Opposing forces=Union West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments. Confederate Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas infantry regiments. Battle Map of Cheat Mountain Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The approaches by each of the three Confederate brigades were uncoordinated. Rain, fog, mountainous terrain, and a dense forest limited visibility to minimal distances. As a result, each of the three Confederate brigades assigned to attack Cheat Summit Fort acted independently and never made contact with either of the other two Confederate brigades. The Union defenders on Cheat Summit were very familiar with the terrain and mountain trails. Information from captured Federal soldiers was so misleading and two Federal probing attacks from Cheat Summit Fort were so aggressive that Rust and Anderson, each leading approximately 1500 Confederates at Cheat Mountain, were convinced that an overwhelming force confronted them. Rust and Anderson withdrew their 3,000 men although they actually faced only about 300 determined Federals outside the Union fortifications. At Elk Water, Reynolds's brigade faced three more Confederate brigades but refused to budge from well-prepared entrenchments.Newell, p. 230‚Äì31. The Confederates did not press an attack after Col. John A. Washington, a member of Lee's staff, the great-grandnephew of George Washington and the last civilian owner of the first president's Mount Vernon estate, was killed during a reconnaissance of the Union right. Reynolds was so confident in the face of such timidity that he dispatched two of his own regiments from Elk Water up the mountain road to relieve the supposedly besieged fortress garrison, but the arriving Union reinforcements were unnecessary. Lee called off the attack and, after maneuvering in the vicinity, withdrew to Valley Mountain on September 17. Reynolds, meanwhile, planned an offensive against the Confederate forces stationed at the Greenbrier River.Newell, pp. 232‚Äì33. Aftermath Reynolds's forces lost a total of 88 casualties (10 killed, 14 wounded, and 64 captured); Confederate casualties were unreported, but Reynolds and Kimball claimed 100 Confederates were killed and twenty were captured. The battle had little effect on either the campaign or the war; both forces after the battle were in positions similar to their positions before the battle. In October, Lee left Cheat Mountain for Sewell Mountain (West Virginia) in the Kanawha River valley with the troops of John B. Floyd and Henry Wise, but he was forced to cancel the offensive operations he had planned because of low supplies and bad weather. Lee was recalled to Richmond on October 30 after achieving little in western Virginia.Newell, p. 262.

History Countrywide was founded in 1969 by David S. Loeb and Angelo Mozilo. Loeb died in 2003. The initial public offering was less than successful, with company stock trading over the counter at less than $1 per share. In 1985 Countrywide stock was re-listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CFC. Countrywide's stock has been described as the \\"23,000% stock\\" by Fortune magazine. Between 1982 and 2003, Countrywide delivered investors a 23,000.0% return, exceeding the returns of Washington Mutual, Walmart, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.Fortune, \\"Meet The 23,000% Stock\\", September 2003 On January 11, 2008, Bank of America announced that it planned to purchase Countrywide Financial for $4.1 billion in stock. On June 5, 2008, Bank of America Corporation announced it had received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to purchase Countrywide Financial Corporation. Then, on June 25, 2008, Countrywide announced it had received the approval of 69% of its shareholders to the planned merger with Bank of America. On July 1, 2008, Bank of America Corporation completed its purchase of Countrywide Financial Corporation. In 1997, Countrywide had spun off Countrywide Mortgage Investment as an independent company called IndyMac Bank. Federal regulators seized IndyMac on July 11, 2008, after a week-long bank run.US Lender IndyMac Collapses . Sky News. July 13, 2008. Businesses Bank of America Home Loans is composed of: *Mortgage Banking, which originates, purchases, securitizes, and services mortgages. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Mortgage Banking segment generated 59% of the company's pre-tax earnings. *Banking, which operates a federally chartered thrift that primarily invests in mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit primarily sourced through its mortgage banking operation. *Capital Markets, which operates as an institutional broker-dealer that primarily specializes in trading and underwriting mortgage-backed securities. *Global Operations, which provides mortgage loan application processing and loan servicing. Mortgage banking The Mortgage Banking segment produces mortgage loans through a variety of channels on a national scale. Nearly all of the mortgage loans the company produces in this segment are sold into the secondary market, mainly in the form of mortgage-backed securities. In 2006, 45% of those mortgages were conventional non-conforming loans, loans too large to sell to Fannie Mae. The company generally performs the ongoing servicing functions related to the mortgage loans that it produces. It also provides various loan closing services, such as title, escrow and appraisal. The Mortgage Banking segment consists of three distinct sectors: Loan Production, Loan servicing and Loan Closing Services. = Loan production = The role of Loan Production is to originate and fund new loans, and to acquire already-funded loans through purchases from other lenders. Loan Production produces mortgage loans through four divisions of Countrywide Home Loans: Consumer Markets, Full Spectrum Lending, Wholesale Lending and Correspondent Lending. Consumer Markets and Full Spectrum Lending offer loans directly to consumers. Loans produced by these two retail division are originated, funded, and sold by Countrywide. Consumer Markets offers a wide variety of products, whereas Full Spectrum Lending focuses primarily on products appropriate for customers with less than prime-quality credit. Wholesale Lending offers loans to consumers whose loans are originated by another mortgage broker. These loans are funded and sold by Countrywide, but originated by other lenders. Correspondent Lending purchases mortgage loans from other lenders, which include mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, home builders and credit unions. These loans may be sold by Countrywide to end-investors on the secondary market, but are originated and funded by other lenders. = Loan servicing = Loan servicing services loans, i.e., collects payments from the borrower, handles escrow accounts, tax and/or insurance payments (if applicable), then remits \\"advances\\" to the investor's trustee as specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA). Loan servicing typically retains a fraction of the payment made (typically 25 ‚Äì 75 basis points of the unpaid principal balance) as a \\"servicing fee\\". Loan servicing also generates income in the form of interest on monies received and held prior to paying scheduled advances to the trustee, fees charged for late payments, force-placed insurance, document requests, legal fees, payoff statements, etc. =Loan closing services= LandSafe and its subsidiaries offer loan closing services, including real estate appraisal services, automated credit reporting products, flood determination services and residential title services for the six major counties of Southern California. Banking The Banking segment consisted of Countrywide Bank, FSB and Countrywide Warehouse Lending. Formerly, the bank was known as Countrywide Bank, N.A., a nationally chartered bank that was regulated jointly by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, but it converted its charter to a federally chartered thrift that is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision.OTS Approves Countrywide ApplicationTheStreet.com : Countrywide's Thrifty Move  Banks  CFC Countrywide Bank is the 3rd largest Savings and Loan institution and is the fastest growing bank in United States history. Assets from deposits are currently approaching $125 billion. Countrywide Bank primarily originates and purchases mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit for investment purposes. The majority of these loans are sourced through its mortgage banking subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans. The Bank obtains retail deposits, primarily certificates of deposit, through the Internet, call centers and more than 200 financial centers, many of which were located in Countrywide Home Loans' retail branch offices as of April 1, 2007. Countrywide Warehouse Lending provides warehouse lines of credit to mortgage bankers, who use these funds to originate loans. These mortgage bankers are primarily customers of Countrywide Home Loans' Correspondent Lending division and the Capital Markets divisions; the mortgage bankers use warehouse lines of credit from Countrywide Warehouse Lending to help originate loans, then sell those loans to Countrywide through Correspondent Lending or Capital Markets. Capital markets The Capital Markets segment primarily operates as a registered securities broker dealer, a residential mortgage loan manager and a commercial mortgage loan originator. CFC also operates broker dealers in Japan and the United Kingdom, an introducing broker dealer of futures contracts, an asset manager and a broker of mortgage servicing rights. With the exception of its commercial mortgage activities, the company transacts only with institutional customers, such as banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, asset managers, mutual funds, pension plans, other broker dealers and governmental agencies. Customers of its commercial real estate finance business are the owners or sponsors of commercial properties, who can be individuals or institutions. Countrywide Asset Management Corporation manages the acquisition and disposition of loans from third parties, as well as loans originated by Countrywide Home Loans, on behalf of Countrywide Home Loans. These are typically delinquent or otherwise illiquid residential mortgage loans, which have primarily been originated under Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) programs. The Company attempts to rehabilitate the loans, using the servicing operations of Countrywide Home Loans, with the intent to securitize those loans that become eligible for securitization. The remaining loans are serviced through foreclosure and liquidation, which includes the collection of government insurance and guarantee proceeds relating to defaulted FHA and VA program loans. Securities trading activities include the trading of debt securities in the secondary market after the original issuance of the security. Underwriting activities encompass the assumption of the risk of buying a new issue of securities from the issuer and reselling the securities to investors, either directly or through dealers. Capital Markets primarily underwrites mortgage- related debt securities. Insurance The Insurance segment activities include offering property, casualty, life and credit insurance as an underwriter and as an insurance agency, and providing reinsurance coverage to primary mortgage insurers, through two business units: Balboa Life and Casualty Operations, and Balboa Reinsurance Company. Balboa Life and Casualty Group underwrite property, casualty, life and credit insurance in all 50 states. Its products include Lender-Placed Property and Auto, which includes lender-placed auto insurance and lender-placed, real-property hazard insurance; Voluntary Homeowners and Auto, which underwrites retail homeowners insurance and home warranty plans for consumers, and Life and Credit, which underwrites term life, credit life and credit disability insurance products. Balboa Reinsurance Company provides a mezzanine layer of reinsurance coverage for losses between minimum and maximum specified amounts to the insurance companies that provide private mortgage insurance (PMI) on loans in its servicing portfolio. It provides this coverage with respect to substantially all of the loans in the Company's portfolio that are covered by PMI, which generally includes all conventional loans with an original loan amount in excess of 80% of the property's appraised value. In return for providing this coverage, it earns a portion of the PMI premiums. Global operations The primary activities of the Global Operations segment was Global Home Loans (GHL): a UK third party administrator (TPA) formed out of a joint venture between Countrywide and Woolwich plc in 1998. Activities included Loan Processing and Subservicing, providing mortgage loan application processing and mortgage loan subservicing in the United Kingdom. Following the acquisition of Woolwich by Barclays plc, this relationship developed further, with GHL acquiring the Barclays mortgage portfolio, through a transfer of ownership of the Barclays mortgage operation in Leeds to GHL in 2003. By 2005, GHL operation processed more than ¬£11.3 billion ($20.3 billion) in loans, all of which are subserviced for Barclays, PLC, the joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2005, Global's subservicing portfolio was ¬£59 billion ($102 billion). In November 2005, Barclays announced that it intended to terminate the third party administration arrangement with GHL and bring the mortgage originations and servicing operations back in-house. This resulted in Countrywide buying out Barclays' remaining 30% stake in GHL. Barclays brought the operation back in-house in February 2006. Since then Global's presence in the UK has been confined to providing support to Barclays and Prudential Assurance, who continue to use the proprietary originations, servicing and arrears processing systems developed for GHL and Countrywide by Countrywide Technology Group (CWTG). A second venture in the UK, Valuation Services, provided one of the first electronic residential property valuation services to third parties in the United Kingdom through a majority-owned joint venture. This was sold to First American in 2007. Offshore Services commenced operations in India in 2004. Set up to exploit the strategic advantage of employing systems specialists based in the sub-continent, it provides business process and technology services to the Parent Company and its subsidiaries in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Controversies= Employee and contract labor issues  In 2003, Countrywide was the subject of a class- action lawsuit alleging overtime violations. Countrywide was charged with working employees 10‚Äì15 hours per day, 6 to 7 days per week without compensating them for overtime wages. The lawsuit was settled in May 2005, with the payment of $30 million in compensation to 400 account executives.Countrywide to Settle Rosemead Call Center Employees Class Action Additionally, Countrywide is one of many companies that conducts in-depth background searches of new employee applicants. The background search goes beyond typical employment, education, and criminal history searches, and enables a company to view the applicant's credit, and public record documents such as lawsuits and divorce records. Although it must be authorized by the applicant, Countrywide explicitly does not consider applicants who deny authorization for a search. This policy has led to otherwise qualified applicant complaints and dispute filings which claim this policy is discriminatory, invasive, and compromises the applicant's privacy. Countrywide maintains a policy of not filing the legally required Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 to independent brokers. The validity of this is questionable however. Minority and subprime borrowers Countrywide agreed to a settlement with New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer to compensate black and Hispanic borrowers improperly steered by Countrywide salespeople to higher-cost loans. The company also agreed to improve training and oversight of its loan officers and to pay New York state $200,000 to cover costs of the investigation. Countrywide subprime documents show a policy of lending to families with as little as $1000 of disposable income, often compromising their ability to pay living expenses. Economist Stan Liebowitz writes that the Fannie Mae Foundation singled out Countrywide Financial as a \\"paragon\\" of a nondiscriminatory lender who works with community activists, following \\"the most flexible underwriting criteria permitted.\\" The chief executive of Countrywide is said to have bragged that in order to approve minority applications, \\"lenders have had to stretch the rules a bit.\\" Countrywide's commitment to low-income loans had grown to $600 billion by early 2003. Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Rita complaints Some customers have complained that after the devastating hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Rita, Countrywide told loan customers in the affected areas that they could take a break on payments without any late fees, and the payments would be added back to the end of the loan. They now contend that Countrywide forced the loan customers to pay the missed payments in a lump sum, along with late fees they were told they did not have to pay, within 30 days or face foreclosure.The Blotter: A Deal Too Good To Be True?: Katrina Victims Say Mortgage Lender Misled Them \\"Friends of Angelo\\" VIP program In June 2008 Conde Nast Portfolio reported that numerous Washington D.C. politicians over recent years had received mortgage financing at noncompetitive rates because the corporation considered the officeholders \\"FOA's\\" ‚Äî \\"Friends of Angelo\\" (Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo). The politicians extended such favorable financing included the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and Kent Conrad.

Johnson announced he would step down from the vice-presidential vetting position on June 11, 2008 in order to avoid being a distraction to Obama's campaign. In June 2008 The Wall Street Journal reported that Franklin Raines, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, received below market rates loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation also considered him an \\"FOA\\". He received loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae.Countrywide Friends Got Good Loans On July 16, 2008, The Washington Post reported that Franklin Raines had \\"taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.\\" Subsequent attempts to connect Obama's campaign with Franklin Raines were characterized by The Washington Post as \\"a stretch\\".  Lawsuits The office of Attorney General of Illinois, Lisa Madigan, filed a civil lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court against Countrywide Financial Corporation on June 25, 2008. The lawsuit cites information gathered from documents obtained via a subpoena in the fall of 2007. Madigan's office claims the \\"mortgage lender engaged in \\"unfair and deceptive\\" practices to get homeowners to apply for risky mortgages far beyond their means.\\" California Attorney General, Jerry Brown, followed suit by filing a similar lawsuit on June 25, 2008, accusing the lender of breaking the state's laws against false advertising and unfair business practices. The lawsuit also claims the defendant mislead many consumers by misinforming them about the workings of certain mortgages such adjustable-rate mortgages, interest-only loans, low-documentation loans and home-equity loans while telling borrowers they would be able to refinance before the interest rate on their loans adjusted. In August 2008, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal also brought suit against Countrywide, alleging that deceptive lending practices had ripped off Connecticut homeowners. The suit was settled in October 2008 after Bank of America acquired Countrywide. The settlement involves the modifying of troubled 'predatory loans' up to $8.4 billion. The states currently involved in the settlement are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. Other states may also join the settlement.\\"BofA to pay $8 billion over subprime suit\\",'MSNBC', October 6, 2008 There is also a shareholder class action lawsuit for investors in asset-backed securities from Countrywide.Countrywide Mortgage-Backed Securities Certificate Investor Lawsuit. Shareholders Foundation.  Subprime mortgage crisis =Secondary market disruption When Countrywide finances mortgage loans, they usually packaged them for sale to large investors as mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac can only buy loans which conform to the standards of government-sponsored enterprises. Non-conforming mortgages securities must be sold in the private, secondary market to alternative investors. On August 3, 2007, this secondary market essentially stopped trading most of the non- conforming securities. Secondary mortgage market disruptions had happened previously, but, the new disruption appeared more serious, both larger in range and likely duration. Alt-A mortgages (loans given to apparently creditworthy borrowers without much or any documentation) completely stopped at ratings lower than AAA. Difficulties extended to much of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities. Only securities with conforming mortgages were trading. Countrywide Financial issued a statement that its mortgage business has access to a nearly $50 billion funding cushion. After the collapse of American Home Mortgage on August 6, 2007, attention returned to Countrywide Financial which at the time had issued about 17% of all mortgages in the United States. Only days later, Countrywide Financial disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that these disruptions in the secondary mortgage markets could hurt it financially: > Since the company is highly dependent on the availability of credit to > finance its operations, disruptions in the debt markets or a reduction in > our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our earnings and > financial condition, particularly in the short term‚Ä¶ Current conditions in > the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased credit risk > premiums for certain market participants.

There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be > successful in these efforts, that such facilities will be adequate or that > the cost of debt will allow us to operate at profitable levels. This raised speculation that Countrywide was a potential bankruptcy risk. On August 10, a run on the bank began as the secondary mortgage market shut down, curtailing new mortgage funding. The perceived risk of Countrywide bonds rose. Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's credit ratings agencies downgraded Countrywide 1 or 2 grades, some to near junk status. The cost of insuring its bonds rose 22% overnight. This also limited its access to commercial paper. Some institutional investors admitted trying to sell Countrywide paper. Fifty other mortgage lenders had already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Countrywide Financial was cited as a possible bankruptcy risk by Merrill Lynch and others on August 15. This combined with news that its ability to issue new commercial paper might be severely hampered put severe pressure on the stock. Its shares fell $3.17 to $21.29, which was its biggest fall in a single day since the crash of 1987 ‚Äì the shares had fallen 50% so far that year. On August 15, 2007, Merrill Lynch advised its clients to sell their stock in Countrywide. Announcement of problems and bailouts On Thursday, August 16, 2007, the company expressed concerns over liquidity because of the decline of the secondary market for securitized mortgage obligations. Countrywide also announced its intent to draw on the entire $11.5 billion credit line from a group of 40 banks including JPMorgan Chase. SEC Accession No. 0000950148-07-000204, Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant, SEC, August 16, 2007 On Friday August 17, many depositors sought to withdraw their bank accounts. Countrywide also planned to make 90% of its loans conforming. By this point stock shares had lost about 75% of their peak value and speculation of bankruptcy broadened. At the same time the Federal Reserve Bank lowered the discount rate 0.5% in a last-minute, early morning conference call. The Fed accepted about $17.2 billion in repurchase agreements for mortgage backed securities to aid in liquidity. This also helped calm the stock market and investors promptly responded positively with the Dow posting gains.Temporary Open Market Operations Federal Reserve Bank of New York Additionally, the firm was forced to restate income it had claimed from accrued but unpaid interest on \\"exotic\\" mortgages where the initial pay rate was less than the amortization rate. In 2007 it became apparent much of this interest had become uncollectable. High-risk mortgages become toxic mess AP via yahoo In a letter dated August 20, Federal Reserve agreed to waive banking regulations at the request of Citigroup and Bank of America. The Fed agreed to exempt both banks from rules that limited the amount that federally insured banks can lend to related brokerage companies to 10% of bank capital. Response to request for exemption to section 23A of Regulation W (pdf), Federal Reserve Bank Board of Governors. Until then, banking regulation was that banks with federally insured deposits should not be put at risk by brokerage subsidiaries' activities. On August 23, Citibank and Bank of America said that they and two other banks accessed $500 million in 30-day financing at the Fed's discount window. The same day, Countrywide Financial obtained $2 billion of new capital from Bank of America Corp. For this the Bank of America brokerage arm would get convertible preferred stock. On November 26, 2007, Countrywide stock was hammered on the NYSE, dropping over 10% to a level of $8.64/share; less than half the share's value in August when the firm faced bankruptcy rumors and a fraction of its value in 2006.CFC: Basic Chart for COUNTRYWIDE FNL CP ‚Äì Yahoo! Finance One proximate cause were reports that the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank had extended a large amount of its credit to Countrywide to offset its inability to raise funds in the private market. Senator Chuck Schumer called for an investigation as to the prudence of the FHLBB's action in this regard. From 2005 to 2007, Angelo R. Mozilo sold much of his CFC stock realizing $291.5 million in profits. A class action suit was filed on behalf of shareholders alleging securities violations. In September 2008, Countrywide sent letters to its mortgage customers to inform that one of their employees had stolen identity information that contained social security numbers and birth dates. Countrywide apologized in the letter and offered free credit monitoring for 90 days. 'Protect Our House' PR campaign In September 2007, after months of negative publicity and the announcement of a reduction of 20% of its workforce,\\"Countrywide to lay off 20 percent of workforce\\" The Orange County Register, September 7, 2007 Countrywide launched a public relations campaign aimed at demoralized employees. Employees were expected to sign a pledge to \\"demonstrate their commitment to our efforts\\" and \\"to tell the Countrywide story to all\\". Those who signed the pledge received a green rubber Protect Our House wristband. Takeover The endgame in Bank of America's $4 billion takeover of Countrywide Financial began with a December phone call from Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo to his Bank of America counterpart, Kenneth D. Lewis. And on January 11, 2008, Bank of America announced it had agreed to buy Countrywide for $4 billion in an all- stock transaction. The stock's value settled at about $5¬Ω per share following the announcement; it had been as low as $4.43 before the Bank of America deal was announced.CFC: Summary for COUNTRYWIDE FNL CP ‚Äì Yahoo! Finance After more than six months of financial deterioration at Countrywide‚Äîdespite a $2 billion infusion of cash from Bank of America in August‚ÄîMozilo said he was ready to throw in the towel, according to Lewis. At the same time, having watched Countrywide dramatically retool its operations in a bid to survive, Bank of America executives began to believe Countrywide's big U.S. mortgage business might be worth having. > The ability to get that kind of size and scale became more appealing as we > saw the business model change to a model we could accept,\\" Lewis said. \\"We > considered the lawsuits, the negative publicity that Countrywide had. We > weighed the short-term pain versus what we think will be a very good deal > for our shareholders. Bank of America deployed 60 analysts from its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to Countrywide's headquarters in Calabasas, Calif. After four weeks analyzing Countrywide's legal and financial predicament, and modeling how its loan portfolio was likely to perform, Bank of America offered an all-stock deal valued at $4 billion for Countrywide‚Äîa fraction of the company's $24 billion market value a year ago. Countrywide shareholders approved the deal on June 25, 2008 and it closed July 2, 2008. Bank of America announced on June 26, 2008 that the takeover of Countrywide Financial Corp. will result in the loss of 7,500 jobs over the next two years. The deal was a landmark in the housing crisis, given Countrywide's prominence as the nation's largest mortgage lender, at the time. It was to prove more costly to Bank of America, however, than was perceived at the time: in August 2014, Bank of America was forced to agree to a near-$17 billion deal to settle claims against it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities, a large percentage of which had been sold by Countrywide.  SEC charges  On June 4, 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged former CEO Angelo Mozilo with insider trading and securities fraud, and former COO David Sambol and former CFO Eric Sieracki with securities fraud for failing to disclose Countrywide's lax lending standards in Countrywide's 2006 annual report. Despite these charges, Countrywide, and then its successor Bank of America, were awarded the Property Management contract with the Veterans Administration. A July 22, 2008 memo from Judith Caden, VA Director of Loan Guaranty Service issued this proclamation in Circular 26-08-10. Bank of America still retained this position with VA until 2011.

Background In mid-September 1861 Confederate troops established Camp Bartow in the Cheat Mountain Area. The Confederates, under the command of General William B. Taliaferro, had the advantage of knowing the land but their numbers were greatly reduced due to sickness. Taiaferro had reported that his army had been reduced to one-third strength. A map of the battle, drawn by A.T. McRae of the Quitman Guards, 1st Regiment Georgia Volunteers Controlling the Union forces in Cheat Mountain and Tygart's Valley was General Joseph J. Reynolds. Reynolds‚Äô army's spirits had been heartened due to their success in repelling General William W. Loring's troops. Reynolds believed that he would be able to defeat Taliaferro and clear the mountain for a quick route to Virginia. For two days it rained non-stop and due to the cold weather both troops lost men. Opposing forces=Union Reynolds' army was composed of: the 24th Ohio Infantry; 25th Ohio Infantry; and the 32nd Ohio Infantry; the 7th Indiana Infantry, 9th Indiana Infantry, 13th Indiana Infantry, 14th Indiana Infantry, 15th Indiana Infantry and the 17th Indiana Infantry; the 4th U.S. Light Artillery, Battery G, Cpt Albion P. Howe; Loomis' Michigan Battery; Battery \\"A\\" West Virginia Light Artillery, Captain Philip Daum; and with parts of Robinson's Ohio Cavalry; Greenfield's Pennsylvania Cavalry, and Brackens' Indiana Rangers. Reynolds had about 5,000 men of different arms, infantry, cavalry and artillery. Confederate Jackson's army consisted of the 1st Georgia Infantry (Ramsey's) and 12th Georgia Infantry, under command of Colonel Edward Johnson; the 23rd Virginia Infantry, 44th Virginia Infantry and a battalion of the 25th Virginia Infantry, commanded by Colonel William B. Taliaferro; 3rd Arkansas Infantry, 31st Virginia Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel Hansbrough's battalion, under command of Colonel Albert Rust; Anderson's and Shumaker's Batteries, and a part of the Churchville Cavalry under Captain Sterrett. And about nine miles away, Colonel John B. Baldwin was stationed with the 52nd Virginia. Battle Map of Greenbrier River Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Reynolds troops began to move at midnight on October 2, 1861 and by daylight they entered Greenbrier, roughly four miles from the Confederate camp. At 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning the Confederate soldiers guarding the camp left their posts and the Union soldiers entered the Confederate camp. Upon opening fire, the Confederate Army was having trouble working their weapons and while they were trying to fix them they were forced to move out into the open due to the Union armies significant firepower. When Colonel John B.Baldwin, who was in charge of the 52nd Virginia Infantry, heard the gunshots he immediately left camp with all of his men and went to help the Confederates. By the time they reached the battlefield they thought it was too late, but when the Union army saw more men coming they continued to fire and the battle continued for approximately five more hours. Reynolds ordered his troops to return to Cheat Mountain breaking off the battle. Aftermath After the battle was finished both sides realized the losses were not great. In an attempt to appear superior both the Union and the Confederates increased the enemies losses and both reported that they had lost around three-hundred men. When the results were calculated the Union had eight men killed and thirty-five men wounded. The Confederates had lost six men, had thirty-three wounded, and thirteen men missing. The result of the Battle of Greenbrier River was inconclusive. Battlefield Preservation The Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike Alliance received a $46,000 grant from the National Park Service to develop community consensus and a preservation plan for the future of the Greenbrier River/Camp Bartow site. The preservation partner will seek community support for this plan, and will address the future of the Camp Bartow Historic District. In the fall of 2016, in conjunction with the American Battlefield Trust and its partners, the West Virginia Land Trust acquired that preserve the core of the battlefield.

It is the administrative centre of the eponymous Lom Municipality. The town is north of Sofia, southeast of Vidin, north of Montana and west of Kozloduy. It is the second most important Bulgarian port on the Danube after Rousse. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 24,300. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - Bulgarian towns in 2009 History=Antiquity and Middle Ages Lom was founded by the Thracians under the name of Artanes in Antiquity. After the Romans called the fortress and the town Almus, from where the name of the today's city and of the Lom River comes. There are no reports proving that there existed a big settlement in the Middle Ages. It was not until Ottoman rule that it enlarged but for a long time it was under the shadow of the dominant towns of Vidin, Nikopol and Silistra. It is assumed that the Ottoman village was founded in 1695 by Kara Mustafa and Murad Bey, who were defeated at Vienna in 1683 and who came here sailing rafts along the Danube. Ottoman rule and Bulgarian National Revival The name Lom Palanka was mentioned for the first time in 1704. The settlement then called Palanka stood between village and town in size and importance. In 1798 Lom suffered from brigand raids. With the development of shipping along the Danube after 1830, the importance of the town grew. The road to Sofia contributed to its progress and turned it into a main export port to Vienna (Austria). By 1869 there were 120 shops, 148 trade offices, 175 food shops, 34 coffee bars, six hotels and two mills. The town was centred on the old Kale (fortress), which was entered through three kapii (gates) ‚Äî Vidinska, Belogradchishka, Sofiyska. The tradesmen from Lom offered goods at the biggest fairs in the region and beyond. In 1880 there were 7,500 inhabitants in the town. Lom is proud of its traditions from the period of the Bulgarian National Revival. During the national revival, the first community centre in Bulgaria (1856) was founded in the town, the first women's society in the country was also established in 1858 and one of the first theatre performances took place in the town. Krastyu Pishurka, a noted educator, also worked in Lom. Until the Second World War it was a major market town. In 1943, the Bulgarian government transported several thousand Jewish captives from Bulgarian-occupied territory in Greece and Yugoslavia to Lom to be embarked on boats bound for Vienna in Nazi Germany, from where they were taken to be exterminated in Treblinka. Lom was the main hub for the first deportations of victims of the Holocaust from the Axis- aligned Balkans. After 1944 the industry developed ‚Äî sugar factory, can factory, grain industry.

Taylors Lakes recorded a population of 15,519 at the . Taylors Lakes is bounded by the Calder Freeway in the north, Overnewton Road and Taylors Creek in the east, Lady Nelson Way in the south and the Bendigo railway line in the west. The suburb is mostly composed of recent developments dating from the 1990s, with Taylors Lakes Post Office opening on 18 August 1994. One of Keilor's earliest settlers was Scotsman William Taylor, who built the Overnewton homestead in 1849. Taylors Creek was named after him. This in turn gives the name of the suburb. There are many available facilities in Taylors Lakes, such as shopping centres, cinemas, bowling alley, schools, a train station, bus lines, parks and gardens, sports grounds, roads, houses and kindergartens. Recreational Club Taylors Lakes is home to the Taylors Lakes Recreational Club, which includes the Taylors Lakes Football Club competing in the Essendon District Football League, Taylors Lakes Cricket Club, Taylors Lakes Basketball Club, Taylors Lakes Tennis Club and Gardening Club. Transport The suburb is serviced by trains on the Sunbury line many of which terminate at Watergardens Station, and a number of connecting bus services to local areas. In 2007 a Victorian Department of Infrastructure survey revealed that the Sydenham line registered the biggest increase in passenger numbers, up 25%. In 2006, the Sydenham line was one of only three lines that operated above the passenger load limit. The Victorian Government has plans to add extra tracks on the service. The Taylors Creek Trail runs along Taylors Creek and provides ready access to Watergardens Town Centre and Watergardens Station. A handful of bus lines run throughout the Taylors Lakes district.

The battle was a small brigade-level conflict, and while the Confederates technically won with a Union withdrawal, it was considered militarily indecisive. However, it had critical implications for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and would not be involved in the formation of the future state of West Virginia.https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped- destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb- bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt;=gal&pos;=1 Background In December, Confederate forces under Col. Edward Johnson occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly 4,400 feet above sea level) to defend the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike that offered a point of access from the mountains of western Virginia into the strategic Shenandoah Valley. This was called the \\"Monterey Line,\\" named for the village behind them in Highland County.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4962441/account-of-battle-of-camp- allegheny/ The occupation of the high mountain pass coincided with a bitter winter, with much suffering and disease among the Southern troops.https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/CampAlleghenyConfederateOutpost/ Early Union victories in what is now West Virginia had solidified control in much of the western mountains of Virginia, emboldening a Union move to take the Staunton to Petersburg Pike.https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil- war/battles/camp-allegheny Perhaps thinking that Confederate morale was low,https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191 a Union brigade of 2,000 men under Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy attacked Johnson and his 1,200 Confederates at sunrise on December 13. Battle Milroy's advance and a Confederate scouting party had skirmished on December 12. The next morning, Milroy divided his troops into a two pronged attack to flank the Confederate camp. The first column advanced up the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike, engaging the Confederate right side for several hours before withdrawing. Because of the difficult mountain terrain, the second Union column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column, therefore unable to support the main body of Union troops on the right as planned,https://www.mycivilwar.com/battles/611213.html but then attacked the Confederate left. When the left column of Union forces arrived, an officer believed that they were his own pickets returning, ordered his men not to fire and rode forth to bring them into the camp. The Confederate officer was killed by a shot from the Union troops, and the second part of the battle commenced with fierce fighting. After the right Union column had withdrawn, Johnson ordered all his troops who had been fighting there to join the battle on the left flank, and the concentrated Confederate fire broke up the left Union assault and the final Union troops withdrew. Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. In a piercing winter wind, fighting had raged for much of the sunlit morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy's force found a position in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to dislodge. A Confederate artillery battery unlimbered and unleashed a \\"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\\" The fighting on the right moved back and forth from advance to retreat, with the Union temporarily occupying the post, only to be driven off. The Confederates attempted their own flanking maneuvers which quickly failed because their force was too thin. The fighting was in such close quarters that the Confederate cannons in the fortification could not be used. After fighting for over seven hourshttps://emergingcivilwar.com/2012/11/24/a-historians-stroll-across-camp- allegheny/ without taking the positionMilroy's troops withdrew, retreating to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson claimed the Confederate losses were 20 men killed and 96 wounded and 28 missing. According to one Confederate soldier in the 52nd Virginia Infantry: > I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight > without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel > Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one > point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, > swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, > driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the > bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners... Confederate units under Johnson's command during the battle were the 12th Georgia Regiment, the 52nd Virginia, the 31st Virginia, a detachment of Pittsylvania (Virginia) cavalry, which fought dismounted with carbines, and the \\"Lee Battery\\" of Virginia light artillery, consisting of four pieces.https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units- detail.htm?battleUnitCode=CVAHARDCAL Aftermath The battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the Civil War, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war (April‚ÄìDecember 1861). The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualties at 147. Johnson would receive the nickname \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountain post. Ironically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle. But the failed Union assault convinced the Confederate higher command to reinforce Johnson's force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861‚Äì62.http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle- summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html The weather was bitter snow was often knee deep, something the southern soldiers, mainly from Georgia and Virginia, were not accustomed to. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. On March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent Battle of McDowell in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson, by then promoted to General, had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable.http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf After the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that Shenandoah Mountain, 40 miles to the southeast, was a better position to defend the Staunton to Parkerburgs Pike and the approaches to the Shenandoah Valley. Combined with the loss of men in the harsh mountain winter and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, General Robert E. Lee agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862.https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny By April 6, 1862, Johnson's constructed Fort Edward Johnson at the site on Shenandoah Mountain, just 26 miles west of Staunton. However, the new fortification was soon abandoned on April 19, when Johnson left to rendezvous with the Confederate Army of Gen. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in advance of the Battle of McDowell. The battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia were small by later standards but left an enduring footprint because those counties that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny (and the subsequent Battle of McDowell,) the future state line between Virginia and West Virginia would begin and stop at the Pocohantas and Highland County line, even though the counties shared the same geographic traits and mountain culture. Neither Pocahontas County nor Highland County participated in the creation of West Virginia, but Pocahontas was included in the new state nevertheless as part of the Congressional statehood bill while Highland remained part of Virginia.Curry, Richard Orr, A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia, Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 149-151. No votes recorded for Pocahontas County.Vote Totals by County on the West Virginia State Constitution April 3, 1862 In 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \\"A Bivouac of the Dead,http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/\\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment. Bierce wrote movingly about the sacrifice and suffering of the men in this little remembered battle in a remote area, and hauntingly about how little the battlefield had changed.http://www.ambrosebierce.org/journal1owens.html  Alternate Spelling  The battle is also known as the Battle of Alleghany Camp, or the Battle of Alleghany Mountain, and Johnson was actually referred to in the South as \\"Alleghany Johnson\\", reflecting the usage that derives from the English colonial era rather than the French derivative, Allegheny. Contemporary accounts from the time in the South use the wording \\"Alleghany,\\" including Johnson's own account of the battle published in the Staunton Spectator in March 1862. Camp Allegheny Historic District The Camp Allegheny Historic District is a national historic district encompassing one contributing structure and four contributing sites.

Simon & Schuster) Victory Through Air Power is a 1942 non-fiction book by Alexander P. de Seversky. It was made into a 1943 Walt Disney animated feature film of the same name. Theories De Seversky began his military life at a young age. After serving in the Imperial Russian Navy, he received high honors and was the ace in the Navy after engaging in over 57 aerial combats. After coming to the United States, he created the Seversky Aircraft company before being forced out of the presidency of his own company in 1939. Seversky published Victory Through Air Power in 1942, and explained his theories of aviation and long-range bombing as influenced by General Billy Mitchell. Seversky argued that: #\\"The rapid expansion of the range and striking power of military aviation makes it certain that the United States will be as exposed to destruction from the air, within a predictable period, as are the British Isles today;\\" #Those who deny this possibility are exhibiting something like a \\"Maginot line mentality\\"; #The U.S. must begin preparing immediately for \\"an interhemispheric war direct across oceans;\\" #The U.S. must become the dominant air-power nation, \\"even as England in its prime was the dominant sea-power nation of the world.\\" Impact Appearing less than six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the United States' entry into World War II, the book was extremely popular, influential, and controversial. Seversky advocated the formation of an independent air force, the development of long-range bombers (meaning an intercontinental range of 3,000 miles or more) and a commitment to strategic use of air power (as opposed to its then-traditional use as cover or support for ground-based operations). His plans implicitly involved diversion of resources away from current war operations. On May 3, 1942, Fletcher Pratt reviewed the book, saying: :\\"No one has produced a more intelligent and comprehensive analysis of any feature of the world struggle. Probably nobody has written anything more truly prophetic; and no one is more wrongheaded.\\" On May 4, 1942, it appeared on the New York Times bestseller list, reaching No. 1 on the list in mid- August and staying there for four weeks. In the 10 May \\"Speaking of Books\\" column, J. D. A. bracketed it with Mein Kampf and Lieut. Col. Kernan's Defense Will Not Win the War to illustrate his point that :\\"In no other war have books played such an important part‚Ä¶ Books are not only supplying information. They are furnishing weapons for the successful prosecution of the war.\\" Its familiarity to the general public was such that it could appear in a 1943 Bugs Bunny cartoon, Falling Hare, in which the title character reads \\"Victory Thru Hare Power\\".Merrie Melodies: Falling Hare with Bugs Bunny (video, cued) Filmmaker Walt Disney read the book, and felt that its message was so important that he would personally finance a partly-animated short, also called Victory Through Air Power, which was released in July 1943. Disney's purpose for creating the film was to promote Seversky's theories to government officials and the public. After seeing the film, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt decided that Seversky knew what he was talking about, changing the course of the war. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Bear, John.

It broadcast from the Panama registered ship in international waters in the North Sea. Within months the station had a large audience due to its strong signal and continuous music mixing current records with oldies. However, insufficient advertising starved the station off the air in late 1985. In 1986 an attempt was made to return as Laser Hot Hits, but the same problems arose. The beginnings of Laser Radio A London car salesman and DJ named John Kenning convinced Philip Smyth, a wealthy Irish businessman, to fund an offshore radio station. Kenning recruited Paul Rusling, who introduced the project to Roy Lindau, who had been involved in Radio Caroline. Lindau was a marketing executive for Major Market Radio, an airtime brokerage owned by Gene Autry. He joined Laser in mid-1983 and became president of its sales company, Eurad. He left in late 1984 after disagreements over control. There were reports that the tobacco giant, Philip Morris, pulled out following pressure from European authorities, although their sponsorship of programmes continued to be announced. The team planned two stations on one ship, the music programmed via satellite from the New York offices of Music Media International. This was scaled down to a single station called Laser after early disagreements on policy. The station was built on a former hydrographic survey vessel, the Gardline Seeker, renamed Communicator. The ship was registered via a Panama-based company, Deka Overseas Inc. The plan was to use an antenna held aloft by a helium balloon - an inflatable dirigible tethered to the deck. The conversion work to install studios and transmitters was carried out in autumn 1983 by Paul Rusling at Tracor Marine in Port Everglades, Florida, and the ship sailed via the Azores and Ireland to an anchorage off the Thames Estuary. Antenna problems The early days were overshadowed by problems with the balloon aerial. Due to weather in the North Sea, several balloons were lost. The short-lived transmissions on 729 kHz could be heard in several countries but not in London due to a Radio 4 relay on the adjacent channel of 720 kHz. A change to two masts and a frequency at the bottom of the AM band (558 kHz) were effected for the station's launch in May 1984 as Laser 558. Operations The near non-stop music, \\"never more than a minute away from music\\", was in stark contrast to the 50 per cent speech imposed on UK commercial radio, and the similar proportion of talk on BBC Radio 1. The lack of advertising on Laser, plus the American DJs, resulted in a huge audience - BBC research indicated four million in the UK and a similar number on the continent. By using only American DJs and claiming supply tenders from Spain, Laser claimed to be legal. Surveillance by the UK showed Laser was supplied from Kent, and UK stations campaigned to have Laser and Caroline removed, saying the ships were \\"stealing their listeners\\". Technical information Laser played most of its music from tape cartridges as the American management wanted control over material broadcast. The former research lab at the stern of the ship was converted into two studios plus a newsroom, which contained a Kaypro 4 computer and telex link with the station's office in New York. This link was achieved initially by a COMSAT installation on the upper deck, which used Inmarsat; it could access regular telephones, although at $15 a minute. Later the ship used a private marine VHF channel to a base in Kent. The broadcast transmitters were a pair of CSI 25 kilowatt AM transmitters, built in Boca Raton, Florida. Usually only one was in use at half power, due to the limitations of tuning components in the antenna. This was an \\"inverted L\\" array running up to the top of a 100 foot high fore mast, and then across to a similar construction at the stern of the ship. Coverage was good with the \\"commercially marketable\\" core area of the signal travelling 140 miles over land, which included most of England, all of the Netherlands and Belgium and much of northern France as far as Paris. The audio quality was a little better than most other AM broadcasters in western Europe, as the equipment had been set up to modulate with frequencies up to around 8 kHz, whereas many stations in the UK for example rolled off treble frequencies at 4.5 kHz. The programme feed was modified by an audio processor made by Circuit Research Labs of Arizona, while Radio Caroline (based on another ship nearby) used an Optimod processor. Other media in the UK ran stories about who the owners might be, and in August 1984 the Evening Standard named a BBC TV journalist, Roger Parry and an Irish businessman, Philip Smyth. \\"Eurosiege\\" On 9 August 1985, the British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) chartered the Dioptric Surveyor to anchor nearby to monitor Laser and Caroline, at a reported cost of ¬£50,000 a month. It was replaced by the larger Gardline Tracker in November, a sister ship of the Communicator, which had been bought from Gardline Shipping in Great Yarmouth as the Gardline Seeker. DJs at Laser made references to the DTI vessel, poking fun at the ship and staff. They made a parody record \\"I Spy For The DTI\\" by the Moronic Surveyors. The term \\"Eurosiege\\" was coined by disc jockey Charlie Wolf. On one occasion the MV Communicator moved temporarily away from the MV Ross Revenge only to be followed by the DTI, confirming that Laser rather than Caroline was the target. Business failure The New York agency MMI failed to secure advertising although there were several underhand practices where London based agents took large payments for airtime on the station. The station attracted considerable \\"paid for play\\" advertising from UK and Dutch record companies, keen to have product heard by the 8 or 9 million listeners Laser 558 was attracting.Radio Adventures of the MV Communicator The Last Broadcast Due to the blockade and lack of funds, the MV Communicator went into port, escorted by Gardline Tracker, where it was impounded by the Admiralty Marshall on behalf of creditors, including Gardline Surveys who had sold Laser the ship, and Paul Rusling, its first engineer and coordinator who had sourced the transmitters and paid staff on behalf of the owner. The ship was offered for sale in a blind auction and, despite its cost being almost ¬£1 million two years before, was sold for around ¬£35,000. The monitoring exercise ended shortly afterwards, on 12 December 1985. The day after Laser's closure, Radio Caroline moved from 576 to 558 kHz, a clearer frequency. Laser Hot Hits The MV Communicator was bought by East Anglian Productions and left unhindered during restoration in Essex. The ship returned to international water in late 1986 and on 1 December began test transmissions as Laser Hot Hits using the 576 channel abandoned by Radio Caroline, since Caroline was still using 558. The station resumed broadcasting on 7 December. The ship had twin 25 kW transmitters and initially tests were heard with a powerful signal. Laser Hot Hits lasted less time than the original and had poorer nighttime coverage owing to the less clear channel than 558. After losing masts in a storm in January 1987 it closed temporarily, cite and closed permanently at Easter 1987. Plans to relaunch the service were plagued by financial irregularities, the ship being taken over and finally a partial sale to an American entrepreneur, James Ryan. Aftermath Charlie Wolf was from Boston, Massachusetts. He was working in Salt Lake City, Utah, when he answered an advert in Radio & Records Magazine, a weekly industry paper in the US. Wolf told friends he joined for a free trip to London. After Laser's closure he became one of the first DJs on Atlantic 252. He has worked for stations in the GWR Group (now Global Radio). He presented on TalkSport Radio (2000‚Äì2006). He married an English girl and they have one son. Charlie is now seen and heard on Sky News and the BBC's TV News Channel plus Radio Five Live, as a commentator, providing expert opinion on the Republican Party. Blake Williams went to Guam for a few years but then resided near Moriarty in New Mexico where he ran his own ranch, a small radio station in Albuquerque and worked as a film extra. Blake died in June 2017 following a severe asthma attack causing brain damage. David Lee Stone, was heard with a pre-recorded show on Hot Hits on Sundays. He joined Radio Luxembourg for a time then returned to California. David died in 1997. Jessie Brandon, who travelled on MV Communicator from Fort Lauderdale to Europe, worked for Radio Nova, Capital Radio and Radio Luxembourg. She returned to the US and worked with Simon Marks's FeatureStoryNews in Washington, DC. In 2020 she is a DJ at WCLZ in Portland Steve Masters ran a consulting business in Washington DC and in Paris France. Rick Harris left in 1985 to work on Radio Nova and then returned to the US where he works in IT. Chris Carson (Skelley) went to Rock KFMH/99 in the Davenport/Quad Cities (US), on air and helping with promotions. Erin Kelly went to WAVA in Washington DC, moving on from pop to country on WYCD-FM in Detroit under her married name Erin Weber. Currently in 2020 she's a photographer and fundraiser to many charitable causes. Manager John Catlett went on to consult for Atlantic 252 and manage Radio Luxembourg and Radio Star India. He then was the COO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He is now a broadcasting consultant in New York City. Paul Rusling worked on two more radio ship projects and then for several radio stations and organisations across Europe. In 1993 he organised Classic FM's bid for a Dutch national FM licence and then repeated this in Finland And Sweden. He then worked with Sky Radio, Virgin Radio and others on other licence applications and for Radio 10 and others on technical work. He also worked with Nozema, the Dutch state transmission company, which ran all radio transmitters in the Netherlands. John Lewis joined the station when it relaunched as Laser Hot Hits and single- handedly ran a station from the ship in October 1987 called Radio Sunk. He then joined several stations in Kent and now lives near Sandwich where he is also a crew member for the RNLI. Mike Barrington continued to work on the MV Communicator until it was sold to new owners in early 1989. He is now Head of Security at Sealand, the independent nation established on Roughs Tower, in the Thames estuary off Felixstowe. DL Bogart wrote a film script based on his time on the radio ship and hawked this around several Hollywood film companies. Most thought the story was too unbelievable and that American audiences wouldn't believe radio in Europe had ever been so primitive, so it never went beyond a screenplay stage. DL broadcasts a weekly online progressive music show called Very Heavy Uncle. A full listing of all the voices heard on Laser as DJs and newsreaders, together with their biographies and photographs, was published in the book Laser Radio Programming MV Communicator After Laser Hot Hits went off the air in 1987, MV Communicator was again impounded. This time it was stripped of studio equipment, although the transmitters and generators were intact. The ship was sold several times and impounded by the Portuguese Government in Lisbon. In 1994, when the ship was taken to the Netherlands. There she was refitted with a new 50-kilowatt transmitter and mast and broadcast programmes of Holland FM from a mooring on the IJsselmeer. The following year Communicator was sold to the Veronica Broadcasting Society, who used it to transmit a new national Dutch station - Veronica Hit Radio. When that moved to FM they sold the ship on to Quality Radio. The ship was then sold to Dave Miller's The Superstation, and taken to the Orkney Isles where she broadcast a local station on 105.4 MHz in 2004. The Superstation sold the ship for ¬£1,000 following which she was beached near St Margaret's Hope pier in Orkney and cut up for scrap. The full story of the MV Communicator's 21-year career as a radio ship was told in a new book at the end of 2016 called Radio Adventures of the MV Communicator, published by World of Radio Ltd. The book features recollections and reminisces as well as many photographs of the Communicator's crew of DJs, engineers and suppliers.WorldofRadio.co.uk A further book published in 2017 is LASER RADIO PROGRAMMING which describes how the format was devised, and how it was put into action - the hot clocks, the use of power words that sell, and other radio programming techniques.WorldofRadio.co.uk Station theme The nightly closedown song for Laser 558 and Laser Hot Hits was \\"Thank You For The Music\\" by ABBA.

Standing tall, it was the largest and southernmost of three volcanoes that formed the island Krakatoa (the others being Danan and Perboewatan) and the only one not totally destroyed in the eruption of 1883. Rakata is the last remnant of the original island prior to its destruction. However, Rakata did lose its northern half in that eruption, leaving just its southern half. The exposed cliff is quite striking visually, partially of a large exposed dike terminating in a large lenticular extrusion at the middle of the almost vertical cliff. The feature has been called \\"the Eye of Krakatoa.\\" Etymology Because the words Rakata and Krakatau are the same in Indonesian, both names are used interchangeably, leading to confusion in languages which distinguish between the two words. In geological usage, Krakatau is the island and Rakata is the main volcanic cone on that island. But Krakatau is also used for the volcanic edifice as a whole, including all four islands (Krakatau, Anak Krakatau, Verlaten and Lang) of the Krakatoa Archipelago. Before 1883 (and in many of the eruption reports), Rakata was just referred to as \\"the Peak (of Krakatau).\\" Physical features Rakata is a volcanic cone with its northern face being a vertical cliff, exposing much of its eruptive history. More than 25 extrusion dikes have been counted; the largest at the center runs from sea level to 320 meters above and terminates in a large (about 6 meters in diameter), convex form. It is not known if the two are actually related in origin or just coincidental. The 1883 eruption 1883 eruption. Rakata seems to have played a comparatively minor role in the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Some reports seem to indicate it started erupting (\\"venting\\") in late July, compared to Perboewatan starting in May and Danan in June. (Furneaux mentions an unsourced report that the Peak had collapsed sometime in July.) All eruptive centers of Krakatau have a common source, meaning that they are different vents of a single volcano. The map made by Capt. Ferzaneer from his visit on August 11 shows no eruptive \\"foci\\" from Rakata or its slopes (although there are several from the southern part of Danan), but he was not able to investigate the southern or western parts of the island due to the ash cloud blowing in that direction. In his portrayal of the catastrophe, Rogier Verbeek depicts that Rakata's northern half was destroyed, along with the central part of the island, during the largest explosion, which occurred at 10:02 am on August 27. Verbeek surmised that unlike Danan and Perboewatan, Rakata was not directly above the magma chamber, being connected only by a fissure which lay along the cleavage line of the caldera. However, examining the cliff from the air indicates two arcs, the second of which seems to be due to later (post-1883) landslides of unstable cliff material. In surveys made a few months after the catastrophe, Rakata's height is given as 830 m, compared to 820 m before, however this may be due to inaccuracy of the earlier surveys. Verbeek reports that the cleavage was approximately at the old summit. The remnant of Rakata grew rather considerably in area due to falling pumice. However, most of the increased area (largely to the west and southeast) was washed away within several years by wave action. Due to the severity of the eruption, leaving very little flora and fauna alive, Rakata has been used as a modern study on biological island colonization. Recent activity Rakata in October 2013 There are no dated reports of eruptions from Rakata since the 1883 catastrophe, although tentative datings have been made from dating ash deposits left. Subsequent activity of Krakatoa seems to be limited to the area that had been between Danan and Perboewatan, where Anak Krakatoa has arisen, starting in 1927. Rakata itself is extinct since its conduit has been virtually destroyed.

His career spanned half a century, beginning in the early 1940s and ending in 2002. His career peaked in the 1960s with large- scale adventure films and in all Annakin directed nearly 50 pictures.  Biography  Annakin was born in and grew up in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire where he attended the local grammar school. He was a trainee income tax inspector in the city of Hull. He decided to emigrate to New Zealand and travelled around the world in a variety of jobs.FILMMAKER KEN ANNAKIN'S ADVENTURES WEREN'T ALL ON SCREEN: [REGION Edition] VANCHERI, BARBARA.

He was compere and stage manager of Eugene Permanent Waving Company's roadshow, touring the Northern provinces. World War II started and Annakin was a firefighter in Soho, then joined the Royal Air Force. Documentaries Injured in the Liverpool Blitz, Annakin joined the RAF Film Unit, where he worked as a camera operator on propaganda films for the Ministry of Information and the British Council. We Serve (1942), a recruiting film for women, was directed by Carol Reed, who made Annakin his assistant director, after which Annakin directed several training films for Verity Films, a group led by Sydney Box, who was soon to become head of Gainsborough Pictures. His early documentaries included London 1942 (1942), A Ride with Uncle Joe (1943), Make Fruitful the Land (1945), We of the West Riding (1945), English Criminal Justice (1946), It Began on the Clyde (1946) and Fenlands (1946). Feature films and Gainsborough Pictures Annakin had made a number of documentaries for Sydney Box and when Box took over as head of Gainsborough Pictures he brought Annakin with him and assigned him to his first feature, Holiday Camp (1947). It was a solid hit and launched Annakin's career. Box called in Annakin to replace Michael Charlton who was directing Miranda (1948) with Glynis Johns. The resulting film was another success. Broken Journey (1948) with Phyllis Calvert was a commercial disappointment. However Quartet (1948), an anthology film based on stories by W. Somerset Maugham, for which Annakin directed one segment, was well received. Holiday Camp featured the Huggetts, a working-class family living in suburban England headed by Jack Warner and Kathleen Harrison. They were spun off into their own vehicle directed by Annakin, Here Come the Huggetts (1948) with Petula Clark, Jane Hylton, and Susan Shaw as their young daughters, Amy Veness as their grandmother and Diana Dors as their cousin. It was popular and led to Vote for Huggett (1949) and The Huggetts Abroad (1949). Associated British Annakin moved to Associated British Pictures Corporation for whom he directed Landfall (1949), a war film; and Double Confession (1950), a thriller. He did another installment for an anthology movie based on Magham stories, Trio (1950). For producer George Brown, Annakin did the comedy Hotel Sahara (1951) with Peter Ustinov and Yvonne de Carlo. Walt Disney Annakin then received an offer from Walt Disney to make The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952) with Richard Todd. He made an action film set during the Malayan Emergency, the United Artists film The Planter's Wife (1952) with Jack Hawkins and Claudette Colbert, which was a big hit in Britain. Disney reunited Annakin and Todd on The Sword and the Rose (1953), co-starring Glynis Johns; it was a commercial disappointment. Annakin made a comedy, You Know What Sailors Are (1954) then did another imperial adventure story with Hawkins, The Seekers (1954). He returned to comedy for Value for Money (1955) with John Gregson and Diana Dors, for Rank; Loser Takes All (1956) with Johns, based on a script by Graham Greene, for British Lion Films; and Three Men in a Boat (1956) with Laurence Harvey and Jimmy Edwards for Romulus Films. Three Men in a Boat was especially popular. Annakin made Across the Bridge (1957) with Rod Steiger from a story by Graham Greene. This would be Annakin's favourite film.OBITUARIES: Ken Annakin Anonymous. Hollywood Reporter; Hollywood Vol. 409, (Apr 24-Apr 26, 2009): 35. He travelled to South Africa to make another adventure story, Nor the Moon by Night (1958) for Rank with Michael Craig and Belinda Lee. Around this time he was credited as a writer on Mission in Morocco (1959), though he did not direct it. Disney called again and hired Annakin to make a mountaineering tale, Third Man on the Mountain (1959). They kept him on for Swiss Family Robinson (1960), which Walt Disney's nephew, Roy, considered \\"one of the greatest family adventure films of all time and a favourite for generations of moviegoers\\".Legacy.com It was a huge hit. Annakin returned to comedy with Very Important Person (1961) with James Robertson Justice. He travelled to South Africa once more for The Hellions (1962) with Richard Todd. Annakin did some British comedies with Leslie Phillips, Stanley Baxter and a young Julie Christie: The Fast Lady (1962) and Crooks Anonymous (1962).Ken Annakin---on a Grand Scale Los Angeles Times 24 Dec 1965: a9. Producer Annakin was hired by Darryl F. Zanuck to direct the British and (uncredited) French and American interior segments in The Longest Day (1962), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, eventually losing out to Lawrence of Arabia. Annakin then made The Informers (1963) with Nigel Patrick for Rank. On June 16, 1965, saw the release of Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. At the time it was Annakin's most ambitious project and Zanuck the head of the 20th Century-Fox Studio, endorsed the British period comedy film. In this project Annakin co- wrote, produced and directed an international ensemble cast including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, James Fox, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fr√∂be and Alberto Sordi. The story, revolving around the craze of early aviation circa 1910, is about a pompous newspaper magnate (Morley) who is convinced, by his daughter (Miles) and fianc√©e (Fox), to organize an air race from London to Paris. A large sum of money is offered to the winner, hence it attracts a variety of characters who participate. The film received favourable reviews, in which the film was described as funny, colourful and clever, and was said to have captured the early enthusiasm for aviation. It was treated as a major production, one of only three full-length 70 mm Todd-AO Fox releases in 1965 with an intermission and musical interlude part of the original screenings.\\"Director's Voice-over Commentary\\".

The film grossed $31,111,111 theatrically. Audience reaction both in first release and even today, is nearly universal in assessing the film as one of the \\"classic\\" aviation films.Hardwick & Schnepf (1989), p. 58. For its writing Annakin and Jack Davies received an Academy Award nomination. Annakin directed the big-scale war film Battle of the Bulge the same year for producer Philip Yordan and Cinerama. He started writing a follow up to Flying Machine called Monte Carlo or Bust.Annakin to Pen Auto Saga Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 25 Sep 1965: B8. He planned to make epics about the Spanish Armada, Cortez and the Indian Mutiny, and a film about martians. None of these were made. Instead he did The Long Duel (1967) in India for Rank with Yul Brynner, then The Biggest Bundle of Them All (1968) for MGM in Italy.He Wants People to Stop Laughing: No Laughs By A. H. WEILER. New York Times 22 Dec 1968: D15. This was followed by Monte Carlo or Bust (1969) for Paramount Pictures, which Annakin produced and directed from his own script and story. It was an attempt to replicate the success of Those Magnificent Men but was not as well received. Annakin continued to travel widely with his films The Call of the Wild (1972) was shot in Finland, with Charlton Heston; Paper Tiger (1975), with David Niven in Malaysia. Hollywood In 1978, Ken Annakin left Britain and moved to Los Angeles. There he made a series of films for TV: Murder at the Mardi Gras (1978), The Pirate (1978) from a novel by Harold Robbins and Institute for Revenge (1979). He travelled to Europe for The Fifth Musketeer (1979). In Hollywood he made Cheaper to Keep Her (1981) and went to Australia for The Pirate Movie (1982). Annakin's last completed film was The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking (1988) which he directed, produced and co wrote.BROWARD GIRL GETS STAR TREATMENT AFTER LANDING TITLE ROLE AS \`PIPPI': [SUN-SENTINEL Edition] Roth, Patti.

Annakin was made one of the few Disney Legends by the Walt Disney Company in March 2002. He is only the second film director to be so honoured. He was also awarded an OBE the same year for services to the film industry and received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Hull University. He died on 22 April 2009, the same day as Jack Cardiff, who had been his cinematographer on the 1979 film The Fifth Musketeer. A daughter from a previous marriage predeceased him. The cause of his death was myocardial infarction and stroke. Claims were made that George Lucas took the name for Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars from his fellow film director; however, Lucas's publicist denied this following Annakin's death in 2009.

His vivid descriptions of western Asia preceded those of Marco Polo by a hundred years. With his broad education and vast knowledge of languages, Benjamin of Tudela is a major figure in medieval geography and Jewish history. The Travels of Benjamin is an important work not only as a description of the Jewish communities, but also as a reliable source about the geography and ethnography of the Middle Ages. Some modern historians credit Benjamin with giving accurate descriptions of everyday life in the Middle Ages. Originally written in Hebrew, his itinerary was translated into Latin and later translated into most major European languages. It received much attention from Renaissance scholars in the 16th century. His journeys reveal the concurrent interconnectedness and diversity of Jewish communities during this time period.  Early life  Little is known of his early life, apart from the fact that he was from the Navarrese town of Tudela in what is now Spain. Today, a street in the aljama (former Jewish quarter) is named after him.  Journey  Benjamin of Tudela in the Sahara (Author : Dumouza, 19th-century engraving) There is no consensus among scholars as to Benjamin of Tudela's exact route, although most scholars believe from his itinerary that he travelled on a popular route frequented by travelers at the time. Benjamin set out on his journey from the northeast Iberian Peninsula around 1165, in what may have begun as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.. It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. Several times the subject shows an interest in the coral trade, perhaps as a professional gem-merchant.Roth, Cecil. (1972) \\"Benjamin (Ben Jonah) of Tudela\\" in Encyclopaedia Judaica. 4. New York: Macmillan, pp. 535‚Äì538. On the other hand, he may have intended to catalog the Jewish communities en route to the Land of Israel to provide a guide where hospitality could be found for Jews traveling to the Holy Land, or for those fleeing oppression elsewhere.. He stopped frequently, meeting people, visiting places, describing occupations, and giving a demographic count of Jews in each town and country that he visited. Benjamin provided his own evaluations of various cultures he encountered and, sometimes, drew parallels between customs he encountered.copied Fauvelle- Aymar, Fran√ßois-Xavier. \\"Desperately Seeking the Jewish Kingdom of Ethiopia: Benjamin of Tudela and the Horn of Africa (Twelfth Century).\\" Speculum 88, no. 2 (2013): 383‚Äì404. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23488846. His journey began in Zaragoza, further down the valley of the Ebro to Tarragona, Barcelona, and Girona, whence he proceeded north to France, then set sail from Marseilles. After visiting Genoa, Lucca, Pisa, and Rome, he went to Greece and Constantinople, then set off across Asia. He visited Syria, Lebanon, the Land of Israel, and northern Mesopotamia (which he called Shinar) before reaching Baghdad.Hess, Robert L. \\"The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: A Twelfth- Century Jewish Description of North-East Africa.\\" The Journal of African History 6, no. 1 (1965): 15‚Äì24. https://www.jstor.org/stable/179644.. From there he went to Persia, then cut back across the Arabian Peninsula to Egypt and North Africa, returning to the Iberian Peninsula in 1173. In his travels, he described a significant Jewish community somewhere around modern-day Ethiopia. While it appears clear that such a community exists, scholars still struggle to decide where in Africa he actually visited‚Äîa lack of uniform spelling makes it hard to distinguish what places Benjamin and other contemporary writer travel writers are actually referencing. His visit to the ruins outside Mosul is one of the earliest accurate descriptions of the site of ancient Nineveh. He visited 300 cities in all, including many of importance in Jewish history, such as Susa, Sura, and Pumbedita. In addition, he gathered information on many more areas that he heard about in his travels, including China and Tibet. He recorded details on cultures such as that of Al-Hashishin, the hemp smokers, introducing Western Europeans to people and places far beyond their experience. He described his years abroad in a book, The Travels of Benjamin (◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü, Masa'ot Binyamin, also known as ◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™, Sefer ha-Masa'ot, The Book of Travels), which describes the countries he visited, with an emphasis on the Jewish communities, including their total populations and the names of notable community leaders. He also described the customs of the local population, both Jewish and non-Jewish, with an emphasis on urban life. In his accounts, Benjamin of Tudela describes Baghdad with great enthusiasm, making particular note of the virtuosity of the Caliph. He often writes of the respect and intermingle that he encounters between Judaism and Islam. He gave detailed descriptions of sites and landmarks passed along the way, as well as important buildings and marketplaces. Although Benjamin is noted for citing sources and is generally regarded by historians as trustworthy, some of his claims are faulted as relying on earlier writers. For instance, Benjamin's identification of Laish (Tel Dan) with Baniyas along with Philostorgius, Theodoret, and Samuel ben Samson is incorrect.; ; Eusebius of Caesarea, conversely, locates Dan/Laish more accurately in the vicinity of Paneas at the fourth mile on the route to Tyre.

Union general Irvin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia was marching south towards the Confederate capitol of Richmond, and encountered the Confederate Army of the Potomac under the command of P. G. T. Beauregard. McDowell sent troops from Daniel Tyler's division to probe the Confederate defenses along Bull Run Creek to locate the Confederate left flank. At Blackburn's Ford, the Union troops attempted to cross but Confederate fire broke up the attack. The repulse at Blackburn's Ford led McDowell to seek to attack the Confederates at a different point along their line, leading to the First Battle of Bull Run days later. Background On July 16, 1861, the untried Union Army of Northeastern Virginia under Brigadier General (Brig. Gen.) Irvin McDowell, 35,000 strong, marched out of the Washington, D.C., defenses to give battle to the Confederate Army of the Potomac, which was concentrated around the vital railroad junction at Manassas. Moving slowly, the army reached Fairfax Court House on July 17; the next day, McDowell ordered division commander Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to look for a fording point across Bull Run Creek and to \\"keep up the impression that we are moving on Manassas\\". The Confederates, about 22,000 men under the command of Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, were concentrated near Bull Run Creek, with detachments spread north of the creek to observe the Union troops. When McDowell started his advance from Washington, the Confederate detachments slowly retreated and rejoined the main body. Beauregard expected to be attacked either on the 18th or the 19th near Mitchell's Ford; meanwhile, he continued to ask for reinforcements, especially from Joseph E. Johnston's army in the Shenandoah Valley. Battle Map of Blackburn's Ford Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program On July 18, Tyler advanced to Centreville and was informed by local residents that the Confederates had retreated from the town. Milledge Bonham's troops in particular were reported to have retreated in the direction of Blackburn's Ford. Tyler then marched southeast to Mitchell's Ford and Blackburn's Ford, arriving at the latter about 11 a.m. Looking south across the stream, Tyler believed that the road to Manassas Junction was mostly clear, but he failed to see the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. James Longstreet concealed in the woods behind the ford. He ordered two howitzers under Captain (Capt.) Romeyn B. Ayres to bombard the Confederates he could seeguns of the Alexandria Artillery and the Washington Artillerybut the fire had no visible effect. As a result, Tyler ordered Colonel (Col.) Israel B. Richardson and part of his brigade forward. Richardson sent out a portion of the 1st Massachusetts Infantry towards the Confederate line. The Massachusetts regiment wore gray uniforms instead of the standard Union blue, which caused initial confusion, as the Confederates were also clad in gray. After the 1st Massachusetts, Richardson deployed the 1st Michigan Infantry, 2nd Michigan Infantry, 3rd Michigan Infantry, and 12th New York Infantry regiments. The Union advance met initial resistance from the 1st Virginia Infantry, 11th Virginia Infantry, and 17th Virginia Infantry regiments of Longstreet's brigade. Tyler ordered Ayres to move his guns closer to the action, accompanied by cavalry, and he sent the rest of Richardson's brigade toward the ford. The 12th New York Infantry began to retreat under heavy fire, exposing the rest of Richardson's line, particularly the 1st Massachusetts, to Confederate fire. Ayres, his battery having used up much of its ammunition, withdrew his two howitzers from the field. During the exchange, Union cannons fired an estimated 415 shots, and the Confederate cannons fired an estimated 310. Tyler realized that the Confederates had a strong force at the ford, and ordered the rest of his infantry to withdraw. After Richardson's brigade had completed its withdrawal, a second of Tyler's brigades commanded by William T. Sherman arrived on the field, although Sherman's brigade was only subjected to light shelling. Col. Jubal A. Early arrived with his Confederate brigade after marching two miles north from Beauregard's headquarters at Wilmer McLean's house. The availability of this additional firepower completed the Confederate victory, and a reinforced Washington Artillery kept the Union troops under fire as they retreated. Col. Patrick T. Moore of the 1st Virginia Infantry, later a Confederate brigadier general, received a severe head wound in the skirmish and was incapacitated for further field service. Tyler's Union division suffered 83 casualties in the action, while the Confederates lost 68 men. Aftermath The failed reconnaissance-in-force at Blackburn's Ford led McDowell to decide against a frontal assault along Bull Run Creek. He decided to attempt to cross the stream beyond the Confederate left flank, the maneuver he employed at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. The resulting battle ended in a defeat for McDowell's Union army, although the Confederates were in too much of disarray to provide a strong pursuit. Both Longstreet and Early later claimed that Blackburn's Ford \\"went a long way towards winning the victory of the 21st, for it gave our troops confidence in themselves\\". Two Union soldiers, both from the 12th New York, would later be awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at Blackburn's Ford. In June 1994, bodies from the 1st Massachusetts Infantry were found and later re-interred. Today, the site of the skirmish is marked with an interpretive marker set by the Virginia Civil War Trails organization. The marker is located at the site of the old ford.

It spreads at the foot of steep chalk cliffs along the Danube and up a narrow valley. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 3,892 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 History In Roman times, it was a village in the province of Moesia, first mentioned in 169. After the decline of the Roman Empire, the town turned out to be located at the northern border of the Byzantine Empire. In 1059, it was named Nicopolis, Greek for \\"City of Victory\\". During most of the Middle Ages, it was part of the Bulgarian Empire from its foundation in 681. After the fall of Tarnovo in 1393, the last Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Shishman defended what remained of the Empire from the fortress of Nikopol, where he was captured after the town was conquered by the Ottomans in 1395. Nikopol is therefore sometimes considered the capital of Bulgaria during these two years.Map in the National Historical Museum (Bulgaria) It was the site of the Battle of Nicopolis, the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, in 1396. At the fortress of Nicopolis, the united armies of Christian Europe headed by Hungarian king Sigismund and various French knights were defeated by the Ottomans under Bayezid I and his Serbian vassal Stefan Lazareviƒá. Nikopol Fortress plan Under Ottoman rule, Nikopol developed into an important military and administrative centre as a sanjak, with a strong fortress and a flourishing economic, spiritual and political life, until it went into decline during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was the centre of a district (kaza), but it was overtaken by Pleven as the regional centre of that part of the Bulgarian lands. Nikopol was captured by the Russians in the Battle of Nikopol in 1877. Modern times Nikopol has a population of 3,892 as of December 2009. It is the seat of Nikopol municipality and provides services to the local villages. Nikopol was partially flooded by the Danube during the 2006 European floods, and is currently working on new town infrastructure to manage fluctuations in the Danube River.

The completion of a car ferry in 2010 has linked the town to Turnu MƒÉgurele across the Danube in Romania, spurring local development, including the opening of new restaurants and the town‚Äôs first hotel. Nikopol also serves as a port for tourist boats where visitors stop and have the opportunity to take a bus into the nearby city of Pleven, or spend the afternoon in Nikopol. The fifth-largest nature park in Bulgaria, Persina Natural Park, lies partially in Nikopol. Persina Natural Park is the only Bulgarian natural park on the Danube River, and contains marshlands, over 200 species of birds, 475 species of plants, and 1,100 species of animals. Based on the importance and uniqueness, Persina Natural Park has been declared a Ramsar site. Tourist attractions in Nikopol include the ruins of the medieval fortress, the richly decorated 13th- or 14th-century Church of Saints Peter and Paul, the rock-hewn Church of Saint Stephen, the Bulgarian National Revival Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God from 1840, the Elia water fountain with an immured Ancient Roman gravestone featuring an epitaph, and the Vasil Levski museum house.

It is part of the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board or 'Zoos Victoria' which also includes Melbourne Zoo and Healesville Sanctuary. It is situated on approximately and is located on the Werribee River in Werribee Park, adjacent to the Werribee Mansion. It was originally agistment land to the Melbourne Zoo. Overview Visitors to the zoo can take a bus tour, which normally lasts 35‚Äì40 minutes, multiple times a day, and takes up to 140 people per bus. The tour includes animals such as the hippo as well as animals of the grassland, such as zebra, waterbuck, giraffe, ostrich and rhinoceros, as well as the camel and the oryx. The zoo has a simulated African village, with educational and entertaining features, including a mock scenario of an African ranger and his adventures tracking lions, and an interactive soundscape walk with simulated lion sounds surrounding the walker. There are two independent trails that visitors may follow: the Pula Reserve Walking Trail which focuses on African animals, including lions, vervet monkeys, cheetahs and meerkats, and the Australian Journey Walk, which focuses on Australian animals, like the koala, emu and kangaroo as well as the cassowary. There is a Learning Centre, which teaches more about the history and geography of animals in their environments. Visitors can also book various 'specialty' tours, including the Off Road Safari, or close encounters with gorillas, servals or giraffe. Werribee Open Range Zoo also has an animal/adoption sponsorship program, which is used for gifts and other altruistic purposes. In April 2008 it was announced that a theme park known as African Safari World was proposed, by Warner Village Theme Parks to be built within the grounds of the zoo. On July 1, 2008 the proposed theme park plans were indefinitely postponed, the Government citing the potential $100 million cost to the taxpayer as the reason they were postponed. Gorilla exhibit In 2011, Werribee Zoo gained three male western lowland gorillas from Melbourne Zoo. These consist of an adult silverback and his two sons. The new public display gorilla habitat is a sanctuary that features wide-open spaces, climbing structures and indoor facilities. This new facility enable Zoos Victoria to provide best-practice care for the bachelor gorillas and confirm the organisation's reputation as a world leader in gorilla management.Gorillas in the West The Victorian Government recently gave $1.5 million to support the construction of this $2.2 million facility. Zoos Victoria Foundation is seeking public support to help raise the remaining $700,000 through the Gorillas in the West campaign. In 2010, the zoo made national headlines over the gorilla enclosure when comedy duo Hamish & Andy dressed in gorilla suits and played with radio controlled cars and golf clubs as part of a television special. Some viewers believed the zoo to be attempting to con them and complained.

It is also the name of a fictional character that she created. Personal life Ulinskas is from Connecticut. She married Douglas Hobbie in 1964. She resides in Conway, Massachusetts. Career=Author Hobbie is the author of the popular Toot and Puddle children's books and the creator of the character bearing her name. Namesake characterOrigin= In the late 1960s, at the encouragement of her brother-in-law, Hobbie sold distinctive artwork of a cat-loving, rag dress- wearing little girl in a giant bonnet to American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. The artwork, based on Hobbie's own children and with rustic New England style of a bygone era, became popular, and her originally nameless character (identified earlier as \\"blue girl\\") became known as Holly Hobbie. As a contract artist, Hobbie worked with the Humorous Planning department at American Greetings under art director Rex Connors, who was responsible for launching \\"blue girl\\" as the most identifiable of the Hobbie characters. =Doll and other product licensing= Also working in Humorous Planning at that time (1973, 1974) was Bob Childers, a veteran humorous concept artist and designer. Childers insisted that there should be a doll of the character. Since no one seemed to listen, Childers went home and, on his own time, hand- stitched the first prototype and presented it to Connors, who took the cloth doll to Tom Wilson, Creative Vice President. American Greetings approached Knickerbocker Toy Company concerning the Holly Hobbie license. In 1974, Knickerbocker Toys licensed the Holly Hobbie character for a line of rag dolls, launched in 1975. These were a popular toy for young American girls for several years. Additional products were licensed and produced, including fabrics, furniture, ceramics, games, and stationery. Holly Hobbie products were later marketed by American Greetings in association with Carlton Cards. In 1976, Coleco produced a toy oven similar to Kenner's Easy-Bake Oven called The Holly Hobbie Oven. It was shaped like an old-fashioned wood-powered cookstove, used an incandescent light bulb for heat, and came with packaged mixes that could also be bought separately. In 1980, Holly was featured in The Adventures of Holly Hobbie, a novel by Richard Dubelman. In this book, Holly Hobbie is a ghost who lives in a painting from 1803. She comes out of the painting to help a descendant, Liz Dutton, find her missing father, an archaeologist who has vanished in Guatemala. =Updated versions= Beginning in 1989 and into the 1990s, Holly Hobbie dolls were produced by Tomy. Knickerbocker Toys also began producing dolls, but these were vinyl doll heads with soft bodies, unlike the original cloth dolls (rag dolls). In 2006, a redesigned Holly Hobbie was launched as part of a spin-off product line called \\"Holly Hobbie and Friends\\" based on the TV series and Academy award- winning books created by author and illustrator Linda Hayward and published by American Greetings. She was featured in TV series and movies Holly Hobbie and Friends: Surprise Party and Holly Hobbie and Friends: Christmas Wishes which were broadcast on Nick Jr. and are available on DVD. The traditional line still exists, with the back story that the \\"original\\" Holly is the great- grandmother of the \\"new\\" Holly. Coinciding, Mattel released an updated, brand new Holly Hobbie doll line, which includes Holly (blue eyes and blonde hair), Amy (green eyes and red hair), and Carrie (brown eyes and black hair). The dolls feature an all new face sculpt, a new body style, and flat feet. There is also a series of smaller Holly, Amy, and Carrie figures; each of these figures arrives with a farm animal. Holly has a cocker spaniel named Doodles, Amy has a pig named Cheddar, and Carrie has a cat named Bonnet. Separate doll outfits were available for sale, and each outfit could be customized. Porcelain dolls were available, made by the Ashton-Drake company. The movie features songs with music and lyrics written by lead guitarist Sheriff Mandy Collins and keyboardist Charlotte Spencer of the English rock group, the Hyper Girls. The cartoon features three pop songs, two sung in her own voice, \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"The Things That Make You Special.\\" LeAnn Rimes sings the third song, \\"Twinkle in Her Eye,\\" the show's theme song. Five direct-to-DVD movie releases followed. The first four releases were produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studios and Wang Film Productions, while the last two releases were produced by Sunflower Productions, Cartoonuity, and Nelvana. However, work on the franchise trickled to a stop and was quietly shelved in 2010. In fall 2018, Family Channel and Hulu released a live-action series featuring Ruby Jay as thirteen-year-old Holly Hobbie, a country girl who enjoys playing the guitar, hailing from a small town and seeking to save her grandmother's Calico Caf√©. The series draws loosely upon past elements created for the Holly Hobbie franchise, but includes modern elements, such as Holly's use of a crowdfunding page.

A mass grave is a grave containing multiple human corpses, which may or may not be identified prior to burial. The United Nations has defined a criminal mass grave as a burial site containing three or more victims of execution, although an exact definition is not unanimously agreed upon. Mass graves are usually created after many people die or are killed, and there is a desire to bury the corpses quickly for sanitation concerns. Although mass graves can be used during major conflicts such as war and crime, in modern times they may be used after a famine, epidemic, or natural disaster. In disasters, mass graves are used for infection and disease control. In such cases, there is often a breakdown of the social infrastructure that would enable proper identification and disposal of individual bodies. History Mass graves are a variation on common burial, still occasionally practiced today under normal circumstances. Mass or communal burial was a common practice before the development of a dependable crematory chamber by Ludovico Brunetti in 1873. In Paris, the practice of mass burial, and in particular, the condition of the Cimeti√®re des Innocents, led Louis XVI to eliminate Parisian cemeteries. The remains were removed and placed in the Paris underground forming the early Catacombs. Le Cimeti√®re des Innocents alone had 6,000,000 dead to remove. Burial commenced outside the city limits in what is now P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.  War = Thirty Years' War  The Thirty Years' War was Europe's deadliest religious conflict. In the Battle of L√ºtzen, 47 soldiers perished and were buried in a mass grave. Archaeological and osteological analyses found that the soldiers ranged in age from 15‚Äì50 years. Most corpses had evidence of blunt force trauma to the head while seven men had stabbing injuries.  Napoleonic Wars  Several mass graves have been discovered that were the result of Napoleonic battles, mass graves were dug for expeditious disposal of deceased soldiers and horses. Often soldiers would plunder the substantial quantity of corpses prior to burial. Generally the mass graves were dug by soldiers or members of logistical corps. If these weren't available, the corpses would be left to rot or would be burned. Such examples have been found scattered throughout Europe.  Spanish Civil War  Mass grave of Spanish Civil War victims in El Soler√†s There are over 2,000 known mass graves throughout Spain from the Spanish Civil War wherein an estimated 500,000 people died between 1936 and 1939, and approximately 135,000 were killed after the war ended. Several exhumations are being conducted from information given in witnesses' and relatives' testimonies to the Asociaci√≥n para la Recuperaci√≥n de la Memoria Hist√≥rica (ARMH). These testimonies serve the purpose of helping geophysicists, archaeologists and forensic scientists to locate graves in order to identify bodies and allow families to rebury their relatives. In the summer of 2008, information from these testimonies was used to unearth a 4 meter long square grave containing five skeletons near the town of San Juan del Monte. These five remains are believed to be of people that were kidnapped and killed after the July 18, 1936 military coup. Another mass grave from the Spanish Civil War was found using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Eyewitness accounts identified two potential locations for an unmarked grave in mountains of Lena in Northern Spain. Both sites were examined and an unmarked mass grave of approximately 1 meter by 5 meters was found.  Korean War  Approximately 100,000‚Äì200,000 civilians were killed at the start of the Korean War. These people were flagged by the government of South Korea for potentially collaborating with or sympathizing with North Korea. They were arrested and subsequently executed without trial. The sites where the massacres occurred were forbidden to the public. The bodies were considered to be traitors and the act of associating with them was considered treasonous. Despite this, families retrieved bodies from the shallow forbidden mass graves at the massacre sites. In 1956, bereaved families and villagers exhumed over 100 decomposed and unidentifiable bodies, ensuring that the complete human skeleton was intact. Each exhumed body was buried in its own \\"nameless grave\\" in a cemetery on Jeju Island. There is a granite memorial within the cemetery which bears the cemetery's local name, \\"Graves of One Hundred Ancestors and One Descendant.\\" This name functions to express the opposite of how the genealogy should be as typically many descendants derive from one ancestor. 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat  The Chilean military coup against President Salvador Allende occurred on September 11, 1973. The military surrounded the town of Santiago and searched for people hiding in potential guerilla insurgent locations. Civilians were detained for long periods of time and some disappeared. Following the coup, bodies were abundant in the streets and in the Mapocho River. It is estimated that 3,200 people were executed or disappeared between 1973 and 1990 in Chile. Higher estimates are up to 4,500 people. These bodies were taken to morgues to be identified and claimed. Unidentified bodies were buried in marked mass graves. From this conflict, several hidden mass graves have been identified. In December 1978, 15 bodies were discovered in an abandoned limestone mine in Lonqu√©n. In October 1979, 19 bodies were exhumed after being secretly buried at the cemetery of Yumbel. Mass graves were also identified in Santiago's General Cemetery with multiple bodies being forced into a single coffin. This cemetery had an influx of over 300 bodies within a three-month time span. These mass graves were distinguished by a cross with the initials \\"NN.\\" \\"NN\\" is indicative of the phrase \\"Nomen Nescio\\" or \\"no name.\\" Following extensive media coverage of these mass graves, the Chilean military decided to exhume the bodies from Lonqu√©n, Yumbel, and Santiago's General Cemetery. The military airdropped the exhumed bodies over open water or remote mountain locations.  Turkish Invasion of Cyprus  Many mass graves of both Turkish and Greek Cypriots were found in Cyprus after Turkey invaded the island in 1974. On August 3, 14 Greek Cypriot civilians were executed and buried in a mass grave. In Eptakomi 12 Greek Cypriots were found in a mass grave executed with their hands tied.Guardian, Bones don't speak. (published in Guardian newspaper). On the other hand, during the Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre, 126 Turkish Cypriots including elderly people and children were murdered by EOKA B and the inhabitants of the three villages were buried in mass graves with a bulldozer. The villagers of Maratha and Santalaris, 84 to 89 people in total,https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat;=19740903&id;=r2AdAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VlsEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3020,430189 were buried in the same grave.Oberling, Pierre. The road to Bellapais: the Turkish Cypriot exodus to northern Cyprus (1982), Social Science Monographs, p. 185 Mass graves were used to bury Turkish Cypriot victims of Tochni massacre too.  1976 Argentine coup d'√©tat  On March 24, 1976 at 3:21 AM, the media told the people of Argentina that the country was now under the \\"operational control of the Junta of General Commanders of the Armed Forces.\\" This event and years following it became known as the 1976 Argentine coup d'√©tat. The presiding president, President Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, had been taken captive two hours prior to the media announcement. The new dictatorship implemented travel bans, public gatherings, and a nighttime curfew. Additionally, the new dictatorship resulted in widespread violence, leading to executions and casualties. Abducted captives were disposed of in one of the five defense zones within Argentina where they were held. The bodies were typically buried in individual marked anonymous graves. Three mass graves are known to exist on Argentinian police and military premises although other bodies were disposed of through cremation or by being airdropped over the Atlantic Ocean. Approximately 15,000 people are estimated to have been assassinated. Argentina's largest mass grave's exhumation began in March 1984 at the San Vicente Cemetery in Cordoba.The grave was 3.5 meters deep and 25 by 2.5 meters across. It contained approximately 400 bodies. Of the recovered and exhumed bodies, 123 were of young people violently killed during the 1976‚Äì1983 dictatorship. The remaining bodies were identified as older and having died nonviolent deaths such as leprosy.  Vietnam War  Many mass graves were discovered during the Vietnam War. In the fall of 1969, the body count unearthed from these mass graves was around 2,800. The victims buried in these mass graves included government officials, innocent civilians, women and children. They were tortured, executed and in some cases, buried alive. In Quang Ngai, a mass grave of 10 soldiers was discovered on December 28, 2011. These soldiers were buried alongside their belongings including wallets, backpacks, guns, bullets, mirrors, and combs. Other larger mass graves of Vietnamese soldiers are believed to exist, with hundreds of soldiers in each grave.  Mass killings = Rwandan Genocide  View over Nyabarongo River - Where Tutsi Victims Were Thrown in 1994 - Outside Kigali - Rwanda The Rwandan Genocide began after the unsolved death of the Rwandan president, Juv√©nal Habyarimana, on April 6, 1994. Extremist members of the Hutu government formed an interim wartime government. They called for an extermination of the Tutsi population, Hutu political opponents and Hutu whom resisted the violence. The genocide lasted 100 days and resulted in an estimated 800,000 killings. Rwandan people sought refuge in gathering places such as churches and stadiums. An estimated 4,000‚Äì6,000 people gathered in Kibuye Catholic Church. Around April 17, 1994, the church was surrounded by armed civilians, police and gendarmes. Those inside were attacked with a variety of weapons including grenades, guns, and machetes. Survivors of the attack were sought after and killed in the following days. Burial of these bodies took place in at least four mass graves. The first mass grave resulting from this attack was discovered behind the church where several bodies were left unburied and scattered. In December 1995, archaeologists surveyed the area and flagged any potential human remains. In January 1996, forensic anthropologists located and exhumed 53 skeletal assemblages. A second mass grave was found under a tree marked with wire, indicating a memorial. Below the tree was a trench filled with multiple bodies. The third and fourth mass graves were found using a probe to test for deteriorating remains. The third grave was marked by the local population, similar to the second grave. The fourth grave was identified by a priest. Throughout the Rwandan genocide, bodies were buried in mass graves, left exposed, or disposed of though rivers. At least 40,000 bodies have been discovered in Lake Victoria which connects to Akagera River.  Khmer Rouge Genocide  Mass grave mapping teams have located 125 Khmer Rouge prison facilities and corresponding gravesites to date in Cambodia while researching the Killing Fields. These mass graves are believed by villagers to possess tutelary spirits and signify the dead bodies becoming one with the earth. Buddhist rituals, which were taboo at the time, were performed in the 1980s which transformed the anonymous bodies into \\"spirits of the departed.\\" In the 1990s, religious ceremonies were re- established and the Festival of the Dead was celebrated annually.  Holocaust  Nordhausen bury corpses found at Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in 1945. The Mittelbau camps held about 60,000 prisoners of The Holocaust between August 1943 and March 1945. Conservative estimates assume that at least 20,000 inmates perished at the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. In early April 1945, an unknown number of prisoners perished in death marches following the evacuation of prisoners from Mittelbau camps to Bergen- Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany. In April 1945, U.S. soldiers liberated the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Only a few prisoners were still in the camp and the U.S. soldiers found the remains of approximately 1,300 prisoners in the Boelcke barracks. The names of these prisoners are unknown. Mass graves of the dead prisoners from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp were dug by German civilians under orders from U.S. soldiers.

July 2007. Victims of the Srebrenica massacre were murdered by the Army of Republika Srpska and buried in mass graves. Serb forces used mass graves throughout the Bosnian War and thousands of victims remain unidentified as of 2017.  Famine = The Great Famine  Ireland's Great Famine lasted from 1845 to 1849, a period wherein about one million people died. Because of the excessive number of deaths and extreme poverty, many families were unable to provide a wake or proper burial for loved ones and used mass graves instead. Archaeological excavations have taken place on Irish mass burial sites. One excavation revealed a mass grave of nearly 1,000 individuals. The skeletons within the grave were layered on top of each other in multiple sub-rectangular pits positioned less than a meter apart.  Epidemic = Bubonic plague  Victims of bubonic plague in a mass grave from 1720 and 1721 in Martigues, France. The bubonic plague outbreak existed in three pandemic waves and is known as the Black Death. In the 1300s alone, an estimated 20‚Äì30 million people were killed in Europe and approximately 12 million people were killed in China. These deaths were at least 30 percent of the European population at that time. The last major outbreak of the bubonic plague occurred in London from 1665‚Äì1666 and is known as The Great Plague. In March 2013, a plague pit of 25 skeletons were found in a 5.5 meter-wide shaft during the construction of a new railroad in London. The skeletons were neatly lined up in two rows and were about 8 feet underground. Samples from 12 corpses were taken and forensic analysis confirmed traces of DNA from Yersinia pestis.  Spanish flu  In several territories, the amount of death caused by the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was beyond the capacities of funeral industry, requiring the use of mass graves. Several mass graves of Spanish flu victims were created in Australia, Canada, and the United States.  COVID-19  Reports of mass graves having been dug for COVID-19 victims have been made about Iran, using satellite pictures of sites near Qom as evidence. In New York City, mass graves have been prepared in Hart Island for an afflux of dead; however, other reports said mass graves would be unlikely in the United States. University of Huddersfield experts said mass graves might be considered if local services end up overwhelmed. Following the rise of deaths and morgues being overwhelmed, New York City has temporarily allowed for mass graves on Hart Island for unclaimed bodies. In Brazil, the city of Manaus, in the state of Amazonas, used mass graves after a large spike in deaths attributed to the pandemic.  Natural disaster  Burial of the victims of Brunner Mine disaster, New Zealand 1896  Brunner Mine disaster  The Brunner Mine disaster occurred at 9:30 a.m. on March 26, 1896. An underground explosion caused the death of 65 miners, making it New Zealand's deadliest mining disaster. Of the 53 victims buried in Stillwater cemetery, 33 victims were in one mass grave.  2010 Haitian earthquake  Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, thousands of bodies were left in the streets on Port-au-Prince, exposed to the sun and beginning to decompose and smell. The government of Haiti collected the bodies on the street, along with rubble through use of dump trucks and other heavy machinery. The bodies and rubble were then transported to empty rectangular holes, 20 feet deep, 20 feet wide and 100 feet long. No efforts were taken to identify the dead that were transported and buried. Within Haitian culture, burial rituals hold great significance and the sacred ceremonies can cost more than their own homes. There is a Haitian Vodou belief that the dead continue to live and are connected to their ancestors through these rituals. The burial of unidentified corpses in mass graves rather than familial plots severs this spiritual link between the living and dead.  2013 Typhoon Haiyan  As the casualties of the Typhoon Haiyan were in the thousands, unidentified or unknown corpses were buried in several mass graves in Leyte (especially in Tacloban City where the most deaths happened), Samar and other areas, while identified corpses were given to their families for burial.  Health concerns  The debate surrounding mass graves amongst epidemiologists includes whether or not, in a natural disaster, to leave corpses for traditional individual burials, or to bury corpses in mass graves. For example, if an epidemic occurs during winter, flies are less likely to infest corpses, reducing the risk of outbreaks of dysentery, diarrhea, diphtheria, or tetanus, which decreases the urgency to use mass graves. A research published in 2004 indicates that the health risks from dead bodies after natural disasters are relatively limited.

It has long-standing connections with royalty that have led to it sometimes being referred to as an \\"annexe to Buckingham Palace\\". Claridge's Hotel is owned and managed by Maybourne Hotel Group. History=Founding Claridge's was founded in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel, in a conventional London terraced house, and it grew by expanding into neighbouring houses. In 1854, the founder (the father of biologist St. George Jackson Mivart) sold the hotel to a Mr and Mrs Claridge, who owned a smaller hotel next door. They combined the two operations, and after trading for a time as \\"Mivart's at Claridge's\\", they settled on the current name. The reputation of the hotel was confirmed in 1860 when Empress Eugenie made an extended visit and entertained Queen Victoria at the hotel. In its first edition of 1878, Baedeker's London listed Claridge's as \\"The first hotel in London\\". Acquisitions Drawing of the current version of Claridge's was published in 1897, the year before the reopening. Richard D'Oyly Carte, the theatrical impresario and founder of the rival Savoy Hotel, purchased Claridge's in 1894, as part of The Savoy Group, and shortly afterwards demolished the old buildings and replaced them with the present ones. This was prompted by the need to install modern facilities such as lifts and en suite bathrooms. From 1894 to 1901, √âdouard Nignon was the hotel chef. Restructure The new Claridge's, built by George Trollope & Sons, opened in 1897. It is a Grade II listed building. The hotel has 203 rooms and suites and around 400 staff. After the First World War, Claridge's flourished due to demand from aristocrats who no longer maintained a London house, and under the leadership of Carte's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, an extension was built in the 1920s. During the Second World War it was the base of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's forces in exile and home of Peter II of Yugoslavia. He and his wife spent much of the Second World War in exile at Claridge's, and suite 212 was supposedly ceded by the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia for a single day (17 July 1945) to allow their heir, Crown Prince Alexander, to be born on Yugoslav soil, although no documentary evidence now exists to support the story. The prince and his family are regular return guests. At the end of the Second World War, when unexpectedly defeated in the General election of 1945, Winston Churchill was temporarily without a London home and took a suite at Claridge's. In December 1951, West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer secretly met World Jewish Congress president Nahum Goldmann at Claridge's to begin negotiations on German reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. Clients Well-known actors, directors, and entertainers who have used Claridge's include Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, regular visitor Alfred Hitchcock, Brad Pitt, Joan Collins, Mick Jagger, U2 and Whitney Houston. In his memoir The Moon's a Balloon David Niven wrote that for film producer Alexander Korda, \\"Home was the penthouse at Claridge's\\". The hotel lobby and several guestrooms appear in the 2001 Stephen Poliakoff BBC television drama Perfect Strangers. Claridge's is known for hosting visiting royalty and guests of the Royal Family. The late King Hassan of Morocco was known to travel with his own mattress, but at the hotel he used a Savoy Mattress. Impressed by the quality, he ordered 24 identical mattresses from the Savoy for his palace. In 1998, the group of hotels‚Äîalong with the later-added Connaught‚Äîwas sold for $867 million to two American private-equity funds, Blackstone and Colony Capital.Dana Vachon (August 2014), To Capture Claridge‚Äôs Vanity Fair. In 2004, they both retained Deutsche Bank to sell The Savoy Group, including Claridge's, to a group of Irish investors, which eventually sold the Savoy Hotel and Savoy Theatre and renamed the group Maybourne Hotel Group.Walsh, Dominic. \\"Savoy Group changes name after deal\\", The Times, 25 January 2005. In 2007, Claridge's gained worldwide media coverage by introducing a Water Menu containing bottled waters sourced globally and from the United Kingdom, such as Malmberg and Iskilde.Telegraph online news, 15 October 2007. The Maybourne Hotel Group includes two other five-star luxury hotels in London, The Berkeley and The Connaught. Restaurants and other facilities Claridge's replaced Gordon Ramsay's restaurant (see below) with Fera at Claridge's in 2014. Fera is run by Michelin-starred chef Simon Rogan, who previously ran L'Enclume in Cumbria, England. In March 2015, Fera was named in The Observer as one of its best places that month. Fera earned a Michelin star, one of 14 restaurants in the UK to do so in 2015. For twelve years, the fine dining main restaurant was run by Gordon Ramsay, with head chef Steve Allen who replaced Mark Sargeant. Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's lost its Michelin status in January 2010 and closed in 2013 following Ramsay's withdrawal from renewal negotiations with the hotel. Michelin-starred Northern Irish chef Michael Deane started his career at the restaurant. Claridge's offers afternoon tea and has been endorsed by the Tea Guild. Claridge's has two ground floor bars: a main bar and a former cigar bar known as The Fumoir. The smoking ban in England has caused The Fumoir to stop selling cigars. From 28 July to 6 August 2012, the hotel hosted a ten-day pop-up restaurant by two-Michelin-starred New Nordic Cuisine Noma, while the restaurant in Copenhagen was closed from 22 July to 13 August for refurbishment. Owner and founder Ren√© Redzepi with head chef Matt Orlanda and staff from the restaurant served a ¬£195-per-head nine-course menu that included their take on scones and clotted cream, Lancashire hotpot with British ingredients, and live ants foraged in Denmark and flown to London. Christmas tree Claridge's does a Christmas tree display: usually by someone in the fashion industry such as John Galliano and Kally Ellis. In 2015 the tree was designed by Christopher Bailey, made up of around 100 umbrellas, with 77,000 individual lights that were triggered by people walking past.

Jeffrey EC is jointly owned by Westar Energy and Aquila Corp., both now wholly owned sibsidiaries of Evergy, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri. Jeffrey EC is composed of three separate 800-MW units providing a name-plate energy center capacity of 2.16 gigawatts. Unit 1 began operation in 1978, unit 2 in 1980 and unit 3 in 1983. Jeffrey EC is a typical modern coal- fired energy center. Its primary mission is to convert the chemical energy available from its Wyoming Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal supply into electric energy. History Jeffrey EC came into operation during the late 1970s in the wake of an energy crisis created by a quadrupling of world oil prices. Its inauguration in July, 1978 was heralded with a visit by Vice President Walter Mondale praising its use of domestic coal reserves at a time when many power stations were still using imported oil. The opening ceremonies included a performance by the US Army Golden Knights parachute team, and the arrival of a special train carrying company officials and state dignitaries from Topeka, Kansas. The center was originally designed for four generating units, but was scaled back when the anticipated growth in demand for electricity did not materialize. The steam turbines and generators were imported from Germany. The unit 2 intermediate pressure turbine had to be replaced by the unit 3 turbine when the original unit was lost on a ship that sunk during the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. As of December, 2007, Foundation Coal has shipped approximately 220,000,000 tons of Powder River Basin Coal to Jeffrey Energy Center. Operation Coal is delivered to Jeffrey EC by a unit train. A unit train contains about 110 cars, constructed of aluminum to conserve weight, and is approximately long. Jeffrey EC burns the coal delivered by about of coal train cars each week. The heating value of this coal is about 8,400 BTU/lb (19.5 MJ/kg) and at full load Jeffrey EC burns about of coal per hour. Jeffrey EC has the capacity to generate 1,857 MW of electrical power. Westar Energy \\"Westar Energy - Our Energy\\" Jeffrey EC is not located close to any large bodies of natural water. Its water supply comes from the Kansas River and two nearby wells. The overall efficiency of the conversion process is about 33%, or about 1/3 of the coal's available chemical energy is converted to electric energy. The remainder of the energy (2/3) is rejected to the environment as low-grade waste heat with poor thermodynamic availability. Steam generating (nuclear, gas, coal, geothermal, and solar furnace) energy centers, like Jeffrey, operate their steam plant on the Rankine cycle. According to Moyers and Company web site as of September 18, 2013 this is ranked 12th of the 50 dirtiest American power plants and generated 14.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2011.

Its plot is a shaggy God story. Opening narrationPlot Astronaut Colonel Adam Cook (Richard Basehart) crash lands on a strange planet with gravity and atmospheric conditions similar to those of his home world. Most of his equipment is destroyed in the crash and cannot be repaired due to a broken right arm and lack of resources. He contacts his home base, but they have little encouragement for him; there is no replacement spacecraft to rescue him, and his home planet may be at war in a matter of hours. They promise to send instructions on how to repair his ship. From base, General Larrabee (Harold Gould) reports that the enemy attacked and destroyed their entire coast in 12 minutes, after which they retaliated. Those at base will have to move soon, meaning Cook will not have anyone to contact. Cook leaves his ship at night and finds drawn patterns in the dirt. While looking for the source, he is hit by a rock from an unseen source, and knocked unconscious. During this time, General Larrabee sends his last transmission to Cook reporting that the radiation from the attacks will kill any remaining survivors, so Cook can expect no rescue. Upon regaining consciousness, Cook returns to his ship and is startled by a noise coming from a closet. Cook leaves the ship as a gesture showing that he means the alien no harm. A human-like female (Antoinette Bower) emerges from his ship. Not knowing each other's languages, they communicate through sketches in the sand and pantomime. He learns that she is also stranded; her planet left its orbit and she is its sole survivor. Her name is Norda. As they ready to look for food, Cook picks up a stick, which Norda interprets as a threat. She scratches his face and runs. Soon after, Norda returns and expresses remorse for her actions, which Cook happily forgives.

History In 1969, Phipps Plaza opened as the first multi-level mall in Atlanta, aiming to become the South's leading shopping destination. The mall originally opened with two levels. Purchased by financier Ogden Phipps in 1966 for less than $600,000, the development was sold in 1992 to Simon Properties for $488 million. That year, in development as part of a $140 million renovation and expansion, Phipps added a third anchor, Parisian, a department store based in Birmingham, Alabama, owned by the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, to its original anchors Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. The expansion would also add a 14 screen AMC theatre, a new food court, new elevators, and the addition of one new level. Phipps Plaza remains Atlanta's only Saks Fifth Avenue venue. Lord & Taylor would close their Phipps Plaza location in 2004 citing an overly competitive regional marketplace. The store served as one of the original anchors for 35 years. The space was eventually completely renovated to make way for Atlanta's third Nordstrom, which opened in March 2005. On August 2, 2006, it was announced that Belk was acquiring the Parisian chain of department stores, with the store being converted to the Belk name in the fall of 2007. In 2010 the food court was renovated into a Legoland Discovery Center.Phipps Plaza in 2019 On November 13, 2017, Belk announced that it would close its location at Phipps Plaza during the summer of 2018.

Keith Millis grew up in Rensselaer, New York and earned his Bachelor of Science in Metallurgical Engineering as a 1938 graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A year later he was conferred a Master of Science degree in Metallurgical Engineering at RPI. Early in the Second World War, chromium was considered critical to the war effort and experimentation was conducted by Millis to find a substitute. He made his discovery while experimenting with molten iron and magnesium. The original intent was to find another element that would cause all the carbon in the cast iron alloy to be combined as carbide. Magnesium was a known carbide former. Instead, the graphite in the iron formed into spheroidal shapes, and the cast iron had high tensile strength plus it exhibited ductility. Thus was born ductile iron in 1943. Millis and others at the International Nickel Company (Inco) sought and obtained U.S. patent 2,485,760 on October 25, 1949 for magnesium additions to cast iron that would spheroidize the graphite and dramatically ductilize the material. As an employee of Inco, Millis worked to promote the use of ductile iron as it began to be used as a commercial material. He also helped to found the Ductile Iron Society, an organization whose purpose is to promote the production and application of ductile iron castings. Millis died in 1992. Legacy Since his death, the Ductile Iron Society has held the \\"Keith Millis World Symposium on Ductile Iron\\", a technical meeting concerning all facets of ductile iron material, processing and applications. The event has been held approximately every 5 years: * 1993 - Hilton Head Island, SC * 1998 - Hilton Head Island, SC * 2003 - Hilton Head Island, SC * 2008 - Las Vegas, NV * 2013 - Nashville, TN The most recent symposium was co-sponsored by the American Foundry Society. He was inducted into RPI's alumni hall of fame in 1999. A perpetual international scholarship has been awarded by the Ductile Iron Society Foundry Educational Foundation in Millis's name since 1991.

Most have the mechanism set in the ground under the flowerbed, which is then planted to visually appear as a clock face with moving arms which may also hold bedding plants. The first floral clock was the idea of John McHattie, Superintendent of Parks in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was first planted up in the spring of 1903 in West Princes Street Gardens. In that year it had only an hour hand but a minute hand was added the following year. A cuckoo which pops out every quarter hour was added in 1952. The clock was soon imitated across the United Kingdom and later throughout the world. In Edinburgh, the clock mechanism is set inside the plinth of the statue to Allan Ramsay adjacent. The first mechanism using salvaged parts from Elie Parish Church in Fife was installed by James Ritchie.Monuments and Statues of Edinburgh, Michael T.R.B. Turnbull (Chambers) p.5 A new mechanism was installed in 1934 and has been electrically operated since 1973. It is still maintained by James Ritchie Clockmakers. The only flower clock with two faces moved by the same system is located in Zacatl√°n, Puebla, Mexico. It has two faces, each in diameter. It was manufacturated by Relojes Centenario, a local manufacturer. Michael Jackson had a floral clock at his Neverland Ranch. Other floral clocks can be seen in the International Peace Garden on the border between North Dakota and Manitoba, Rockford, Illinois and in Frankfort, Kentucky. On 19 May 2016, Camarillo Plaza in California unveiled a in diameter floral clock. The clock was created as a dedication to Mr. David Pick.

The District of Keewatin was a territory of Canada and later an administrative district of the Northwest Territories. It was created in 1876 by the Keewatin Act, and originally it covered a large area west of Hudson Bay. In 1905, it became a part of the Northwest Territories and in 1912, its southern parts were adjoined to the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, leaving the remainder, now called the Keewatin Region, virtually uninhabited. On April 1, 1999, the Keewatin Region was formally dissolved, as Nunavut was created from eastern parts of the Northwest Territories, including all of Keewatin. The name \\"Keewatin\\" comes from Algonquian roots‚Äîeither in Cree or in Ojibwe‚Äîboth of which mean north wind in their respective languages. In Inuktitut, it was called ‚Äîa name which persists as the Kivalliq Region in Nunavut. History as a territory, 1876‚Äì1905 The District of Keewatin was created by the passage of the Keewatin Act on October 7, 1876,Victoria R, Proclamation, 7 October 1876, (1876) C Gaz, 458. from a portion of Canada's Northwest Territories. The district ceased being an independent territory in 1905 and was returned to the Northwest Territories. At the time of its abolition, it covered 228,160 square miles (590,932 km¬≤)‚Äîroughly the size of Saskatchewan. At its establishment in 1876, it encompassed the bulk of what is now Manitoba and northwestern Ontario and southern Nunavut. Its territory had been reduced over the years as areas were added to the two provinces. The federal government created the District of Keewatin on the advice of Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris. Morris convinced the government that the new territorial government of the Northwest Territories would be unable to effectively administer land to the north and east of Manitoba. Morris was advised of the need for a new territory by James McKay. Morris approved of the idea and began conferring with McKay to determine a proper Aboriginal name for the territory. McKay decided upon Keewatin, which comes from the Cree and Saulteaux languages and means the land of the north wind. The government decided to use an Aboriginal name because they wanted to be sensitive towards Natives who formed the largest demographic and respect their cultural identity. District of Keewatin government The District of Keewatin was run by an appointed council. The legislative branch of the government was a unicameral body, known as the Council of Keewatin. The council contained six members, all of whom were appointed by the Lieutenant- Governor. Political parties did not exist in the council. The executive branch of the territory was run by the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba who also doubled as the Lieutenant-Governor of the District of Keewatin. The seat of government for the district was in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The District of Keewatin did not have any representation in the House of Commons of Canada or the Senate of Canada. Prohibition Upon creation of the District of Keewatin, the Government of Canada decreed that intoxicants such as alcohol were forbidden to be imported into the territory. The government made this decision in regards to active law enforcement to curb the whisky trade running rampant in the Northwest Territories. Laws had been passed two years earlier by the Council of the Northwest Territories to enforce prohibition in that territory. Law enforcement The territorial laws created by the Council of Keewatin were enforced by the North-West Mounted Police. The judicial system in the territory consisted of a combined court system of stipendiary magistrates who were appointed to the Council of the Northwest Territories and court proceedings taking place in the courts of Manitoba. History, 1905‚Äì1999 On September 1, 1905, the District of Keewatin became one of four districts in the Northwest Territories, the other three being the District of Ungava, the District of Mackenzie, and the District of Franklin. Keewatin covered the portion of the Northwest Territories north and east of Manitoba on the mainland (essentially much of present-day mainland Nunavut, northern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario), and western islands within Hudson and James Bays. After the boundaries of Ontario and Manitoba were extended northward in 1912, Keewatin largely consisted of treeless lands in the Arctic. After 1920, the largely uninhabited eastern islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay that had been part of the District of Ungava were transferred to Keewatin. Because of the harsh winters and lack of inland roads, settlement of the isolated district by whites was poor, and even the native Inuit population was sparse. In 1950, there were just 2,400 persons in the entire district. On April 1, 1999, the Keewatin Region was formally dissolved, as Nunavut was created from eastern parts of the Northwest Territories, including all of Keewatin. However, as an administrative district of the Northwest Territories it had ceased to function several years prior to division.

After several hours, they tried to escape in a car, using the bank manager and an accountant as human shields, and holding the manager's wife. A few meters ahead, a special group of the provincial police, the GEO, killed one of the suspects and the two hostages. Another suspect, Mart√≠n Salda√±a, was found hanged in his cell just hours after the massacre; though it was assumed that he had committed suicide, in January 2007 new research showed that he had been murdered, possibly by first hitting him in the head, rendering him unconscious, and then strangling him.Masacre de Ramallo: piden que se investigue como un crimen el caso del asaltante que muri√≥ en la comisar√≠a Doubts about the police behaviour arose after the whole country saw footage of the police special unit deliberately shooting the car with hostages inside. After the massacre, several government officials blamed the media coverage for the tragic outcome, accusing journalists of an unprofessional treatment of the news. The provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde claimed that negotiations may have been negatively affected by the police constant communication with radio and television reporters. On October 17, 1999, the Secretary of Justice and Security Buenos Aires, Carlos Soria, confirmed that police had acted as accomplices of the thieves who robbed the National Bank of Villa Ramallo, a fact which preceded the slaughter of two hostages and a criminal during the escape attempt. \\"There is, unfortunately, and as we all imagined, some police personnel directly involved,\\" Soria told Radio Am√©rica, Telam reported.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/156297-participaron-policias-en-la-banda- de-ramallo See also *List of massacres in Argentina ReferencesFurther reading * International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), 23 September 1999.

Production consisted of window panes, mirrors and stemware until 1816 when the first crystal oven went into operation. By that time over 3000 workers were employed at the site.  1817-1869  Baccarat received its first royal commission in 1823. This began a lengthy line of commissions for royalty and heads of state throughout the world. In 1855 Baccarat won its first gold medal, at the World's Fair in Paris. Baccarat first began marking its work with a registered mark in 1860. The mark was a label affixed to the bottom of the work. In the period 1846-1849 Baccarat signed some of their high quality glass millefiori paperweights with the letter B and the year date in a composite cane.Dunlop, Paul H. (2009) The Dictionary of Glass Paperweights A special paperweight dated 1853 was found under the cornerstone of a bomb damaged church in Baccarat when construction recommenced after World War II.Dunlop, Paul H. (2013) Baccarat Paperweights : two centuries of beauty The crystal production expanded its scope throughout this period, and Baccarat built a worldwide reputation for making fine stemware, chandeliers, barware, and perfume bottles.  1870-1936  Baccarat crystal chandelier and staircase banister, Dolmabah√ße Palace The Imperial Era ended in 1870 with the defeat of Napol√©on III. Influences outside France began to have a stronger influence on Baccarat's work during this era, particularly imports from Japan. The world's largest chandelier and a staircase lined with a Baccarat crystal balustrade adorn the Dolmabah√ße Palace in Istanbul. Strong growth continued in Asia for Baccarat. Baccarat has become quite famous at the royal houses. The queen of Portugal , for example, commissioned for her private collection decorative pieces and tableware (currently exhibited in the Ajuda National Palace ). One of the strongest production areas for Baccarat was perfume bottles, and by 1907 production was over 4000 bottles per day. In 1936 Baccarat began marking all of its works via acid or sandblasting.  1936-present  Baccarat created an American subsidiary in 1948 in New York City. They started to produce pieces based on Cylon designs, as the famous Cylon Carrier - Napoleon Hat piece (1958). The chairman of Baccarat from 1960 to 1992 was Ren√© de Chambrun, former Vichy France's Prime Minister Pierre Laval's son-in-law. There are American stores in Costa Mesa, California; Houston, Texas; Greenwich, Connecticut; New York City; Palm Desert, California; Las Vegas; and Miami, Florida. A retrospective was held in 1964 at the Louvre Museum to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the crystal works. In 1993, Baccarat began making jewelry and in 1997 the company expanded into perfume. In 2003, Baccarat relocated to 11, place des Etats-Unis in Paris. In 2005 it was acquired by Starwood Capital Group in the United States.

Afirman que Menem recibi√≥ una mansi√≥n de Yabr√°n Biography Yabr√°n was born in Larroque, province of Entre Rios, in 1944, the seventh son of Nallib Miguel Yabr√°n and Emilia Tufic Marpez, both children of Lebanese immigrants. He moved to Buenos Aires in the early '60s, as he began to do business in the areas of security and banking transactions. In the '70s, he became one of the main shareholders of Ocasa, and at the end of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's term he began to operate airport security in Ezeiza. His name became known due to allegations of the former economy minister Domingo Cavallo. At a session of the Congress in 1995, the then finance minister denounced Yabr√°n as a kind of mafia boss with political and judicial protection. Yabr√°n, currently known by the general public, was largely unknown at the time and the press did not have any pictures of him. Legally, Yabr√°n only declared a few companies, but Cavallo accused him of driving, through proxies, other major companies. Among them, Correo OCA (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), Ocasa (which Yabr√°n claimed to have sold ), Ciccone Calcogr√°fica (a print and minting company that printed the Patacones Bonaerenses in the 2001 recession) and a transport and logistics company called Villalonga Furlong. These companies were sold to the Exxel Group for $605 million. The main accusation against Yabr√°n was that their transport and security companies were being used to hide drugs, weapons trafficking, and money laundering. Among other things, he owned the private courier company OCASA, and the immense - of which are covered - EDCADASSA warehouses at the Ezeiza international airport in Buenos Aires. When his name became known due to allegations of former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, Yabr√°n was extremely secretive and jealous of his privacy. After the murder of photojournalist Jos√© Luis Cabezas, who had been investigating Yabr√°n, he was forced to come out in public and face the suspicions of society. Close links with Menem's government The killing of Cabezas embarrassed President Carlos Menem's government while Menem admitted that Emir Yoma was Alfredo Yabr√°n's friend, he denied that Yabran knew him. His former wife Zulema Yoma insisted that they were close friends, and was proven right when it was found out that Yabran had given Menem a mansion in Buenos Aires as a marriage gift. Justice Minister Elias Jassan had to resign over the 102 calls he personally made to Yabran and because of the calls that he had with Yabran's bodyguards the day after the murder of Cabezas. Cabinet Minister Jorge Rodriguez was criticized for receiving Yabran in the Casa Rosada. Suicide In 1998, Yabr√°n was found dead in one of his houses, with a gunshot through his face which left him nearly unrecognizable.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 14, 1993. The plot revolves around Springfield's impulse purchase of a faulty monorail from a conman, and how it subsequently falls to Marge to stop the train from destroying the town. The episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Rich Moore. Recurring guest star Phil Hartman provided the voice of Lyle Lanley, while Leonard Nimoy made a guest appearance in this episode. \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\" has been widely praised by fans and critics and is generally considered one of the best episodes of The Simpsons. O'Brien has said that, of the episodes he wrote, this was his favorite. Nimoy's unexpected guest appearance was also widely praised. Despite this, the episode attracted some criticism when it was first aired due to the somewhat abstract and less situational nature of the plot, particularly from voice actor Yeardley Smith who in 1995 described the episode as \\"truly one of our worst\\". Plot When the Environmental Protection Agency fines Mr. Burns $3 million for dumping nuclear waste in a Springfield park, a town meeting is held on how to spend the money. Following a few suggestions‚Äîincluding a proposal from a poorly-disguised Burns to invest the money back into his power plant‚ÄîMarge nearly succeeds in advocating for the repair of the town's rundown roads, but a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley leads a song-and-dance routine that convinces the townspeople to instead build a monorail. After running a questionable training program, Lanley randomly selects Homer to be the monorail's conductor. Doubtful about Lanley, Marge visits his office and discovers his intention to run off with money skimmed from the project while the townspeople fall victim to a faulty train. Marge drives to the town of North Haverbrook, a previous purchaser of one of Lanley's monorails. She discovers the town to be in ruins, and, despite the advertisements for it everywhere stating otherwise, the townsfolk fearfully deny their monorail's existence. She meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook monorail, who explains Lanley had embezzled construction funds through shoddy workmanship and materials, confirming that his monorail projects, including the Springfield one, are all scams. Cobb offers to help Marge prevent Springfield from suffering the same fate. At the Springfield monorail's inaugural run, Lanley arranges for a well- attended opening ceremony as a diversion while he escapes on a plane heading to Tahiti. When the flight makes an unexpected stopover in North Haverbrook, the townsfolk storm the aircraft to attack Lanley for ruining the town. Back in Springfield, the monorail leaves the station just before Marge and Cobb arrive and the controls malfunction from Lanley's sabotage, causing the solar- powered train to over-speed around the track, endangering Homer, Bart, and the passengers, including Leonard Nimoy. As Chief Wiggum and Mayor Quimby argue over who takes charge, Marge and Cobb contact Homer by radio and Cobb tells him he will need to find an anchor to stop the train. Improvising quickly, Homer pries loose the metal \\"M\\" from the engine's side logo, ties a rope to it, and throws it from the train. After damaging a large portion of the town‚Äîespecially the already-derelict roads‚Äîthe \\"M\\" catches on the giant doughnut of the Lard Lad Donut store's sign and the rope holds, stopping the monorail. As the passengers are rescued, Marge narrates that the town never again embarked on such a foolish project, then follows with a list that contradicts her statement consisting of a skyscraper made from Popsicle sticks, a 50 foot-tall magnifying glass, and an up-escalator that leads to nowhere. Production Conan O'Brien conceived the idea when he saw a billboard in Los Angeles that just had the word \\"Monorail\\" on it, with no other details or explanation. He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and thought he should try some other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks \\"absolutely loved\\" this episode when O'Brien presented it. Leonard Nimoy was not originally considered for the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star, as he had previously appeared as Akira in the second season episode \\"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\\". After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying he did not want to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted. Cultural references The episode borrows some elements from the The Music Man, with \\"The Monorail Song\\" strongly resembling the show's \\"Ya Got Trouble\\" and Lyle Lanley being based on Harold Hill. The episode starts with a tribute song to The Flintstones as Homer heads home from work and crashes his car into a chestnut tree. Later, Leonard Nimoy makes a guest appearance as himself. References are made to his role in Star Trek: The Original Series, and an allusion to his role as the host of In Search of.... Kyle Darren, the caricature of Luke Perry, star of Beverly Hills, 90210, appears as well.Mullen, p. 74 Mayor Quimby uses the phrase \\"May the Force be with you\\" from the Star Wars franchise, confusing it with Nimoy's work on Star Trek (and‚Äîat the same time‚Äîbelieving Nimoy to have been \\"one of The Little Rascals\\"). Homer's Monorail conductor uniform is based on uniforms from Star Wars. When Mr. Burns is brought into the court room, he is restrained in the same way as Hannibal Lecter in the film The Silence of the Lambs. Homer briefly serenades Marge in their bedroom with a line from the folk tune \\"The Riddle Song\\". The logo on the monorail cars which is revealed as Homer attempts to stop the speeding train shows they were first used during the 1964 World's Fair, though that event's train actually used cars suspended from an overhead rail. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\" finished 30th in the ratings for the week of January 11 to 17, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.7. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\" has frequently been selected in lists of the show's best episodes. In 1998, TV Guide listed it in its list of top twelve Simpsons episodes. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly released a list of its Top 25 episodes, ranking this episode in fourth, saying \\"the episode has arguably the highest throwaway-gag-per-minute ratio of any Simpsons, and all of them are laugh-out-loud funny.\\" EW.com. Retrieved on February 13, 2007 In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner named the episode as being one of his five favorites. In 2006, IGN named the episode the best of the fourth season. IGN.com. Retrieved on February 14, 2007 John Ortved of Vanity Fair called it the third best episode of the show, due to, \\"An amazing musical number; Leonard Nimoy in a random guest appearance... Besides being replete with excellent jokes, this episode reveals the town's mob mentality and its collective lack of reason. This is the episode that defines Springfield more than any other.\\" In 2010, Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the ninth best in the show's history. In 2019, Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. Later that same year, The Guardian named it one of the five greatest episodes in Simpsons history, Time ranked the episode first in its list of 10 best Simpsons episodes picked by Simpsons experts, and Consequence of Sound ranked it the number two episode on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"an unsurpassed episode. It's hard to know where to start dishing out the praise ‚Äî Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn...\\" Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating \\"It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and no matter how many times I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating \\"It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode\\", and is \\"maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer.\\" In 2012, \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\" was the second-place finisher in a Splitsider reader poll to decide on the best episode of any television sitcom, losing to the Community episode \\"Remedial Chaos Theory\\". Leonard Nimoy's appearance as himself has been praised as being one of the show's best guest appearances. In a list of the 25 greatest guest voices on the show, released September 5, 2006, IGN.com ranked Leonard Nimoy at 11th.Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances IGN.com Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the 13th best guest appearance in the show's history. Nimoy would make a second guest appearance in season eight's \\"The Springfield Files\\". Conan O'Brien has said that of all the episodes of The Simpsons he wrote, this is his favorite. Homer's lines \\"I call the big one Bitey\\" and \\"Donuts, is there anything they can't do?\\" are among series creator Matt Groening's favorite lines. O'Brien and Hank Azaria performed the monorail song live at the Hollywood Bowl from September 12‚Äì14, 2014 as part of the show \\"The Simpsons Take The Bowl\\". When The Simpsons began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former Simpsons writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named the episode as one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service. Conversely, the episode was not initially well received by many fans of the show's earlier seasons, as it was a particularly absurd early example of the show taking a more joke-based cartoon approach to comedy, rather than the more realistic situational style of comedy it had employed in its first few years. In 1995, during the production of the seventh season, Yeardley Smith said of the episode as \\"truly one of our worst ‚Äì we [the entire cast] all agree\\".

Two forts on the Outer Banks (Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras) had been built by the Confederates, to protect their commerce-raiding activity. But these were lightly-defended, and their artillery could not engage the bombarding fleet under Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham, commandant of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which had been ordered to keep moving, to avoid presenting a static target. Although held up by bad weather, the fleet was able to land troops under General Ben Butler, who took the surrender of Flag Officer Samuel Barron. This battle represented the first application of the naval blockading strategy. The Union retained both forts, providing valuable access to the sounds, and commerce raiding was much reduced. The victory was welcomed by a demoralised Northern public after the humiliation of 1st Bull Run. The engagement is sometimes known as the Battle of Forts Hatteras and Clark. Hatteras Inlet in Confederate hands The North Carolina Sounds occupy most of the coast from Cape Lookout (North Carolina) to the Virginia border. With their eastern borders marked by the Outer Banks, they were almost ideally located for raiding Northern maritime commerce. Cape Hatteras, the easternmost point in the Confederacy, is within sight of the Gulf Stream, which moves at a speed of about 3 knots (1.5 m/s) at this latitude.Maury, The physical geography of the sea, p. 27. Ships in the Caribbean trade would reduce the time of their homeward journeys to New York, Philadelphia, or Boston by riding the stream to the north. Raiders, either privateers or state- owned vessels, could lie inside, protected from both the weather and from Yankee blockaders, until an undefended victim appeared. Watchers stationed at the Hatteras lighthouse would then signal a raider, which would dash out and make a capture, often being able to return the same day.Trotter, Ironclads and Columbiads, pp. 21‚Äì24. Fort Hatteras (top) and Fort Clark, from wartime sketches To protect the raiders from Federal reprisal, the state of North Carolina immediately after seceding from the Union established forts at the inlets, waterways that allowed entrance to and egress from the sounds. In 1861, only four inlets were deep enough for ocean-going vessels to pass: Beaufort,Pronounced BOW-fort in North Carolina; the name of the town in South Carolina is pronounced BYOO-fort. Ocracoke, Hatteras, and Oregon Inlets. Hatteras Inlet was the most important of these, so it was given two forts, named Fort Hatteras and Fort ClarkHenry T. Clark was Governor of North Carolina; see Trotter, Ironclads and Columbiads, p. 16. Fort Hatteras was sited adjacent to the inlet, on the sound side of Hatteras Island. Fort Clark was about half a mile (800 m) to the southeast, closer to the Atlantic Ocean. The forts were not very strong; Fort Hatteras had only ten guns mounted by the end of August, with another five guns in the fort but not mounted. Fort Clark had only five.ORA I, v. 4, p. 584. But see p. 591, where the number of mounted guns in Fort Hatteras is stated to be 12. Furthermore, most of the guns were rather light 32-pounders or smaller, of limited range and inadequate for coastal defense. The personnel problem was even worse. North Carolina had raised and equipped 22 infantry regiments to serve in the war, but 16 of these had been drawn off for the campaigns in Virginia. The six regiments remaining were responsible for the defense of the entire North Carolina coastline. Only a fraction of one regiment, the 7th North Carolina Volunteers, occupied the two forts at Hatteras Inlet. The other forts were likewise only weakly held. Fewer than a thousand men garrisoned Forts Ocracoke, Hatteras, Clark, and Oregon. Reinforcements, if needed, would have to come from as far away as Beaufort.Trotter, Ironclads and Columbiads, p. 19. Strangely, the military authorities in North Carolina did little to keep the poor state of their defenses secret. Several Yankee captains, victims of either capture or shipwreck, were loosely detained at or near Hatteras Island while awaiting return to their homes. They were allowed virtually free access to the forts, and made mental notes of everything. When they returned to the North, at least two of them gave full and valuable descriptions to the Navy Department.ORN I, v. 6, pp. 78‚Äì80. Northern reaction The depredations on Northern commerce emanating from Hatteras Inlet could not pass unnoticed. Insurance underwriters pressured Union Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles for remedy.ORN I, v. 6, pp. 77‚Äì78. Welles needed no prodding. He already had on his desk a report from the Blockade Strategy Board suggesting a way to perfect the blockade of the North Carolina coast. The board recommended that the coast be rendered useless to the South by sinking old, useless, ballast-laden ships in the inlets to block them. Soon after he received the board's report, Secretary Welles began to implement its recommendation. He ordered Commander H. S. Stellwagen to go to the Chesapeake Bay to buy some suitable old hulks. At the same time, he was told to report his activities to Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham, commandant of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron. As such, he was the naval officer in charge of the blockade of the North Carolina coast. This was the first involvement of Stringham with what was to become the attack at Hatteras Inlet. In time, he would become the most important person in the expedition. Stringham opposed the plan to block the inlets from the beginning. He believed that the tidal currents would either sweep the impediments away or would rapidly scour new channels. As he saw it, the Rebels could not be denied access to the sounds unless the inlets were actually held by the Union. In other words, in order to establish an effective blockade in this part of North Carolina, the forts that the state had set up would have to be captured. Since the Navy could not do it alone, the cooperation of the Army would be needed. As it happened, the Army was willing to cooperate. Its willingness had something to do with the political general Benjamin F. Butler, who was a political force that had to be dealt with, but was already emerging as militarily incompetent. Butler was ordered to assemble a force of some 800 men for the expedition. He soon had 880: 500 from the German-speaking 20th New York Volunteers, 220 from the 9th New York Volunteers, 100 from the Union Coast Guard (an Army unit, actually the 99th New York Volunteers;ORA III, v. 1, p. 961. the U.S. Coast Guard as we know it did not exist in 1861), and 20 army regulars from the 2nd U.S. Artillery.ORA I, v. 4, p. 581. The men were put aboard two of the vessels that Commander Stellwagen had purchased, and George Peabody. When objection was made that the two ships would not be able to survive a Hatteras storm, Stellwagen pointed out that the expedition could proceed only in fair weather anyway, as a storm would prevent landings.ORN I, v. 6, p.109. While Butler was gathering his forces, Flag Officer Stringham was also making preparations. Somehow he learned that the War Department orders to Butler's superior, Major General John E. Wool, had contained the statement, \\"The expedition originated in the Navy Department, and is under its control.\\"ORA I, v. 4, p. 580. Reasoning that he would be blamed if anything went wrong, he decided to follow his own plans. He selected seven warships for the expedition: , , , , , , and . All but the last were ships of the U.S. Navy; Harriet Lane was a revenue cutter, part of the US Revenue Cutter Service.A predecessor of the US Coast Guard. He also included in his force the armed steam tug Fanny, needed to tow some of the surf boats that would be used for the landing.ORN I, v. 6, p. 120. On 26 August, the flotilla, less Susquehanna and Cumberland, departed Hampton Roads and moved down the coast to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. On the way, they were joined by Cumberland. They swung around the Cape on 27 August and anchored near the inlet, in full view of the defenders there. Colonel William F. Martin of the 7th North Carolina Infantry, commanding at Forts Hatteras and Clark, knew that his 580 or so men would need help, so he called for reinforcements from Forts Ocracoke and Oregon. Unfortunately for him and his garrison, communication among the forts was slow, and the first reinforcements did not arrive until late the next day, when it was too late.

Stringham kept his ships moving in a loop, with Wabash towing Cumberland. About 11:00 a.m., USS Susquehanna \\"made her number\\" and joined in. The ships would deliver their broadsides against the fort, move back out of range to reload, and then come back in to fire again. By remaining in motion, they did not let the artillerymen in the fort correct their aim between shots, and thereby negated much of the traditional advantage of shore-based guns over those on ships. This tactic had been used previously by the British and French at the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, but this was the first time it was used by the US Navy.ORN I, v. 6, p. 121. The return fire from Fort Clark was ineffectual, either falling short or passing overhead, and no hits were made on the bombarding ships. Shortly after noon, the defenders ran low on ammunition, and about 12:25 p.m. they ran out completely. At this point, they abandoned the fort, some fleeing to Fort Hatteras, while others took to boats. Col. Max Weber, commanding the Federal troops already on shore, noted this and put some men in to take possession, but the fleet did not know this and continued firing for another five minutes. It was during this interval of confusion that the landing force suffered its only casualty, one of the soldiers being seriously wounded in the hand by a shell fragment. Fortunately, some of the troops were able to get the attention of the gunners on the ships by waving a large American flag, and the bombardment stopped with no further harm done.ORA I, v. 4, p. 589. Stringham and his captains then turned their attention to Fort Hatteras. The Union fleet bombards Fort Hatteras Meanwhile, the landings were not going well. Only about a third of the troops were ashore when rising winds produced surf that swamped and overturned the landing boats, and General Butler had to suspend further attempts to land. Colonel Weber found that he had only 318 men with him. The number included 102 from his own regiment, the 20th New York, but also 68 from the 9th New York, 28 from the Union Coast Guard, 45 artillerymen, 45 marines, and 28 sailors who could man heavy guns. With several field pieces that they had managed to wrestle ashore through the surf, they could reasonably well defend themselves against a Confederate counterattack, but they were too weak to mount an attack on Fort Hatteras. At Fort Hatteras, Stringham kept his ships moving as he had done at Fort Clark. The defenders tried to conserve their ammunition by firing only sporadically, so Stringham thought that perhaps the fort had been abandoned. (No flag was flying. Before the battle, the old flag had been reduced to tatters, and was never replaced.) He sent Monticello into the inlet to sound it out, but then the fort came again to life. The ship grounded while trying to extricate herself, and in this condition she was struck by five shots. None of these did any permanent damage, although several sailors received minor wounds.ORN I, v. 6, p. 123. As the day came to a close, the fleet drew off in the face of threatening weather, the exhausted defenders looked for reinforcements, and the Federal troops ashore went to sleep supperless, with water running low, and dreading the reinforcements that their opponents hoped for. After sunset, and second day Sometime after dark, reinforcements began to arrive at the fort. The gunboat CSS Warren Winslow brought in some of the garrison from Fort Ocracoke, and some of the sailors also stayed to help man the guns. This brought the number of men in the fort up to more than 700, with more expected from New Bern. Accompanying the additional troops was Flag Officer Samuel Barron, commanding the coast defenses of North Carolina and Virginia. Colonel Martin, pleading exhaustion, requested Barron to assume command. He did so, still believing that with the additional troops from New Bern they would be able to retake Fort Clark. Fort Hatteras surrenders Dawn of the second day blasted the hopes of the defenders. The weather moderated enough that the Union fleet could return and resume its bombardment; they were also able to drive off the transport bringing reinforcements. (Somehow a ship was able to get in, but rather than bringing in more troops she carried away some of the wounded.) The fleet initially kept in motion, but they soon found that they were out of range of the guns in the fort. After that, the ships did not alter their positions, but poured their fire into the fort with no danger of reply. There was nothing the men in the forts could do except endure. After about three hours, Barron called a council of the officers, and they decided to seek terms, even though casualties had been quite light. (The actual numbers of dead and wounded are known only very imprecisely. Various reports give the number of dead as from four to seven, and the wounded as from 20 to 45)Trotter, Ironclads and Columbiads, p. 38. At a little after 11:00 a.m., the white flag was shown. Butler insisted upon surrender, which Barron agreed to. The battle came to a close, and the survivors went into prisoner-of-war camps. The list of prisoners had 691 names, including those wounded but not evacuated.ORA I, v. 4, pp. 592‚Äì594. Aftermath Butler and Stringham left immediately after the battle, the former to Washington and the latter accompanying the prisoners to New York. Critics argued that each was trying to gather credit for the victory to himself. The pair contended, however, that they were trying to persuade the administration to abandon the original plan to block up Hatteras Inlet. In Federal hands it was no longer useful to the Confederacy, and in fact now allowed Union forces to pursue raiders into the sounds. Although they and their supporters continued to press the case for several weeks, it seems to have been unnecessary. The War and Navy Departments had already decided to retain possession of the inlet, which would be used as the entry point of an amphibious expedition against the North Carolina mainland early the next year. This campaign, known as Burnside's North Carolina Expedition for its senior Army commander Ambrose E. Burnside, completely removed the sounds as sources of commerce-raiding activity. Continued Federal possession of Hatteras Inlet was considerably aided by the Confederate authorities, who early decided that the Ocracoke and Oregon batteries were indefensible, so they were abandoned.Trotter, Ironclads and Columbiads, p. 40. Stringham's tactic of keeping his ships in motion while bombarding forts was used later by Flag Officer Samuel Francis Du Pont at Port Royal, South Carolina. The effectiveness of the practice led to a reconsideration of the value of fixed forts against naval gunnery. No physical evidence of the battle remains; however, the battlefield is preserved within Cape Hatteras National Seashore.

His career record was 161 wins (with 83 knockouts), 44 losses and 19 draws. In 2003, Wright ranked #95 on The Ring magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time. Early years and family Wright was born in Willcox, Arizona, though a few sources erroneously give Wright's place of birth as Durango, Colorado or Durango, Mexico), the youngest of seven children born to James (\\"Jim\\") and Clara Wright (n√©e Martin). Wright's maternal grandfather, Caleb Baines Martin, was a runaway slave from Natchez, Mississippi who fled to the Arizona Territory shortly before the Civil War. After serving in the Union Army as a Buffalo Soldier, he homesteaded 160 acres in Graham County, Arizona. He bought cattle from Colonel Henry Hooker and established a dairy ranch on the property (which eventually grew to 640 acres), making him the first African American ranch owner in Southwest Arizona. He supplied dairy produce to Fort Grant and surrounding settlers. Wright's father was born in Mexico and also raised cattle. Wright's mother worked as a housekeeper. Shortly after Wright's birth, his father left the family. Around 1918, Clara Wright moved her children to Colton, California. It was there that Wright developed a love for boxing. Professional career Wright began his professional boxing career at the age of 16, boxing for the San Bernardino Boxing Club.Real name Albert Martin in \\"Chalky Wright, Ex-Featherweight King Dies in Accidental Drowning\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 39, 13 August 1957 The five-foot, 7¬Ω-inch Wright was unusually tall for his 126-pound weight, giving him a long reach. His first fight took place on February 23, 1928 against Nilo Balle, who he defeated in four rounds. Wright began fighting on the East Coast of the United States in 1938, losing a knockout to Henry Armstrong. Armstrong, however was impressed with his boxing style, and began using Wright as a sparring partner. Impressed with his technique, Armstrong's manager Eddie Walker picked up Wright as a client. He began winning again, and by 1938 was moving up rapidly in the ranks.Roberts, James, and Skutt, Alexander G., The Boxing Register, ((2006), McBooks, Press, Ithaca, New York, pgs. 662-7 By 1941, he was among the world's top featherweight boxers. He beat Sal Bartolo on May 22 at Madison Square Garden to get a chance at the New York State Athletic Commission featherweight championship then held by Joey Archibald. The modest crowd of 4,000 booed the decision for Wright, favoring the younger, whiter, and more regional Italian Bartolo from Boston.\\"Gus Notches Fifteen Round Win\\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 32, 23 May 1941 Wright's pre-match regimen was described as \\"unorthodox\\" by the Baltimore Afro-American. Before the Terranova fight Chalky was in and out of the Hotel Theresa bar for four days. He smoked evil smelling, twisted cigars. He drank freely of whatever his palate called for. He went where he wanted as late as 2 and 3 a.m., and then climbed into the ring at the Garden to put on a master exhibition of boxing and hitting power. Taking the world featherweight title, September 1941 On September 11, 1941, Wright dethroned reigning New York State Athletic Commission's (NYSAC) world featherweight champion Joey Archibald with a TKO in the eleventh round in Washington, D.C., taking the featherweight title, as recognized by the NYSAC and Maryland. A left hook to the body and a right to the jaw ended the eleventh, 54 seconds after the bell. Wright had kept his left jabbing and hooking to the face of his opponent and his rights to the body were equally punishing. Archibald fought back well after the first few rounds, and showed excellent footwork, but was unable to hurt or slow Wright.\\"Joey Archibald Outclassed by Chalky Wright in Washington\\", The Courier-News, Bridgewater, New Jersey, pg. 21, 12 September 1941 Wright successfully defended the title against former champion Harry Jeffra gaining a tenth-round technical knockout on June 19, 1942 in Baltimore. The first six rounds remained somewhat close, but Jeffra was badly hurt in the seventh and eighth, as he lost his speed and fell victim to Wright. Jeffra was floored for a count of nine in the ninth, and his defeat looked in inevitable, as Wright continued to bang away at him after he arose for the rest of the round. As Wright continued to land blows against the nearly defenseless Jeffra in the opening of the tenth, the referee stopped the bout, coming between the contestants to end the match.\\"Chalky Wright Knocks Out Henry Jeffra in Tenth\\", The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 13, 20 June 1942 Before a crowd of 12,000, Wright successfully defended his title again on September 25, 1942 against LuLu Constantino in a fifteen-round split decision at Madison Square Garden. The Associated Press gave Wright nine rounds, with five to Constantino, and one even. Wright did most of his work from the fifth round on, and clearly had the edge in the eighth through fifteenth.\\"Chalky Wright Saves Title\\", The Montana Standard, Butte, Montana, pg. 10, 26 September 1942 =Losing the world featherweight title, November 1942= He lost his title in a fifteen-round unanimous decision before a crowd of 19,000, Willie Pep, eight years his junior, on November 20, 1942 at Madison Square Garden. Pep, who made his fiftieth straight victory, used brilliant blocking and adroit shifting of his body along the ropes to defend the strong punching of his opponent. Pep used well timed left jabs effectively at many points in the bout, which was not entirely one-sided. The Associated Press gave Wright four rounds, including the fifth through seventh, but strongly favored Pep, who won decisively, with eleven.AP gave Pep eleven rounds in Cuddy, Jack, \\"Pep Beats Chalky, Plans Miami Trip\\", Times Herald, Olean, New York, pg. 6, 21 November 1922\\"Willie Pep Defeats Chalky Wright\\", Dunkirk Evening Observer, Dunkirk, New York, pg. 12, 21 November 1942 Still fighting in 1946, he won only two of eleven remaining fights, bucking the odds and continuing to box as he turned an \\"ancient\\" thirty-four years of age. He finally retired March 9, 1948, after losing to Ernie Hunick when he did not answer the bell for the fourth round. Post boxing career After his retirement, Wright worked as a trainer for lightweight contender Tommy Campbell. In January 1954, Jet magazine reported that Wright claimed he had written his autobiography, Me and You, under the pen name \\"Jay Caldwell\\". The book remains unreleased. In October 1954, Wright opened a bar in Los Angeles called the \\"Knockout Lounge\\". He claimed that all of the bartenders were ex-boxers. By the mid-1950s, Wright had gambled away the fortune he had earned as a boxer. At the time of his death, he was working in a Los Angeles bakery. Personal life Wright was married twice and had one child. His first marriage, which ended in divorce, was to Gertrude \\"Gert\\" Arnold. His subsequent marriage to Jennie Batch in 1937 produced a son, Albert James. They were separated at the time of his death. Confidential magazine scandal In the 1930s, Wright became friendly with actress Mae West. West was a boxing fan and helped to finance Wright's boxing career. He eventually became her live-in bodyguard and chauffeur for a time. The two reportedly began a romantic relationship though both publicly denied this. In November 1955, the popular tabloid Confidential wrote an expos√©, titled \\"Mae West's Open Door Policy\\". The story, intended to raise scandal and arouse interest, described West's live-in love affair with the \\"bronze boxer\\" and how she frequently gave Wright hundreds of dollars to gamble. West denied the story and sued for libel and defamation. She won the suit and Confidential published a retraction. In August 1957, a highly publicized criminal libel case was brought against Confidential to expose the tactics used by the magazine's writers. Celebrity testimony was to include that of both West and Wright. Though Wright died before he could testify, West testified a writer for Confidential had approached Wright falsely claiming he wanted information on West for a biographical film. West noted that Wright was paid $200 for the information, but insisted \\"...he didn't say any of the things they claim he did.\\" Early death from drowning By 1957, Wright was in ill health, and had been hospitalized in July for a heart condition.\\"Chalky Wright, L.A. Ring Great Dies\\", The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, pg. 34, 13 August 1957 On August 12, 1957, Wright's mother found his body in the bathtub in her Los Angeles apartment. His head was submerged underwater and the tap was running. Rumors of foul play and suicide immediately began to surface as Wright was scheduled to testify in the high-profile libel suit against Confidential magazine. These rumors were furthered when Wright's first wife Gert Arnold, who was expected to testify, claimed she received an anonymous phone call from a \\"gruff voiced man\\" who told her \\"...if you know what's good for you, you'll clam up about this whole thing.\\" It was later determined that Wright, who had been hospitalized for a heart condition six weeks before his death, suffered a heart attack while in the bathtub causing him to slip and fall. He then struck his head on the tap, which rendered him unconscious, and he drowned. Investigators noted that Wright had attempted to stop himself from falling by grabbing a towel rack which was found pulled from the wall. His death was ruled accidental. Wright's funeral was held on August 26. Baptist minister Henry Armstrong, a former sparring partner, and opponent, delivered the eulogy. He was buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Carson, California. Honors Wright was inducted into the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1976 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2003, The Ring ranked Wright #95 on their 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time list. In 2012, Wright was inducted into the Colton, California Sports Hall of Fame.

The book is based on the life of the author Henry James. It was released at about the same time as The Master by Colm T√≥ib√≠n and other books about James, and Lodge wrote The Year of Henry James: The Story of a Novel about this. Lodge populates his novel with several of the most famous figures of English literature from the time of the book's setting in the late nineteenth century. Plot summary The novel opens with a framing device wherein we are shown what is happening in the London home of the dying novelist at the beginning of World War I. One of the servant staff in James' house has taken a crude but sincere interest in discovering what her employer's books are all about and takes to reading one of his more famous stories, \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\". This story, whose hero is obsessed by a paranoid belief that his life will be marked by an unknown catastrophe, provides the opening for the novel proper to begin. Now we proceed back in time to the middle years of James' life and are introduced to a large and interesting group of James' literary acquaintances from his period of expatriation in England. Among those we meet are George du Maurier, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells and Robert Louis Stevenson. The long and productive friendship between James and du Maurier is described in great detail, including the story of du Maurier's deteriorating eyesight which threatens his livelihood as a cartoonist for the magazine Punch. He is finally driven to write fiction himself and he astonishes James and the entire literary world by producing the bestselling novel Trilby. Much of Lodge's book is built upon James' own obsession with attracting a larger readership than his opaque books have yet garnered and the success of Trilby both baffles and annoys him. Meanwhile, James is writing prolifically himself with little comparable financial or critical success. We are given a long and funny account of James' humiliating quest to write a popular play for the London stage. There is an ironic and entertaining distance set up here between James' feelings of failure and inadequacy and what we now know about his final reputation. While du Maurier and Trilby have all but faded from the public view, James' body of work has continued to attract readers worldwide and his position as one of the most important figures in literature is now secure. In this sense, the novel can be seen as both an homage and as an artistic attempt to rescue the historical James from his own feeling of obscurity. The book also includes a portrait of the friendship that James formed during this time with the American author Constance Fenimore Woolson. Lodge suggests that their relationship had a romantic (but unconsummated) dimension. As in real life, Woolson commits suicide while traveling in Italy and this leads James to wonder what connection, if any, there might have been between her death and her feelings for him. Lodge's depiction of their relationship allows him subtly to explore James' alleged lifelong virginity and to conjecture somewhat about his notorious prudishness.

McClellan suffered a humiliating defeat. The operation was planned as a minor reconnaissance across the Potomac to establish whether the Confederates were occupying the strategically important position of Leesburg.https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil- war/battles/balls-bluff A false report of an unguarded Confederate camp encouraged Brigadier General Charles Pomeroy Stone to order a raid, which resulted in a clash with enemy forces. A prominent U.S. Senator in uniform, Colonel Edward Baker, tried to reinforce the Union troops, but failed to ensure that there were enough boats for the river crossings, which were then delayed. Baker was killed,https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/10-facts-battle-balls-bluff and a newly-arrived Confederate unit routed the rest of Stone‚Äôs expedition. The Union losses, although modest by later standards, alarmed Congress, which set-up the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a body which would provoke years of bitter political infighting. Background Three months after the First Battle of Bull Run, Major General George B. McClellan was building up the Army of the Potomac in preparation for an eventual advance into Virginia. On October 19, 1861, McClellan ordered Brigadier General George A. McCall to march his division to Dranesville, Virginia, twelve miles southeast of Leesburg, in order to discover the purpose of recent Confederate troop movements which indicated that Colonel Nathan \\"Shanks\\" Evans might have abandoned Leesburg. Evans had, in fact, left the town on October 16‚Äì17 but had done so on his own authority. When Confederate Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard expressed his displeasure at this move, Evans returned. By the evening of October 19, he had taken up a defensive position on the Alexandria- to-Winchester Turnpike (modern-day State Route 7) east of town. McClellan came to Dranesville to consult with McCall that same evening and ordered McCall to return to his main camp at Langley, Virginia, the following morning. However, McCall requested additional time to complete some mapping of the roads in the area and, as a result, did not actually leave for Langley until the morning of October 21, just as the fighting at Ball's Bluff was heating up. On October 20, while McCall was completing his mapping, McClellan ordered Brigadier General Charles Pomeroy Stone to conduct what he called \\"a slight demonstration\\" in order to see how the Confederates might react.https://armyhistory.org/disaster-at-balls-bluff-21-october-1861/ Stone moved troops to the river at Edwards Ferry, positioned other forces along the river, had his artillery fire into suspected Confederate positions, and briefly crossed about a hundred men of the 1st Minnesota to the Virginia shore just before dusk. Having gotten no reaction from Colonel Evans with all of this activity, Stone recalled his troops to their camps and the \\"slight demonstration\\" came to an end. Stone then ordered Colonel Charles Devens of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry, stationed on Harrison's Island, facing Ball's Bluff, to send a patrol across the river at that point to gather what information it could about enemy deployments. Devens sent Captain Chase Philbrick and approximately 20 men to carry out Stone's order. Advancing in the dark nearly a mile inland from the bluff, the inexperienced Philbrick mistook a row of trees for the tents of a Confederate camp and, without verifying what he saw, returned and reported the existence of a camp. Stone immediately ordered Devens to cross some 300 men and, as soon as it was light enough to see, attack the camp and, per his orders, \\"return to your present position.\\" This was the genesis of the Battle of Ball's Bluff. Contrary to the long-held traditional interpretation, it did not come from a plan by either McClellan or Stone to take Leesburg. The initial crossing of troops was a small reconnaissance. That was followed by what was intended to be a raiding party.Morgan, \\"A Little Short of Boats,\\" Ironclad Publ.Co., 2004, pp. 73‚Äì6. To make matters worse, Stone was not advised that McCall and his division had been ordered back to Washington.Sears, \\"Controversies & Commanders\\" Houghton Mifflin Co., 1999, pp 33‚Äì34. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle A map of the battle On the morning of October 21, Colonel Devens' raiding party discovered the mistake made the previous evening by the patrol; There was no camp to raid. Opting not to recross the river immediately, Devens deployed his men in a tree line and sent a messenger back to report to Stone and get new instructions. On hearing the messenger's report, Stone sent him back to tell Devens that the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts (another 350 men) would cross the river and move to his position. When they arrived, Devens was to turn his raiding party back into a reconnaissance and move toward Leesburg. While the messenger was going back to Col. Devens with this new information, Colonel and U.S. Senator Edward Dickinson Baker showed up at Stone's camp to find out about the morning's events. He had not been involved in any of the activities to that point. Stone told him of the mistake about the camp and about his new orders to reinforce Devens for reconnaissance purposes. He then instructed Baker to go to the crossing point, evaluate the situation, and either withdraw the troops already in Virginia or cross additional troops at his discretion. On the way upriver to execute this order, Baker met Devens' messenger coming back a second time to report that Devens and his men had encountered and briefly engaged the enemy, one company (Co. K) of the 17th Mississippi Infantry. Baker immediately ordered as many troops as he could find to cross the river, but he did so without determining what boats were available to do this. A bottleneck quickly developed so that Union troops could only cross slowly and in small numbers, making the crossing last throughout the day. Meanwhile, Devens's men (now about 650 strong) remained in its advanced position and engaged in two additional skirmishes with a growing force of Confederates, while other Union troops crossed the river but deployed near the bluff and did not advance from there. Devens finally withdrew around 2:00 p.m. and met Baker, who had finally crossed the river half an hour later. Beginning around 3:00 the fighting began in earnest and was almost continuous until just after dark. Col. Baker was killed at about 4:30 p.m. and remains the only United States Senator ever killed in battle. Following an abortive attempt to break out of their constricted position around the bluff, the Federals began to recross the river in some disarray. Shortly before dark, a fresh Confederate regiment (the 17th Mississippi) arrived and formed the core of the climactic assault that finally broke and routed the Union troops. Many of the Union soldiers were driven down the steep slope at the southern end of Ball's Bluff (behind the current location of the national cemetery) and into the river. Boats attempting to cross back to Harrison Island were soon swamped and capsized. Many Federals, included some of the wounded, were drowned. Bodies floated downriver to Washington and even as far as Mt. Vernon in the days following the battle. A total of 223 Federals were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were captured on the banks of the Potomac later that night. The official records incorrectly state that only 49 Federals were killed at this battle, an error probably resulting from a mistaken reading of the report of the Union burial detail which crossed over the next day under flag of truce.The Medical and Surgical History of the Civil War, Broadfoot Publ.

Baker at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, by Currier and Ives This Union defeat was relatively minor in comparison to the battles to come in the war, but it had an enormously wide impact in and out of military affairs.https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-balls-bluff.htm In addition to losing 223 soldiers, the Union lost a sitting senator, which led to severe political ramifications in Washington. Stone was treated as the scapegoat for the defeat, but members of Congress suspected that there was a conspiracy to betray the Union. The ensuing outcry, and a desire to learn why Federal forces had lost battles at Bull Run (Manassas), Wilson's Creek, and Ball's Bluff, led to the establishment of the Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which would bedevil Union officers for the remainder of the war (particularly those who were Democrats) and contribute to nasty political infighting among the generals in the high command. Lt. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, survived a nearly fatal wound at Ball's Bluff to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1902. Herman Melville's poem \\"Ball's Bluff ‚Äì A Reverie\\" (published in 1866) commemorates the battle. Holmes' great friend and role model, Lt. Henry Livermore Abbott also survived the battle but did not survive the war. In 1865, Abbott was posthumously promoted to Brigadier General. Another outstanding young officer named Edmund Rice also eventually reached the rank of Brigadier General, was awarded the Medal of Honor and was fortunate enough to survive the war by near a half century. 2nd Lt. John William Grout of the 15th Massachusetts was killed in the battle; his death inspired a poem (and later a song) titled \\"The Vacant Chair\\".

Along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the Maryland side, it was rumored that ghosts of departed soldiers from that battle, particularly those who drowned in one of the boats that sank in the Potomac River, haunted that area, so canal workers did not stay in that area overnight, and tied up their boats for the night elsewhere. p. 68-69 NotesReferences *Eicher, David J., The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War, Simon & Schuster, 2001, .

E. B. Stuart and Union forces under Brigadier General Edward O. C. Ord on December 20, 1861, in Fairfax County, Virginia, as part of Major General George B. McClellan's operations in northern Virginia. The two forces on similar winter- time patrols encountered and engaged one another in the crossroads village of Dranesville. The battle resulted in a Union victory. Background Approximate site of the battle, seen in 2017 Following the Battle of Ball's Bluff on October 21, major offensive action was halted in the eastern theater, as both armies went into winter quarters. Small detachments were still occasionally sent out to probe the enemy's position and to obtain forage. Such was the case early on the morning of December 20 when General Stuart, with a mixed brigade of infantry comprising the regiments of the 6th South Carolina, 1st Kentucky, 10th Alabama, and 11th Virginia, 150 of his cavalry troopers and Allen S. Cutts's four-gun Georgia battery, set out north from their position near Centreville to escort the army's wagons trains on a foraging expedition into Loudoun County. Meanwhile, General Ord, leading the 10,000 strong 3rd Brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves set out west from Langley to clear the south bank of the Potomac River of Confederate pickets and partisans in Fairfax and Loudoun. At Colvin Run Mill, Ord left half his force to protect his rear and prevent his force from being cut off from their base at Langley. Opposing forces=Union Brigadier General Edward O. C.

Matz, Otto H., 1895 At about noon, Ord arrived at the intersection of the Georgetown Pike and Leesburg Pike in the village of Dranesville, where he encountered Stuart's advance cavalry pickets, which were quickly driven off by the Union force. Ord then began to lead his command west, down the Leesburg Pike. At around 1 p.m. Stuart, with the main body of his force approached Dranesville from the south, whereupon he encountered the rear of the Union detachment. Ord halted his infantry and wheeled it around to meet the Confederate threat, forming a line on the north side of the Leesburg Pike. He then deployed his artillery on an eminence near the intersection. Stuart deployed his infantry on the south side of the pike and his artillery 300 yards south of the federal position. While the Confederate infantry was deploying, the 6th South Carolina mistook the 1st Kentucky for Union troops and opened fire, which was quickly returned by the Kentuckians. Hearing the sound of gunfire, the 9th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment charged across the turnpike but were quickly driven back. The artillery then began to duel, but owing to the strength of the Union position, the Confederate guns were quickly knocked out. Ord deployed his infantry in a skirmish line and sent it across the Pike at Stuart and the two sides squared off for nearly 2 hours. At 3 p.m., with his wagons safely away and secure from capture, Stuart ordered a withdrawal. Ord pursued for a half mile, ensuring his line of retreat was safe, before breaking off the attack and returning to Langley. The following day Stuart returned with reinforcements, but the battle was already over. Results Though the battle was small, of no strategic importance and resulted in only light casualties, it marked the first time in the east that a Union force had bested their Confederate enemy, inflicting 230 casualties while suffering only 71, and was able to drive them from the field. -https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/dranesville NotesReferences *Salmon, John S.

It sometimes has formed cups called a bralette for cleavage with an attached, loose-fitting skirt falling in length usually between the belly button and upper thigh. The garment is often trimmed with lace, ruffles, appliques, marabou, bows, and ribbons, optionally with spaghetti straps. Sometimes it is made of sheer or translucent fabric such as nylon or chiffon or silk. History The creation of the super-short nightgown is attributed to the American lingerie designer Sylvia Pedlar, who produced them in 1942 in response to fabric shortages during World War II. Although her designs became known as \\"babydolls\\", Pedlar disliked the name and did not use it. The name was popularized by the 1956 movie Baby Doll, starring Carroll Baker in the title role as a 19-year-old nymphet. This marked the beginning of the enduring popularity of the style for adults. Babydoll pajamas in the 1950s through the 1960s consisted of a top and a loose fitting short bloomer bottom with elasticized waist and legs. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the bloomer bottom was replaced by closer fitting briefs with elastic waist and legs. The most recent versions of babydoll pajamas have eliminated the elastic on the legs, the bottoms being either shorts or tap pants. Babydolls became a prominent part of the \\"kinderwhore\\" look during the early-to-mid-1990s, due to the popularity of riot Grrrl and grunge performers such as Courtney Love and Kat Bjelland. Contemporary styles Babydolls are now considered an eroticized item of adult apparel, often classified as a form of lingerie. Adult babydolls are quite different from the infant babydolls; they fully expose the woman's legs, and some styles emphasize or deliberately expose the breasts as well. The gown is often sold as a set with matching panties, as a typical babydoll is short enough that underwear is visible if worn. Styles of the same general length but not intended to emphasize sex appeal are sometimes called shortie nightgowns. Babydolls are available in a sufficiently wide variety of styles that many lingerie retailers consider babydolls a distinct department. Modern babydolls often vary considerably from the styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Babydoll negligees from the 1950s to the early 1980s are now collectible vintage items. Some babydolls open in front and resemble a robe or peignoir. Short daywear dresses of a similar style are sometimes called babydoll dresses; the name is sometimes two words, baby doll, and sometimes hyphenated, baby-doll. Some styles are similar to what is worn by some infants; and by dolls designed like infants. The gown or top is short enough that diapers may be easily changed. An alternative origin for the style may be the lace-trimmed shortie bedjackets and bed-capes of the 1930s and 1940s. In the 21st century, babydolls have become popular as bridal lingerie. They are more affordable than a bridal corset and often offer a greater choice of designs and colours.

The word comes from French peigner, to comb the hair (from Latin pectinƒÅre, from pecten, pectin-, comb) describing a garment worn while brushing one's hair, originally referring to a dressing gown or bathrobe. Very high-end peignoirs were occasionally sold with sheer long gloves and stockings made of the same material as the peignoir itself for wear to bed or on occasions where the wearer would be seen in her nightclothes, such as visiting or while sharing accommodations during travel during the mid-19th to mid 20th centuries. Contemporary peignoirs are usually sold with matching nightgown or panties. In popular culture A peignoir is worn by Edna Pontellier, protagonist of the novel The Awakening by Kate Chopin (1899), mostly as a dressing gown. \\"Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. She began to cry a little, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir. Blowing out the candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare feet into a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch...\\" In Arnold Bennett's novel The Old Wives' Tale (1908), the character Sophia Baines, an Englishwoman living in Paris, associates the peignoir with loose living and idleness even though she wears one herself: \\"She decided that on the morrow she would dress herself 'properly,' and never again wear a peignoir; the peignoir and all that it represented, disgusted her.\\" In Max Beerbohm's novel Zuleika Dobson, the chief character, Zuleika, is described in chapter one in a scene set in Judas College, Oxford, as resting \\"in a white peignoir tied with a blue sash...in a great chintz chair, gazing out of the bay window\\". It is also mentioned in opening chapters of the novel Tender Is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, where it is described in the context of beach attire. A peignoir is notably featured in the opening stanza of the poem \\"Sunday Morning\\" by Wallace Stevens. In John Fowles' 1969 postmodern historical fiction novel The French Lieutenant's Woman, set in 1867, Ernestina Freeman wears a peignoir in chapter five. In Fawlty Towers a flirtatious Frenchwoman has the character name \\"Mrs. Peignoir\\". In the episode of Frasier entitled \\"The Seal Who Came to Dinner\\", Frasier and Niles dress a dead seal in Niles's absent wife's peignoir to avert the attention of the guests attending his exclusive dinner party, leading to accusations that he had murdered her. In the episode of Columbo entitled \\"Death Hits the Jackpot\\" (December 1991), Columbo is thinking about possible anniversary presents for his wife, and is taken aback to learn that a nightie and peignoir would cost him $425. In a 1988 Doonesbury cartoon strip, the inept Jeremy Cavendish gives Lacy Davenport a peignoir while they are attending a game on their second date. In City of Bones by Cassandra Clare, Isabelle Lightwood wears a \\"pink peignoir set\\" when devising battle strategies to secure the Mortal Cup. In the episode \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" of Sherlock, Irene Adler is briefly seen wearing a green peignoir (a vintage lace model by famed lingerie designer Janet Reger).http://www.sherlockology.com/wardrobe/lace-peignoir-irene-adler In The Small House at Allington by Anthony Trollope, Alexandria is wearing a peignoir when Mr. Crosbie visits her and her mother in the mother‚Äôs bedroom at Courcy Castle to discuss their engagement.

In biology, the thorax of an insect, or a protective band of enlarged scales in the shoulder region of a fish. In female clothing, a corselet, or corselette, is a type of foundation garment, sharing elements of both bras and girdles. It extends from straps over the shoulders down the torso to stop around the top of the legs. It may incorporate lace in front or in back. As an undergarment, a corselet can be open-style (with suspenders attached) or panty style. History The missing-link between corset and corselette from 1914 The origin of the English word for the piece of armor comes from cors, an Old French word meaning \\"bodice\\". The modern term probably originated by the addition of the diminutive suffix \\"-ette\\" to the word corset, itself of similar origin to \\"corselet\\". The corselet as an item of women's clothing began to gain traction in 1914, as a substitute for wearing two separate pieces (a bra with either a girdle or a corset). The bust uplift cups were first introduced in 1933, but did not become common until 1943.Bust Upliftss:Spirella Catalogue (1933) Merry widow A corselet was released by Warner's in 1952,Store Operations: Cinch Bra Gets Glamour Treatment. (1952, March 18). Women‚Äôs Wear Daily, 84(54), 67. named after The Merry Widow, a 1905 operetta which has been adapted several times into feature-length films. \\"Merry widow\\" remains a common generic term for a corsetry type garment in the United States, or a \\"basque\\" in the UK. It is usually strapless, and stopping on the hips, rather than extending below the hip line, like the typical corselet. A merry widow type garment is normally fastened by hooks and eyes at the rear, and because it is strapless, it needs to be well boned to prevent it from rolling over, the boning helping to support the demi-cup section. A merry widow / basque would also incorporate suspenders/garters for attaching to stockings. This type of lingerie is also known as a torsolette, and is used in bridal lingerie, much like the bustier. The original merry widow was a corselet incorporating slim panels of black, elastic yarn netting. A heavy- duty zipper was inserted behind a velvet-backed hook-and-eye flange, and the entire garment was lined with nylon voile. Nine long, spiral wires were encased in black satin. Lana Turner, star of the 1952 film adaptation of The Merry Widow, is reported to have said in 1989, \\"I'm telling you, the merry widow was designed by a man. A woman would never do that to another woman.\\" Interval and rebirth Around 1960, tights and trousers began to replace corselets. However, Maidenform and other mainstream lingerie and undergarment manufacturers have sold corselets as \\"control slips\\" since around 1975.

Polka dots are commonly seen on children's clothing, toys, furniture, ceramics, and Central European folk art but they appear in a wide array of contexts. The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, however, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as bathing suits and lingerie. Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal clothing. Etymology It is likely that the term originated in popularity of polka dance at the time the pattern became fashionable, just as many other products and fashions of the era also adopted the \\"polka\\" name.  Usage  Fr√©d√©ric Bazille's 1867 painting Family Reunion, containing two women in blue polka dot dresses In 1962, DC Comics introduced Polka-Dot Man with irregularly-sized and differently coloured dots. Some people associate polka dots with Venezuelan fashion designer Carolina Herrera, who used polka dots on most of her dresses during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as on the boxes of perfume Carolina Herrera, Herrera For Men, Aquaflore and Flore. Much of the Japanese artist's Yayoi Kusama's work features a polka dot motif. The polka dot also appears in popular music. \\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\\" is a novelty song telling the story of a shy girl in a very revealing bathing suit who stays immersed in the ocean water to hide from view. It was written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss and first released in June 1960 by Brian Hyland. Before that however, \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\\" was a popular song with music by Jimmy Van Heusen and lyrics by Johnny Burke, published in 1940. It was Frank Sinatra's first hit recorded with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. The song is one of the top 100 most- frequently recorded jazz standards with arrangements by Gil Evans and others and notable recordings by Lester Young, Sarah Vaughn and many others. The 1943 Twentieth Century Fox Technicolor musical film The Gang's All Here, directed by Busby Berkeley, featured a large production number \\"The Polka-Dot Polka\\". The song was written by Harry Warren and Leo Robin, referencing the 19th Century Polka Dot craze in the lyric, and sang by Alice Faye with the Busby Berkeley dancers.

The essential spectrum of self-adjoint operators In formal terms, let X be a Hilbert space and let T be a self- adjoint operator on X. Definition The essential spectrum of T, usually denoted œÉess(T), is the set of all complex numbers Œª such that :T-\\\\lambda I_X is not a Fredholm operator, where I_X denotes the identity operator on X, so that I_X(x)=x for all x in X. (An operator is Fredholm if its kernel and cokernel are finite-dimensional.) Properties The essential spectrum is always closed, and it is a subset of the spectrum. Since T is self-adjoint, the spectrum is contained on the real axis. The essential spectrum is invariant under compact perturbations. That is, if K is a compact self-adjoint operator on X, then the essential spectra of T and that of T+K coincide. This explains why it is called the essential spectrum: Weyl (1910) originally defined the essential spectrum of a certain differential operator to be the spectrum independent of boundary conditions. Weyl's criterion for the essential spectrum is as follows. First, a number Œª is in the spectrum of T if and only if there exists a sequence {œàk} in the space X such that \\\\Vert \\\\psi_k\\\\Vert=1 and : \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left\\\\ T\\\\psi_k - \\\\lambda\\\\psi_k \\\\right\\\\ = 0. Furthermore, Œª is in the essential spectrum if there is a sequence satisfying this condition, but such that it contains no convergent subsequence (this is the case if, for example \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_k\\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal sequence); such a sequence is called a singular sequence. The discrete spectrum The essential spectrum is a subset of the spectrum œÉ, and its complement is called the discrete spectrum, so : \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{disc}}(T) = \\\\sigma(T) \\\\setminus \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess}}(T). If T is self-adjoint, then, by definition, a number Œª is in the discrete spectrum of T if it is an isolated eigenvalue of finite multiplicity, meaning that the dimension of the space : \\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi \\\\in X : T\\\\psi = \\\\lambda\\\\psi \\\\\\\\} has finite but non-zero dimension and that there is an Œµ > 0 such that Œº ‚àà œÉ(T) and Œº‚àíŒª < Œµ imply that Œº and Œª are equal. (For general nonselfadjoint operators in Banach spaces, by definition, a number \\\\lambda is in the discrete spectrum if it is a normal eigenvalue; or, equivalently, if it is an isolated point of the spectrum and the rank of the corresponding Riesz projector is finite.) The essential spectrum of closed operators in Banach spaces Let X be a Banach space and let T:\\\\,X\\\\to X be a closed linear operator on X with dense domain D(T). There are several definitions of the essential spectrum, which are not equivalent. # The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},1}(T) is the set of all Œª such that T-\\\\lambda I_X is not semi-Fredholm (an operator is semi-Fredholm if its range is closed and its kernel or its cokernel is finite-dimensional). # The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},2}(T) is the set of all Œª such that the range of T-\\\\lambda I_X is not closed or the kernel of T-\\\\lambda I_X is infinite- dimensional. # The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},3}(T) is the set of all Œª such that T-\\\\lambda I_X is not Fredholm (an operator is Fredholm if its range is closed and both its kernel and its cokernel are finite-dimensional). # The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},4}(T) is the set of all Œª such that T-\\\\lambda I_X is not Fredholm with index zero (the index of a Fredholm operator is the difference between the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the cokernel). # The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},5}(T) is the union of œÉess,1(T) with all components of \\\\C\\\\setminus \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},1}(T) that do not intersect with the resolvent set \\\\C \\\\setminus \\\\sigma(T).

For self-adjoint operators, all the above definitions of the essential spectrum coincide. Define the radius of the essential spectrum by :r_{\\\\mathrm{ess},k}(T) = \\\\max \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda : \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},k}(T) \\\\\\\\}. Even though the spectra may be different, the radius is the same for all k. The definition of the set \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},2}(T) is equivalent to Weyl's criterion: \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},2}(T) is the set of all Œª for which there exists a singular sequence. The essential spectrum \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{ess},k}(T) is invariant under compact perturbations for k = 1,2,3,4, but not for k = 5.

Spectral theory ","title":"Essential spectrum"},{"id":"1350006","text":"The Western concert flute is a family of transverse (side-blown) woodwind instruments made of metal or wood. It is the most common variant of the flute. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist (in British English), flutist (in American English), or simply a flute player. This type of flute is used in many ensembles, including concert bands, military bands, marching bands, orchestras, flute ensembles, and occasionally jazz bands and big bands. Other flutes in this family include the piccolo, alto flute, and the bass flute. A large repertory of works has been composed for flute.  Predecessors  The flute is one of the oldest and most widely used wind instruments. The precursors of the modern concert flute were keyless wooden transverse flutes similar to modern fifes. These were later modified to include between one and eight keys for chromatic notes. \\"Six-finger\\" D is the most common pitch for keyless wooden transverse flutes, which continue to be used today, particularly in Irish traditional music and historically informed performances of early music, including Baroque. During the Baroque era the traditional transverse flute was redesigned and eventually developed as the modern traverso.  Medieval flutes (1000‚Äì1400)  Throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, transverse flutes were very uncommon in Europe, with the recorder being more prominent. The transverse flute arrived in Europe from Asia via the Byzantine Empire, where it migrated to Germany and France. These flutes became known as \\"German flutes\\" to distinguish them from others, such as the recorder. The flute became used in court music, along with the viol, and was used in secular music, although only in France and Germany. It would not spread to the rest of Europe for nearly a century. The first literary appearance of the transverse flute was made in 1285 by Adenet le Roi in a list of instruments he played. After this, a period of 70 years follows in which few references to the flute are found.  Renaissance to 17th century  Beginning in the 1470s, a military revival in Europe led to a revival in the flute. The Swiss army used flutes for signalling, and this helped the flute spread to all of Europe. In the late 16th century, flutes began to appear in court and theatre music (predecessors of the orchestra), and the first flute solos. Following the 16th-century court music, flutes began appearing in chamber ensembles. These flutes were often used as the tenor voice. However, flutes varied greatly in size and range. This made transposition necessary, which led flautists to use Guidonian hexachords (used by singers and other musicians since their introduction in the 11th century) to transpose music more easily. During the 16th and early 17th centuries in Europe, the transverse flute was available in several sizes, in effect forming a consort in much the same way recorders and other instruments were used in consorts. At this stage, the transverse flute was usually made in one section (or two for the larger sizes) and had a cylindrical bore. As a result, this flute had a rather soft sound and limited range and was used primarily in compositions for the \\"soft consort\\".  Traverso  A modern copy of an 18th-century French traverso, by flute-maker Boaz Berney During the Baroque period, the transverse flute was redesigned. Now often called the traverso (from the Italian), it was made in three or four sections or joints with a conical bore from the head joint down. The conical bore design gave the flute a wider range and more penetrating sound without sacrificing the softer, expressive qualities. In addition to chamber music, the traverso began to be used in orchestral music. In the Baroque era, flutes became used in the scores of opera, ballet and chamber music. With this, composers wrote music for the flute. These included Praetorius, Sch√ºtz, Rebill√© and Descoteaux, Quantz, Bach, Telemann, Blavet, Vivaldi, Handel and Frederick the Great. In 1707, Jacques Martin Hotteterre wrote the first method book on playing the flute: Principes de la fl√ªte traversi√®re. The 1730s brought an increase in operatic and chamber music feature of flutes. The end of this era found the publication of Essay of a Method of Playing the Transverse Flute by Quantz. The orchestras formed in the last half of the 18th century included flutes which were featured in symphonies and concertos. Throughout the rest of the century, the interest in flutes increased and peaked in the early half of the 19th century. Around this time, Friedrich D√ºlon was one of the best-known flautists in Germany while, in England, Charles Nicholson was considered a super star. The early 19th century saw a great variety of flute designs. Conical bores giving a penetrating sound were used in Vienna, English flutes had a range to low C and played best in flat keys, French flutes gave a softer tone, and German flutes blended best with orchestras. With the romantic era, flutes began to lose favor: Symphony orchestras rather featured brass and strings.  Development  A 1911 illustration of a Western Classical Flute In the nineteenth century Theobald Boehm began to make flutes. Keys were added to the flute, and the taper was changed to strengthen its lower register. With the ability to record sound (beginning in the 1890s), flutes began to regain a popularity not seen since the classical era. Recordings of flute music became increasingly common, with professional flautists spending a great deal of time recording music. The 20th century brought the first recordings of Baroque music on modern flutes. Boehm flute The dimensions and key system of the modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely the work of the great flautist, composer, acoustician, and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost exactly as he designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large straight tube bore, \\"parabolic\\" tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the \\"crutch\\" for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G key over an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys. The modern flute has three octaves plus C7‚ÄìC7‚ÄìD7 in the fourth octave. Many modern composers used the high D7; while such extremes are not commonly used, the modern flute can perform up to an F7 in its fourth octave.  19th-century variants  The Meyer flute was a popular flute in the mid 19th century. Including and derived from the instruments built by H.F. Meyer from 1850 to the late 1890s, it could have up to 12 keys and was built with head joints of either metal-lined ivory or wood. The final form was a combination of a traditional keyed flute and the Viennese flute, and became the most common throughout Europe and America. This form had 12 keys, a body of wood, a head joint of metal and ivory, and was common at the end of the century. Quite at the opposite end of the spectrum, in terms of the complexity of the key system developed by Boehm, was the Giorgi flute, an advanced form of the ancient holed flute. Patented in 1897, the Giorgi flute was designed without any mechanical keys, though the patent allows for the addition of keys as options. Giorgi enabled the performer to play equally true in all musical keys, as does the Boehm system. Giorgi flutes are now rarities, found in museums and private collections. The underlying principles of both flute patterns are virtually identical, with tone holes spaced as required to produce a fully chromatic scale. The player, by opening and closing holes, adjusts the effective length of the tube, and thus the rate of oscillation, which defines the audible pitch.  Modified Boehm flute designs  In the 1950s, Albert Cooper modified the Boehm flute to make playing modern music easier. The flute was tuned to A440, and the embouchure hole was cut in a new way to change the timbre. These flutes became the most used flutes by professionals and amateurs. In the 1980s, Johan Br√∂gger modified the Boehm flute by fixing two major problems that had existed for nearly 150 years: maladjustment between certain keys and problems between the G and B keys. The result was non-rotating shafts, which gave a quieter sound and less friction on moving parts. Also, the modifications allowed for springs to be adjusted individually, and the flute was strengthened. The Br√∂gger flute is only made by the Brannen BrothersBr√∂gger flutes. Brannenflutes.com.

Retrieved 25 February 2011  Characteristics  A flautist playing a Western concert flute The flute is a transverse (or side-blown) woodwind instrument that is closed at the blown end. It is played by blowing a stream of air over the embouchure hole. The pitch is changed by opening or closing keys that cover circular tone holes (there are typically 16 tone holes). Opening and closing the holes produces higher and lower pitches. Higher pitches can also be achieved through over-blowing, like most other woodwind instruments. The direction and intensity of the airstream also affects the pitch, timbre, and dynamics. The piccolo is also commonly used in Western orchestras and bands. Alto flutes, pitched a fourth below the standard flute, and bass flutes, an octave below, are also used occasionally. (B3) C4‚ÄìC7 (F7) :(B3) C4‚ÄìC7 (F7‚ÄìC8) The standard concert flute, also called C flute, Boehm flute, silver flute, or simply flute, is pitched in C and has a range of about three and a half to four octaves starting from the note C4 (middle C). The flute's highest pitch is usually given as either C7 or (sometimes) D7; however, more experienced flautists are able to reach up to F7. Some notes above this up to C8 are possible with extreme effort, but suffer greatly in tone, and are not typically considered part of the flute's range. Modern flutes may have a longer foot joint, a B-footjoint, with an extra key to reach B3. From high to low, the members of the concert flute family include the following: *Piccolo in C or D *Treble flute in G *Soprano flute in E *Concert flute in C, described above *Fl√ªte d'amour (also called tenor flute) in B, A, or A *Alto flute in G *Bass flute in C *Contra-alto flute in G *Contrabass flute in C (also called octobass flute) *Subcontrabass flute in G (also called double contra-alto flute) or C (also called double contrabass flute) *Double contrabass flute in C (also called octocontrabass flute or subcontrabass flute) *Hyperbass flute in C Each of the above instruments has its own range. The piccolo reads music in C (like the standard flute), but sounds one octave higher. The alto flute is in the key of G, and the low register extends to the G below middle C; its highest note is a high G (4 ledger lines above the treble staff). The bass flute is an octave lower than the concert flute, and the contrabass flute is an octave lower than the bass flute. Less commonly seen flutes include the treble flute in G, pitched one octave higher than the alto flute; soprano flute, between the treble and concert; and tenor flute or fl√ªte d'amour in B, A or A pitched between the concert and alto. The lowest sizes (larger than the bass flute) have all been developed in the 20th century; these include the sub-bass flute, which is pitched in F, between the bass and contrabass; subcontrabass flute (pitched in G or C), contra-alto flute (pitched in G, one octave below the alto), and double contrabass flute in C, one octave lower than the contrabass. The flute sizes other than the concert flute and piccolo are sometimes called harmony flutes. Construction and materials A closed hole \\"Take-down\\" Yamaha FL221 flute in case Concert flutes have three parts: the headjoint, body, and foot joint. The headjoint is sealed by a cork (or plug which may be made out of various plastics, metals, or less commonly woods). It is possible to make fine adjustments to tuning by adjusting the headjoint cork, but usually it is left in the factory- recommended position around from the centre of the embouchure hole for best scale. Gross, temporary adjustments of pitch are made by moving the headjoint in and out of the headjoint tenon. The flautist makes fine or rapid adjustments of pitch and timbre by adjusting the embouchure and/or position of the flute in relation to himself or herself, i.e., side and out. Labelled parts of a French model (open-hole) flute with a B-foot joint. *Crown ‚Äì the cap at the end of the head joint that unscrews to expose the cork and helps keep the head joint cork positioned at the proper depth. *Lip plate ‚Äì the part of the head joint that contacts the player's lower lip, allowing positioning and direction of the air stream. *Riser ‚Äì the metal section that raises the lip plate from the head joint tube. *Head joint ‚Äì the top section of the flute, has the tone hole/lip plate where the player initiates the sound by blowing air across the opening. *Body ‚Äì the middle section of the flute with the majority of the keys. *Closed-hole ‚Äì a fully covered finger key. *Open- hole ‚Äì a finger key with a perforated center. *Pointed arms ‚Äì arms connecting the keys to the rods, which are pointed and extend to the keys' centers. These are found on more expensive flutes. *French model ‚Äì a flute with pointed French-style arms and open-hole keys, as distinguished from the plateau style with closed holes. *Inline G ‚Äì the standard position of the left-hand G (third-finger) key ‚Äì in line with the first and second keys. *Offset G ‚Äì a G key extended to the side of the other two left-hand finger keys (along with the G key), making it easier to reach and cover effectively. *Split E mechanism ‚Äì a system whereby the second G key (positioned below the G key) is closed when the right middle-finger key is depressed, enabling a clearer third octave E; standard on most flutes, but omitted from many intermediate- and professional flutes, as it can reduce the tonal quality of the third-octave F (F6). *Trill keys ‚Äì two small, teardrop shaped keys between the right-hand keys on the body; the first enables an easy C‚ÄìD trill, and the second enables C‚ÄìD. A‚ÄìB lever or \\"trill\\" key is located in line directly above the right first-finger key. An optional C trill key which facilitates the trill from B to C is sometimes found on intermediate- and professional flutes. The two trill keys are also used in playing the high B and B. *Foot joint ‚Äì the last section of the flute (played farthest towards the right). *C foot ‚Äì a foot joint with a lowest note of middle C (C4); typical on student flutes. *B foot ‚Äì a foot joint with a lowest note of B below middle C (B3), which is an option for intermediate and professional flutes. *D roller ‚Äì an optional feature added to the E key on the foot joint, facilitating the transition between E/D and D/C, and C. *\\"Gizmo key\\" ‚Äì an optional key on the B foot joint that helps play C7. =Head joint shape= Close-up of part of the body and the C-foot joint. The instrument features plateau keys with Y-arms, trill keys, and soldered tone holes. The image depicts the D-key adjustment screw, and needle springs. The head-joint tube is tapered slightly towards the closed end. Theobald Boehm described the shape of the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument. Cheaper student models may be purchased with a curved head to allow younger children with shorter arms to play them. =Tubing materials= Less expensive flutes are usually constructed of brass, polished and then silver-plated and lacquered to prevent corrosion or silver-plated nickel silver (nickel-bronze bell metal, 63% Cu, 29% Zn, 5.5% Ni, 1.25% Ag, .75% Pb, alloyed As, Sb, Fe, Sn). Flutes that are more expensive are usually made of more precious metals, most commonly solid sterling silver (92.5% silver), and other alloys including French silver (95% silver, 5% copper), \\"coin silver\\" (90% silver), or Britannia silver (95.8% silver). It is reportedLouis Lot Analysis . Eldredspellflutes.com. Retrieved 25 February 2011 that old Louis Lot French flutes have a particular sound by nature of their specific silver alloy. Gold/silver flutes are even more expensive. They can be either gold on the inside and silver on the outside, or vice versa. All-gold and all-platinum flutes also exist. Flutes can also be made out of wood, with African blackwood (grenadilla or Dalbergia melanoxylon) being the most common today. Cocuswood was formerly used, but this is hard to obtain today. Wooden flutes were far more common before the early 20th century. The silver flute was introduced by Boehm in 1847, but did not become common until later in the 20th century. Wm. S. Haynes, a flute manufacturer in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, told Georges Barr√®re that in 1905 he made one silver flute to every 100 wooden flutes, but in the 1930s, he made one wooden flute to every 100 silver flutes.Goldman, Edwin Franko (1934). Band Betterment. Carl Fischer Inc. New York. p. 33 Unusual tubing materials include glass, carbon fiber, and palladium. Professionals tend to play more expensive flutes. However, the idea that different materials can significantly affect sound quality is under some contention, and some argue that different metals make less difference in sound quality than different flautists playing the same flute. Even Verne Q. Powell, a flute-maker, admitted (In Needed: A Gold Flute or a Gold Lip?) that \\"As far as tone is concerned, I contend that 90 percent of it is the man behind the flute\\". Most metal flutes are made of alloys that contain significant amounts of copper or silver. These alloys are biostatic because of the oligodynamic effect and thus suppress growth of unpleasant molds, fungi, and bacteria. Good quality flutes are designed to prevent or reduce galvanic corrosion between the tube and key mechanism. =Pad materials= Tone holes are stopped by pads constructed of fish skin (gold-beater's skin) over felt or silicone rubber on some very low-cost or ‚Äúruggedized‚Äù flutes. Accurate shimming of pads on professional flutes to ensure pad sealing is very demanding of technician time. In the time-honored method, pads are seated on paper shims sealed with shellac. A recent development is \\"precision\\" pads fitted by a factory-trained technician. Student flutes are more likely to have pads bedded in thicker materials like wax or hot melt glue. Larger-sized closed-hole pads are also held in with screws and washers. Synthetic pads appear more water-resistant but may be susceptible to mechanical failure (cracking). =Keywork= The keys can be made of the same or different metals as the tubing, nickel silver keys with silver tubing, for example. Flute key axles (or \\"steels\\") are typically made of drill rod or stainless steel. These mechanisms need periodic disassembly, cleaning, and relubrication, typically performed by a trained technician, for optimal performance. James Phelan, a flute maker and engineer, recommends single-weight motor oil (SAE 20 or 30) as a key lubricant demonstrating superior performance and reduced wear, in preference to commercial key oils).Phelan 2001, p.58 The keywork is constructed by lost-wax castings and machining, with mounting posts and ribs silver-soldered to the tube. On the best flutes, the castings are forged to increase their strength. Most keys have needle springs made of phosphor bronze, stainless steel, beryllium copper, or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys typically have flat springs. Phosphor bronze is by far the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.  Mechanical options  Comparison of a C foot and a B foot (right) ; B thumb key:The B thumb key (invented and pioneered by Briccialdi) is considered standard today.Toff, Nancy (1996). , page 56. New York: Oxford University Press US. . ; Open hole keys versus plateau keys: Open-hole \\"French model\\" flutes have circular holes in the centers of five of the keys. These holes are covered by the fingertips when the keys are depressed. Open-hole flutes are frequently chosen by concert-level flautists, although this preference is less prevalent in Germany, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Students may use temporary plugs to cover the holes until they can reliably cover the holes with the fingertips. Some flautists claim that open-hole keys permit louder and clearer sound projection in the lower register. Open-hole keys are needed for traditional Celtic music and other ethnic styles and some modern concert pieces that require harmonic overtones or \\"breathy\\" sounds. They can also facilitate alternate fingerings, \\"extended techniques\\" such as quarter-tones, glissando, and multiphonics. Closed holes (plateau keys) permit a more relaxed hand position for some flautists, which can help their playing. ; Offset G versus in-line G keys: All of Boehm‚Äôs original models had offset G keys, which are mechanically simpler, and permit a more relaxed hand position, especially for flautists with small hands. Some players prefer the hand position of the in-line G. For many years there was a misperception that inline G was for \\"professional\\" flutes while offset G was for \\"student\\" models, but this stereotype has been largely debunked. ; Split E: The split E modification makes the third octave E (E6) easier to play for some flautists. A less expensive option is the \\"low G insert\\". ; B foot: The B foot extends the range of the flute down one semitone to B3 (the B below middle C). ; Gizmo key: Some flutes with a B foot have a \\"gizmo key\\": a device that allows closure of the B tone hole independently of the C and C keys. The gizmo key makes C7 easier to play. ; Trill keys: The three standard trill keys permit rapid alternation between two notes with disparate standard fingerings: lowest, middle, and highest trill keys ease C‚ÄìD, C‚ÄìD, and B‚ÄìA, respectively. Some higher notes (third-octave B and B and most fourth-octave notes) also require use of the two lower trill keys. A fourth so-called C trill key is an increasingly popular option available on many flutes. It is named after one of its uses, to ease the B to C trill, but it also allows some trills and tremolos that are otherwise very difficult, such as high G to high A. Another way of trilling G6‚ÄìA6 is a dedicated high G‚ÄìA trill key. ; D roller: Some models offer a D roller option, or even an optional pair of parallel rollers on the D and C keys, that ease motion of the right little finger on, for example, low C to D. ; Soldered tone holes: Tone- holes may be either drawn (by pulling the tube material outwards) or soldered (cutting a hole in the tube and soldering an extra ring of material on). Soldered tone-holes are thought by some to improve tone, but generally cost more. ; Scale and pitch: The standard pitch has varied widely over history, and this has affected how flutes are made. Although the standard concert pitch today is A4 = 440 Hz, many manufacturers optimize the tone hole size/spacings for higher pitch options such as A4 = 442 Hz or A4 = 444 Hz. (As noted above, adjustments to the pitch of one note, usually the A4 fingering, can be made by moving the headjoint in and out of the headjoint tenon, but the point here is that the mechanical relationship of A4 to all other pitches is set when the tone holes are cut. However, small deviations from the objective 'mechanical' pitch (which is related to acoustic impedance of a given fingering) can be improvised by embouchure adjustments.)  Composition =Classical music An early version of Antonio Vivaldi's La tempesta di mare flute concerto was possibly written around 1713‚Äì1716, and would thus have been the first concerto for the instrument, as well as the earliest scoring of a high F6, a problematic note for the Baroque flute of that period. In Pop, Jazz, and Rock Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull playing a flute Flutes were rarely used in early jazz. Drummer and bandleader Chick Webb was among the first to use flutes in jazz, beginning in the late 1930s. Frank Wess was among the first noteworthy flautists in jazz, in the 1940s.[ Scott Yanow: Frank Wess ‚Äì Biography] (at allmusic.com) Since Theobald Boehm's fingering is used in saxophones as well as in concert flutes, many flute players \\"double\\" on saxophone for jazz and small ensembles and vice versa. Since 1950, a number of notable performers have used flutes in jazz. Frank Foster and Frank Wess (Basie band), Jerome Richardson (Jones/Lewis big band) and Lew Tabackin (Akiyoshi/Tabackin big band) used flutes in big band contexts. In small band contexts, notable performers included Bud Shank, Herbie Mann, Yusef Lateef, Melanie De Biasio, Joe Farrell, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Charles Lloyd, Hubert Laws and Moe Koffman. Several modal jazz and avant-garde jazz performers have utilized the flute including Eric Dolphy, Sam Rivers and James Spaulding. Jethro Tull is probably the best-known rock group to make regular use of the flute, which is played by its frontman, Ian Anderson. An alto flute is briefly heard in The Beatles' song \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", played by John Scott. The Beatles would later feature a flute more prominently in their single \\"Penny Lane\\". Other groups that have used the flute in pop and rock songs include The Moody Blues, Chicago, Australian groups Men At Work and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, the Canadian progressive rock group Harmonium, Dutch bands Focus and early Golden Earring, and the British groups Traffic, Genesis, Gong (although its flautist/saxophonist Didier Malherbe was French), Hawkwind, King Crimson, Camel, and Van der Graaf Generator. American singer Lizzo is also well known for playing the flute. Lizzo's flute even has its own Instagram account.

Marineland functions as an entertainment and swim-with-the-dolphins facility, and reopened to the public on March 4, 2006 (charging the original 1938 admission price of one dollar). In 2011, the park was purchased by the Georgia Aquarium for a reported $9.1 million. History=Beginnings Marineland porpoise with the 1963 Citrus Queen. Moby the Whale gets a dental checkup, 1964. Marineland was first conceived by W. Douglas Burden, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, Sherman Pratt, and Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy (grandson of Leo Tolstoy) as an oceanarium that could be used to film marine life. A site was selected on the Atlantic Ocean south of St. Augustine, eventually known as the town of Marineland. The site of Marineland is within a grant given to London barrister Levett Blackborne in 1767. The well-connected Blackborne, grandson of Sir Richard Levett, Lord Mayor of London, never settled his grant (nor even visited Florida), and eventually Blackborne's plantation was regranted to John Graham, a Georgia Loyalist fleeing the Revolutionary War. Ultimately, the land that is today Marineland was broken up over the years into smaller parcels. Financing and construction presented challenges as Marineland was the first attempt at capturing and sustaining sea creatures. These challenges were overcome. Construction and engineering were carried out Arthur Franklin Perry Co. of Jacksonville. On June 23, 1938, \\"Marine Studios\\" (the name \\"Marineland of Florida\\" would later be adopted) began operations with its main attraction a bottlenose dolphin. Unexpectedly, over 20,000 tourists clogged Highway A1A to visit the new attraction. For many decades Marineland consisted of not only the oceanariums but several amenities including a motel (Marine Village Court, Marineland Motel and Quality Inn/Marineland); Dolphin Restaurant and Moby Dick Lounge; Periwinkle Snack Bar and Sandpiper Snack Bar; Marineland Marina; plus fruit shop and gift shop; and a pier at the north end of the facility. A Texaco service station was adjacent to the Periwinkle Snack Bar, and Greyhound Bus Lines stopped regularly during its St. Augustine to Daytona Beach run. The total property area consisted of sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. Originally planned for the St. Augustine area, residents of that community did not look favorably on the attraction being located there; thus the new site south of Matanzas Inlet was chosen. Having the grandson of Leo Tolstoy involved in the project helped Marineland become a very fashionable destination in its early days, prompting writers Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, John Dos Passos, and Ernest Hemingway to visit Moby Dick's Bar located there. Ms. Rawlings was married to Norton Baskin who at one time (1950s/early 1960s) was the operator/manager of the Dolphin Restaurant/Moby Dick Lounge. The park's facilities were very popular with tourists and also used for numerous movies, including Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and Revenge of the Creature (1955). The very first dolphin trainer in the world, Adolph Frohn started trained dolphins and developed \\"dolphin shows\\" which became an additionally draw in the early 1950s as Marineland became one of Florida's major attractions, attracting over 900,000 visitors per year with peak attendance in the mid-1970s. Hard hat divers would feed fish and dolphins by hand and jumpmasters and trainers would conduct dolphin shows 6 times a day. The opening of Walt Disney World Resort in 1971 gave a major boost to the attraction's annual attendance. However, Sea World's entry into the Florida market eventually had a very negative impact on Marineland from the late 1970s through 2009. Many publications erroneously note the peak attendance as having been 300,000. The break-even admission point was actually 400,000, however, even during the 1950s. Decline Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, who was the major stockholder of the private company opted to sell the marine park in 1983 to a group of St. Augustine businessmen. For a while the park held its own with fair attendance in the busier summer months with the ongoing traditional shows being complemented by a seasonal high dive show as well as other entertainment however things changed in the latter 1980s. With declining attendance, bad management, expensive schemes and other issues, the group was unable to meet their loan payments and the attraction was again put on the market. Ownership change was the norm from that point and the long range future was chaotic and uncertain. Eventually the maintenance demands of the old park became too costly for the real estate investment group who owned it at that time. The facility began to sink into disrepair as the owners desperately sought a buyer. Finally, through a convoluted deal involving junk bonds, the property was The buyers planned to build time-share condominiums on most of the ocean hammock land but were unable to bring the plan to fruition. This effort resulted in bankruptcy for the buyers. In addition, the already- strapped oceanarium had been reconfigured as a non-profit foundation as part of the sale and was responsible for its own sustenance as well as repayment of the bond issue. Needed monies were not invested in repairs, and the shabby condition of the park offended even the most loyal fans. With no direct ownership, no funding, and the financial burden of bond interest payments, employees were left to cope with equipment failures, no marketing, loss of credit, bounced paychecks, government inspections and the custodianship of the marine mammals, fish and birds. During this era, many devoted individuals and businesses contributed materials and services to help employees keep the place going. In the end, the foundation repaid the bondholders pennies on the dollar, a large part of Marineland's dolphin population was sold off to Orlando, and the current owner came in and picked up the pieces. Dolphin Show Rebirth Hurricanes Floyd and Irene in 1999 forced the park to close for two months. Damage was extensive with the famous boardwalk destroyed, walkways to Whitney park collapsing due to erosion and even the filtration plant was under threat of falling into the ocean. Other buildings suffered damage including the iconic Marineland sign. In 2003, all of the park buildings west of Highway A1A were demolished leaving only the original structures along the Atlantic Ocean. In 2004, the park closed completely for renovations after being battered by three more hurricanes and reopened on March 4, 2006 as the Marineland Dolphin Adventure which is now operated by Georgia Aquarium. Today modern equipment and highly trained staff attend to the animals and visitors who still come to the park today. During the renovations the original 1938 Circular Oceanarium () and Rectangular Oceanarium () were demolished. The age of the original Dolphin Show at Marineland ended as the park transformed, reopened as a hands-on educational facility as the Marineland Dolphin Adventure. Guests can now interact directly with the dolphins in the new facility as well see other marine life. Future plans for the area include a condominium development on former park lands. The rest of the old Marineland property wound up in the hands of Flagler County and now make up the River to the Sea Preserve, one of the County's many parks. With a gift from Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney of slightly more than of land together with his donation of about half of the total constructions costs, on January 30, 1974 the University of Florida opened the Whitney Marine Laboratory adjacent to Marineland. This laboratory's purpose was the experimental study of marine animals but it was separate from the lab that was once operated by Marineland. Marine Studios through their Research Facility contributed greatly to the understanding of porpoises / dolphins thanks to Arthur McBride, Forrest Wood, David and Melba Caldwell and other marine biologists and scientists. The staff at Marineland had a \\"first responder team\\" for hundreds of whale strandings along the southeastern Atlantic Coast during its existence. The old Marineland lab was demolished in the renovations in 2003. Three bottlenose dolphins were born at the newly constructed Dolphin Conservation center in July 2008, two males and one female. The calves were named in November 2008. In January 2011, Marineland was sold again and is currently being operated as a subsidiary of Georgia Aquarium. The facility, now named Marineland Dolphin Adventure, offers several dolphins encounters, educational programs, and conducts research to help care for marine life in human care and in the wild.

Biography Fisher was originally named ', and also known as ', which translated into English as George Fisher. He was born to Serbian parents in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary in April 1795. Following his father's death ƒêorƒëe was sent to the Serbian Orthodox Church seminary in Sremski Karlovci, to train as a priest. He left in 1813 to join the Serbian revolutionary forces during the First Serbian Uprising.1 He traveled to Philadelphia in the United States in 1814 before heading to Mexico. In 1825, Fisher helped found the first York Rite Masonic Lodge in Mexico. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen in 1829 and contracted to settle five hundred families on lands in Texas formerly held by Haden Edwards. Fisher later was in charge of a customs house at the far north end of Galveston Bay, succeeding the very unpopular John Davis Bradburn in this post. Fisher demanded that all ships landing at the mouth of the Brazos River pay their customs duties to him at Anahuac. This was a great hardship to area boat captains due to the great distances between that port and other Texas seaports. Fisher was forced to resign his post in early 1832 after a military confrontation with Texian settlers. Later that year, Fisher began publishing the liberal newspaper Mercurio del Puerto de Matamoros in Matamoros. On October 13, 1835, Fisher and Jos√© Antonio Mex√≠a organized a movement in New Orleans to attack Tampico and instigate a revolt among the eastern states of Mexico. In 1837, he became a commission agent in Houston, in the Republic of Texas, and served as justice of the peace in 1839. Fisher was admitted to the bar in 1840 and was elected to the Houston city council. In 1843 he became a major in the Texas militia. He traveled to Panama in 1850 and on to California in 1851. In 1853 while he was still Secretary for the Land Commission, he may have gone to Washington. For there was printed in two and later three volumes \\"Portraits and Memoirs of Eminent Americans\\", in which a biographical sketch of Fisher appears as the sole entry from the state of California. It was written by the editor John Livingston, a New York lawyer. Fisher's story aroused interest also in Europe as evidenced by many articles published in several European countries. The well-known Munich magazine of the epoch Das Ausland, of July, 1843, using material out of John Lloyd Stephens book which had appeared in London at the beginning of 1843 published several articles in sequence on this \\"adventurous Serb.\\" Fisher continued to serve in various civic and administrative posts in San Francisco from 1860 to 1870 until retirement. Soon after retiring, he was appointed by the King of Greece as Consul for that nation. Fisher was married four times. He died in San Francisco on June 11, 1873.

Canales joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party in 1931 and helped organize the Daughters of Freedom, the women's branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. As a leader of the Nationalist party in Jayuya, she stored arms in her house, which were used in a revolt in 1950 against United States rule over the island. During the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s she led members in the Jayuya Uprising, in which Nationalists took control of the town for three days. Early years Canales (birth name: Blanca Canales Torresola ) was born in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. She was the younger sister of writer and politician Nemesio Canales. Her family was politically active and her father was part of the \\"Partido Uni√≥n de Puerto Rico\\" (Union Party of Puerto Rico). It lobbied for the independence of the island. Her mother was a strong-willed woman who encouraged her children to think for themselves.Anonymous, \\"Blanca Canales\\", Peace Host website (Spanish), n.d. As a child, Canales read many books and stories about other nations and their heroes. She often accompanied her father to political meetings, where she enjoyed the speeches, flag-waving, and patriotic fervor. Canales finished her primary and secondary education in Jayuya. In 1924, her father died and her mother moved to Ponce. Canales graduated from Ponce High School and, in May 1930, earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Puerto Rico. Before graduating, she attended a conference given by the President of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Pedro Albizu Campos, and was impressed by the ideals of independence which he preached. Canales returned to the university that same year, and took a course of study in social work. Nationalist Party Canales returned to Jayuya and worked at a local rural school. In 1931, she joined the Nationalist Party and was active in organizing the Daughters of Freedom, the women's branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. During the 1940s, Canales' active political participation was limited to making monetary collections because her job kept her constantly traveling from San Juan to Ponce. After Canales joined the party, a series of increasingly hostile events between the U.S.-appointed government and the Nationalists took place in the 1930s. In 1936, Albizu Campos was arrested and on March 31, 1937 the infamous Ponce massacre took place. In 1947, Albizu Campos was released from jail. Puerto Rican Gag Law On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both.

Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a On June 21, 1948, Albizu Campos gave a speech in the town of Manati, which explained how this Gag Law violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Nationalists from all over the island attended ‚Äì to hear Campos's speech, and to prevent the police from arresting him. Police repression On October 26, 1950, Albizu Campos held a political meeting in Fajardo. After the meeting Albizu Campos received word that he was going to be arrested and that his house in San Juan was surrounded by the police. He escaped from Fajardo and ordered the revolution to start. On October 27, the police in the town of Pe√±uelas, intercepted and fired upon a caravan of nationalists, killing four. On October 30, the nationalists were ordered to stage uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado, San Juan and Jayuya. The first battle of the Nationalist uprisings occurred in the pre-dawn hours of October 29, in the barrio Macan√° in the town of Pe√±uelas. The police surrounded the house of the mother of Melit√≥n Mu√±iz the president of the Pe√±uelas Nationalist Party, under the pretext that he was storing weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired upon the nationalists and a firefight between both factions ensued, which resulted with the death of two nationalists and six police officers wounded.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza; by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez; Page 7; Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â; Jayuya uprising The National Guard, commanded by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General Major General Luis R.

The Nationalists then occupied the post office, approached the telephone station, and cut the phone lines.El Vocero; March 3, 1979; p. 6 Canales led the group to the town plaza, raised the Puerto Rican Flag (which was outlawed at the time), and declared Puerto Rico a Free Republic.Remember the 1950 Uprising of October 30: Puerto Rico Casa Museo Blanca Canales After being notified that Carlos Irizarry was wounded, Canales hurried to the town hospital. But, the police had shut down the hospital, and she found Irizarry leaning against a lamp post. He had been wounded in a gunfight at the police station. Canales rushed him to a hospital in Utuado, the neighboring town. Jayuya was under Nationalist control for three days until it was attacked by U.S military planes, artillery, mortar fire, grenades, U.S. infantry troops, and the Puerto Rican National Guard commanded by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General Major General Luis R. Est√©ves, which occupied the town. The Nationalists surrendered on November 1, 1950. Canales was arrested and accused of killing a police officer, wounding three others, and burning down the post office. Following a brief federal trial, she was sentenced to life imprisonment plus sixty years. In June 1951, she was sent to the Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia. In prison she developed a close friendship with fellow nationalist Lolita Lebr√≥n, who led the 1954 Nationalist attack on the US House of Representatives, and Rosa Collazo, the wife of Oscar Collazo and treasurer of the New York City branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Later years In 1956, Canales was transferred to the Women's Jail in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. In 1967, after 17 years in prison, Canales was given a full pardon by Puerto Rican Governor Roberto Sanchez Vilella. She continued to be an active independence advocate until the day she died. Canales died in 1996 in her hometown of Jayuya. She is buried in the \\"Cementerio Municipal\\" (Municipal Cemetery) in her hometown Jayuya. Legacy The house in which Blanca and Nemesio Canales were born and raised was turned into a museum by the City of Jayuya.

Kitchener Memorial Auditorium The Kitchener Memorial Audiorium, or The Aud for short, includes a main ice rink (the Dom Cardillo Arena) with a seating capacity of 7,234 and a total capacity of 7,777, including standing room. It is home to the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League. The original arena was built in 1950 and has been expanded three times since then. The Aud hosted the 2008 Memorial Cup from May 16 to May 25, 2008, with 437 additional permanent seats being added. The Aud previously hosted 1962 Memorial Cup, 1975 Memorial Cup and 1984 Memorial Cup games.

History The current Aud replaced an earlier facility, the Queen Street Auditorium, at the corner of Charles St., built for $55,000 in 1904. Use of that building ended after a major fire in 1948. In its early days, the natural ice surface of the old Aud supported hockey, with the first game seeing Berlin trounce Brantford 7-3, in front of an audience of 2,000. Artificial ice was installed in 1927 and this was the home of the Waterloo Siskins, a team formed in 1937. The Kraut line also played at this facility. \\"It was home to me and it was a palace, as far as I was concerned,\\" Milt Schmidt recalled in 2016. By the time of the Second World War however, when most young men were overseas, so the building was used primarily as a Big band era dance hall. Another factor in this change was that Silverwood Dairies, which had provided the refrigeration for the ice surface, moved to another location in 1938, ending the availability of inexpensive artificial ice. Afterwards, the city was without a large indoor ice surface until the new Aud was built. Renovations In 2008, Kitchener Rangers president Steve Bienkowski stated that the Rangers had begun the process of researching the possibility of building a new arena with larger capacity. The Rangers had sold out almost every game for the previous 3 years, and the waiting list for season tickets had been well over the cap of 4,750. Mr. Bienkowski stated the Rangers would like a building with at least 10,000 seats. Bienkowski presented the City of Kitchener council a report on expanding the Aud. The expansion would have included another level of seating as well as an expanded concourse. The expansion proposed to add 3,500 seats to the facility to make total seating capacity around 10,500. The estimated cost was $44 million. This expansion option was the favoured route for the team, as it was estimated that a new arena with a larger seating capacity (about 10,000) would cost $150 million. City council made it clear they would not finance such a large project unless private companies were adding money to it but had been very favourable at the idea of expanding the city-owned building. The plan includes raising the roof on the building, a process which had been done before with the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in the early 1970s. Bienkowski and the city came an agreement involving the Aud being expanded by 1,000 seats with a concourse on the third level. The expected cost for this expansion was roughly $9 million, with the Kitchener Rangers Hockey Club paying for it, via a loan from the City of Kitchener. Work began in February 2012 and was completed by the end of that year. Upon completion the seating capacity is 7,234, including about 920 new seats in the regular seating area and 80 new seats in new suites, with a standing room capacity of 7,777. As of January 2020, talks are underway by the City of Kitchener to move the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium to a new location as the building nears a time where more renovations are required to the facility. Centennial Stadium Centennial Stadium was a football/soccer stadium next to The Aud. The stadium seated 3,200 spectators and was the largest stadium in Kitchener. The stadium was additionally noteworthy for its location with easy highway access from Waterloo, Guelph, and Cambridge and its track and field facilities. In the spring of 2011, the grandstand at Centennial Stadium was deemed unsafe and ultimately condemned. On Tuesday, June 12, 2012, Kitchener City Council voted 6-4 to demolish the grandstand, it has since been torn down.

Direct Action Network (DAN) was a North American confederation of anti-corporate, anti-authoritarian and anarchist affinity groups, collectives, and organizations. It grew out of the Seattle chapter which had been formed to coordinate the nonviolent civil disobedience portion of the anti-WTO mobilization in Seattle in 1999. David Graeber, Direct Action: An Ethnography (AK Press, 2009) p. 290-294 Seattle DAN was formed in response to the call for direct action against the WTO conference by People's Global Action. Members of the Art and Revolution Collective, based in San Francisco, sought funding for their WTO actions from a coalition of NGOs led by Public Citizen and Global Exchange. Simultaneously, local activists in Seattle began meeting to plan disruptive protest. The Seattle group envisioned a \\"decentralized network of people who would organize autonomous actions,\\" while the San Francisco group envisioned \\"a coherent organization...that would come together around a fixed day action.\\" According to San Francisco organizer David Solnit, the two groups merged \\"somewhat awkwardly,\\" with differences over property destruction being a particular source of tension.WTO History Project, University of Washington \\"David Solnit interview with Jeremy Simer\\" Soon after the Seattle mobilization, several DAN chapters formed a Continental Direct Action Network (CDAN), which rapidly expanded into branches in 12 cities in the United States and Canada. CDAN, as well as many of the local chapters, adopted principles of unity based on those of Peoples' Global Action. Regional DANs were formed of autonomous affinity groups which coordinated actions via spokescouncils using delegation and consensus decision-making. According to former NYC DAN organizer David Graeber: > Chapters operating in different cities soon came to be classified into two > broad tendencies: anti-corporate, or anti-capitalist. The former tended to > be more reformist in orientation, more oriented towards the [nonviolence] > tradition and suspicious of more militant styles of direct action, more > interested in appealing to the middle classes around concepts like fair > trade and green consumerism. The latter were more explicitly anarchist and > revolutionary. The most prominent examples of the former tendency were > Seattle DAN and LA DAN, both of which continued to be dominated by NGO > activists...The vast majority of groups that were within the DAN network, > however, including NYC DAN, the Philadelphia Direct Action Group (PDAG), San > Francisco and Humboldt County DAN, Chicago DAN, and many others, were > plainly anti-capitalist. They had little NGO participation, but were made up > instead mainly of independent activists and members of local anarchist > collectives...David Graeber, Direct Action: An Ethnography (AK Press, 2009) > p. 294 Other than Seattle, DAN played a key role in organizing the following protests/mobilizations: * International Monetary Fund/World Bank protests, April 8‚Äì17, 2000 * Republican National Convention protests, Philadelphia, July 29, 2000 * Democratic National Convention protests, Los Angeles, August 11, 2000 * George W. Bush Inauguration, Washington, DC, January 20, 2001 * World Economic Forum protests, New York City, NY, February 2, 2002 After the September 11 attacks in 2001, DAN began to fall apart. DAN's last major mobilization was in New York City in February 2002, where remnants of the local chapter was responsible for organizing actions against the World Economic Forum attended by between 15,000 and 20,000 individuals. NYCDAN was later eclipsed by the Another World is Possible Coalition (AWIP), a local NYC network which was originally formed by DAN members. Since DANs evaporation, many former activists have gone on to play pivotal roles in regional and national mobilizations and groups, including anti-war organizing, NY Peoples' Global Action, NYC Social Forum, New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists and other organizational work. The websites for both Continental Direct Action Network and Direct Action Network are no longer maintained.

Career Schenker founded Scorpions in 1965. He has become one of the major driving forces in the band's song-writing and musical direction for 50 years. Schenker has been Scorpions' most consistent member, appearing on every album and at every tour. His younger brother Michael Schenker was a member of Scorpions in the band's earliest inception, before joining the band UFO. In the year 2000 Rudy was awarded the city of Hannover plaque as well as the Cross of Merit First Class (Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse) of the Lower Saxony Order of Merit. Equipment After starting out with a Fender Stratocaster, Schenker is primarily known for playing Gibson Flying Vs. In the Acoustica DVD, he is seen playing an acoustic Flying V made especially for him by Dommenget. He now uses Dean acoustic V models. Some of Rudolf Schenker's main live guitars in recent years are Dommenget, the same maker that produced Klaus Meine's live guitar and many guitars for Matthias Jabs. Rudolf's signature models are \\"Gibson Rudolf Schenker Flying V\\", the Dommenget \\"Ferrari\\" V, PGG \\"Scorpions Golden Jubilee\\" Flying V, PGG \\"Veetle\\" Flying V and the \\"Scorpions\\" V.

The first storm, Hurricane One, developed north of the Lesser Antilles on August 21\\\\. The final system, Tropical Storm Sixteen, dissipated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 5\\\\. It was a fairly active season, featuring 16 tropical storms and seven hurricanes. Two of these strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Two. It caused up to $52 million (1949 USD) and two deaths after making landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane. Another storm inflicting severe impact was Hurricane Ten. Striking Texas as a Category 2 hurricane, this storm brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surge to the state, with damage reaching about $6.7 million. In late September, Hurricane Nine caused 15 deaths and over $1 million in damage in Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic. The third tropical storm caused seven fatalities from drowning on Barbados. Several other systems brought minor impacts to land. Overall, storms during this season caused about $59.8 million in damage and 26 fatalities.

However, tropical cyclogenesis did not begin until August 21, over two months after the start of the season. Overall, there were 16 tropical storms, seven of which strengthened into hurricanes. Three of these intensified into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Four hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 26 deaths and $59.8 million in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Sixteen, dissipated on November 5, about 10 days before the official end of the season on November 15. No activity was observed until the first system was located north of the Lesser Antilles on August 21\\\\. The hurricane later threatened the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where it caused two deaths and about $50,000 in damage. By August 23, the Florida hurricane developed near the Lesser Antilles. It later peaked as a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale and struck South Florida at that intensity. The storm severely impacted the Florida peninsula and left two deaths and approximately $52 million in losses. On August 30, the third system of the season struck the Leeward Islands, causing some impact and seven deaths by drowning on Barbados. A fourth system was first observed near Puerto Rico on September 3\\\\. It peaked as a Category 3 hurricane while passing east on Bermuda. After becoming extratropical, the remnants of this storm struck Newfoundland. Tropical Storm Five also developed on September 3, in the southern Gulf of Mexico and struck Louisiana on September 4. It caused minor damage in Mississippi and Louisiana, totaling less than $50,000. Neither the sixth or seventh tropical systems impacted land. The eighth hurricane was initially observed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 20\\\\. It meandered erratically for several days, until eventually making landfall in Veracruz. The system produced above normal tides and locally heavy rains in Texas and Louisiana. Hurricane Nine was initially spotted near the Leeward Islands on September 20\\\\. It struck Dominican Republic on September 22, shortly before dissipating. The storm left over $1 million in damage and 15 deaths in Dominican Republican and Puerto Rico. On September 27, the tenth hurricane developed in the Pacific Ocean offshore Guatemala. The system eventually reached the Gulf of Mexico and struck Texas as a Category 2 hurricane on October 4. The adverse effects of this storm resulted in two deaths and $6.7 million in damage. No impact was reported from the final three storms, the last of which dissipated on November 5. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 98. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Systems=Hurricane One A tropical storm was first observed about a few hundred miles north of the Lesser Antilles on August 21\\\\. The storm moved west-northwestward and was upgraded to a hurricane 12 hours later, after various surface vessels reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It paralleled The Bahamas and turned northward on August 23\\\\. Further intensification continued until August 24, with the storm approaching major hurricane status. At 00:00 UTC it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). The eye of the cyclone later passed over the Diamond Shoals Lightship, which recorded a minimum central barometric pressure of while located offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The cyclone became extratropical on August 25 and dissipated near Iceland on August 30. In the Hatteras area, sustained winds reached , while rainfall up to was observed. Thousands of trees were destroyed in Buxton. Damage was estimated at $50,000, mostly in the Buxton area. Additionally, the storm was attributed to two fatalities. Later on August 24, the storm curved east- northeastward and began to slowly weaken. By 00:00 UTC on August 26, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located well south of Newfoundland. It was known as Hurricane Harry in newspapers. Hurricane Two The Florida Hurricane of 1949 A tropical storm developed east of the northernmost Lesser Antilles on August 23\\\\. It moved west-northwestward and strengthened, becoming a hurricane on August 24\\\\. Moving through the Bahamas, the storm rapidly strengthened over the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf Stream. It became a major hurricane on August 26 and then passed just north of Nassau. At 18:00 UTC on that day, it peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . Five hours later, the storm made landfall in Lake Worth, Florida, at the same intensity. On August 27, the hurricane weakened quickly after moving inland over Lake Okeechobee, but otherwise maintained hurricane intensity as it curved northward into southern Georgia. At 00:00 UTC on August 28, it degenerated into a tropical storm. It later ejected northeastward and tracked rapidly across the Southeastern United States, Mid-Atlantic, and New England. On August 29, the storm became extratropical over New Hampshire. In Florida, the storm produced strong winds, with highest official observations being sustained winds of 110 mph (180 km/h) at the Palm Beach International Airport and gusts of 155 mph (250 km/h) in Palm Beach. The most severe damage in South Florida occurred in Palm Beach, Jupiter, and Stuart; hundreds of homes, apartment buildings, stores, and warehouse buildings lost roofs and windows. Interior furnishings were blown through broken glass into the streets. Approximately 90% of homes and buildings were damaged in Stuart, leaving about 500 people homeless. Additionally, heavy rainfall caused water to enter numerous homes in Martin and Palm Beach Counties. Significant damage to crops also occurred, particularly to citrus. In Florida alone, the hurricane caused two deaths and at least $52 million in damage, $20 million of which was to agriculture. Minor impact was reported in other states, with local flooding and light wind damage in Georgia, The Carolinas, and Maryland. Tropical Storm Three A tropical depression formed to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August 30\\\\. It moved steadily west-northwestward, passing over Barbados as a weak tropical storm. Seven people drowned on the island and 27 houses were destroyed in Bridgetown. After entering the Caribbean Sea on September 1, hostile conditions weakened the storm, and the third tropical cyclone of the season degenerated into a tropical wave on September 3 to the south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. Hurricane Four A tropical wave developed into a tropical storm east of Puerto Rico on September 3\\\\. It moved northward and strengthened to a hurricane later that day, but then weakened to a strong tropical storm the next day. At the same time, the system halted its forward motion and began to drift eastward. Early on September 5, it re- intensified into a hurricane, and it became a major hurricane on September 6\\\\. The storm turned to the north on September 7 and passed about east of Bermuda on September 8. The hurricane weakened as it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters, and became extratropical on September 10 near Atlantic Canada. Shortly after becoming extratropical, it passed over Newfoundland, and ultimately dissipated on September 11 near southwestern Greenland. The hurricane produced gale-force winds on Bermuda, though overall, no damage was reported. In Newfoundland, the storm brought rainfall up to in many areas. The Bayfield was smashed into pieces along the rocky shores, though all of the crewmen swam to safety. Tropical Storm Five Early on September 3, a tropical storm developed in the south-central Gulf of Mexico. Throughout much of its duration, the storm headed north-northwestward, gradually intensifying into a moderate tropical storm. At around 12:00 UTC on September 4, the storm made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, while at its peak intensity. While moving inland, it passed west of New Orleans and east of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The storm curved northeastward and slowly weakened across the Southern United States. Late on September 5, it dissipated over Tennessee. Damage was minimal in Louisiana and Mississippi, likely amounting to less than $50,000. Tropical Storm Six The sixth tropical storm of the season was first observed on September 5, while located about half-way between the northern Lesser Antilles and the Azores. The storm moved to the northwest and reached its peak intensity early on September 12\\\\. It then became extratropical, turning to the northeast before curving southeastward. It dissipated on September 16. Tropical Storm Seven An extratropical system developed into a tropical storm offshore The Carolinas on September 11\\\\. The storm moved west-northwestward and strengthened slightly, peaking with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . It then weakened somewhat before making landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina on September 13 with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm soon weakened to a tropical depression and curved northeastward. It dissipated over southeastern Virginia on September 14\\\\. Tropical Storm Eight A tropical storm developed early on September 13, while located about 595 miles (960 km) west of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. The storm slowly strengthened while moving north-northeastward across the eastern Atlantic Ocean for much of its duration. Late on September 14, the system attained its peak intensity. Thereafter, it began to weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity on September 17\\\\. Later that day, the storm dissipated about 475 miles (765 km) south of the central Azores. Hurricane Nine A tropical wave entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 18. It moved northwestward and developed into a tropical storm on September 20, while offshore Louisiana. The storm continued northwestward, then turned to the southwest, and erratically looped to the south on September 22\\\\. Steadily strengthening as it tracked south- southwestward, the storm intensified into a hurricane on September 24. After turning to the southwest, it reached its peak intensity on September 25\\\\. The hurricane weakened as it turned to the south-southeast then south and fell to tropical storm intensity shortly before making landfall between Veracruz and Nautla. The system dissipated by September 26. Operationally, the storm was treated as two separate storms, due to reconnaissance aircraft being unable to report a center of circulation on September 23. The storm produced higher than normal tides along the coast of Texas and Louisiana, while its outer rainbands produced locally heavy rainfall. Hurricane Ten Hurricane San Mateo of 1949 A strong tropical wave approached the Lesser Antilles on September 20\\\\. Reconnaissance aircraft reports indicated the system initially lacked a circulation. However, based on a ship report of westerly winds, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical storm late on September 20, while located about south-southeast of Saint Croix. A small storm, it quickly strengthened as it traversed west-northwestward, and became a hurricane by 12:00 UTC on September 21\\\\. After reaching peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) the hurricane weakened, and it made landfall on September 22 on the southeastern Dominican Republic as a tropical storm. The storm rapidly dissipated after moving inland. Strong winds resulted in heavy damage in Saint Croix. In Puerto Rico, where it was known as the San Mateo Hurricane, wind gusts from the hurricane peaked at in Ramey. Gusty winds disrupted electrical and telephone services between Ponce and Mayag√ºez. In the latter, residents were evacuated inland to Red Cross shelters. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall of up to in San Lorenzo, which caused flooding in several rivers in the northern portion of the island. Damage in Puerto Rico totaled to over $1 million, mainly to coffee crops and buildings. In the Dominican Republic, the hurricane killed 15 people, while damage amounted to $12,000. Hurricane Eleven The Texas Hurricane of 1949 A tropical depression formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean just offshore Guatemala on September 27\\\\. The depression drifted northwestward and made landfall in Guatemala on September 28\\\\. It crossed southeastern Mexico and entered the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on October 1\\\\. Shortly after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and became a hurricane on October 2\\\\. It turned more to the north and intensified to a strong Category 2 hurricane on October 3\\\\. Subsequently, the storm made landfall near Freeport, Texas, on October 4 at the same intensity. The hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical storm as it turned northeastward over land. On October 6, it weakened to a tropical depression over Missouri and later became extratropical. The storm accelerated northeastward and dissipated near Chicago. The hurricane produced high tides along the Texas coast, peaking at in Velasco. Galveston was temporarily cut off from the mainland when water surpassed the city's seawall. Several streets were flooded in Galveston and the city pier was damaged. Another pier in Port Aransas was nearly destroyed. Freeport sustained the most damage, totaling about $150,000. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in Texas, peaking at in Goodrich. A tornado was also spawned in Riceville, which injured two children. Damage totaled approximately $6.7 million, primarily to crops. The hurricane also caused two deaths, one from electrocution in Port Neches and another due to drowning in Matagorda Bay. Outside of Texas, impact was mainly limited to minor damage to cars in five other states. Tropical Storm Twelve Another tropical storm developed northeast of Puerto Rico on October 2\\\\. The system initially moved northward, before curving to the east-northeast on the following day. It slowly strengthened and later peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . By early on October 6, the storm began to weaken and became extratropical the next day. Its remnants continued east-northeastward for about 12 hours, before dissipating on October 7\\\\. Hurricane Thirteen Beginning on October 11, an area of disturbed weather moved through the western Caribbean Sea. Early on October 13, a tropical depression made landfall in Guant√°namo Province, Cuba. Continuing northeastward, the storm emerged into the Atlantic over the Bahamas. While located over the southeastern Bahamas, the system intensified into a tropical storm. Further intensification occurred and it became a hurricane on October 14, after exiting the Bahamas. Late on the following day, the hurricane reached its peak intensity. Thereafter, the storm began to deteriorate, weakening to a tropical storm on October 17\\\\. It became transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 19. Tropical Storm Fourteen A tropical storm was first observed about 865 miles (1,400 km) east-northeast of Barbuda. The storm initially moved west-northwestward, until re-curving northwestward on October 14\\\\. It strengthened slowly and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Thereafter, the storm began to weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity on October 17\\\\. Several hours later, it dissipated while located about south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Tropical Storm Fifteen A tropical storm developed over the central Atlantic Ocean on November 1\\\\. The system moved southwestward and then west-southwestward, strengthening slowly during this time. On November 2, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm began to weaken while appearing to threaten the Lesser Antilles, but later curved northwestward. On November 4, the system turned northward and weakened to a tropical depression. Early the next day, it became extratropical. The remnants continued northward before dissipating on November 6\\\\. Tropical Storm Sixteen The final storm developed from a persistent low pressure area in the northwestern Caribbean Sea near Swan Island on November 3\\\\. A reconnaissance aircraft reported a well-defined eye feature as the storm reached its peak intensity. The storm drifted south-southwestward and began weakening on November 4\\\\. Later that day, it made landfall over northeastern Honduras as a tropical depression. Shortly after moving inland, the system dissipated.

It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist, and, together with \\"If I Needed Someone\\", marked the start of his emergence as a songwriter beside John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The song's lyrics advocate independent thinking and reflect the Beatles' move towards more sophisticated concepts in their writing at this stage of their career. The song has invited interpretation as both a political statement and a love song, as Harrison dismisses a lover or friend in a tone that some commentators liken to Bob Dylan's 1965 single \\"Positively 4th Street\\". Among musicologists, the composition has been recognised as adventurous in the degree of tonal ambiguity it employs across parallel major and minor keys and through its suggestion of multiple musical modes. The Beatles recorded \\"Think for Yourself\\" in November 1965, towards the end of the sessions for Rubber Soul. In a departure from convention, the track includes two bass guitar parts ‚Äì one standard and one played through a fuzzbox. Performed by McCartney, this fuzz bass serves as a lead guitar line throughout the song and marked the first time that a bass guitar had been recorded using a fuzzbox device, as opposed to manipulating equipment to achieve a distorted sound. The group overdubbed their harmony vocals during a lighthearted session that was also intended to provide material for their 1965 fan-club Christmas disc. A snippet from this session was used in the Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. The song has also appeared on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison and on the 1999 Yellow Submarine Songtrack album. Background and inspiration In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls little about the inspiration behind \\"Think for Yourself\\". He said that his intention was to target narrow-minded thinking and identified the British government as a possible source. Partly as a result of the vagueness of his comments, the song has invited interpretation as both a political commentary and a statement on a failing personal relationship. The song reflects the influence of Bob Dylan, with whom the Beatles had spent time socialising in May 1965, in London, and then in mid August, following the band's concert at Shea Stadium in New York. Just as their songs had encouraged Dylan to embrace rock music, Dylan's work inspired the Beatles, and particularly Harrison, as a nascent songwriter, to address more sophisticated concepts than the standard love song. In addition, since March that year, Harrison's outlook had been transformed by his and John Lennon's experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD; in a 1987 interview, he said that the drug had revealed to him the futility of the band's widespread fame. Author George Case groups \\"Think for Yourself\\" with two Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney compositions from the Beatles' Rubber Soul album ‚Äì \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"The Word\\" ‚Äì as examples of how the band's focus had progressed \\"from excited songs of juvenile love to adult meditations on independence, estrangement and brotherhood\\". In Ringo Starr's later recollection, Rubber Soul was the Beatles' \\"departure record\\", written and recorded during a period when, largely through the influence of marijuana, \\"We were expanding in all areas of our lives, opening up to a lot of different attitudes.\\" Composition=Musical form \\"Think for Yourself\\" has a 4/4 time signature and is set to a moderate rock beat. After a two-bar introduction, the structure comprises three combinations of verse and chorus, with the final chorus being repeated in full, followed by what musicologist Alan Pollack terms a \\"petit-reprise of the last phrase\\" to close the song. The chorus sections contrast rhythmically with the verses, providing a more upbeat mood. The song's musical key is a combination of G major and G minor. Pollack comments that whereas Lennon and Paul McCartney had regularly employed a major key and its parallel minor to provide an element of contrast in their songs, Harrison's composition ensures that the two modes are \\"blended\\", so creating a form that is \\"neither quite really Major nor minor\\". In the description of musicologist Dominic Pedler, while G major appears to be the central key, the song's musical premise involves permanent tonic key ambiguity and \\"restless root movement\\" through extensive borrowing from the parallel minor key. The G7 chord over the introduction suggests a tonic key of G major and a musical mode of G Mixolydian, yet the verse opens with A minor, the ii chord in Roman numeral analysis, which suggests A Dorian mode, and the subsequent change to D minor then suggests A Aeolian mode, in which the chord represents iv. The immediate shift to a B chord (III in G major) followed by a C chord (IV in G major) creates further ambiguity, since these chords hint at a VI‚ÄìVII rock run in D Aeolian. During the chorus, Pedler continues, the anticipated tonic- identifying V‚ÄìI (D7‚ÄìG7) shift is preceded by an unexpected VI (E/B) chord in second inversion that undermines its tonal direction. The unusual chord progression is an example of the Beatles' use of chords for added harmonic expression, a device that Harrison adopted from Lennon's approach to melody. Musicologist Walter Everett describes the composition as \\"a tour de force of altered scale degrees\\". He adds that, such is the ambiguity throughout, \\"its tonal quality forms the perfect conspirator with the text's and the rhythm's hesitations and unexpected turns.\\" Pollack also views the composition as musically adventurous; he identifies it as a \\"curious stylistic hybrid\\" in the pop/rock genre, comprising blues-inflected motifs within a folk-based framework. Lyrics The song's message recalls that of Dylan's September 1965 single \\"Positively 4th Street\\", as Harrison appears to be ending a relationship, possibly with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: \\"I've got a word or two to say about the things that you do.\\" Author Ian Inglis describes the song as \\"a withering attack\\" in which \\"Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [from 'Positively 4th Street'] could be spoken by the same voice.\\" Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to \\"opaque\\" minds and in the line \\"the good things that we can have if we close our eyes\\". According to Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould, despite Harrison having envisaged \\"Think for Yourself\\" as a form of social commentary, contemporary listeners most likely interpreted it as a love song, given the limited perception afforded the work of pop artists. As a result, Gould includes the composition among \\"a new genre of 'anti-love' songs\\", a style that was inaugurated by Dylan in 1964 and later developed by the Rolling Stones. When read as a farewell to a romantic partner, according to James Decker, an English literature academic and Henry Miller scholar, the lyrics express the view that their relationship is based on a false reality, whereby the individual is submerged within the bounds of the relationship. In the final verse, Harrison urges his partner to \\"try thinking more\\", confident that she too will come to see the emptiness in her life choices. While adhering to this particular interpretation of \\"Think for Yourself\\", Decker says that \\"Harrison and the Beatles have thus raised the stakes from the na√Øve idealism of hand- holding\\" that typified love songs of the period. In the opinion of Steve LaBate of Paste magazine, the song \\"implores listeners to question what they're told and live a more examined, conscious life\\". Author and critic Kenneth Womack identifies an air of superiority in Harrison's lyrics. In his description, the song represents \\"the inaugural entry (with shades of 'Don't Bother Me') in Harrison's existential philosophy, later to be adumbrated by Eastern religion and thought, about the mind-numbingly automatic and insensate manner in which human beings undertake their lives in the workaday world\\". Recording=Basic track The Beatles recorded \\"Think for Yourself\\" towards the end of the sessions for Rubber Soul, at which point they were under pressure to meet the deadline for completing the album. Recording for the song, which had a working title of \\"Won't Be There With You\\", took place at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 8 November 1965. The group achieved a satisfactory basic track in one take, with a line-up comprising two electric guitars, bass guitar and drums. Lennon's guitar contribution does not appear on the completed recording, however. Instead, he overdubbed a keyboard part, played on either a Vox Continental organ or an electric piano. Fuzz bass part McCartney used a Rickenbacker 4001S to overdub the fuzz bass, which effectively serves as a lead guitar part. McCartney overdubbed an additional bass part, which he played through a fuzzbox effect unit known as a Tone Bender. The recording of a bass through a fuzzbox was unprecedented at the time, as was the inclusion of both a standard bass and \\"fuzz bass\\" on a song. Gould and Everett consider that the Beatles' adoption of this effect was inspired by the Rolling Stones' 1965 hit \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", on which the distorted, fuzz-tone sound of the lead guitar riff had been a key element. However, Harrison credited Phil Spector's production of \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\", by Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans ‚Äì a 1962 recording that, after the distorted lead guitar sound had been created accidentally in the studio, led to Gibson's invention of the first fuzzbox. McCartney's riff-dominated part serves the role of a lead guitar throughout the track. The inclusion of fuzz bass, and its layering beside a standard bass part, typified the Beatles' willingness to experiment with sound on Rubber Soul. McCartney used a Rickenbacker 4001S, a solid-body guitar that gave his bass playing on Rubber Soul a more precise tone than he had been able to achieve with his usual H√∂fner \\"violin bass\\". Inglis comments that, in its dialogue with Harrison's vocal lines, the \\"growling\\" fuzz bass contributes to the song's \\"persistent mood of menace\\", while Gould describes the effect as \\"the snarls of an enraged schnauzer, snapping and striking at its lead\\". Vocal overdubs Typical of the group's sound on the album, the song's arrangement includes three-part harmonies sung in homorhythm. Since the band also had to have their annual fan club Christmas disc completed at this time, their producer, George Martin, instructed the studio engineers to set up a second, ambient microphone and tape the Beatles as they rehearsed and recorded their vocal parts for the track. The tapes captured the three vocalists ‚Äì Harrison, Lennon and McCartney ‚Äì engaging in humorous banter and often unable to remember their parts. As a rare record of the group at work in the studio, the \\"Think for Yourself\\" rehearsal tape has invited comparison with the Beatles' Let It Be documentary film, made in January 1969. Whereas that film documents a period of acrimony among the band members, the 1965 tape shows them, in author Mark Hertsgaard's description, \\"clearly [taking] joy in one another's company\\". Once the vocals had been recorded successfully, and then double-tracked, Starr overdubbed tambourine and maracas. Contrary to Martin's hopes, nothing from the rehearsal tape was deemed suitable for the Beatles' 1965 Christmas record. In 1968, six seconds' worth of Harrison, Lennon and McCartney's a capella singing ‚Äì repeating the line \\"And you've got time to rectify\\" ‚Äì was used in the soundtrack of the Yellow Submarine animated film. McCartney subsequently incorporated other segments from the \\"Think for Yourself\\" rehearsal into his 2000 experimental album Liverpool Sound Collage. A fifteen-minute edit of the full tape became available unofficially in 1991 on the bootleg compilation Unsurpassed Masters, Volume 7. In 1995, a mix of the song featuring only vocals was among several tracks that were in the running for inclusion on the Anthology 2 compilation album but were ultimately passed over. Release and reception EMI's Parlophone label released Rubber Soul on 3 December 1965 in Britain, with \\"Think for Yourself\\" sequenced as the fifth track, between \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"The Word\\". The album was a commercial and critical success, although initially some reviewers in the UK were confused by the band's more mature approach. The release also marked the start of a period when other artists, in an attempt to emulate the Beatles' achievement, sought to create albums as works of artistic merit, with a consistently high standard of original compositions and with increasingly novel sounds. Among the albums influenced by Rubber Soul was the Rolling Stones' Aftermath, which included fuzz-toned bass parts on the songs \\"Under My Thumb\\" and \\"Mother's Little Helper\\". Author John Kruth writes that, with its vitriolic tone and an \\"edge\\" that was unfamiliar in the Beatles' work, \\"Think for Yourself\\" was \\"somewhat startling\\" to many listeners. In his album review for the NME, Allen Evans interpreted the song's message as \\"advice to someone who's going off the rails to think for himself and rectify things\\", and he admired the track's \\"good tempo and vocal sound\\". Record Mirrors review panel opined: \\"Nice song but a feeling hereabouts that there's a sameness about some of the melody-construction ideas. Maybe we'll lose it later on ‚Ä¶\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). While recognising Rubber Soul as another example of the Beatles \\"setting trends in this world of pop\\", KRLA Beat highlighted the \\"wonderful sound effect\\" created by McCartney's fuzz bass and concluded: \\"a good, strong, driving beat will keep this one on top.\\" Melody Maker said that \\"Think for Yourself\\" was among the album's best tracks and also admired its \\"double tempo\\" sections and \\"good chugging maraca beat\\". Michael Lydon, who interviewed Lennon and McCartney for Newsweeks laudatory feature on the Beatles in early 1966, quoted the song's chorus in the conclusion to his 1972 article for The Boston Globe, in which he reflected on the passing of the 1960s cultural revolution. He introduced the lyrics with a statement on the Beatles' impact: \\"Freedom to have a good time, to boogie, they showed, was a practical possibility for the average human. I'm glad I got the message.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). \\"Think for Yourself\\" was one of the seven Beatles tracks that Capitol Records included on the 1976 compilation album The Best of George Harrison, released following the expiration of Harrison's contract with EMI. Coinciding with the release of the newly restored Yellow Submarine film in 1999, a new mix of the song was issued on the Beatles' Yellow Submarine Songtrack album. Retrospective assessment and legacy Among Beatles biographers, Tim Riley considers the track to be \\"a step beyond\\" Harrison's two contributions on Help!, with the fuzz bass providing \\"just the right guttural cynicism\\", yet he says the song lacks the \\"melodic sonorities and layered texture\\" that distinguishes the guitarist's other Rubber Soul composition, \\"If I Needed Someone\\". Riley adds that \\"Think for Yourself\\" merely serves to provide contrast with the Lennon songs either side of it on the album. Conversely, Ian MacDonald finds the song underrated and \\"less ingratiating but more incisive\\" than \\"If I Needed Someone\\". While he considers that the group's performance could have been improved on, MacDonald admires the \\"real fervour\\" in McCartney's vocal over the choruses. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic views both tracks as evidence that Harrison was \\"developing into a fine songwriter\\" on Rubber Soul, a view echoed by author Robert Rodriguez. In his review of the song for AllMusic, Thomas Ward deems it one of Harrison's weakest compositions. He says that the track offers \\"a very dated, rather patronising lyric and rather bland melody\\", although he also recognises \\"an ingenious chord sequence and, typically, a great introduction\\". Alex Young of Consequence of Sound describes it as a \\"vital\\" inclusion on Rubber Soul, as the first track to show how \\"this album is truly the champion of making bitterness sound cheerful.\\" In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked \\"Think for Yourself\\" at number 75 in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\\". The magazine's editors wrote that while the Beatles created the track in obvious haste and under the influence of marijuana, these conditions worked to the song's advantage, lending it \\"an unchained, garage-band feel\\". Dominic Pedler cites \\"Think for Yourself\\" as an example of the extent to which Harrison contributed to the Beatles' legacy as writers of pioneering, original melodies. He recognises the song as \\"harmonically outrageous\\" and \\"a maverick blueprint for left-field pop-rock\\". Writing in The Guardian on the 50th anniversary of the album's release, Bob Stanley described \\"Think for Yourself\\" as \\"cool but fierce\\". He grouped it with \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Girl\\" as songs that conveyed the Beatles' new, sophisticated outlook at the time and, decades later, evoked progressive women such as Edie Sedgwick, Maureen Cleave and Pauline Boty. He said that the same three songs were statements that ensured that Rubber Soul would remain \\"fresh\\" for another 50 years. Also writing in December 2015, Emily Mackay of the NME described the song as \\"acerbic\\" and empathetic with the confused sexual politics of \\"Norwegian Wood\\". She recognised Harrison's \\"assertion of independent-mindedness\\" as a forerunner to Lennon's 1968 song \\"Revolution\\". In his 2015 book 1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music, Andrew Grant Jackson identifies it as the Beatles' contribution to a \\"subgenre\\" of protest songs that emerged in 1965, in which artists railed against \\"oppressive conformity itself\\" rather than political issues. He views it as one of the musical statements that, informed by mass media, hallucinogenic drugs and the introduction of the contraceptive pill, \\"chronicled and propelled a social reformation as the old world forged its uneasy synthesis with the new\\". Unterberger regrets that the Beatles did not attempt to play more of their material from the 1965‚Äì66 era in concert before deciding to quit touring in late 1966. He identifies \\"Think for Yourself\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\", along with some of the guitar-based tracks on their Revolver album, as songs that \\"would have worked well in a live setting\\". Yonder Mountain String Band have performed \\"Think for Yourself\\", featuring a bluegrass arrangement that includes banjo and mandolin. They also contributed a recording of the track to This Bird Has Flown ‚Äì A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul in 2005. Pete Shelley covered the song for Yellow Submarine Resurfaces, a CD issued with the July 2012 issue of Mojo magazine. Kruth describes Shelley's version as \\"an exhilarating punk anthem\\" that includes \\"crunchy guitar chords\\" in the style of the Kinks' \\"All Day and All of the Night\\".

Although this term is often used to refer to vehicles mounting such devices, more accurately they are known as winter service vehicles, especially in areas that regularly receive large amounts of snow every year, or in specific environments such as airfields. In other cases, pickup trucks and front end loaders are outfitted with attachments to fulfill this purpose. Some regions that do not frequently see snow may use graders to remove compacted snow and ice off the streets. Snowplows can also be mounted on rail cars or locomotives to clear railway tracks. Usage A small sidewalk clearing plow in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada A snowplow works by using a blade to push snow to the side to clear it from a surface. Modern plows may include technology to make it easier to perform the work and stay on the road. These include Global Positioning System receivers, head-up displays and infrared cameras. Large custom snowplows are commonly used at major airports in North America. These plows have oversized blades and additional equipment like a rotating sweeper broom (sometimes called jetblade) and blowers at the rear of the plow. For sidewalks and narrow lanes small tractor plows (tracked or wheeled) are often used within Canada and the United States. When snowfall accumulates above a certain height, snowplow operators may be seen clearing the main arteries first (designated as snow routes), in some cases for the exclusive use of emergency vehicles. Underbody scrapers are sometimes mounted on vehicles in residential and urban settings, operating on principles similar to a road grader, but allowing greater weights and speed along with the carriage of a road treatment applicator. Newer technology has allowed the use of articulated plow systems which can clear multiple divided highway lanes simultaneously; jurisdictions adopting this technology include the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, along with 21 states (Colorado, Connecticut,[http://portal.ct.gov/en/Office- of-the-Governor/Press-Room/Press-Releases/2016/11-2016/Gov-Malloy-and-DOT- Debut-New-Snow-Plows-That-Can-Clear-Two-Highway-Lanes-in-One-Single-Pass Gov.

The first snow plows were horse-drawn wedge-plows made of wood. With the advent of the automobile, a number of inventors set about to improve existing snow plows. In the US, the \\"snow-clearer\\" is said to have been patented as early as the 1840s, for railways. The first snow plow ever built specifically for use with motor equipment was in 1913. It was manufactured by Good Roads Machinery in Kennett Square, PA. and was designed to meet the exacting requirements outlined by engineers of the New York City Street Cleaning Bureau. Good Roads is therefore unofficially credited as the originator of the modern snow plow, though their horse drawn steel blade road graders were used to clear roads of snow as early as the company's founding in 1878 under their original name American Road Machinery. Good Roads patented the first four-wheel grader in 1889 thus making it the first pull grading apparatus patented in the United States. Unlike most early snow plow manufacturers, Good Roads continues to manufacture snow removal equipment today under the name Good Roads Godwin, now located in Dunn, North Carolina. In the early 1920s Good Roads often advertised in The American City magazine that \\"...three out of every four snow plows in use throughout the whole United States are Good Roads Champions.\\" By the mid-1920s Good Roads was manufacturing snow plows of various shapes and sizes for use on a wide variety of motorized equipment. Other snow plow manufactures began to follow suit as motorized plows were proven more efficient than other methods of snow removal. In 1923, the brothers Hans and Even √òveraasen of Norway constructed an early snowplow for use on cars. This proved to be the start of a tradition in snow-clearing equipment for roads, railways and airports, as well as the foundation of the company √òveraasen Snow Removal Systems. Carl Frink of Clayton, New York, USA was also an early manufacturer of automobile-mounted snowplows. His company, Frink Snowplows, now Frink-America, was founded by some accounts as early as 1920. Today snow plows are produced by numerous companies around the world and available for different kinds of vehicles such as service trucks, pickup trucks, SUVs and ATVs. They are installed using model specific or universal hardware and mount to the frame of the vehicle to ensure durable connection. There are manual, power and hydraulic operating snow plows. All necessary mounting hardware usually comes in set with a plow. Snow plow blades are available in various sizes depending on a vehicle type. Service trucks usually use a blade sized and more. Common blade size for pickup trucks and full size SUVs is . Smaller ATV snow plow blades are wide. Railway snowplows wedge plow mounted on a passenger train in Lower Austria In many countries, railway locomotives have small snowplows permanently attached to their bogies, which also serve as pilots. With others, the snowplow forms part of the obstacle deflector below the bufferbeam. Bolt-on versions also exist, and these attach to the bufferbeam or front coupler. However, larger snowplows exist, which tend to be conversions rather than purpose-built vehicles. Steam locomotive tenders, large diesel locomotive bogies and various freight vehicles have been used, with the snowplow body mounted on the original frames. They are one-ended, with conventional coupling equipment on the inner end. In Canada purpose built snowplow cars (based on a box car with caboose cab located above and behind the blade) are in use in areas where there is a significant snow fall during winter periods (especially in Western Canada, Newfoundland and Northern Ontario). These cars were influenced by the Russell Plow from the United States and used in Canada in the 1880s. Most of the Russell type plows have been retired for smaller custom built railplow or snow blades attached to hopper cars or locomotives. Conventional operation may see one or two locomotives running together with a snowplow at either end. This enables a snow clearance train to reverse direction quickly if it gets stuck. Alternatively, a single locomotive with bogie plows can act as a self- propelled snowplow by running light engine. pilot. VIA Rail, among other railways, has integrated plow blades with the front pilots of their locomotive fleet to clear thinner accumulations of snow as trains run. Self-propelled on-track steel and rubber tired \\"Hy-Rail\\" equipment can also be employed to remove snow from railroad tracks. The Pettibone Speed Swing loader and similar machines, both with and without hyrail wheels can be fitted with a large capacity snow bucket or a wedge plow to clear the tracks. Ballast regulators, machines designed to shape the profile of the crushed stone ballast that anchors the track in place, can be used without modification or refitted with purpose built snow blades, blowers and wings to clear snow from the right of way. Locomotive propelled Jordan Ditcher/Spreaders are still sometimes used to plow especially deep snow in the US on the former Wisconsin Central railroad. These machines carry large main plows and hydraulic or air powered articulating wings to push snow far away from the tracks, sometimes past the next adjacent track to facilitate clearing snow from yards and sidings. These machines can also used to create ditches and plow the tracks clear of loose material during maintenance operations. Russell Plows are still in service at some locations, with large front wedge plows and shorter hinged air powered wings only suitable for plowing snow.

The term is a combination of the English word \\"Mama\\" and the Japanese suffix -san which is a polite honorific attached to a person's name or title, coined by U.S. soldiers in Japan after World War II. This probably has had some influence in its spread to other Southeast Asian countries. It is considered extremely rude to refer to a woman in charge of a respectable restaurant or inn as mama-san. The proper title for her is okami or okami-san. In Thailand and the Philippines, mamasan is commonly used to describe a woman who manages the female workers in bars and brothels. To at least some extent, these can be considered the local equivalents of a madam, although the conventions of bar fine prostitution in Asia are quite different from those of street or brothel prostitution in western countries.

The second protective tariff of the 19th century, the Tariff of 1824 was the first in which the sectional interests of the North and the South truly came into conflict. The Tariff of 1816 eight years before had passed into law upon a wave of nationalism that followed the War of 1812. But by 1824, this nationalism was transforming into strong sectionalism. Henry Clay advocated his three-point \\"American System\\", a philosophy that was responsible for the Tariff of 1816, the Second Bank of the United States, and a number of internal improvements. John C. Calhoun embodied the Southern position, having once favored Clay's tariffs and roads, but by 1824 was opposed to both. He saw the protective tariff as a device that benefited the North at the expense of the South, which relied on foreign manufactured goods and open foreign markets for its cotton. And a program of turnpikes built at federal expense, which Clay advocated, would burden the South with taxes without bringing it substantial benefits. Nonetheless, Northern and Western representatives, whose constituencies produced largely for the domestic market and were thus mostly immune to the effects of a protective tariff, joined together to pass the tariff through Congress, beginning the tradition of antagonism between the Southern States and the Northern States that would ultimately help produce the American Civil War.Tariffs, Blockades, and Inflation: The Economics of the Civil War Mark Thornton, Robert B. Ekelund, JR. - 2004 - Page 19 \\"As Frank Taussig argued and as verified in more recent research, the Tariff of 1824 and its companion passed in 1828 (the so-called Tariff of Abominations) were pivotal in solidifying economic interests in North and South.\\" The successor to the Tariff of 1824, the so-called \\"Tariff of Abominations\\" of 1828, was perhaps the most infamous of the protective tariffs for the controversy it incited known as the Nullification Crisis.

The service was initially established as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBC Universal, Providence Equity Partners, and later The Walt Disney Company, serving as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from their respective television networks. In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initially branded as Hulu Plus, which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and undelayed access to new episodes. In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV‚Äîan over-the-top IPTV service featuring linear television channels. Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) later held a stake in the service. As of the first quarter of 2020, Hulu had 35.5 million subscribers. In March 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, giving it a 60% majority stake in Hulu. AT&T; (which acquired Time Warner Now Warner Media in 2018) sold back its roughly 10% stake the following month. Comcast, the only other shareholder, announced on May 14, 2019, that it had agreed to cede its control to Disney, and reached an agreement for Disney to purchase its 33% stake in the company as early as 2024.  Name  The name Hulu comes from two Mandarin Chinese words, h√∫lu (Ëë´Ëä¶/Ëë´ËòÜ), \\"calabash; bottle gourd\\", and h√πl√π (‰∫íÂΩï/‰∫íÈåÑ), \\"interactive recording\\".  History  Individuals instrumental in the founding of Hulu include Bruce Campbell, Peter Chernin, JB Perrette, Michael Lang, Beth Comstock and Jason Kilar. Hulu was announced in March 2006 with AOL, NBC Universal (now Comcast), Facebook, MSN, Myspace, and Yahoo! planned as \\"initial distribution partners\\". Jason Kilar was named Hulu CEO in late 2007. The name Hulu was chosen in late August 2007, when the website went live, with an announcement only and no content. It invited users to leave their email addresses for the upcoming beta test. In October 2007, Hulu began the private beta testing by invitation, and later allowed users to invite friends. Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008. The first product to launch was the HULU Syndication network, which was designed and developed by the NBC Universal team from New York, on October 29, 2007, followed by the Hulu.com destinations site. Hulu began an advertising campaign during NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII with an initial ad starring Alec Baldwin titled \\"Alec in Huluwood\\". Advertisements have since aired featuring Eliza Dushku, Seth MacFarlane, Denis Leary, and Will Arnett. In July 2007, Providence Equity Partners, the owner of Newport Television, became one of the earliest \\"outside\\" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for US$100 million equity investment, before the company was known as \\"Hulu\\". With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an \\"independent voice on the board\\". In April 2009, The Walt Disney Company joined the Hulu consortium as a stakeholder, with plans to offer content from ABC and Disney Channel. Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009. ComScore says monthly video streams reached 903 million in January 2010, over three times the figure for a year earlier, and second only to YouTube. On August 16, 2010, a report revealed that Hulu was planning an initial public offering (IPO) which could value the company at more than $2 billion. On June 21, 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that an \\"unsolicited offer\\" caused Hulu to begin \\"weighing whether to sell itself\\". However, on October 13, 2011, Hulu and its owners announced that they would not sell the company, as none of the bidders offered an amount that was satisfactory to its owners. Hulu generated $420 million in revenue in 2011, $80 million short of the company's target. The vacant CEO post was officially filled by former Fox Networks President Mike Hopkins on October 17, 2013. In October 2012, Providence sold its 10 percent stake to \\"Hulu's media owners\\" and ceased participation in the board. Fox Networks Group COO Randy Freer was named CEO on October 24, 2017.  Disney ownership  In December 2017, Disney announced that they would acquire 21st Century Fox, including its 30% stake in Hulu, in a sale completed on March 20, 2019. The deal resulted in Disney having a controlling 60% interest in Hulu. On April 15, 2019, AT&T; (via WarnerMedia) sold its 9.5% stake in Hulu back to the company for $1.43 billion. Ownership history of Hulu. On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division of Walt Disney Direct-to- Consumer & International (DTCI) with Comcast effectively becoming a silent partner. Under the agreement, Comcast's 33% stake can be sold to Disney at fair market value as early as 2024. The fair market value will be determined at that time, but Disney guaranteed a minimum valuation of the entire company at $27.5 billion (valuing the Comcast stake as worth at least $5.8 billion). Randy Freer would report to Disney executive Kevin Mayer. In the wake of the deal, Disney CEO Bob Iger explained that direct integration of Hulu with Disney's studios would allow increased investments in original content, which would in turn allow it to \\"make the service even more compelling and a greater value for consumers\\". NBCUniversal will continue to license its content to the service through at least 2024, but it will have the option to begin transitioning its exclusivity deals with Hulu to non-exclusive terms beginning in 2020, and to end other content deals beginning in 2022. Disney stated that its control of Hulu was the third major component of its direct-to-consumer strategy, complementing its sports streaming service ESPN+, and its then- forthcoming Disney+ (which would be focused primarily on family-friendly content from Disney's flagship franchises and studios). Hulu would be oriented towards \\"general\\" entertainment and content targeting mature audiences. On July 31, 2019, Disney reorganized Hulu's reporting structure, placing Hulu's Scripted Originals team under Walt Disney Television. Under the new structure, Hulu's SVP of Original Scripted Content would report directly to the chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. As of November 2019, FX and Fox Searchlight were assigned to supply Hulu with content. In January 2020, Disney eliminated the role of Hulu CEO, as part of fully integrating Hulu with Disney's business model. Under the new structure, top Hulu executives would report directly to DTCI and Walt Disney Television leads. On January 31, 2020, CEO Randy Freer resigned from his role as part of a major restructuring of Disney's streaming business; a part of the restructuring, Disney announced on February 25, 2020 that Kelly Campbell would run Hulu as president, reporting to DTCI Chairman, Kevin Mayer.  Partners  Following the start of its service, Hulu signed deals with several new content providers making additional material available to consumers. On April 30, 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would join the venture, purchasing a 27 percent stake in Hulu. Starting August 15, 2011, viewers of content from Fox and related networks are required to authenticate paid cable or satellite service wherever Fox streams episodes, including on Hulu, to be able to watch them the morning after the first airing.

This discount also includes an even more discounted rate for university students.  Products = Hulu subscription service  Hulu's subscription service was launched in beta (preview) on June 29, 2010, and officially launched on November 17, 2010 under the branding Hulu Plus. The service remained advertising-supported, but it offers an expanded content library including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available. Hulu also launched Hulu Plus apps on other types of devices, including mobile, digital media players, and video game consoles. By the end of 2011, Hulu Plus had around 1.5 million subscribers.Nakashima, Ryan January 13, 2012. \\"Hulu Plus ends year with 1.5 million subscribers\\". On April 29, 2015, it was announced that the \\"Hulu Plus\\" branding would be discontinued, and that the service would be henceforth marketed as simply \\"Hulu\\" to place it in-line with its subscription-only competitors.

In late 2016, co-owners 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company agreed to supply their channels to the streaming service, joined by Time Warner, which previously reached an agreement with Hulu. The service, originally marketed as \\"Hulu with Live TV,\\" launched in beta on May 3, 2017. It was later renamed to \\"Hulu + Live TV.\\" The service included live streams of more than 50 broadcast and cable-originated channels, including feeds of the five major broadcast networks ‚Äì ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW ‚Äì as well as cable channels owned by Hulu co-parents NBCUniversal and The Walt Disney Company, along with ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia Entertainment, Scripps Networks Interactive, Fox Corporation and A+E Networks, with HBO, Cinemax, and Showtime available as add-ons for an extra fee.

In the third quarter of 2019, Hulu overtook Sling TV as the top OTT pay television service in the United States, with 2.7 million subscribers.  Viewership  Viewership numbers for the site are tracked by measurement firms such as ComScore, Nielsen ratings, and Quantcast. In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices. The reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropping from 43.5 million unique and special viewers to 24 million in a single month. In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in Review report found that Hulu was watched twice as much as viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined. Hulu in May 2018 announced it has surpassed 20 million subscribers in the United States. The tally, which puts the company about 36 million subscriptions behind Netflix, was disclosed at a media presentation at the newly named Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. Hulu said it has grown total engagement by more than 60%, with 78% of viewing taking place in the living room on connected TVs.

In November 2009, Hulu also began to establish partnerships with record labels to host music videos and concert performances on the site, including EMI in November 2009, and Warner Music Group in December 2009. In early March 2010, Viacom announced that it was pulling two of the website's most popular shows, The Colbert Report and The Daily Show, off Hulu.New York Daily News article: \\"Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' and 'The Colbert Report' off Hulu .\\" The programs had been airing on Hulu since late 2008.

At the 2016 Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, Hulu's first-released documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days A Week ‚Äì The Touring Years won the award for Best Music Documentary. The documentary also received Grammy Award for Best Music Film at the 2017 Grammy Awards and Best Documentary at the 16th Annual Movies for Grownups Awards. At the Creative Arts Emmys, the documentary earned two Emmys including Outstanding Sound Editing and Outstanding Sound Mixing. At the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, Hulu received its first Emmy Award nominations for its Original series, 11.22.63 and for Triumph's Election Special 2016. In 2016, Hulu received its first Golden Globe nomination for its Original series, Casual, for TV series, Comedy.  International availability  In July 2010, the Financial Times revealed that Hulu had been working on plans for an international launch of Hulu Plus for several months, and had identified the UK and Japan as markets where its free website and subscription model could feasibly work.Garrahan, Matthew. Hulu eyes launching global pay platform , Financial Times, July 8, 2010. Retrieved July 11, 2010. Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar expressed his belief that the US model could be replicated elsewhere, saying \\"We won't be satisfied until this is a global service.\\"Laughlin, Andrew. Hulu 'puts UK launch back on agenda' , Digital Spy, July 9, 2010. Retrieved July 11, 2010. Hulu's first expansion into an international market took place with the launch of a service in Japan on September 1, 2011. On February 27, 2014, Nippon TV announced that it would acquire Hulu's Japanese business. The service would maintain the Hulu name under license, and Hulu would continue to provide its infrastructure and support to the service as a regional licensee. Nippon TV also planned to produce its own original content for the service. As rights to its content are already held by other broadcasters, U.S.-based video on demand services, including Hulu, are not usually available in Canada. Hulu also cited a small advertising market in Canada as a reason not to launch in that country. Rights to Hulu's original series have often been picked up by domestic broadcasters; for example, The Mindy Project was retained by its previous broadcast home, Citytv, after its move to Hulu, The Handmaid's Tale was acquired by Bell Media cable network Bravo (unrelated to the NBC-owned channel) and its streaming service Crave, and The Path by Showcase. The lack of international operations had been considered a potential shortcoming of Hulu in comparison to its sister streaming service Disney+, and competitors such as Prime Video and Netflix. During an earnings call on November 8, 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that after its purchase of 21st Century Fox, it planned to make stronger investments into Hulu, including wider international expansion. In February 2020, Iger announced that the international expansion of Hulu would start in early 2021. During an earnings call on August 5, 2020, Bob Chapek, who had taken over from Iger as CEO of Disney in late February, announced that a new Star-branded streaming service will launch internationally in 2021. He asserted that the Hulu brand is unknown outside the U.S., and therefore Disney had decided against using it for the new service. Chapek further announced that the new streaming service will not have licensed content from other studios, similarly to Disney+ and unlike Hulu which does carry licensed content. Instead, the international service will only have content owned by Disney from ABC, FX, Freeform, 20th Television, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures.

If a knot is embedded in the 3-sphere, then the complement is the 3-sphere minus the space near the knot. To make this precise, suppose that K is a knot in a three-manifold M (most often, M is the 3-sphere). Let N be a tubular neighborhood of K; so N is a solid torus. The knot complement is then the complement of N, :X_K = M - \\\\mbox{interior}(N). The knot complement XK is a compact 3-manifold; the boundary of XK and the boundary of the neighborhood N are homeomorphic to a two-torus. Sometimes the ambient manifold M is understood to be 3-sphere. Context is needed to determine the usage. There are analogous definitions of link complement. Many knot invariants, such as the knot group, are really invariants of the complement of the knot. When the ambient space is the three-sphere no information is lost: the Gordon-Luecke theorem states that a knot is determined by its complement. That is, if K and K‚Ä≤ are two knots with homeomorphic complements then there is a homeomorphism of the three-sphere taking one knot to the other.

The song is credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney, although in the 1997 book, Many Years from Now, McCartney recalls it as entirely his. This is supported by a 1970 interview with John Lennon by Ray Connolly, in which he could not remember writing it; \\"That must be one of Paul's,\\" he said.\\"1970: John talking about his songs [telephone interview]\\", The Ray Connolly Beatles Archive, Plumray Books, 2011, Kindle edition, ASIN: B0052AFE6S Origin and recording The song was originally recorded for Help! in June 1965, but was rejected for inclusion on the album. When Rubber Soul fell one song short for a Christmas release, \\"Wait\\" was brought back. Overdubs were added to the initial recording so it would blend in better with the other, more recent songs on Rubber Soul. The lyrics \\"probably reflected his [McCartney's] complex relationship with Jane Asher: 'I am often away, but if you really love me, wait for me'\\", according to authors Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin. The vocals on the verse are shared between Lennon and McCartney, and McCartney sings the two middle eight sections. For his guitar part, Harrison uses a volume pedal, which he earlier utilised on \\"I Need You\\" and \\"Yes It Is\\".

Labrosse in 1991. It is a priority-based preemptive real-time kernel for microprocessors, written mostly in the programming language C. It is intended for use in embedded systems. MicroC/OS allows defining several functions in C, each of which can execute as an independent thread or task. Each task runs at a different priority, and runs as if it owns the central processing unit (CPU). Lower priority tasks can be preempted by higher priority tasks at any time. Higher priority tasks use operating system (OS) services (such as a delay or event) to allow lower priority tasks to execute. OS services are provided for managing tasks and memory, communicating between tasks, and timing. History The MicroC/OS kernel was published originally in a three-part article in Embedded Systems Programming magazine and the book ŒºC/OS The Real-Time Kernel by Jean J. Labrosse (). The author intended at first to simply describe the internals of a portable operating system he had developed for his own use, but later developed the OS as a commercial product in versions II and III. ŒºC/OS-II Based on the source code written for ŒºC/OS, and introduced as a commercial product in 1998, ŒºC/OS-II is a portable, ROM-able, scalable, preemptive, real- time, deterministic, multitasking kernel for microprocessors, and digital signal processors (DSPs). It manages up to 255 application tasks. Its size can be scaled (between 5 and 24 Kbytes) to only contain the features needed for a given use. Most of ŒºC/OS-II is written in highly portable ANSI C, with target microprocessor-specific code written in assembly language. Use of the latter is minimized to ease porting to other processors.  Uses in embedded systems  ŒºC/OS-II was designed for embedded uses. If the producer has the proper tool chain (i.e., C compiler, assembler, and linker-locator), ŒºC/OS-II can be embedded as part of a product. ŒºC/OS-II is used in many embedded systems, including: * Avionics * Medical equipment and devices * Data communications equipment * White goods (appliances) * Mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), MIDs * Industrial controls * Consumer electronics * Automotive Task states ŒºC/OS-II is a multitasking operating system. Each task is an infinite loop and can be in any one of the following five states (see figure below additionally) *Dormant *Ready *Running *Waiting (for an event) *Interrupted (interrupt service routine (ISR)) Further, it can manage up to 255 tasks. However, it is recommended that eight of these tasks be reserved for ŒºC/OS-II, leaving an application up to 247 tasks. Kernels The kernel is the name given to the program that does most of the housekeeping tasks for the operating system. The boot loader hands control over to the kernel, which initializes the various devices to a known state and makes the computer ready for general operations.Wikiversity:Operating Systems/Kernel Models#Monolithic Kernel The kernel is responsible for managing tasks (i.e., for managing the CPU's time) and communicating between tasks. The fundamental service provided by the kernel is context switching. The scheduler is the part of the kernel responsible for determining which task runs next. Most real-time kernels are priority based. In a priority-based kernel, control of the CPU is always given to the highest priority task ready to run. Two types of priority- based kernels exist: non-preemptive and preemptive. Nonpreemptive kernels require that each task do something to explicitly give up control of the CPU. A preemptive kernel is used when system responsiveness is more important. Thus, ŒºC/OS-II and most commercial real-time kernels are preemptive. The highest priority task ready to run is always given control of the CPU. Assigning tasks Tasks with the highest rate of execution are given the highest priority using rate-monotonic scheduling. This scheduling algorithm is used in real-time operating systems (RTOS) with a static-priority scheduling class. Managing tasks In computing, a task is a unit of execution. In some operating systems, a task is synonymous with a process, in others with a thread. In batch processing computer systems, a task is a unit of execution within a job. The system user of ŒºC/OS-II is able to control the tasks by using the following features: *Task feature *Task creation *Task stack & stack checking *Task deletion *Change a task's priority *Suspend and resume a task *Get information about a task Managing memory To avoid fragmentation, ŒºC/OS-II allows applications to obtain fixed-sized memory blocks from a partition made of a contiguous memory area. All memory blocks are the same size, and the partition contains an integral number of blocks. Allocation and deallocation of these memory blocks is done in constant time and is a deterministic system. Managing time ŒºC/OS-II requires that a periodic time source be provided to keep track of time delays and timeouts. A tick should occur between 10 and 1000 times per second, or Hertz. The faster the tick rate, the more overhead ŒºC/OS-II imposes on the system. The frequency of the clock tick depends on the desired tick resolution of an application. Tick sources can be obtained by dedicating a hardware timer, or by generating an interrupt from an alternating current (AC) power line (50 or 60 Hz) signal. This periodic time source is termed a clock tick. After a clock tick is determined, tasks can be: *Delaying a task *Resume a delayed task Communicating between tasks Intertask or interprocess communication in ŒºC/OS-II occurs via: semaphores, message mailbox, message queues, tasks, and interrupt service routines (ISRs). They can interact with each other when a task or an ISR signals a task through a kernel object called an event control block (ECB). The signal is considered to be an event. ŒºC/OS-III ŒºC/OS-III is the acronym for Micro-Controller Operating Systems Version 3, introduced in 2009 and adding functionality to the ŒºC/OS-II RTOS. ŒºC/OS-III offers all of the features and functions of ŒºC/OS-II. The biggest difference is the number of supported tasks. ŒºC/OS-II allows only 1 task at each of 255 priority levels, for a maximum of 255 tasks. ŒºC/OS-III allows any number of application tasks, priority levels, and tasks per level, limited only by processor access to memory. ŒºC/OS-II and ŒºC/OS-III are currently maintained by Micrium, Inc., a subsidiary of Silicon Labs, and can be licensed per product or per product line. Uses in embedded systems The uses are the same as for ŒºC/OS-II Task states ŒºC/OS-III is a multitasking operating system. Each task is an infinite loop and can be in any one of five states (dormant, ready, running, interrupted, or pending). Task priorities can range from 0 (highest priority) to a maximum of 255 (lowest possible priority). Round robin scheduling When two or more tasks have the same priority, the kernel allows one task to run for a predetermined amount of time, named a quantum, and then selects another task. This process is termed round robin scheduling or time slicing. The kernel gives control to the next task in line if: *The current task has no work to do during its time slice, or *The current task completes before the end of its time slice, or *The time slice ends. Kernels The kernel functionality for ŒºC/OS-III is the same as for ŒºC/OS-II. Managing tasks Task management also functions the same as for ŒºC/OS-II, however, ŒºC/OS-III supports multitasking and allows an application to have any number of tasks. The maximum number of tasks is limited by only the amount of memory (both code and data space) available to the processor. A task can be implemented via run to completion scheduling, in which the task deletes itself when it is finished, or more typically as an infinite loop, waiting for events to occur and processing those events. Managing memory Memory management is performed in the same way as in ŒºC/OS-II. Managing time ŒºC/OS-III offers the same time managing features as ŒºC/OS-II. It also provides services to applications so that tasks can suspend their execution for user-defined time delays. Delays are specified by a number of either clock ticks, or hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Communicating between tasks Sometimes, a task or ISR must communicate information to another task, because it is unsafe for two tasks to access the same specific data or hardware resource at once. This can be resolved via an information transfer, termed inter-task communication. Information can be communicated between tasks in two ways: through global data, or by sending messages. When using global variables, each task or ISR must ensure that it has exclusive access to variables. If an ISR is involved, the only way to ensure exclusive access to common variables is to disable interrupts. If two tasks share data, each can gain exclusive access to variables by either disabling interrupts, locking the scheduler, using a semaphore, or preferably, using a mutual exclusion semaphore. Messages can be sent to either an intermediate object called a message queue, or directly to a task, since in ŒºC/OS-III, each task has its own built-in message queue. Use an external message queue if multiple tasks are to wait for messages. Send a message directly to a task if only one task will process the data received. While a task waits for a message to arrive, it uses no CPU time. Ports A port involves three aspects: CPU, OS, and board specific (BSP) code. ŒºC/OS-II and ŒºC/OS-III have ports for most popular processors and boards in the market and are suitable for use in safety critical embedded systems such as aviation, medical systems, and nuclear installations. A ŒºC/OS-III port involves writing or changing the contents of three kernel specific files: \`OS_CPU.H\`, \`OS_CPU_A.ASM\`, and \`OS_CPU_C.C\`. It is necessary to write or change the content of three CPU specific files: \`CPU.H\`, \`CPU_A.ASM\`, and \`CPU_C.C\`. Finally create or change a board support package (BSP) for the evaluation board or target board being used. A ŒºC/OS-III port is similar to a ŒºC/OS-II port. There are significantly more ports than listed here, and ports are subject to continuous development. Both ŒºC/OS-II and ŒºC/OS-III are supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL, which ensure security across all connections. Licensing Change After acquisition by Silicon Labs, Micrium in 2020 has changed to an Open Source licensing model in February 2020. This includes uC/OS III, all prior versions, all components (USB, file system, GUI, TCP/IP, etc). Documentation and Support In addition to a typical support forum, a number of well-written books are available. Books are available as free PDFs, or for low-cost purchase as hard-cover books. A number of books are each tailored to a particular microcontroller architecture / development platform. Paid support is available from Micrium and others.

The suburb is believed to be named after Truganini, who was often wrongly described as the last full-blooded Aboriginal Tasmanian woman, as she had visited the area for a short time. Truganina is a rapidly growing suburban area with Truganina recording a population of 20,687 at the . It is bordered roughly by the Skeleton-Waterholes Creek to the west; Boundary Road to the north; Foundation to the east and the Federation Trail to the south. It is home to the A-League club Western United. History Truganina Post Office opened on 12 June 1878, closed in 1895, reopened in 1902 and closed again in 1942. The nearby Tarneit Post Office opened in 2008 to serve the area. In 1969 bushfires claimed about 60 houses in the area.  Name pronunciation  The pronunciation of Truganina has two common points of dispute. The first is the vowel used in the initial syllable \\"Trug\\", and the second is the vowel used in the third syllable \\"ni\\". As the suburb is believed to be named after Truganini, the pronunciation of Truganina can be elucidated by the phonology of her name in her native tongue. Truganina was, in the Bruny Island language (Nuennonne), the name of the grey saltbush Atriplex cinerea. In reference to the Oyster-Bay pronunciation (the region where Truganini was born) of the Indigenous Palawa languages of Tasmania, Truganini's name would have been pronounced as \\"Troo-ga-ni-ni\\" [ÀàtrugaÀånini] with short vowels, rather than with an initial unrounded open-mid vowel in the initial position [tr å]; or with the diphthong of \\"nai-nai\\" [n…ë…™n…ë…™] in the third syllable. This would make the approximated Palawa pronunciation of \\"Truganina\\" as [ÀàtrugaÀånin…ô]. Taking this into account, \\"Troo-ga-nee-na\\" [Ààtrug…ôÀåni:n…ô] is most likely the closest correct anglicised pronunciation. Aerial perspective of Skeleton Creek Truganina Population growth Truganina is expected to have a population of 39,951 by 2031, which would be an increase of 1,350.6%, or 28,633 persons from 2006.Population Forecast, Forecast.id. Retrieved 3 April 2011 * 2,958 (2006) * 8,353 (2011 estimated) * 17,469 (2014 abs) *20,687 (2016 census) * 39,951 (2031 projected) Urban sprawl Truganina (and neighbouring Tarneit) is largely characterised by low density development and is growing rapidly in advance of transport infrastructure and services, meaning that the vast majority of new residents are currently dependent on automobiles. The growth is primarily due to affordable housing and the area's location within a growth corridor that is close to the major manufacturing areas in Laverton and the proposed business park on part of the RAAF Williams Base. Facilities=Telecommunications People who live in developments with broadband hubs will have access to high speed DSL services, as local exchanges are too far away for effective DSL services. New houses being built are now being connected to National Broadband Network using the FTTP and FTTC technologies. Transport Truganina's road network is laid out in street hierarchy, with almost all residential streets feeding into a grid of main roads including busy east‚Äìwest corridor Sayers Road, Leakes Road, Dohertys Road and Boundary Road, and north‚Äìsouth links Morris Road, Marquands Road, Woods Road and Palmers Road. As part of the Regional Rail Link project, bridges were built over the railway line at two locations in Truganina, Dohertys and Boundary Road's. This enables commuters to keep using the road whilst the railway line functions underneath, effectively a grade separation. The main public transport is the bus network, with most of the main routes runs via Forsyth and Sayers Roads. The bus runs through the Clearwater Rise residential estate and also Marquands Road. Off-road cycling is facilitated by the Federation Trail at the southern border of the suburb, however few of the main roads provide provision for bicycles. The nearest railway stations is Williams Landing which is 3.5 kilometres from the centre of Truganina. Laverton and Hoppers Crossing, both on the Werribee railway line are 5 kilometers from the centre of Truganina. Another similarly distant railway station, Tarneit, at the corner of Derrimut Road and Leakes Road in nearby Tarneit, opened recently as part of the Regional Rail Link project. This would provide V/Line diesel services on route between Geelong and Melbourne.Geelong - Melbourne timetable Public Transport Victoria There are plans for an additional Truganina railway station to eventually be added to the line to service Truganina. Education There are several schools in Truganina, including Westbourne Grammar School, Al-Taqwa Islamic College, Truganina South Primary School, Truganina P-9 College and St Clare's Catholic Primary School Industry Parts of Truganina have been planned as new areas for industrial zones. These planned areas lie northwards and eastwards of the new housing zones in southern Truganina. Distribution centres Many distribution centres are setting up in the Truganina area due to the easy access to rail, roads and air freight services. Currently Woolworths Limited has a large liquor distribution centre that services BWS, Dan Murphy's and Woolworths Liquor. Linfox also have a small logistics centre in the same complex, and to the north of the area K&S; Freighters. In 2010 Kmart Australia started construction on a new purpose built distribution centre in Truganina. The Kmart Australia Distribution Centre is now the largest building by footprint size in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere and tenth largest in the world. Another mega distribution centre in the Truganina industrial area was built for Coles Supermarkets in 2012 which is approximately 70,000 square metres.

Despite the name, petroleum ether is not classified as an ether; the term is used only figuratively, signifying extreme lightness and volatility.  Properties  The very lightest, most volatile liquid hydrocarbon solvents that can be bought from laboratory chemical suppliers may also be offered under the name petroleum ether. Petroleum ether consists mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons and is usually low on aromatics. It is commonly hydrodesulfurized and may be hydrogenated to reduce the amount of aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbons. Petroleum ether bears normally a descriptive suffix giving the boiling range. Thus, from the leading international laboratory chemical suppliers it is possible to buy various petroleum ethers with boiling ranges such as 30-50 ¬∞C, 40-60 ¬∞C, 50-70 ¬∞C, 60-80 ¬∞C, etc. In the United States, laboratory-grade aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents with boiling ranges as high as 100-140 ¬∞C may be called petroleum ether, rather than petroleum spirit. It is not advisable to employ a fraction with a wider boiling point range than 20 ¬∞C, because of possible loss of the more volatile portion during its use in recrystallisation, etc., and consequent different solubilising properties of the higher boiling residue. Most of the unsaturated hydrocarbons may be removed by shaking two or three times with 10% of the volume of concentrated sulfuric acid; vigorous shaking is then continued with successive portions of a concentrated solution of potassium permanganate in 10% sulfuric acid until the color of the permanganate remains unchanged. The solvent is then thoroughly washed with sodium carbonate solution and then with water, dried over anhydrous calcium chloride, and distilled. If required perfectly dry, it can be allowed to stand over sodium wire, or calcium hydride.  Standards  Ligroin is assigned the CAS Registry Number 8032-32-4, which is also applied to many other products, particularly the lower boiling ones, called petroleum spirit, petroleum ether, and petroleum benzine. \\"Naphtha\\" has the CAS Registry Number 8030-30-6, which also covers petroleum benzine and petroleum ether: that is, the lower boiling point non-aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. DIN 51630 provides for petroleum spirit (also called spezialbenzine or petrolether) which is described as \\"a special boiling-point spirit (SBPS) commonly used in laboratory applications, having high volatility and low aromatics content.\\" Its initial boiling point is above 25 ¬∞C, its final boiling point up to 80 ¬∞C.  Safety  Petroleum ethers are extremely volatile, have very low flash points, and present a significant fire hazard. Fires should be fought with foam, carbon dioxide, dry chemical or carbon tetrachloride. The naphtha mixtures that are distilled at a lower boiling temperature have a higher volatility and, generally speaking, a higher degree of toxicity than the higher boiling fractions. Exposure to petroleum ether occurs most commonly by either inhalation or through skin contact. Petroleum ether is metabolized by the liver with a biological half-life of 46‚Äì48 h. Inhalation overexposure causes primarily central nervous system (CNS) effects (headaches, dizzines, nausea, fatigue, and incoordination). In general, the toxicity is more pronounced with petroleum ethers containing higher concentrations of aromatic compounds. n-Hexane is known to cause axonal damage in peripheral nerves. Skin contact can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Oral ingestion of hydrocarbons often is associated with symptoms of mucous membrane irritation, vomiting, and central nervous system depression. Cyanosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea may appear as a result of aspiration, with subsequent development of chemical pneumonitis. Other clinical findings include albuminuria, hematuria, hepatic enzyme derangement, and cardiac arrhythmias. Doses as low as 10 ml orally have been reported to be potentially fatal, whereas some patients have survived the ingestion of 60 ml of petroleum distillates. A history of coughing or choking in association with vomiting strongly suggests aspiration and hydrocarbon pneumonia. Hydrocarbon pneumonia is an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing disease that can develop within 24 h after the ingestion. Pneumonia may require several weeks for complete resolution. Intravenous administration produces fever and local tissue damage. Petroleum-derived distillates have not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans. Petroleum ether degrades rapidly in soil and water.

Monkey Soccer (known as Monkey Football outside of North America) is an association football game, Monkey Dance is a rhythm game requiring players to match dance moves to the rhythm, and Monkey Climber is a challenging game requiring players to navigate a monkey across vines. Completing the game unlocks a New Game+ mode in which players can play as the previous game's hero,Kakeru (Spike outside of North America). Story The game takes place after the events in Ape Escape, where Kakeru (Spike in the English versions) stopped Specter from taking over the world. It is a few years later, and the Professor left for a vacation leaving his granddaughter, Natsumi (Natalie in the U.S. version),[1] and Spike's cousin, Hikaru (Jimmy in the U.S. version), to watch over the laboratory. The Professor has left them with one task: deliver a load of monkey pants to the monkeys in Monkey Park. Hikaru accidentally sends not only the monkey pants, but some Monkey Helmets as well, wrecking the laboratory in the process. Specter gets a hold of one, and yet again makes an army of monkeys bent on ruling the world. Under Natsumi's orders, Hikaru aims to capture all the monkeys and stop Specter. However, Specter has supplied five monkeys, the Freaky Monkey Five, with Vita-Z bananas, making them stronger and more intelligent than the average monkeys. Hikaru manages to capture all of the Freaky Monkey Five, except Yellow Monkey. Before his fight with White Monkey, Pipotchi, a baby monkey accompanying Hikaru, is kidnapped, in order to transfer the data in his Monkey Helmet (a re-engineered model which makes Pipotchi friendly) into a device called the Lethargy Laser. Rescuing Pipotchi, Hikaru makes his way through a monkey controlled military base, and confronts Specter, who is waiting for him with a redesigned version of his battle cruiser from the first game. Before the two can battle, Yellow Monkey, now a giant monster thanks to an overdose of Vita-Z bananas attacks the facility. Specter flees, and Hikaru manages to downsize and capture Yellow. Hikaru, the Professor and Natsumi then discover the purpose of the Lethargy Laser. By firing it at the globe, all humans worldwide will lose the will to fight back, making it easier for Specter and the monkeys to take over the world. Hikaru confronts Specter at his moonbase, who attacks him with a giant robot. Once defeated, Specter attempts to fire the laser, but Hikaru states that humans will never give up, and captures him. Hikaru and Pipotchi then flee the exploding moonbase. Shortly afterwards, Specter escapes and goes into hiding. Hikaru then proceeds to capture all the remaining monkeys before the Professor discovers Specter's hiding place. Hikaru warps there, encountering Specter, and the two of them battle again. Specter loses and is once again captured. The game ends with Kakeru visiting the laboratory, which is again destroyed when Hikaru accidentally crashes a spaceship into it. Development The game was directed and produced by Naoto Ohta, formerly of Capcom. The music of the game was composed by Koji Hayama, managed by Don Makkou and Bungo Fujiwara of Two Five and data programmed by Masaaki Kaneko of Procyon Studio. The game's sound effects were created by Takashi Kanai and Junko Sano. The voice acting of the American version was recorded by Dan Rich and Jeremy Blaustein. The American voice cast features Rachael Lillis, Jay Snyder, Gary Littman, Carter Cathcart, Greg Abbey, Tara Sands and Kathleen McInerney. The voice acting of the European version was recorded at Side UK on Great Titchfield Street in London, with Andy Emery serving as the voice director. The European voice cast consists of Jonathan Keeble as the Professor and Red Monkey, Mark Silk as Specter and White Monkey, David Holt as Hikaru, Yellow Monkey and Pipotchi, Rachel Preece as Natsumi and Pink Monkey and Richard Pearce as Blue Monkey and Kakeru. Ape Escape 2 was re- released as a PSN title in 2016, featuring trophies and upscaled graphics. There's also remote play and second screen options available. Reception On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥2 - „Çµ„É´„Ç≤„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„É•2. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.78. 30 June 2006.

Geography Brezno is located within the Horehronsk√© podolie basin. Brezno lies between the Low Tatras mountain range and the Slovak Ore Mountains, both of which belong to the Inner Western Carpathians. The town is situated on the right bank of the River Hron, which flows through town from the east, in the direction of the city of Bansk√° Bystrica, approximately west. The local climate in the basin is rather cold, with an annual average of and an annual precipitation of . History The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, but the current town arose from an old Slovak settlement, next to which newly arrived German miners erected a typical market square in the early 13th century. The first written evidence of the town's existence is dated 1265 when King B√©la IV of Hungary issued a charter for hunters from the area of Liptov, allowing them to use the woods around the settlement known as Berezuno. The name is derived from the Slovak word \\"breza\\" for birch. In the nineteenth century Brezno was a typical, almost purely Slovak town and was one of the centers of the Slovak national movement. After the Second World War the town developed into an industrial center. By far the largest industrial concern was Mostaren Brezno, a construction company which specialized in crane construction for the whole of Central Europe. Mostaren Brezno's restructuring in the early '90s caused high unemployment in the whole region. Since the late '90s, Brezno has built a large retail sector and promoted itself and the whole region as a tourist destination. Sports games and events such as the World Cup Biathlon and golf championships are held regularly. Sports The town's three sports clubs with the highest attendance are HC Brezno, FC Brezno and Biathlon Club Brezno. Other sports clubs include Volleyball Club Brezno, Cycle Club Brezno, and Swim Club Brezno. The hockey club HC Brezno represents the town as part of the 1st senior league since the 2009/10 season. Therefore, the Brezno town council decided to reconstruct it's indoor stadium in 2009. During the reconstruction, new seats were added and the stadium was renamed the Brezno Arena; total capacity was increased to 2,500 seats. Demographics According to the 2013 census, the town had 21,534 inhabitants. According to the 2001 census 92.85% of the inhabitants were Slovaks, 4.63% Roma, 0.80% Czechs and 0.22% Hungarian. The religious makeup was 66.89% Roman Catholics, 18.54% people with no religious affiliation, 8.57% Lutherans, and 0.98% Greek Catholics.

The screenplay was written by Robert Dozier, based on the novel of the same name (1950) by Henry Morton Robinson. The music score was written by Jerome Moross. The film's cast features Tom Tryon, Romy Schneider and John Huston, and it was nominated for six Academy Awards. It marks the final appearance by veteran film star Dorothy Gish as well as the last big-screen performance of Maggie McNamara. The film was shot on location in Rome, Vienna, Boston and Stamford, Connecticut. Robinson's novel was based on the life of Cardinal Francis Spellman, who was then Archbishop of New York. The Vatican's liaison officer for the film was Rev. Dr. Joseph Ratzinger,The Cardinal review by Frank Miller, Turner Classic Movies later to become Pope Benedict XVI. The story touches on various social issues such as interfaith marriage, sex outside marriage, abortion, racial bigotry, the rise of fascism and war.  Plot  This former Boston streetcar was restored to its 1915 Boston Elevated Railway livery for scenes in the film. The film is shown as a series of memory flashbacks during a formal ceremony where the protagonist is instituted as a cardinal. A newly ordained Irish Catholic priest, Stephen Fermoyle (Tom Tryon), returns home to Boston in 1917. He discovers that his parents are upset about daughter Mona (Carol Lynley) having become engaged to marry a Jewish man, Benny Rampell (John Saxon). Mona seeks Stephen's counsel as a priest. Concerned about the young priest's ambition, the archbishop (John Huston) assigns Stephen to an out-of- the-way parish where it is hoped that he will learn humility. There he meets the humble pastor, Father Ned Halley (Burgess Meredith), and Fermoyle observes the unpretentious way in which he lives his life and treats his parishioners. Father Halley is very sick with multiple sclerosis. Fermoyle learns humility from him and his housekeeper, Lalage (Jill Haworth). Stephen and his Irish Catholic family will only permit Mona to marry her Jewish fianc√© Benny if he becomes a Catholic or agrees to raise any children as Catholic. Benny does not agree and leaves to serve in World War I. Mona runs away and becomes promiscuous. She becomes pregnant out of wedlock. Stephen, his brother and Benny find Mona in agony because her pelvis is too small for a large baby. She is taken to the hospital, where the doctor tells Stephen that it is too late to perform a caesarean operation and in order to save Mona, the head of the baby must be crushed. Stephen will not allow the doctor to do so, because according to Catholic doctrine, the baby may not be killed. Mona dies giving birth to the child, Regina. Racked with guilt over the death of his sister, Stephen suffers a crisis of faith, so he is transferred to Europe and made a monsignor, but he is unsure of how committed he is to a life in the clergy, and he travels to Vienna, taking a two-year sabbatical by working as a lecturer. There he meets and enters into a relationship with a young woman, Annemarie (Romy Schneider). Stephen does not violate his vows. Stephen's vocation calls him back to Rome and the church. The Vatican returns him to the United States on a mission in the American South to assist a black priest named Father Gillis (Ossie Davis) who is opposed by the Ku Klux Klan. After successfully handling the assignment, Stephen is consecrated as a bishop, with Father Gillis present for the consecration. Stephen is sent back to Austria to persuade a cardinal not to cooperate with the Nazis, with a threat of a world war looming over all. He and the cardinal ultimately must flee for their lives. He manages to see Annemarie one last time after she has been imprisoned by the Nazis. After the success of the missions on which the Vatican had sent him, he is elevated to the College of Cardinals. On the eve of World War II, a ceremony is held in which Stephen formally becomes a cardinal. He warns about the dangers of totalitarianism and pledges to dedicate the rest of his life to his work.

The terminology is popular rather than scientific: there is no scientific coverage (or evidence) of the phenomenon as a distinct sort of wave with respect to height or predictability‚Äîas there is on other extreme wave events such as rogue waves. One American oceanographer distinguishes \\"rogue waves\\" as occurring on the ocean and sneaker waves as occurring at the shore. Because they are much larger than preceding waves, sneaker waves can catch unwary swimmers, waders, and even people on the beaches and ocean jetties and wash them into the sea. Sneaker waves are mainly referred to in warnings and reports of incidents for the coasts of Central and Northern California (including the San Francisco Bay Area's beaches, especially Ocean Beach, Baker Beach, and those that face the Pacific Ocean) (e.g. from Big Sur to the California‚ÄìOregon border), Oregon, and Washington in the Western United States. These sneaker waves also occur on the coast of British Columbia in Western Canada, especially this province's southern coast, because they commonly occur on the west coast of Vancouver Island (including Tofino, Ucluelet, and Cape Scott Provincial Park). Sneaker waves are common on the southern coast of Iceland, and warning signs have been erected at Reynisfjara and Kirkjufjara beaches, following three unrelated tourist deaths in recent years. King waves occur especially in Western Australia and Tasmania. Seventh wave In many parts of the world, local folklore predicts that out of a certain number of waves, one will be much larger than the rest. \\"Every seventh wave\\" or \\"every ninth wave\\" are examples of such common beliefs that have wide circulation and have entered popular culture through music, literature, and art. These ideas have some scientific merit, due to the occurrence of wave groups at sea, but there is no explicit evidence for this specific phenomenon, or that these wave groups are related to sneaker waves. The saying is likely derived more from a cultural fascination with certain numbers , and it may also be designed to educate shore-dwellers about the necessity of remaining vigilant when near the ocean.

In 1931, when Ziglar was five years old, his father took a management position at a Mississippi farm, and his family moved to Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he spent most of his early childhood. The next year, his father died of a stroke, and his younger sister died two days later. Between 1943 and 1945, he participated in the Navy V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina.  Career  Ziglar dropped out of college in 1947 and moved to Lancaster, South Carolina where he took up a job as a salesman with the WearEver Cookware company. Ziglar was promoted to field manager and eventually divisional supervisor in 1950. While working at the company, Ziglar became interested in self-help and motivational speaking, and began giving speeches of his own. With Richard \\"Dick\\" Gardner and Hal Krause, Ziglar was a charter member in the establishment of American Salesmasters in 1963. The company's objective was to raise the image of salespeople in America by providing seminars. They began with cities across the South and Midwest (Memphis, Atlanta, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver, etc.), featuring speakers such as Ziglar, Norman Vincent Peale, Ken McFarland, Cavett Robert, Bill Gove, Maxwell Maltz, and Red Motley. They booked an auditorium, put together a slate of speakers and contacted local businesses to sell tickets. Audiences included insurance agents, car salesmen, financial advisors, entrepreneurs, small business owners and curiosity seekers. Ziglar went on to speak extensively for audiences of the National Association of Sales Education (NASE), founded by Dick Gardner in 1965, and also became a major sales trainer for Mary Kay Cosmetics. In 1968, he became a vice president and training director for the Automotive Performance company and moved to Dallas, Texas. The company went bankrupt two years later. He founded the Zigmanship Institute, later known as Ziglar, Inc., after this. Subsequently, Ziglar spoke extensively at seminars for motivational speaker Peter Lowe and eventually signed an exclusive agreement to support Peter Lowe events. In addition to speaking, Ziglar wrote over 30 books. His first book, See You at the Top, was rejected 39 times before it was published in 1975. It is still in print. In Addison Texas, Ziglar employed and trained several speakers, including Will Harris. In 2007, a fall down a flight of stairs left him with short-term memory problems. Nonetheless, Ziglar continued taking part in motivational seminars until he retired in 2010.  Quotes  \\"You can get everything you want in life if you will just help other people get what they want.\\" \\"Success doesn't come overnight, it comes over time.\\"  Personal life  Ziglar met his wife, Jean, in 1944, in Jackson, Mississippi. He was 17 and she was 16; they married in late 1946. They had four children: Suzan, Tom, Cindy, and Julie. Ziglar, a Baptist, integrated Christianity into his motivational work. He was also a Republican who endorsed the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee for his party's presidential nomination in 2008.

As of January 2018, AFA represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines. Since 2004, AFA has been part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), an affiliate of AFL-CIO. AFA is also an affiliate of the International Transport Workers' Federation. History AFA was founded in 1945 by flight attendants at United Airlines. The organization was originally known as Airline Stewardess Association (ALSA). ALSA negotiated its first contract with United in 1946. In 1949, ALSA merged with the Air Line Stewards and Stewardesses Association (ALSSA), an affiliate of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). By 1951, ALSSA had 3,300 members. ALPA created two separate divisions in 1960, one for pilots, and one for stewards and stewardesses. Nearly half of the USA's 8,700 flight attendants were members of ALPA's S&S; division at that time. In 1973, ALSSA flight attendants chose self-determination and formed an independent Association of Flight Attendants, leaving ALPA. In 1982, AFA had 22,000 members at 18 American airlines. In 1984, the AFL-CIO granted AFA a charter.Nielsen, passim. By 1995, AFA represented 36,000 Flight Attendants at 23 carriers. Four years later, 46,000 flight attendants at 26 airlines were AFA members. After layoffs resulting from the September 11, 2001 Attacks, AFA members voted in 2004 to merge with the Communications Workers of America (700,000 members). Organizing In July 2006, Northwest Airlines flight attendants voted to replace their independent union with AFA. AFA's membership rose to 55,000 flight attendants. On November 4, 2010, AFA was decertified by the National Mediation Board as the bargaining representative for the pre- merger Northwest Airlines flight attendants of Delta Air Lines, after narrowly losing a representational election of the combined group the day before. AFA filed objections to the election with the National Mediation Board alleging interference.Union claims Delta interfered in election, by David Shaffer, Minneapolis Star Tribune, last web updated on November 23, 2010 - 7:29 PM The National Mediation Board later dismissed those charges. On June 29, 2011 AFA won one of the largest private sector union elections in decades, winning representation rights for the combined workforce of approximately 24,000 flight attendants at United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Continental Micronesia. That election was triggered by a National Mediation Board ruling that those airlines had formed a single transportation system as a result of a corporate merger. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers filed objections to the election. Those objections are pending before the National Mediation Board. Negotiations for a single, combined collective bargaining agreement were ongoing as of June 1, 2014. On October 25, 2011 flight attendants at Omni Air International voted by a wide margin to elect AFA as their union. With a workforce of approximately 500 flight attendants operating international charter flights, Omni is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On July 17, 2012 AFA won a representation election for a combined bargaining unit of approximately Endeavor Air 1,500 flight attendants that resulted from the merger of Pinnacle Airlines, Colgan Air and Mesaba Airlines. CHAOS AFA-CWA members threaten CHAOS at Northwest Airlines August 15, 2006 at San Francisco International Airport CHAOS is AFA's trademarked strategy of intermittent strikes designed to maximize the impact of an industrial action while minimizing the risk for striking flight attendants. In May 1993, AFA members at Seattle-based Alaska Airlines were facing a 30-day cooling-off period after more than three years of negotiations.Borer p. 567. In June, 1993, the cooling-off period mandated by the Railway Labor Act had expired. The first CHAOS strike took place in Seattle when three flight attendants walked off an Alaska Airlines flight just before passenger boarding. A month later, another crew of flight attendants struck the last flight out of Las Vegas. A few weeks later, AFA struck five flights simultaneously in the San Francisco area. America West,America West Strike Looms, CNN, web posted March 19, 1999. AirTran and US Airways all settled with AFA on the eve of, or a few minutes after, the end of a 30-day cooling-off period in the 1990s. AFA flight attendants at Midwest Express (now Midwest Airlines), completed a cooling-off period without reaching agreement on a first contract in 2002.

United Airlines flight attendants used the threat of CHAOS to leverage their negotiations during the airline's bankruptcy, succeeding in doubling the value of the replacement retirement plan management had proposed. Flight attendants at Northwest Airlines, locked in a round of bankruptcy negotiations, deployed a CHAOS campaign days after joining AFA in July, 2006. Union negotiators concluded a new tentative agreement with millions of dollars in improvements, but which was voted down by a narrow margin. AFA continued preparations for CHAOS strikes at Northwest pending the outcome of negotiations and litigation surrounding the case. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the union, denying the strike injunction sought by management. On appeal, the federal district court and the court of appeals ruled that workers under the Railway Labor Act cannot strike in response to rejection of a collective bargaining agreement in bankruptcy. Northwest and AFA returned to negotiations and reached a new tentative agreement, which was narrowly ratified by the flight attendants on May 29, 2007. The flight attendants became the last major work group at Northwest to agree to new contract terms in bankruptcy. The new contract provided Northwest with $195 million in annual cuts through 2011, and secured a $182 million equity claim for the flight attendants before it was lost upon the company's exit from bankruptcy.

Its population is around 4,000.  Location and landscape  Tisovec is situated in the valley of the river Rimava, at the foots of the Mur√°nska planina plateau. The landscape there gives the impression of a small town in the mountains. Some other towns close to it are Brezno, Hn√∫≈°≈•a and Rev√∫ca.  History  The first settlement in the area dates all the way to the Bronze Age. The first written evidence of the town comes from the year 1334 during the reign of King Charles I of Hungary as Tizolc. The name \\"Tisovec\\" comes from the yew tree (in Hungarian \\"tiszafa\\", in Slovak \\"tis\\"), which can be found in the hills around the town. Tisovec received its charter as a town at the end of the 15th century. The development of the town was halted by raids of the Ottoman Turks in the 16th and 17th centuries. The town's renaissance came in 1780, when Maria Theresia renewed its market privileges.  Demographics  According to the 2001 census, the town had 4,215 inhabitants. 95.75% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.87% Roma, 0.78% Czechs and 0.43% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 34.59% people with no religious affiliation, 32.91% Lutherans and 29.54% Roman Catholics.  Economy  Nowadays, there are two major employers in the town. The Calmit company owns the local mine and produces lime. History of the mine goes all the way back to 1870. CSM Tisovec is a machine building company with 530 employees and annual turnover of 0.5 billion Korunas. The company produces special extensions for trucks which enable them to work in severe conditions or build on the number of jobs that a particular truck can do. The company exports its products to several countries. A Paper mill and the clothing industry have had a history in the town as well, although they are dying out due to globalization. The town has touristic potential for its proximity to Mur√°nska planina mountain karst. Also, the mineral water spring is worth mentioning.  Education  Besides the Vladim√≠r Clementis Elementary School, there are two secondary education schools in Tisovec. An \\"industrial school\\" (technical college) founded in 1953 is able to board more students than it currently does. The Lutheran Gymnasium Tisovec, founded in 1992, The Lutheran Gymnasium is perceived to be among the better high schools in Slovakia.

The cause of the flash remains officially unknown, and some information about the event remains classified. While it has been suggested that the signal could have been caused by a meteoroid hitting the satellite, the previous 41 double flashes detected by the Vela satellites were caused by nuclear weapons tests. Today, most independent researchers believe that the 1979 flash was caused by a nuclear explosion ‚Äî perhaps an undeclared nuclear test carried out by South Africa and Israel.  Detection  Vela-5A/B satellites in a clean room. The two satellites are separated after launch. The \\"double flash\\" was detected on 22 September 1979, at 00:53 UTC, by the American Vela satellite OPS 6911 (also known as Vela 10 and Vela 5B), which carried various sensors designed to detect nuclear explosions that contravened the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In addition to being able to detect gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons, the satellite also contained two silicon solid-state bhangmeter sensors that could detect the dual light flashes associated with an atmospheric nuclear explosion: the initial brief, intense flash, followed by a second, longer flash. The satellite reported a double flash, which could be characteristic of an atmospheric nuclear explosion of two to three kilotons, in the Indian Ocean between the Crozet Islands (a sparsely inhabited French possession) and the Prince Edward Islands (which belong to South Africa) at . Acoustic data of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) established by the United States and NATO to detect Soviet submarines and the Missile Impact Locating System (MILS) designed to detect missile nose cone impact locations of test missiles in the Atlantic and Pacific test ranges were searched in an effort to gain more knowledge on the possibility of a nuclear detonation in the region. These data were found not to have enough substantial evidence of a detonation of a nuclear weapon; however a detailed, affirming study regarding MILS data correlating with time and location of the Vela flash was not considered in that finding. United States Air Force (USAF) surveillance aircraft flew 25 sorties over that area of the Indian Ocean from 22 September to 29 October 1979 to carry out atmospheric sampling. Studies of wind patterns confirmed that fall-out from an explosion in the southern Indian Ocean could have been carried from there to southwestern Australia. It was reported that low levels of iodine-131 (a short-half-life product of nuclear fission) were detected in sheep in the southeastern Australian States of Victoria and Tasmania soon after the event. Sheep in New Zealand showed no such trace. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico detected an anomalous ionospheric wave during the morning of 22 September 1979, which moved from the southeast to the northwest, an event that had not been observed previously. Bhangmeter light patterns detected by a pair of sensors on Vela satellite 6911 on 22 September 1979. After the event was made public, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) clarified that it was either a bomb blast or a combination of natural phenomena, such as lightning, a meteor, or a glint from the Sun. The initial assessment by the United States National Security Council (NSC), with technical support by the Naval Research Laboratory in October 1979 was that the American intelligence community had \\"high confidence\\" that the event was a low-yield nuclear explosion, although no radioactive debris had been detected, and there were \\"no corroborating seismic or hydro-acoustic data\\". A later NSC report revised this position to \\"inconclusive\\" about whether a nuclear test had occurred. That same report concluded that if a nuclear test had been carried out, responsibility should be ascribed to the Republic of South Africa.  Office of Science and Technology evaluation  The Carter Administration asked the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to convene a panel of instrumentation experts to re-examine the Vela Hotel 6911 data, and to attempt to determine whether the optical flash detected came from a nuclear test. The outcome was important to Carter, as his presidency and 1980 re-election campaign prominently featured the themes of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. The SALT II treaty had been signed three months earlier, and was pending ratification by the United States Senate, and Israel and Egypt had signed the Camp David Accords six months earlier. An independent panel of scientific and engineering experts was commissioned by Frank Press, who was the Science Advisor to president Carter and the chairman of the OSTP, to evaluate the evidence and determine the likelihood that the event was a nuclear detonation. The chairman of this science panel itself was Dr. Jack Ruina of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and also the former director of the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency. Reporting in the summer of 1980, the panel noted that there were some key differences in the detected optical signature from that of an actual nuclear explosion, particularly in the ratio of intensities measured by the two detectors on the satellite. The now-declassified report contains details of the measurements made by the Vela Hotel satellite. The explosion was picked up by a pair of sensors on only one of the several Vela satellites; other similar satellites were looking at different parts of the Earth, or weather conditions precluded them seeing the same event. The Vela satellites had previously detected 41 atmospheric tests‚Äîby countries such as France and the People's Republic of China‚Äîeach of which was subsequently confirmed by other means, including testing for radioactive fallout. The absence of any such corroboration of a nuclear origin for the Vela incident also suggested that the \\"double flash\\" signal was a spurious \\"zoo\\" signal of unknown origin, possibly caused by the impact of a micrometeoroid. Such \\"zoo\\" signals which mimicked nuclear explosions had been received several times earlier. Their report noted that the flash data contained \\"many of the features of signals from previously observed nuclear explosions\\", but that \\"careful examination reveals a significant deviation in the light signature of the 22 September event that throws doubt on the interpretation as a nuclear event\\". The best analysis that they could offer of the data suggested that, if the sensors were properly calibrated, any source of the \\"light flashes\\" were spurious \\"zoo events\\". Thus their final determination was that while they could not rule out that this signal was of nuclear origin, \\"based on our experience in related scientific assessments, it is our collective judgment that the September 22 signal was probably not from a nuclear explosion\\". The Ruina panel did not seriously consider a detailed study done by the Naval Research Laboratory concluding that the strong signals detected by three Ascension Island MILS hydrophones supported a near surface nuclear blast that could be associated with the observed double flash. The study used French testing in the Pacific as models and placed the site in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands. Victor Gilinsky (former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) argued that the science panel's findings were politically motivated. Some data seemed to confirm that a nuclear explosion was the source for the \\"double flash\\" signal. An \\"anomalous\\" traveling ionospheric disturbance was measured at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico at the same time, but many thousands of miles away in a different hemisphere of the Earth. A test in Western Australia conducted a few months later found some increased nuclear radiation levels. A detailed study done by New Zealand's National Radiation Laboratory found no evidence of excess radioactivity, and neither did a U.S. Government-funded nuclear laboratory. Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists who worked on the Vela Hotel program have professed their conviction that the Vela Hotel satellite's detectors worked properly. Leonard Weiss, at the time Staff Director of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Nuclear Proliferation, has also raised concerns about the findings of the Ad-Hoc Panel, arguing that it was set up by the Carter administration to counter embarrassing and growing opinion that it was an Israeli nuclear test. Specific intelligence about the Israeli nuclear program was not shared with the panel whose report therefore produced the plausible deniability that the administration sought.  Possible responsible parties  If a nuclear explosion did occur, it occurred within the 3,000-mile-wide (4,800 km diameter) circle covering parts of the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic, the southern tip of Africa, and a small part of Antarctica.  Israel  Well before the Vela incident, American intelligence agencies had made the assessment that Israel probably possessed its own nuclear weapons. According to journalist Seymour Hersh, the detection was the third joint Israeli-South African nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, and the Israelis had sent two IDF ships and \\"a contingent of Israeli military men and nuclear experts\\" for the test. Author Richard Rhodes also concludes the incident was an Israeli nuclear test, conducted in cooperation with South Africa, and that the United States administration deliberately obscured this fact in order to avoid complicating relations with South Africa and Israel. Likewise, Leonard Weiss offers a number of arguments to support the test being Israeli, and claims that successive U.S. administrations continue to cover up the test to divert unwanted attention that may portray its foreign policy in a bad light. Similarly, Professor Avner Cohen concluded that in hindsight, the existence of a cover-up by the United States is unambiguous because there were ‚Äúat least three independent scientific pieces of evidence unrelated to a satellite that confirm the existence of the explosion.‚ÄùHaaretz, 22 Sept. 2019 \\"U.S. Covered Up an Israeli Nuclear Test in 1979, Foreign Policy Says\\" Foreign Policy, 22 Sept. 2019, \\"Blast From the Past Forty years ago, a U.S. satellite detected the telltale signs of a nuclear explosion. An analysis of the evidence today points to a clandestine nuclear test, a Carter administration cover-up, and only one country that was willing and able to carry it out: Israel. \\" In the 2008 book The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation, Thomas C. Reed and Danny B. Stillman stated their opinion that the \\"double flash\\" was the result of a joint South African‚ÄìIsraeli nuclear bomb test. David Albright stated in his article about the \\"double flash\\" event in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that \\"If the 1979 flash was caused by a test, most experts agree it was probably an Israeli test\\". In 2010, it was reported that, on 27 February 1980, President Jimmy Carter wrote in his diary, \\"We have a growing belief among our scientists that the Israelis did indeed conduct a nuclear test explosion in the ocean near the southern end of Africa.\\"Jimmy Carter, White House Diary (Norton and Co., 2010), p. 405. Leonard Weiss, of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University writes: \\"The weight of the evidence that the Vela event was an Israeli nuclear test assisted by South Africa appears overwhelming.\\" Reed has written that he believes the Vela incident was an Israeli neutron bomb test. The test would have gone undetected as the Israelis specifically chose a window of opportunity when, according to the published data, no active Vela satellites were observing the area. Although the decade- old Vela satellite that detected the blast was officially listed as \\"retired\\" by the U.S. government, it was still able to receive data. Additionally, the Israelis chose to set off the test during a typhoon. By 1984, according to Mordechai Vanunu, Israel was mass-producing neutron bombs.  South Africa  The Republic of South Africa did have a nuclear weapons program at the time, and it falls within that geographic location. Nevertheless, it had acceded to the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, and since the end of apartheid, South Africa has disclosed most of the information on its nuclear weapons programme. According to international inspections and the ensuing International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb until November 1979, two months after the \\"double flash\\" incident. Furthermore, the IAEA reported that all possible South African nuclear bombs had been accounted for. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report dated 21 January 1980, that was produced for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, concluded that: The United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 of 4 November 1977 introduced a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa, which also required all states to refrain from \\"any co-operation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of nuclear weapons\\". Sasha Polakow-Suransky writes that, in 1979, South Africa was not yet advanced enough to test a nuclear device: \\"By the first week of October, the State Department had realized that South Africa was probably not the guilty party; Israel was a more likely candidate.\\"The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa, by Sasha Polakow- Suransky, (Vintage 2011), p. 138  Soviet Union  In 1979, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that the test might have been a Soviet test done in violation of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (PTBT). Twenty years earlier in 1959, the USSR had conducted secret underwater tests in the Pacific in violation of the 1958 bilateral moratorium between the Soviet Union and the U.S. (cf. List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union)Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, January 1985, p. 33Vitaly Yosifovich Goldansky, Essays of a Soviet Scientist, p. 195 before the 1958 moratorium was unilaterally and officially abrogated by the Soviet Union in 1961.  India  India had carried out a nuclear test in 1974 (codenamed Smiling Buddha). The possibility that India would test a weapon was considered, since it would be possible for the Indian Navy to operate in those waters so far south. This was dismissed as impractical and unnecessary as India had signed and ratified the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) in 1963, and had complied with it even in its first test, and that India was not hiding its nuclear weapons capability.  Pakistan  An interagency intelligence memorandum requested by the United States National Security Council and entitled \\"The 22 September 1979 Event\\" analyzed the possibility of Pakistan wanting to prove its nuclear explosive technology in secret.  France  Since the \\"double flash\\", if one existed, could have occurred not very far to the west of the French-owned Kerguelen Islands, it was a possibility that France was testing a small neutron bomb or other small tactical nuclear bomb.  Subsequent developments  1981 Los Alamos report as cited. Since 1980, some small amounts of new information have emerged but most questions remain unanswered. A Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report from 1981 notes: In October 1984, a National Intelligence Estimate on the South African nuclear program noted: A shorter form of this wording was used in a subsequent National Intelligence Council memorandum of September 1985. In February 1994, Commodore Dieter Gerhardt, a convicted Soviet spy and the commander of South Africa's Simon's Town naval base at the time, talked about the incident upon his release from prison. He said: Gerhardt further stated that no South African naval vessels had been involved, and that he had no first-hand knowledge of a nuclear test. In 1993, then President F. W. de Klerk admitted that South Africa had indeed possessed six assembled nuclear weapons, with a seventh in production, but that they had been dismantled (before the first all-race elections of April 1994). There was no mention specifically of the Vela incident or of Israeli cooperation in South Africa's nuclear program. On 20 April 1997, the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz quoted the South African deputy foreign minister, Aziz Pahad, as supposedly confirming that the \\"double flash\\" from over the Indian Ocean was indeed from a South African nuclear test. Haaretz also cited past reports that Israel had purchased 550 tons of uranium from South Africa for its own nuclear plant in Dimona. In exchange, Israel allegedly supplied South Africa with nuclear weapons design information and nuclear materials to increase the power of nuclear warheads. Pahad's statement was confirmed by the United States embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, but Pahad's press secretary stated that Pahad had said only that \\"there was a strong rumor that a test had taken place, and that it should be investigated\\". In other words, he was merely repeating rumors that had been circulating for years. David Albright, commenting on the stir created by this press report, stated: In October 1999, a white paper that was published by the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee in opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty stated: More recent information In 2003, Stansfield Turner, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) during the Carter administration, stated that the Vela detection was of a \\"man-made phenomenon\\".Spying on the Bomb: American Nuclear Intelligence from Nazi Germany to Iran and North Korea Jeffrey T. Richelson, (W. W. Norton & Company, 2007), p. 314 In his 2006 book On the Brink, the retired CIA clandestine service officer Tyler Drumheller wrote of his 1983‚Äì1988 tour-of-duty in South Africa: In 2010, Jimmy Carter published his White House Diary. In the entry for 22 September 1979, he wrote \\"There was indication of a nuclear explosion in the region of South Africa‚Äîeither South Africa, Israel using a ship at sea, or nothing.\\" For 27 February 1980, he wrote \\"We have a growing belief among our scientists that the Israelis did indeed conduct a nuclear test explosion in the ocean near the southern end of Africa.\\" Some American information related to this incident has been declassified in the form of heavily redacted reports and memoranda following requests for records made under the US Freedom of Information Act; on 5 May 2006, many of these declassified documents were made available through the National Security Archive. A December 2016 report by William Burr and Avner Cohen of George Washington University's National Security Archive and Nuclear Proliferation International History Project noted that the debate over the South Atlantic flash has shifted over the last few years, on the side of a man-made weapon test. The National Security Archive briefing concluded: The newly released research and subsequent report was largely based upon recently declassified documents in files at the National Archives of Gerard C. Smith, a former Ambassador and special envoy on nuclear nonproliferation during Jimmy Carter's presidency. Smith had once said: \\"I was never able to break free from the thought that the event was a joint operation between Israel and South Africa.\\" The documents cited a June 1980 U.S. State Department report where DIA Vice Director Jack Varona had said the ensuing U.S. investigation was a \\"white wash, due to political considerations\\" based on \\"flimsy evidence\\". He added that the \\"weight of the evidence pointed towards a nuclear event\\" and cited hydroacoustic data analyzed by the Naval Research Laboratory. The data, he suggested, involved \\"signals ... unique to nuclear shots in a maritime environment\\" and emanating from the area of \\"shallow waters between Prince Edward and Marion Islands, south-east of South Africa\\". Avner Cohen stated that ‚ÄúNow, 40 years later, there is a scientific and historical consensus that it was a nuclear test and that it had to be Israeli.\\"Haaretz, 22 Sept. 2019 \\"U.S. Covered Up an Israeli Nuclear Test in 1979, Foreign Policy Says\\" In 2018, a new study made the case for the double flash being a nuclear test.

Location Precise parameters vary, but the most commonly used definition of the East Shore is that it stretches from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and the Staten Island Expressway, or some line slightly south of this, on the north, to the southern property lines of the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area (formerly known as Great Kills Park) and United Hebrew Cemetery on the south, and from the Lower New York Bay on the east to the western boundaries of ZIP Codes 10304, 10305 and 10306, on the west. Not only the term \\"East Shore,\\" but the very concept is often attributed to New York Telephone's East Shore Central Office (now officially known as the East Staten Island Central Office), which has served this part of the island since the 1920s (the northern boundary of this office's territory is situated, on average, about ¬æ mile south of the Staten Island Expressway, built in the early 1960s). Such Staten Island neighborhoods as Arrochar, South Beach, Grasmere, Dongan Hills, Grant City, Midland Beach, New Dorp, Oakwood, Old Town, Richmondtown, and Bay Terrace, along with part of Todt Hill, are usually reckoned as belonging to the East Shore, although all of Arrochar and most of South Beach and Grasmere do not qualify using the telephone company's criteria. Sometimes the communities of Rosebank, Shore Acres, and Fort Wadsworth are also described as East Shore neighborhoods. History Like all of Staten Island except for the North Shore, the East Shore was mostly farmland until residential home construction burgeoned after World War II. Many small, one-family homes sprung up on the East Shore in the 1950s, with the rate of new home construction accelerating rapidly after the Verrazzano- Narrows Bridge, which links Staten Island with Brooklyn, opened in November 1964. The opening of the bridge brought a wave of transplants from Brooklyn, especially from neighborhoods such as Flatbush, which many white (especially Italian-American) families sought to leave because African-Americans were relocating there from the Southern States. This factor has contributed to the East Shore becoming the most politically conservative locality on Staten Island, and for that matter, in all of New York City. Since the early 2000s the trend has been for white Americans of Eastern European ancestry to immigrate to the community. Today, thriving communities of Russians, Poles, and Albanians exist on the East Shore. The area is currently not only Italian- American and Irish-American, but Russian-American, Polish-American, and Albanian-American. There is also an emerging Chinese-American population, centered in Arrochar. Places of interest The commercial core of the East Shore can be found in New Dorp, at the region's geographic center, which is close to New Dorp Lane. Hylan Boulevard, a major commercial boulevard, connects all the East Shore neighborhoods with each other. Points of interest located on the East Shore include Historic Richmond Town, the nearby Tibetan Museum on Lighthouse Hill, Moravian Cemetery (where members of the Vanderbilt family are buried) and a significant portion of the Staten Island Greenbelt.

North Shore as seen from Bayonne Mural on Staten Island's North Shore The term North Shore is frequently applied to a series of neighborhoods within the New York City borough of Staten Island.  Boundaries  Generally, the North Shore is deemed to include the communities located within ZIP codes 10303, 10302 and 10310 in their entirety, along with all of the area covered by 10301 except Sunnyside, and those parts of 10304, 10305, 10314 that lie north of the Staten Island Expressway. This definition includes Mariners Harbor, Port Richmond, Westerleigh, Meiers Corners, Graniteville, Castleton Corners, West Brighton, New Brighton, St. George, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, Grymes Hill, Park Hill, Clifton, and Rosebank among the North Shore's neighborhoods. The Staten Island Expressway is considered by many to be a southern border. History The North Shore is Staten Island's oldest and most densely populated area. Archaeological evidence found along its waterfront tells us that the Leni Lenape (common people) Indian Tribe established a settlement there dating back to 2100 BC The first white European contact with Staten Island was recorded in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano. In 1609 Henry Hudson established Dutch trade in the area and named the island Staaten Eylandt after the Staten-Generaal, the Dutch parliament. Points of interest Important landmarks and points of interest located on the North Shore include the Staten Island Ferry, Staten Island Borough Hall, Alice Austen House, Fort Wadsworth, St. George Coast Guard Station, Sailors' Snug Harbor, The New York Chinese Scholar's Garden, Staten Island Yankees Stadium, Garibaldi Memorial, Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Staten Island Zoo, St. George Theatre, Staten Island Children's Museum, Silver Lake Park, Clove Lakes Park and its public golf course. Richmond Terrace, running from the Staten Island Ferry to the Goethals Bridge is the oldest established road in Staten Island. Originally an Indian footpath, it was later developed into a road by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War. Historic buildings such as the first YMCA c. 1869; Tompkins Department Store c. 1880; The DeGroot House c. 1810; the Captain Nevielle House c. 1750; and the Greek Revival buildings at Sailors' Snug Harbor still stand along the street today. Many historic events took place along the waterfront. New York Governor Thomas Dongan established his manor house along Richmond Terrace in 1661 in the area now known as Castleton. Frederick Douglass spoke at the Fountain Hotel; Anna Leonowens of \\"The King and I\\" fame, owned a school at the corner of Richmond Terrace and Tompkins Court; Cornelius \\"Commodore\\" Vanderbilt, railway tycoon and patriarch of the Vanderbilt family, was born in the area in 1797. In 1836, former Vice President Aaron Burr died in Port Richmond at the St. James Hotel, a prominent hotel which once stood on Richmond Terrace until it was demolished. Heading south past the ferry, the famed Alice Austen House and historic Fort Wadsworth still stand today. The North Shore is the most economically and ethnically diverse section of Staten Island. It offers single family homes as well as multi-family dwellings and it is best served by public transportation in that the Staten Island Rapid Transit and all local buses culminate at the ferry terminal. The North Shore is home to Staten Island Yankees Stadium as well as The New York Chinese Scholar's Garden.  Demographics  According to the most current U.S. Census data estimates, the population in the neighborhoods typically lumped together as the North Shore is almost evenly split among Whites (mostly Irish, Italians, Albanians, and Russians), African-Americans and Hispanics/ Latinos, which each group comprising slightly more than 30 per cent of the total. They are joined by recent immigrants from such countries as Sri Lanka, Trinidad, Liberia and the Philippines. Since the 1990s, the North Shore has seen a large influx of Mexican immigration, many from Michoac√°n, and centered on Port Richmond and Tompkinsville. Transportation Castleton Bus Depot The North Shore section of Staten Island is best served by public transportation. The Castleton Bus Depot at Castleton and Jewett Avenues is the main depot, and the Meredith Avenue Depot on the West Shore also holds buses for North Shore routes. The Staten Island Railway South Shore Branch has stops in Saint George, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Clifton. The North Shore was previously served by the North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway. The North Shore is also home to the Staten Island Ferry. Politics Politically, the area is registered majority Democrat. It boasts the distinction of electing the first African American as its representative when it voted Debi Rose (D) into the New York City Council in November 2009. Other elected officials serving the area include District Attorney Michael McMahon (D) Borough President James Oddo (R) New York State Senator Diane Savino (D) New York State Assemblyman Charles Fall (D). The Island is represented in Congress by Max Rose (D). The North Shore is served by Staten Island Community Board 1 The New York City Police Department patrols the North Shore area in two separate precincts, the 120th Precinct in the eastern half and the 121st in the western half. Economy The North Shore is New York City's busiest remaining working waterfront. Companies such as: Howland Hook Marine Terminal; Cadell Dry Dock; Atlantic Salt; Reynolds Launch; Flagg Container Terminal; Sandy Hook Pilots; Staten Island Ferry DOT Maintenance Facility; United States Coast Guard; Clean Harbors; May's shipyard; Moran', McAllister, Reinauer and K-Sea Towing serve the Kill Van Kull shoreline and the New York Harbor. The upland portion of the waterfront is dotted by quaint restaurants and local taverns that provide local entertainment. Gerardi's produce and the weekly Green Market provide local vendors the opportunity to sell their merchandise. Small businesses located within the Staten Island Ferry terminal provide low level employment opportunities. In the early and middle 20th century the North Shore was an important manufacturing district. Richmond University Medical Center and Staten Island University Hospital are Staten Island's largest employers - both of which service the North Shore. The former HomePort site, which is being developed by Iron State, will be home to shops, restaurants and entertainment facilities, providing employment opportunities for local residents. The St. George Theatre located at the top of Hyatt Street near Staten Island Borough Hall is the oldest theater on Staten Island. It has been recently restored and offers weekly live performances providing additional job opportunities for the area. Old-fashioned shopping districts exist along Forest Avenue, Bay Street, Victory Boulevard and Port Richmond Avenue.  Social issues  The district is also home to a disproportionate amount of the Island's medically uninsured, a number high enough to rank in the top third of New York City's 51 districts. However, compared to the rest of the city, the district is roughly average overall. The median household income for most of the zip codes is in the $50,000 - $60,000 range, compared to a citywide average of roughly $50,000, and the median per capital income is roughly $25,000, compared to a citywide average of roughly $30,000.http://www.clrsearch.com/Staten_Island_Demographics/NY/10301/?compare=10304 References Geography of Staten Island Neighborhoods in Staten Island ","title":"North Shore, Staten Island"},{"id":"1350315","title":"Dale Davis (basketball)"},{"id":"1350324","text":"Gromov () is a Russian male surname, its feminine counterpart is Gromova (–ì—Ä–æ–º–æ–≤–∞).

Robert stars in the fighting video game Art of Fighting as the lead character along his best friend Ryo Sakazaki. The game has both of them as practitioners of the Kyokugenryu Karate fighting who search for Ryo's younger sister, Yuri Sakazaki, who was kidnapped by a criminal named Mr. Big. He is additionally featured in most of The King of Fighters crossover games, in which starts into the King of Fighters tournament in teams composed of three members. Thus far, he has been a playable character in every edition of KOF except The King of Fighters XI; however, he has been added back in for the PlayStation 2 version of the game. Robert appeared in the film adaptation of Art of Fighting, and the manhua from The King of Fighters. He received mixed critics from video games publication, which praised his design, but some also noted him similar to the Street Fighter main characters. He has also been well received by gamers, appearing in several popularity polls developed by journals and websites. Creation and design Robert Garcia was based on the actors Steven Seagal and Andy Garcia. SNK staff members Youichiro Soeda said that Ryo and Robert's debut was unique to other games based on the company because it did not focus on fighting tournaments but instead of the duo's quest to save Yuri Sakazaki. Artist Shinkiro has expressed difficulties in designing Robert due how he does not understand how rich people behave. In contrast, he had no problem with Ryo. In the making of The King of Fighters Robert was made \\"the slimmest of them all\\" in comparison to his original design. His Osaka accent was given to fit Psycho Soldier Sie Kensou and give both of them the traits of comedians. Due to fears of Robert's outfit feeling dated, SNK revised him for The King of Fighters XIV to make him stand out more by giving a new redesign based on an unspecified American actor. In the first Art of Fighting Robert sports a black T-shirt with short sleeves, a brown vest and a gold medallion around the neck. He also wears white pants, white and black shoes and black gloves. He has the same outfit in the following Art of Fighting but without sleeves in his T-shirt. This costume is also featured in the first two King of Fighters as well as The King of Fighters XII and XIII. In the third Art of Fighting game, Robert is bare- chested under a light blue jacket and does not wear his medallion. He also sports white gloves and brown shoes, but keeps having his white pants. He has the same appearance from The King of Fighters '96 to The King of Fighters '98. From The King of Fighters '99 to The King of Fighters 2002, Robert wears a similar outfit to the one from the first two Art of Fighting games but with long sleeves and white gloves and shoes. His The King of Fighters 2003 outfit is similar to his Art of Fighting 3 clothes but with white sleeves. In NeoGeo Battle Coliseum and the PlayStation 2 version from The King of Fighters XI, Robert appears as an older version from himself wearing a similar outfit from Art of Fighting 3. The jacket is purple, his gloves are black and his shoes are brown. There is an Alternate Striker version of Robert in The King of Fighters 2000 called \\"Another Robert\\". This Robert wears a white male Kyokugen Karate gi with a blue shirt underneath. His clothing now parodies Ryo Sakazaki while his looks and playstyle parody Street Fighter Alpha's Dan Hibiki, right down to his Chouhatsu no Ken that parodies the Chouhatsu Densetsu. Appearances=In video games An older Robert as seen in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum and The King of Fighters XI In Art of Fighting, Yuri is kidnapped by the criminal Mr. Big. As such, both Ryo Sakazaki and Robert go to Southtown to interrogate fighters until finding Mr. Big. After defeating Mr. Big, Ryo and Robert face an assassin named an assassin purportedly held Yuri. Ryo nearly finishes him off, but Yuri sneaks in and tells Ryo not to kill him since Mr. Karate is their father, Takuma. The second Art of Fighting game features Robert, Ryo, Takuma and a now fighter Yuri entering into the first King of Fighters tournament held by Geese Howard, the main responsible for the kidnap. In Art of Fighting 3, Robert visits Central America to help Freya Lawrence, a childhood friend, save her brother Wyler, whose demonic power made him go berserk. In his ending, Robert stops Wyler and goes back to Italy. However, before entering into the plane, Yuri accompanies him. In The King of Fighters series, Takuma, Ryo, and Robert are part of the Art of Fighting Team, but in some games they form different allies. With the arrival of The King of Fighters '99 and its teams of four, Takuma returns to the Art of Fighting team. Though the Garcia Foundation no longer faced liquidation as it did in The King of Fighters 2001, it needed significant help to rebuild its prior fortunes, causing Robert to be absent in The King of Fighters XI. Nevertheless, he is present in the Art of Fighting Team where he fails to stage a date between Ryo and King. He appears in the spin-off The King of Fighters Kyo, in which he helps the main character Kyo Kusanagi into finding his girlfriend Yuki. Alongside an aged Ryo Sakazaki from Buriki One, an aged Robert appears in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum with moves largely from The King of Fighters 2000 and The King of Fighters 2003. In his ending, it is revealed that Robert wishes to stay away from his family business and still work as part of teaching the Kyokugen Ryu. He appears in this form as a hidden character in the PlayStation 2 version of The King of Fighters XI. He returns in The King of Fighters XII onwards as part of the Art of Fighting Team. In The King of Fighters game without storylines The King of Fighters 2002 and The King of Fighters Neowave the Art of Fighting Team remains as in '94, while in The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match, it appears with Yuri taking Takuma's place. Both of these latest games also feature an \\"EX\\" version of Robert with his moves from the Art of Fighting series as a playable character. He is also present in mobile phone games Metal Slug Defense,The King of Fighters '98 Unlimited Match Online and Kimi wa Hero. The dating sim Days of Memories also features him. Although he is not playable in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, Robert is often mentioned by other characters and makes a cameo in the endings from Takuma and Ryo. Another cameo of him is in Yuri's ending from SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. He is also present in as well as the otome game King of Fighters for Girls. In other media Besides the games from SNK, Robert also appears in the Art of Fighting anime film from 1993. The plot from film is loosely based on the first Art of Fighting game, with Robert and Ryo searching for Yuri, who has been kidnapped by Mr. Big. However, in the film Mr. Big wants to obtain a diamond held by Ryo and Robert He is voiced by Masanori Ikeda in the Japanese version of film, and by Nick Sullivan in the English adaptation. Two manga based on the Art of Fighting games also follow Robert's role in the games. Robert is featured in the manhua adaptations from The King of Fighters series, which tell how he participates in the fighting tournaments. Reception Robert has been well received by gamers and has appeared in popularity polls from journals and websites. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Robert was voted as the staff's 46th favorite character. He shared the spot with seven other characters, including Samurai Shodown character, Hattori Hanzo, and Darkstalkers character, Demitri Maximoff. In the January 30, 1995 issue of Gamest magazine in Japan, Robert ranked at No. 36 (tied with Iceman from X-Men: Children of the Atom) in list of Top 50 Characters of 1994. Videogame publications have commented on Robert's character, adding praise and criticism. Xataka felt that Robert and Ryo shared one of the most unique stories in fighting games as the first Art of Fighting featured them in a quest to save Yuri rather than participating in a fighting game. The same site noted that Robert's origins remained as a mystery to the fanbase; Upon his introduction to The King of Fighter '94 as a member of Team Mexico, the fans believed Robert to be Mexican. However, SNK would later reveal he was Italian stopping this speculation. Mexican company Evoga originally thought Robert was Mexican due to the team being called Mexico in The King of Fighters '94 yet Art of Fighting 3 revealed he was Italian much to their comical response. David Simpson from AceGamez noted Robert to be very similar to the Street Fighter main characters due to his practice in karate and his relation with Ryo Sakazaki as both are best friends and rivals. Videogamer.com writer Wesley Yin-Poole labeled Robert and Ryo as \\"two double-hard bastards\\" and commented they had the best designs from the Art of Fighting series in comparison to the other characters who had \\"wicked\\" appearances. Spanner Spencer from Eurogamer added that Robert had the best appearance from all the characters of the Art of Fighting series but labelled him as a \\"greasy yuppie\\". Juan E. Hernandez from IGN also compared both Robert and Ryo to Street Fighter as well Dragon Ball characters based on their type of techniques. Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely criticized Robert's redesign in The King of Fighters '99 as his movesets' input were highly changed, something that might bother his players. In a review from The King of Fighters XI, Eurogamer writer Luke Albiger noted Robert's addition to the game as hidden character is a good way to compensate the several recurring who were absent. However, Kurt Kalata from Armchairempire.com criticized that unlocking Robert in that game was \\"a pain\\" due to the difficult challenges the players has to do to unlock him. Greg Kasavin from GameSpot listed his \\"Haohshokohken\\" move from Art of Fighting as one of the most influential fireball moves in fighting games' history. Den of Geek listed him as the 54th with the site comparing him to Street Fighter character Ken Masters based on their similar personalities but found that he did have notable actions in SNK's games outside the third Art of Fighting game which the writer felt few fans cared. Despite criticizing the graphics of The King of Fighters XIV, Juan Garcia from IGN praised the redesigns of both Robert and Kyo Kusanagi. Den of Geek also liked the new design of Robert, comparing him comic book hero Tony Stark. Robert has also been described as praised \\"lavish style is sure to attract many players\\". Niche Gamer noted that while Robert performs the same fighting style as Yuri and Ryo, each present their own variety of Kyokugen Ryu. Den of Geek noted that the trio and the team in general has been characterized as more comical characters in The King of Fighters than in Art of Fighting though in XI they accidentally created their own rival. Outside the video games, Robert has been analyzed by his role in the Art of Fighting original video animation. Akemi's Anime World found the character a poser and found his lack of danger the special \\"cheesy\\". AnimeOnDVD.com enjoyed the contrast between Ryo and Robert as both \\"are like night and day in some respects.\\" The character of Dan Hibiki from the Street Fighter Alpha series is deemed as a parody of Ryo due to his similarities with Ryu and Ken. However, his design is more similar to Robert's to the point that in SVC Chaos, characters often confuse Dan with Robert.

Under the definition most commonly adhered to, Mid-Island comprises all of the communities whose ZIP Code is 10314, plus Sunnyside within zip code 10301, along with the western slope of Todt Hill. Mid-Island communities thus include Graniteville, Bulls Head, Willowbrook, and New Springville, Sometimes the localities situated along the Arthur Kill between the Staten Island Expressway and the Fresh Kills -- Bloomfield, Chelsea and Travis -- are said to be on the island's West Shore; otherwise they too would fall within Mid-Island as their zip code is 10314. Like all of Staten Island except for the North Shore, farms dominated the Mid-Island region until the 1960s, when new home construction began to rise sharply. The opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 did much to stimulate this construction, but the effects of this phenomenon were first seen most profoundly on the East Shore, not spreading inland until nearly the end of the decade. In addition to starting somewhat later, the population boom experienced in Mid-Island also exhibited some important demographic differences from that which took place to the east, as in Mid-Island Jewish transplants (from Queens as well as Brooklyn) tended to predominate, in contrast to the heavily Italian-American influx experienced on the East Shore. These demographic differences are not present today with mostly Italian- Americans dominating the area. The zip code 10314, which covers much of the Mid-Island area has the largest percentage of Asians of any zip code on Staten Island, at 13.3% Non-hispanic Asian.http://www.zip-codes.com/zip- code/10303/zip-code-10303-2010-census.asp The Mid-Island region's character was transformed dramatically in 1973, when the Staten Island Mall opened in New Springville, on a site that was originally used as an airport. This led to the Richmond Avenue corridor, from New Springville to Graniteville, becoming the island's liveliest commercial strip, spawning much traffic congestion in the area; even during midday hours on weekdays, traffic is typically moderate to heavy along Richmond Avenue and Victory Boulevard, which intersects Richmond Avenue in Bulls Head. Besides the Staten Island Mall, other prominent landmarks found within Mid-Island include the former Willowbrook State School (now a campus of the City University of New York), St. Francis Seminary (on the property of which the highest point on Staten Island is located), and the former New York City Farm Colony adjacent to Sea View Hospital and Home, a city-run nursing home. Most of Mid-Island lies within the NYPD's 122nd Precinct, headquartered in the East Shore community of New Dorp, a considerable distance away; however, in 2005 the city approved plans to build a fourth police precinct on the island (which presently has three), with the new precinct's station house to be built at 974 Richmond Avenue, near Forest Avenue and the Baron Hirsh Cemetery.

The town has about 22,000 inhabitants (November 2007) and is twinned with Coventry. Volendam early 20th century. History Originally, Volendam was the location of the harbor of the nearby Edam, which was situated at the mouth of the IJ bay. In 1357, the inhabitants of Edam dug a shorter canal to the Zuiderzee with its own separate harbor. This removed the need for the original harbor, which was then dammed and used for land reclamation. Farmers and local fishermen settled there, forming the new community of Vollendam, which literally meant something like 'Filled dam'. In the early part of the 20th century it became something of an artists' retreat, with both Picasso and Renoir spending time here. The majority of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, which is deeply connected to the village culture. Historically, many missionaries and bishops grew up in Volendam. Today there is the chapel of Our Lady of the Water, which is located in a village park. Caf√© fire In the New Year's night of 2000 to 2001, the lighting of a bundle of sparklers caused a short but intense fire at a party in caf√© De Hemel. The sparklers ignited the dry Christmas decorations on the ceiling, which fell down in their entirety. 14 people died and 200 people were seriously injured.

Tourism Many tourists visit Volendam on tour boats Volendam Volendam is a popular tourist attraction in the Netherlands, well known for its old fishing boats and the traditional clothing still worn by some residents. The women's costume of Volendam, with its high, pointed bonnet, is one of the most recognizable of the Dutch traditional costumes, and is often featured on tourist postcards and posters (although there are believed to be fewer than 50 women now wearing the costume as part of their daily lives, most of them elderly). There is a regular ferry connection to Marken, a peninsula close by. Volendam also features a small museum about its history and clothing style, and visitors can have their pictures taken in traditional Dutch costumes. A residential area in Volendam Film Volendam was a shooting location in Vikas Bahl's 2014 Bollywood film, Queen. The actors established an Indian food shop called Rani's Gol Gappa. The owner was an Italian, Marco Canadea, as Marcello. Working with Marco was Mish Boyko as Oleksander (Sikander), Jeffrey Ho as Taka, and Joseph Guitobh as Tim. The role of Queen was played by Indian actress Kangana Ranaut. Football FC Volendam is a football (soccer in the US) club based in Volendam, which has regularly played in the Dutch Eredivisie (though they are currently in the Eerste Divisie). Music Volendam is also well known for its distinctive music, which is called Palingsound (literally \\"eel sound\\") in reference to Volendam's status as fishing village. During the 1960s, the local group The Cats was a very popular group in the Netherlands and abroad. Another band from Volendam was BZN, which became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

She is best known for having lived in a -tall, roughly 1500-year-old California redwood tree for 738 days between December 10, 1997 and December 18, 1999. Hill lived in the tree, affectionately known as Luna, to prevent Pacific Lumber Company loggers from cutting it down. She is the author of the 2000 book The Legacy of Luna and co-author of One Makes the Difference. Early life Hill's father was a traveling minister who went from town to town, bringing his family with him. Until she was about ten years old, Hill lived in a camper with her father Dale, mother Kathy, and brothers Mike and Dan. Julia is the middle child. While traveling with her family, Hill often explored rivers by campgrounds. When Hill was seven years old, she and her family were taking a hike one day when a butterfly landed on her finger and stayed with her for the duration of the hike. From that day on, her nickname became \\"Butterfly\\". She decided to use that as her nickname for the rest of her life. When Hill was in middle school, her family stopped traveling and settled in Jonesboro, Arkansas. In August 1996, at age 22, Hill suffered a near-fatal car crash. At the time, Hill was acting as the designated driver for a friend who had been drinking. Her friend's car was hit from behind by a drunk driver. The steering wheel of the car penetrated Hill's skull. It took almost a year of intensive therapy before she regained the ability to speak and walk normally. She said: Hill embarked on a spiritual quest afterwards, leading her to the environmental cause opposed to the destruction of the redwood forests in Humboldt County, California. Tree sit After recuperating from her accident, Hill took a road trip to California and attended a reggae fundraiser to save the forests. A group of \\"front-liners\\" had been rotating tree sitters in and out of giant redwoods in Humboldt County every couple days to stave off Pacific Lumber Co. loggers who were clear-cutting. Organizers wanted someone to stay in the tree one week. \\"Nobody else would volunteer so they had to pick me\\", said Hill. Originally, Hill was not officially affiliated with any environmental organization, deciding by herself to undertake civil disobedience. Soon, Hill was actively supported by Earth First!, among other organizations, and by volunteers. On December 10, 1997, Hill ascended the redwood tree Luna to a height of . Hill lived on two platforms for 738 days. Luna's trunk was her sidewalk and exercise treadmill. Hill learned many survival skills while living in Luna, such as \\"seldom washing the soles of her feet, because the sap helped her feet stick to the branches better.\\" Hill used solar-powered cell phones for radio interviews, became an \\"in-tree\\" correspondent for a cable television show, and hosted TV crews to protest old- growth clear cutting. With ropes, Hill hoisted up survival supplies brought by an eight-member support crew. To keep warm, Hill wrapped herself tight in a sleeping bag, leaving only a small hole for breathing. For meals, Hill used a single-burner propane stove. Throughout her ordeal, Hill weathered freezing rains and winds from El Ni√±o, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and attempted intimidation by angry loggers. A resolution was reached in 1999 when the Pacific Lumber Company agreed to preserve Luna and all trees within a buffer zone. In exchange, Hill agreed to vacate the tree. In addition, the $50,000 that Hill and other activists raised during the cause was given to the logging company, as stipulated by the resolution. The $50,000 Earth First! paid to Pacific Lumber was then donated to Humboldt State University as part of the agreement for research into sustainable forestry. Vandals later cut the tree with a chainsaw. A gash in the -tall redwood was discovered in November 2000 by one of Hill's supporters. Observers at the scene said the cut measured deep and around the base, somewhat less than half the circumference of the tree. The gash was treated with a herbal remedy, and the tree was stabilized with steel cables. As of spring 2007, the tree was doing well with new growth each year. Caretakers routinely climb the tree to check its condition and to maintain the steel guywires.How is Luna Today ? Luna's Status currently by \\"Sanctuary Forest Post-tree sit Hill speaks at the Harmony Festival in 2009. Since her tree sit, Hill has become a motivational speaker (holding some 250 events a year), a best-selling author, and the co-founder of the Circle of Life Foundation (which helped organize We The Planet, an eco-friendly music tour) and the Engage Network, a nonprofit that trains small groups of civic leaders to work toward social change. Ecuador oil pipeline protest On July 16, 2002, Hill was jailed in Quito, Ecuador, outside the offices of Occidental Petroleum, for protesting a proposed oil pipeline that would penetrate a virgin Andean cloud forest that teems with rare birds. \\"The cloud forest is stunning,\\" said Hill. \\"It's this deep, lush green, spangled with explosions of red, yellow and purple from the flowers, birds and insects. But the environmental destruction we saw along the pipelines that had already been built was horrendous.\\" Ecuadorian President Gustavo Noboa commented: \\"The little gringos have been arrested, including the old cockatoo who climbs trees.\\" Hill was later deported from Ecuador. Tax redirection In 2003, Hill became a proponent of tax redirection, resisting payment of about $150,000 in federal taxes, donating that money to after-school programs, arts and cultural programs, community gardens, programs for Native Americans, alternatives to incarceration, and environmental protection programs. She said: Farm sale protest In 2006, Hill protested the sale of the South Central Farm in an attempt to save the farm from developers. Looking forward In an April 2009 interview, Hill pondered what would come next for her: Popular culture Hill has been the subject of several documentaries, interviews, and books, including her own 2000 memoir The Legacy of Luna, and has influenced numerous musicians. On December 10, 1998, a benefit concert was played at the Mateel Community Center in Redway, California, during Julia's \\"tree sit\\". Artists performing were Bob Weir and Mark Karan as an acoustic duet, the Steve Kimock Band, and the Mickey Hart Band. Hill took part in the event, reading her poem \\"Luna\\" via telephone while the Mickey Hart Band was performing \\"The Dancing Sorcerer\\". The character Sierra Tierwater in the 2000 novel A Friend of the Earth by T. Coraghessan Boyle was partially inspired by Hill. Hill was the subject of the documentary Butterfly (2000) broadcast on PBS POV. She is also featured in the documentary film Tree-Sit: The Art of Resistance. Both films document her time in the redwood tree. The 2000 twelfth-season episode of The Simpsons called \\"Lisa the Tree Hugger\\" was conceived when writer Matt Selman heard a news story about Hill. In Penn & Teller's 2003 first season of their documentary television show, Bullshit, Hill appeared as a Special Guest Expert on the episode \\"Environmental Hysteria\\". A film adaptation of The Legacy of Luna, to be directed by Laurie Collyer and star Rachel Weisz, became stuck in development hell, although Weisz actively worked towards getting the project off the ground. The main character of the 2017 Swedish children's book Julia r√§ddar skogen (Julia saves the forest) by Niklas Hill and Anna Palmqvist is named after Hill. The book is about a child who occupies a tree in order to hinder the construction of a new highway. The character Olivia Vandergriff in Richard Powers‚Äô 2018 novel, The Overstory, is loosely based on Hill. Music * Trey Anastasio and Tom Marshall wrote a song called \\"Kissed by Mist\\" about Hill. * In 2002 Los Suaves made a song in honor of Hill called \\"Julia Hill\\" on the Un paso atr√°s album in which the singer is \\"Luna\\". * The Red Hot Chili Peppers 2003 song \\"Can't Stop\\" contains the line \\"J. Butterfly is in the treetop\\". * Neil Young made a reference to Hill in the 2003 song \\"Sun Green\\" on the Greendale album in which the title character: \\"Still wants to meet Julia Butterfly\\". * Casey Desmond wrote a song called \\"Julia Butterfly Hill\\" which appeared on her 2006 album No Disguise. * In 2009, Idina Menzel wrote a song entitled \\"Butterfly\\" referring to Hill's concern for the environment.

Landmark judgements At least three landmark judgments given by Anand as the Judge of the Supreme Court have revealed his commitment to human rights and justice. # In the Nilabeti Behera case (1993), which he heard jointly with J.S. Verma, (later CJI) his separate judgment on the right of compensation in the cases of custodial deaths is hailed as a significant contribution to the protection of human rights. Anand held that public bodies and officials are expected to perform public duties properly and refrain from unlawful actions that are likely to violate individual rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. # In the D.K. Basu case (1996), he laid down important safeguards against custodial torture. These safeguards are considered valuable in protecting the rights of prisoners. # Anand's commitment to judicial discipline is also highlighted in his judgment in the V.C. Mishra case. The Supreme Court first sentenced the Chairman of the Bar Council of India, V.C. Mishra, for contempt of court and suspended him from practising. Later, a Bench headed by Anand ruled that the Supreme Court did not have the power to debar any advocate from practising even if it held him guilty of contempt. Corruption allegations Anand had a controversial tenure as Chief Justice of India. Activists have made four serious charges of corruption and abuse of office against Anand. No probe, however, was conducted on any of the allegations.

The arena was built by controversial UND alumnus Ralph Engelstad. The North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's hockey team is the tenant. The arena formerly hosted the defunct North Dakota women's hockey team. Facility Ralph Engelstad Arena, which seats 11,643, opened on October 5, 2001 and is located on the UND campus. The REA is home to the UND men's ice hockey team (UND women's ice hockey team discontinued after 2016‚Äì17 season), and hosts select games for UND men's and women's basketball. The arena also hosts many non-athletic events including concerts and a yearly circus. Called the \\"Taj Mahal of hockey,\\" the $104 million arena was built with materials that would not usually be found in such a facility. For instance, the concourses of the REA are covered in granite flooring, each spectator seat is made of Cherry wood and leather upholstery, escalators bring spectators between levels, and full-color LCD displays dot the arena. The REA has been called one of the finest facilities of its kind in the world. Former NHL hockey player Wayne Gretzky has called the structure \\"one of the most beautiful buildings we have in North America.\\" The REA complex has evolved to include more than just the main arena. A second Olympic-sized sheet of ice sits adjacent to the main arena. An addition to the main arena, The Betty Engelstad Sioux Center (or simply The Betty) was completed in 2004 and is now the home of UND's basketball and volleyball teams. Although located on the campus of the University of North Dakota the arena and land itself is owned by The Engelstad Family Foundation and rented conditionally to UND each year for $1. This setup was created to give the Engelstad family control and final say regarding the facility. In 2015 the Ralph Engelstad Arena received a certificate of excellence from Trip Advisor for being one of the top rated destinations in America. In 2019 the REA announced they would install a new $6 million scoreboard. It was unveiled June 26, 2019 and is considered one the best scoreboards in the country. Numerous other upgrades were completed including a new LED ribbon display wrapping around the entire arena. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Ralph is being considered by the NHL to potentially host playoff games due to North Dakota low population density and the high quality of the REA.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885229-nhl-reportedly-considering- north-dakota-among-options-to-resume-season Controversy Midway during construction, Ralph Engelstad threatened to withdraw his funding if UND's Fighting Sioux sports teams were renamed in deference to political pressures. In an effort to make the prospect of removal a prohibitively costly measure, the Fighting Sioux logo was strategically placed in thousands of instances in the arena, including a large granite logo in the main concourse. After the NCAA barred several universities that use Native American imagery from hosting post-season tournaments or wearing such imagery in post-season play, UND sued the NCAA. A preliminary injunction was granted that would have allowed the Fighting Sioux to both host post-season events and wear their regular uniforms while the lawsuit was in progress. The legal papers filed in support of UND pointed out that the Florida State Seminoles have not been required to change their name, thus raising the possibility that the decision regarding the UND Fighting Sioux was arbitrary and capricious. In addition, the legal papers noted that UND has a Native American Studies program, has Native Americans on its faculty, and has a significant Native American student population. The lawsuit with the NCAA was settled under the condition that UND had three years to gain tribal support from both Sioux nations in North Dakota, or retire the Sioux name and logo. After the three years expired, permission was obtained from only one of the two Sioux tribes. The North Dakota Legislative Assembly passed a law requiring the University to retain the name in June 2011, but then repealed the law in November 2011. A statewide vote was held in June 2012, and the citizens of North Dakota voted to discontinue the Sioux name, and on October 22, 2012 crews removed signage that declared \\"Home of the Fighting Sioux\\" from the face of the building. The 2012 vote also banned UND from choosing a new name for three years. After the nickname ban expired in 2015, the university held two rounds of online fan voting from a suggested list of nicknames; the final selection of Fighting Hawks was adopted in November of that year. Notable events Sign in front of Ralph Englestad Arena The REA's inaugural hockey game was on October 5, 2001 and featured the Fighting Sioux men's team against the WCHA rival Minnesota Golden Gophers in the US Hockey Hall of Fame Game, in which Minnesota defeated North Dakota, 7‚Äì5. The REA hosted the West Regional in the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament, with North Dakota playing in its home building. The REA has hosted a number of non-NCAA ice hockey events, notably the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with over 195,000 tickets sold and the 2005 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship. The Minnesota Wild have played several exhibition games at the arena as well.

Arulanandham, Cristian S. Calude and Michael J. Dinneen in 2002, and published in The Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Both digital and analog hardware implementations of bead sort can achieve a sorting time of O(n); however, the implementation of this algorithm tends to be significantly slower in software and can only be used to sort lists of positive integers. Also, it would seem that even in the best case, the algorithm requires O(n2) space. Algorithm overview Step 1: Suspended beads on vertical poles. Step 2: The beads have been allowed to fall. The bead sort operation can be compared to the manner in which beads slide on parallel poles, such as on an abacus. However, each pole may have a distinct number of beads. Initially, it may be helpful to imagine the beads suspended on vertical poles. In Step 1, such an arrangement is displayed using n=5 rows of beads on m=4 vertical poles. The numbers to the right of each row indicate the number that the row in question represents; rows 1 and 2 are representing the positive integer 3 (because they each contain three beads) while the top row represents the positive integer 2 (as it only contains two beads).By convention, a row representing the positive integer k should have beads on poles 1..k and poles k+1..m should be empty. This is not a strict requirement, but will most likely simplify implementation. If we then allow the beads to fall, the rows now represent the same integers in sorted order. Row 1 contains the largest number in the set, while row n contains the smallest. If the above-mentioned convention of rows containing a series of beads on poles 1..k and leaving poles k+1..m empty has been followed, it will continue to be the case here. The action of allowing the beads to \\"fall\\" in our physical example has allowed the larger values from the higher rows to propagate to the lower rows. If the value represented by row a is smaller than the value contained in row a+1, some of the beads from row a+1 will fall into row a; this is certain to happen, as row a does not contain beads in those positions to stop the beads from row a+1 from falling. The mechanism underlying bead sort is similar to that behind counting sort; the number of beads on each pole corresponds to the number of elements with value equal or greater than the index of that pole. Complexity Bead sort can be implemented with four general levels of complexity, among others: *O(1): The beads are all moved simultaneously in the same time unit, as would be the case with the simple physical example above. This is an abstract complexity, and cannot be implemented in practice. *O(\\\\sqrt{n}): In a realistic physical model that uses gravity, the time it takes to let the beads fall is proportional to the square root of the maximum height, which is proportional to n. *O(n): The beads are moved one row at a time. This is the case used in the analog and digital hardware solutions. *O(S), where S is the sum of the integers in the input set: Each bead is moved individually. This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to assist in finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software implementations. Like the Pigeonhole sort, bead sort is unusual in that in worst case it can perform faster than O(n log n), the fastest performance possible for a comparison sort in worst case. This is possible because the key for a bead sort is always a positive integer and bead sort exploits its structure.  Implementation  This implementation is written in Python; it is assumed that the will be a sequence of integers. The function returns a new list rather than mutating the one passed in, but it can be trivially modified to operate in place efficiently. def beadsort(input_list): \\"\\"\\"Bead sort.\\"\\"\\" return_list = [] # Initialize a 'transposed list' to contain as many elements as # the maximum value of the input -- in effect, taking the 'tallest' # column of input beads and laying it out flat transposed_list = [0] * max(input_list) for num in input_list: # For each element (each 'column of beads') of the input list, # 'lay the beads flat' by incrementing as many elements of the # transposed list as the column is tall. # These will accumulate atop previous additions. transposed_list[:num] = [n + 1 for n in transposed_list[:num # We've now dropped the beads.

Specifically, the GWEN network was intended to survive the effects of an electromagnetic pulse from a high-altitude nuclear explosion and ensure that the United States President or his survivors could issue a launch order to Strategic Air Command bombers by radio.Commission on Life Science: \\"Assessment of the Possible Health Effects of Ground Wave Emergency Network: Description of GWEN System\\", 1993Associated Press: \\"U.S. to Complete Emergency Radio Network\\", The New York Times, 12 September 1988Defense Technical Information Center: Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms AN/URC-117 was the system's Joint Electronics Type Designation System identifier, which signified various radio components installed in different locations.Designations Of U.S. Military Electronic And Communications Equipment Designation-Systems.Net Each GWEN Relay Node site featured a longwave transmitting tower, generally between tall, and emitting an RF output of between 2,000 and 3,000 watts. Of 240 planned GWEN towers, only 58 were built. In 1994, a defense appropriations bill banned the funding of new GWEN tower construction, and a few months later, the GWEN program was cancelled by the US Air Force. The United States Coast Guard later outfitted a number of former GWEN sites to house the Nationwide Differential GPS system. History GWEN was part of the Strategic Modernization Program designed to upgrade the nation's strategic communication system, thereby strengthening the value of nuclear deterrence. The GWEN communication system, established in the late 1980s, was designed to transmit critical Emergency Action Messages (EAM) to United States nuclear forces. EMP can produce a sudden power surge over a widespread area that could overload unprotected electronic equipment and render it inoperable. In addition, EMP could interfere with radio transmissions that use the ionosphere for propagation. It was thought that GWEN would use a ground-hugging wave for propagation and so be unaffected by the EMP. The network was conceived as an array of approximately 240 radio transceivers distributed across the continental USA which operated in the Low frequency (LF) radio band. Analysis showed that low-frequency (150-190 kilohertz) radio transmissions were largely unaffected by high-altitude EMP, and the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (Kirtland Air Force Base) tested a small scale 'groundwave' transmission system in 1978-1982. Based on the groundwave concept's promise, USAF Headquarters issued a draft Program Management Directive (PMD) for a \\"Proliferated Groundwave Communications System (PGCS)\\" on 25 August 1981. The name of this proposed network system was changed from PGCS to Groundwave Emergency Network in February 1982\\"History of the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Volume I.\\", 1984. Held at Air Force Historical Research Agency, IRIS 01085265 The Air Force placed a tentative initial operating capability for GWEN by January 1992. When doubts arose regarding the threat of electromagnetic pulse to permanently shut down communications, only 58 of the originally planned 240 GWEN towers were built. In 1994 a defense appropriations bill banned new towers from being built, and shortly after, the GWEN program was cancelled by the Air Force. Operations Command and control messages originating at various military installations were transmitted on the 225 to 400 MHz band and received by a network of unmanned relay stations, called \\"Relay Nodes\\", dispersed throughout the contiguous 48 states. The Relay Nodes would re-transmit these command and control messages to each other, and to Strategic Air Command operating locations and launch control centers using low frequencies in the 150-175 kHz range in order to take advantage of ground-hugging radio propagation similar to commercial AM radio stations. Distance between the Relay Nodes were approximately 150‚Äì200 miles, determined by the ground wave transmission range. During initial operations, the Relay Nodes would receive and relay brief test messages every 20 minutes. The system had built-in redundancy, using packet switching techniques for reconstruction of connectivity if system damage occurred.Naval Postgraduate School Thesis: \\"FEASIBILITY OF METEOR BURST BUOY RELAY AS A COMMAND AND CONTROL ASSET\\", March 1992 Problems Early in its lifetime, electrical interference problems caused by GWEN system operation began to surface. Since the stations were using LF, the chosen frequency was within 1 kHz of the operating frequency of nearby electrical carrier current systems. With GWEN handling constant voice, teletype and other data traffic, it caused interference to the power companies diagnostic two kilohertz side carrier tone. When the side carrier tone disappeared due to interference from GWEN, the power grid would interpret that as a system fault.\\"Chester Smith Oral History\\", Engineering and Technology History, 1 Dec 2008 Site layout The overall area of a GWEN Relay Node was approximately , approximately √ó 700 feet. It was surrounded on the perimeter by locked, chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. Typical site features included: *A main Longwave transmitting tower (generally between tall *A radial network of underground wires forming a large ground plane to serve as a reflecting surface for radio waves *Three electronic equipment shelters; two located near the perimeter of the site, and one at the base of the tower containing an antenna-tuning unit (ATU) *UHF and LF receive antennas mounted on either a 10 ft. mast, 30 ft. light pole, or 60‚Äì150 ft. tower. *A diesel backup generator, with a two- chambered fuel tank having a capacity of The main GWEN antenna operated intermittently in the LF band at 150 to 175 kilohertz (kHz) (below the bottom of the AM broadcast band at 530 kHz). The peak broadcasting power was from 2,000 to 3,000 watts. The UHF antenna operated at 20 watts, between 225 and 400 megahertz (MHz). GWEN site locations A 1998 Department of Transportation environmental impact survey that proposed repurposing a number of existing GWEN sites for use by the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System listed the locations of 29 GWEN sites: *Appleton, Washington *Austin, Nevada *Bakersfield, California *Billings, Montana *Bobo, Mississippi *Clark, South Dakota *Edinburg, North Dakota *Fenner, California *Flagstaff, Arizona *Gettysburg, Pennsylvania *Goodland, Kansas *Grady, Alabama *Great Falls, Montana *Hackleburg, Alabama *Hagerstown, Maryland *Hawk Run, Pennsylvania *Kirtland AFB, New Mexico *Klamath Falls, Oregon *Macon, Georgia *Medford, Wisconsin *Medora, North Dakota *Onondaga, Michigan *Penobscot, Maine *Pueblo, Colorado *Ronan, Montana *Savannah Beach, Georgia *Spokane, Washington *Summerfield, Texas *Whitney, Nebraska Termination Some of the initial towers had prompted groups of citizens in Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and California to organize to fight construction of GWEN towers in their areas. The groups believed that the presence of a GWEN node would increase the community's \\"strategic worth\\" in the eyes of the Soviet Union and thus invite attack. Responding to these groups, the Air Force repeatedly downplayed the importance of the towers, stating they were not worth that kind of attention by the Soviet Union. Amid controversy and world geopolitical changes, GWEN's value diminished greatly in the post-Cold War environment, in addition to its existence being rendered moot by the sustained effectiveness of predecessor and follow-on systems (Survivable Low Frequency Communication System and Minimum Essential Emergency Communication Network respectively). As early as 1990, legislative measures were enacted to terminate the program.U.S. House of Representatives: S.2257, A bill to terminate the Ground-Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) program, 8 March 1990. In 1994, new construction of GWEN towers were banned after a defense appropriations bill eliminated any funding for the towers for one year. A few months later, the United States Air Force announced that they would terminate the construction contract to build the remaining 25 towers, except for monies used to dismantle the system.Norris, Robert S.; Arkin, William M.

The make was retired for the 1962 and 1963 model years, when the name was used for the Mercury Meteor sold in the United States. It succeeded the Mercury 114, a Canadian-market Mercury based on the Ford, the \\"114\\" name being taken from the car's wheelbase. It complemented the Mercury, and gave Canadian Mercury-Lincoln dealers a car to sell in the low- price market, against the Canadian Pontiac. Similarly, Canadian Ford dealers offered the Monarch, a line of cars based on the Mercury models, to compete against the Oldsmobile. This was due to the dealer structure in Canada, where smaller communities might have only a single dealer that was expected to carry a full line of models in both the low- and mid-price classes. From 1949‚Äì1959, Meteor typically ran fourth in overall sales, behind Chevrolet, Ford, and Pontiac. History The initial 1949 Meteor was introduced on June 25, 1948, at the same time the Ford Deluxe and Custom series were introduced across North America, and shared the new postwar full-sized Ford bodies, chassis, and powertrains but with unique trim. It used a Mercury grille and was powered by a , 239 CID flathead V8 similar to that used in 1946‚Äì1953 U.S. Ford passenger cars. Meteor, as well as the Canadian Ford, kept the flathead V8 engine through 1954. The new OHV V8 which US Fords offered beginning in 1954 was not introduced in Canada until the 1955 model year. The following year, Ford of Canada introduced a six-cylinder engine for Canadian Ford and Meteor cars. Meteor models continued to use the Ford body with unique items such as grilles, taillights, and moldings. The 1952‚Äì1954 Meteors used Mercury instrument panels and dashboards. In mid-1954, some Niagara and Rideau models began using Ford instrument panels and dashes. These cars were named Niagara Special and Rideau Special and were priced around C$67 less than regular Niagaras or Rideaus. In 1954, Meteor changed to its own series names. The entry-level car was called just Meteor, replacing Ford's Mainline series. The mid-level Ford Customline became the Meteor Niagara, while the top trim level Ford Crestline became the Meteor Rideau. A rebadged, Canadian-built version of the Ford Ranchero was added in 1957, and continued to be produced until 1959 as the \\"Meteor Ranchero.\\" The Montcalm series was added in mid-1959 as a counterpart to Ford's new Galaxie models. Meteor was discontinued as a brand name after 1961 for a number of reasons. The Meteor name was selected for a new vehicle introduced in the Mercury line, the intermediate sized Mercury Meteor, beginning in 1962, and the entire Mercury line had already been dropped down in price (moving closer to the niche previously served by the Meteor brand in Canada) due to slow Mercury sales and the discontinuation of the Edsel brand. Model names 378,463 were built in model years 1949 through 1961, using the following nine model names: * De Luxe / Deluxe (1949-1950) * Custom (1949) *Custom Deluxe (1950-1951) *Custom Deluxe Victoria (pillarless hardtop coupe; 1951) * Mainline (1952-1953) * Customline (1952-1953) * Customline Victoria (pillarless hardtop coupe; 1952) *Crestline Victoria (pillarless hardtop coupe; 1953) * Meteor (1954-1961) * Niagara/Niagara 300 (1954-1959) * Rideau/Rideau 500 (1954-1961) *Rideau Skyliner (pillarless hardtop with plexiglass roof; 1954) *Rideau Victoria (pillarless hardtop coupe; 1954) *Rideau Crown Victoria (1955) * Montcalm (1958-1961) The Meteor name was not its own brand in model years 1962 and 1963, replaced by the Mercury Meteor, based on the Ford Fairlane. When the brand returned for 1964 they were based on the full-size Mercury rather than Fords as earlier. About 255,000 Meteors were built between 1964 and 1976, in six different series: * Meteor (1964) * Custom (1964) * Rideau/Rideau 500 (1965-1976) * Montcalm (1965-1976) * Montego (1967) * LeMoyne (1968-1970) 1964 Due to dealer pressure, however, Ford released a lower-priced \\"Mercury 400\\" in 1963 that stood in the price bracket formerly occupied by the Meteor. When the intermediate Mercury Meteor was dropped after 1963, Ford of Canada relaunched Meteor as a standalone make in 1964, and dropped Mercury's Monterey series in Canada. The 1964 Meteor looked nearly identical to the 1964 Mercury, save for its Ford dashboard and interior, and was available in a base and Custom series. Sedans, hardtops, and a convertible were offered. It appears that most, if not all, 1964 Meteor closed models were of the \\"Breezeway\\" style, featuring a blocky C-pillar with retractable rear window, while Mercurys offered sleeker \\"Marauder\\" models. 1965-1968 For 1965, the full range of model names that had existed in 1961 returned: Rideau, Rideau 500, and Montcalm. The cars used Ford Galaxie bodies but had Mercury-styled front and rear styling. The Montego was added as a top-range model for 1967, but when that name was selected for use by Mercury in the U.S. beginning in 1968, it was renamed LeMoyne. A sport-themed Montcalm S-33 model was available from 1966-68. These cars were all basically Ford Galaxies with Mercury styling, they even used Ford's full size wheel covers. 1969-1976 Although Meteor was still considered as a separate marque through 1976, after 1968, the cars also carried Mercury badging and were advertised as the \\"Mercury Meteor\\". LeMoyne and Montcalm S-33 models continued through 1970. 1977-1981 After 1976, the Rideau 500 and Montcalm names, as well as the unique trim items, were dropped. The Meteor name was then used on a lower-priced variant of the Mercury Marquis, called the Mercury Marquis Meteor, built until 1981.

A violet ray is an antique medical appliance used during the early 20th century to discharge in electrotherapy. Their construction usually featured a disruptive discharge coil with an interrupter to apply a high voltage, high frequency, low current to the human body for therapeutic purposes.. Overview Their basic construction was invented before 1900 by Nikola Tesla, who introduced his first prototypes at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Most of the antique violet rays in the US were produced before the Depression era, and some of the larger US manufacturers of violet rays were Renulife, Fitzgerald, and Fisher. Companies who manufactured violet ray devices made many other types of electrical appliances as well, e.g. Star Electric, which also manufactured stock ticker machines. Many of the companies who were able to continue manufacturing violet rays after the Depression stopped making them due to World War II, when they began manufacturing radio coils and other electrical components for the war instead. A typical violet ray device consisted of an ungrounded, electrical control box that controlled the interrupter and housed the magneto coil, and an attached bakelite or other handle housing which contained the high voltage coil and an insertion port for attachments. Glass, evacuated tubes of varying shapes and for different therapeutic uses could be inserted into the bakelite handle to apply the resulting current to different parts of the body.

Early life Grimminger was born in Augsburg, Bavaria and entered the Imperial German Army when he was sixteen years old. He served during World War I as a mechanic in an air regiment from 1914 and 1917. He fought in the Gallipoli Campaign. He also served a year in Palestine after which he returned to Germany. Having been awarded the Iron Cross (second class), Bavarian medals and the Turkish Iron Crescent, Grimminger was discharged from the German Imperial Army in 1919 after its defeat.Profile of Grimminger on the 'WW2 Gravestone.com' website (2019). https://ww2gravestone.com/people/grimminger- jakob/ Nazi Party activity Grimminger joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1922 and became a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). He took part in street- fighting in Coburg in 1922 and in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 8 November 1923. After serving in the Brown House, the general headquarters of the NSDAP, he was selected in 1926 to become a member of the Schutzstaffel (SS). Grimminger was promoted during his service in the SA and the SS, finally reaching the rank of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (equivalent to colonel). As a member of the SS, he was appointed to carry the blood-stained Blutfahne from the Munich Putsch. He was decorated with the Golden Party Badge, the Blood Order (no. 714), and the Coburg Badge, three of the most prized decorations of the NSDAP.Dombrowski, Hanns (1940), Orders, Ehrenzeichen und Titel.

Personal life Nongqawuse was born in 1841 near the Gxarha River in independent Xhosaland but close to the border of the recently colonized territory of British Kaffraria in Eastern Cape South Africa. She was Xhosa. Little is known of Nongqawuse's parents as they died when she was young. According to Jeffrey B. Peires, Nongqawuse stated in a deposition that \\"Mhlakaza was my uncle....my father's name Umhlanhla of the Kreli tribe. He died when I was young.\\" Nongqawuse‚Äôs parents died during the Waterkloof campaigns of the Eighth Frontier War (1850‚Äì1853). Nongqawuse is believed to have been quite conscious and aware of the tensions between the Xhosa and the colonial forces. The Xhosa were experiencing an onslaught of attacks upon their community and institutions by British colonial authorities from as early on as 1779. The orphaned Nongqawuse was raised by her uncle Mhlakaza, who was the son of a councillor of Chief Sarili. Mhlakaza was a religious man who left Xhosaland after his mother's death and spent time in the Cape Colony, where he became familiar with Christianity. He returned to Xhosaland in 1853. Mhlakazi was to have a major influence in Nongqawuse's life acting as an interpreter and organiser of her visions. Spiritual experience In April 1856, 15-year old Nongqawuse and her friend Nombanda, who was between the ages of 8-10, went to scare birds from her uncle's crops in the fields by the sea at the mouth of the Gxarha River in the present day Wild Coast region of South Africa. When she returned, Nongqawuse told her uncle and guardian Mhlakaza, a Xhosa spiritualist, that she had met the spirits of two of her ancestors. She claimed that the spirits had told her that the Xhosa people should destroy their crops and kill their cattle, the source of their wealth as well as food. Nongqawuse claimed that the ancestors who had appeared to them said; # the dead would arise; # all living cattle would have to be slaughtered, having been reared by contaminated hands; # cultivation would cease; # new grain would have to be dug; # new houses would have to be built; # new cattle enclosures would have to be erected; # new milk sacks would have to be made; # doors would have to be weaved with buka roots and lastly; # that people abandon witchcraft, incest and adultery. In return the spirits would sweep the British settlers into the sea. The Xhosa people would be able to replenish the granaries, and fill the kraals with more beautiful and healthier cattle. During this time many Xhosa herds were plagued with \\"lung sickness\\", possibly introduced by European cattle. Mhlakaza did not believe her at first but when Nongqawuse described one of the men, her uncle Mhalakaza, himself a diviner, recognised the description as that of his dead brother, and became convinced she was telling the truth. Obeying the prophecy Mhlakaza repeated the prophecy to Xhosa King Sarili kaHintsa. The cattle-killing frenzy affected not only the Gcaleka, Sarili's clan, but the whole of the Xhosa nation. Historians estimate that the Gcaleka killed between 300,000 and 400,000 head of cattle. Not all Xhosa people believed Nongawuse's prophecies. A small minority, known as the amagogotya (stingy ones), refused to slaughter and neglect their crops, and this refusal was used by Nongqawuse to rationalize the failure of the prophecies over a period of fifteen months (April 1856‚ÄìJune 1857). Aftermath Nongqawuse predicted that the ancestors' promise would be fulfilled on February 18, 1857, when the sun would turn red. Initially, after the failure of Nongqawuse's prophecy, her followers blamed those who had not obeyed her instructions. They later turned against her. Chief Sarili visited the Gxarha River mouth, and spoke with Nongqawuse and Mhalakaza. When he returned, he announced that the New World would begin in eight days. On the eighth day the sun would rise, blood-red, and before setting again, there would be a huge thunderstorm, after which \\"The dead would arise\\". During the next eight days the Cattle- Killing rose to a climax. These prophecies also failed to come true leading to the death of many people. In the aftermath of the crisis, the population of British Kaffraria dropped from 105,000 to fewer than 27,000 due to the resulting famine. The chief of Bomvana handed Nongqawuse over to Major Gawler and she stayed at his home for a period. One day Mrs. Gawler decided to dress her, along with the Mpongo prophetess Nonkosi, and have their portrait taken by a photographer. This is the widely circulated image of Nongqawuse with which most people are familiar. After her release, she lived on a farm in the Alexandria district of the eastern Cape. She died in 1898. Today, the valley where Nongqawuse alleged to have met the spirits is still called Intlambo kaNongqawuse (Xhosa for \\"Valley of Nongqawuse\\").

SDA's primary focus is hosting downloadable, high- quality speedrun videos, and currently has runs of over eleven hundred games, with more being added on a regular basis. SDA additionally used to host two annual speedrunning charity marathons, Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) and Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ), before Games Done Quick LLC started holding the event independently in 2015. It hosted nine marathons in total, and raised over $2.7 million for various charities, with the most successful one being AGDQ 2014 which raised just over $1 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.  History  SDA originally began as a demo archive of Quake playthroughs. SDA was formed initially by Nolan \\"Radix\\" Pflug of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by merging with a site created by Gunnar and Jesse in April 1998. In 2004, after the success of his own 100% Metroid Prime run, Radix expanded SDA to include demos of other games. Mike Uyama took over in 2006 as the site's administrator. In January 2010, SDA ran its first charity marathon, Classic Games Done Quick, raising over $10,000 for CARE.  Content  As of March 2018, SDA hosts speedrun videos of over 1,200 games. These videos are all available for download, and almost all are available in multiple video qualities. The site includes videos of popular games as Mega Man, Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros., and Sonic the Hedgehog. The site has been featured numerous times in publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and G4tv's Attack of the Show!. Some of the runs also appeared in an episode of Pure Pwnage.  Submissions  Speedruns submitted to SDA undergo a comprehensive verification process performed by SDA community members familiar with the game in question. Participants scrutinize the recording in evaluation of both its gameplay and video quality. The review process also attempts to certify that the submitted speedrun contains no foul play such as cheating, hacking, or improper segmenting. Additionally, participants ensure that the submission adheres to the site's rules, as well as any game-specific and category-specific requirements. SDA staff evaluates the community responses and makes a final determination regarding whether or not the run is to be accepted. This verdict is posted publicly in the SDA forum alongside the verifying users' responses. If a submission is accepted, the video of the run is encoded in multiple qualities and posted on the site alongside the runner's comments, which can detail specifics regarding the run.  Rules  Fundamentals = Submitted speedruns are typically performed on their native consoles. When performing a run of a PC game, the rules may mandate that certain computer configurations be adhered to. In general, SDA will not accept runs that are performed on emulators, as emulation can be influenced by the configuration of the computer being used. Furthermore, it is particularly difficult to verify whether or not a run performed on an emulator is tool- assisted. Nevertheless, SDA does permit the use of emulators in certain cases; submissions performed on the Game Boy Player, GameTap, and Virtual Console are allowed. Virtual machines and DOSBox are allowed in cases where an older PC game does not run properly on modern computers. Use of this software is reserved for specific circumstances and these submissions must adhere to several additional rules. Due to potential emulation inaccuracies, runs that utilize an emulator may be categorized separately from those of the original release. Non-cosmetic modifications to a game, console, or controller are not allowed. Glitches that are triggered by interfering with the normal operation of the hardware or game media while the game is running, such as the crooked cartridge trick are not permitted. In-game glitches or exploits may be permissible, contingent on the category being run. It is required that runs be recorded using direct-feed capture. This is typically done using a capture card or DVD recorder. A run may be rejected if the quality of the recording is insufficient. = Segmentation = *Segmented ** Utilizing the in-game save system, the run is performed in multiple parts. Segmented runs allow the player to retry each individual section of the game as many times as they desire. As a result, fully segmented submissions are heavily scrutinized and held to a higher standard of gameplay than single-segment runs. *Single- segment ** The entire game is beaten from start to finish in a single sitting. Excluding situations in which doing so is necessary to continue the game, the player may not utilize either soft or hard resets. *Single-segment with resets (also known as real-time attack) ** A single-segment run that permits resetting the game. Not every game is eligible for this form of segmentation; it is typically only utilized when the use of resets saves a substantial amount of time. = Completion = SDA accepts runs that adhere to one of three different completion requirements: *any% ** The game is beaten as quickly as possible without any regard to completion. *100% ** The player must complete all content prior to beating the game. *low% ** The game is beaten with the lowest completion percentage possible. = Additional categorization = Discrete runs of the same game can vary substantially based on self- imposed restrictions such as using a specific character, playing the game on a specific difficulty level, avoiding the use of glitches and exploits, or requiring completion of optional objectives. These restrictions can result in a single game having multiple (often contradictory) definitions of completion, called categories. Consequently, a single game may possess separate leaderboards for each category.  Charity work  Following an initial meetup at MAGFest, the SDA community, inspired by TheSpeedGamers, began their first charity marathon in January 2010, titled Classic Games Done Quick. Both direct-feed gameplay footage and webcam footage of the runners were live- streamed on SDA's homepage. The marathon was a success, raising over $10,000 for CARE. Starting in 2011, SDA began two annual marathons: Awesome Games Done Quick during the winter, and Summer Games Done Quick during the summer. Each subsequent marathon has become substantially more successful than its last iteration, with AGDQ 2011 and AGDQ 2012 raising $53,000 and $149,000 respectively for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. In April 2011, following the Great East Japan earthquake, SDA put together a marathon titled Japan Relief Done Quick. The marathon was executed by having each runner live-stream their run from their home, rather than having everyone travel to a central location. JRDQ raised $25,000 for Doctors Without Borders. During the marathons, a chip- in widget is placed beneath the streaming video, which visually displays how much has been donated so far, and which allows people watching the runs to donate money directly to the charity through a PayPal account. Viewers who donate are given the option to have a message sent to the marathon attendees to be read during the stream, allowing them to vote with their donation money for, among other things, which games they want played, what they want in-game characters to be named, or to request runners to perform specific feats such as difficult tricks or glitches. Prizes are available throughout the marathon; all donors are entered into a raffle to win them provided they meet the varying minimum donation sum within the time window for each prize. All donations always count towards the grand prizes, but most other prizes require donating during certain game runs or themed game blocks. On 27 January 2013, SDA announced that AGDQ 2013 had raised $448,423.27, surpassing Desert Bus for Hope 6's donation total of $443,165.29 to become the most successful single gaming charity marathon at the time. On 1 August 2013, SDA announced a donation total of $255,160.62 from the SGDQ 2013 marathon. On 16 January 2014, SDA announced over $1,025,000 in donations raised from their AGDQ 2014 event. Summer Games Done Quick 2014, was held from 22‚Äì28 June, and raised over $718,000 for Doctors Without Borders.

He is best known for his 1669 picaresque novel Simplicius Simplicissimus () and the accompanying Simplician Scriptures series.  Early life  Grimmelshausen was born at Gelnhausen. At the age of ten he was kidnapped by Hessian soldiery, and in their midst experienced military life in the Thirty Years' War. At the close of the war, Grimmelshausen entered the service of Franz Egon von F√ºrstenberg, bishop of Strasbourg. In 1665, he was made magistrate () at Renchen in Baden. On obtaining this appointment, he devoted himself to literary pursuits.  Works  Abenteuerlicher Simplicissimus, frontispiece of an early edition Grimmelshausen's work is greatly influenced by previous utopian and travel literature, and the Simplicissimus series attained a readership larger than any other seventeenth- century novel. Formerly, he was credited with Der fliegende Wandersmann nach dem Mond, a translation from Jean Baudoin L'Homme dans la Lune, itself a translation of Francis Godwins The Man in the Moone, but recent scholars have disputed this; he did, however, write an appendix to a 1667 edition of that translation, the basis for that association. Der fliegende Wandersman was included in his collected works, though without the appendix. In 1668, Grimmelshausen published Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus, which has been called the greatest German novel of the 17th century. For this work he took as his model the picaresque romances of Spain, already to some extent known in Germany. Simplicissimus has been interpreted as its author's autobiography; he begins with the childhood of his hero, and describes the latter's adventures amid the stirring scenes of the Thirty Years' War. The rustic detail with which these pictures are presented makes the book a valuable document of its time. For some, however, the later parts of the book overindulge in allegory, and finally become a Robinson Crusoe story. The historian Robert Ergang draws upon Gustav K√∂nnecke's Quellen und Forschungen zur Lebensgeschichte Grimmelshausens to assert that \\"the events related in the novel Simplicissimus could hardly have been autobiographical since [Grimmelshausen] lived a peaceful existence in quiet towns and villages on the fringe of the Black Forest and that the material he incorporated in his work was not taken from actual experience, but was either borrowed from the past, collected from hearsay, or created by a vivid imagination.\\" Among Grimmelshausen's other works, are the so-called Simplicianische Schriften (): *Die Ertzbetr√ºgerin and Landst√∂rtzerin Courasche (1670) *Der seltsame Springinsfeld (1670) *Das wunderbarliche Vogelnest (1672) He also published satires, such as Der teutsche Michel (1673), and gallant novels, like Dietwald und Amelinde (1670).  Death and legacy  1879 Grimmelshausen monument in Renchen He died in Renchen in 1676, where a monument was erected to him in 1879. Grimmelshausen's Landst√∂rtzerin Courasche became an inspiration for Bertolt Brecht's play Mother Courage and Her Children. Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus lent its name to Simplicissimus, a satirical German weekly which ran from 1894-1944 and 1954‚Äì67.

Biography Berk was born in Manisa, Turkey in 1918 and as a child witnessed the Fire of Manisa. He received a teacher's training in Balƒ±kesir. He graduated from the French Language Department of Gazi University in Ankara. Between 1945-1955, Berk served as a teacher. He later began to work for the publishing office of Ziraat Bank as a translator (1956‚Äì1969). He became specialized in translation of poetry notably by translating into Turkish works by Arthur Rimbaud and Ezra Pound. In his later years, Berk resided in Bodrum where he died on 28 August 2008. Poetry Berk's poetry evolved from the approach of an epical socialist to the dreamy vision of a lyrical and erotic individual. He made the \\"object\\" visible in its glory and aimed to break down the meaning. Berk's poetry takes its roots from the mythology, and a synthesis of Western and Eastern poetry traditions, yet he accomplishes to create a unique and postmodern approach.

A long-time food editor and restaurant critic for The New York Times, he was also the author of numerous cookbooks and an autobiography. Over the course of his career, he made many contributions to gastronomy and food writing in the United States.\\"When He Dined, the Stars Came Out\\" (May 8, 2012) New York Times  Early life  Born in Sunflower, Mississippi, Claiborne was raised on the region's distinctive cuisine in the kitchen of his mother's boarding house in Indianola, Mississippi. He essayed in premedical studies at the Mississippi State College from 1937 to 1939. Finding it to be unsuitable, he then transferred to the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism and got his B.A degree Claiborne served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and the Korean War. After deciding that his true passion lay in cooking, he used his G.I. Bill benefits to attend the √âcole h√¥teli√®re de Lausanne (Lausanne Hotel School), located in Lausanne, Switzerland. Career Returning to the U.S. from Europe, he worked his way up in the food-publishing business in New York City, New York, as a contributor to Gourmet magazine, a food-products publicist and finally becoming the food editor of The New York Times in 1957. Claiborne was the first man to supervise the food page at a major American newspaper and is credited with broadening The New York Times's coverage of new restaurants and innovative chefs. A typical food section of a newspaper in the 1950s was largely targeted to a female readership and limited to columns on entertaining and cooking for the upscale homemaker. Claiborne brought his knowledge of cuisine and own passion for food to the pages, transforming it into an important cultural and social bellwether for New York City and the nation at large. Claiborne's columns, reviews and cookbooks introduced a generation of Americans to a variety of ethnic cuisines particularly Asian and Mexican cuisines at a time when average Americans had conservative tastes in food, and what little gourmet cooking was available in cities like New York was exclusively French (and, Claiborne observed, not terribly high quality). Looking to hold restaurants accountable for what they served and help the public make informed choices about where to spend their dining dollars, he created the four-star system of rating restaurants still used by The New York Times and which has been widely imitated. Claiborne's reviews were exacting and uncompromising, but he also approached his task as a critic with an open mind and eye for cooking that was different, creative and likely to appeal to his readers. Inspired by food writers including M. F. K. Fisher, Claiborne also enjoyed documenting his own eating experiences and the discovery of new talent and new culinary trends across the country and across the world. Among the many then-unknown chefs he brought to the public's attention was the New Orleans, Louisiana, chef and restaurateur Paul Prudhomme. At the time, few people outside America's Deep South had any awareness of Louisiana's Cajun culture or its unique culinary traditions. Along with chef, author and television personality Julia Child, Claiborne has been credited with making the often intimidating world of French and other ethnic cuisine accessible to an American audience and American tastes. Claiborne authored or edited over twenty cookbooks on a wide range of foods and culinary styles, including some of the first best-selling cookbooks dedicated to healthy, low-sodium and low- cholesterol diets. He had a long-time professional relationship and collaborated on many books and projects with the French-born New York City chef, author and television personality Pierre Franey. Claiborne was an advocate of a fad diet known as the Gourmet Diet. With Franey, he worked out two hundred low-sodium, low-cholesterol recipes for this diet.Crown, Elizabeth F. (1980). Craig Claiborne's Gourmet Diet. Journal of the American Medical Association 244 (20): 2355. The $4,000 meal In 1975, he placed a $300 winning bid at a charity auction for a no-price-limit dinner for two at any restaurant of the winner's choice, sponsored by American Express. Selecting Franey as his dining companion, the two settled on Chez Denis, a noted restaurant located in Paris, France, where they racked up a $4,000 tab on a five-hour, thirty-one-course meal of foie gras, truffles, lobster, caviar and rare wines. When Claiborne later wrote about the experience in his New York Times column, the newspaper received a deluge of reader mail expressing outrage at such an extravagance at a time when so many in the world went without. Even the Vatican and Pope Paul VI criticized it, calling it \\"scandalous.\\" It was also noted that he and Franey ordered nearly every dish on the menu, but they took only a few bites of each one. Despite its scale and expense, Claiborne gave the meal a mixed review, noting that several dishes fell short in terms of conception, presentation or quality.  Personal life  Claiborne was a fixture of the New York City social scene for decades. His lavish, celebrity-studded birthday parties at his East Hampton, New York, estate on eastern Long Island were a regular event on the Manhattan social calendar. Although he was out as a gay man to most of his friends and colleagues, he struggled to come to terms with his sexuality. In his autobiography, A Feast Made for Laughter (1982), Claiborne described a bizarre, almost Faulknerian, childhood and adolescence in small-town Mississippi where he was mocked by schoolmates for his meek temperament and dislike of sports and had explicit sexual contact with his own father on at least one occasion. His mother was a warm and very genteel Southern lady, but doting and often overprotective of her young son. The young Claiborne often sought solace in the company of his mother's African-American kitchen and housekeeping staff, whose food, humor and culture he came to love. Death and legacy Claiborne, who suffered from a variety of health problems in his later years, died at age 79 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, New York. No cause of death was given.\\"Craig Claiborne, pioneering New York Times food critic, dies at 79\\" (January 24, 2000) Mount Carmel Daily Republican Register, Mount Carmel, Illinois In his will, he bequeathed his estate to The Culinary Institute of America, located in Hyde Park, New York.

He is well known for his incredible memory demonstrations and has appeared on numerous television shows including 24 times on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His book The Memory Book was a New York Times bestseller. His card magic, especially his innovations in card sleights, is widely emulated by amateur and professional magicians. Life and career Lorayne grew up in New York's Lower East Side and he learned sleight of hand at the Hamilton Fish Park in the 1930s. At age 18, he began to perform as a table magician at Billy Reed's Little Club at 70 E. 55th St. in New York. The actor Victor Jory, noted for his role as a magician detective, was a regular visitor to the club. Lorayne started performing memory tricks for Jory and Jory's enthusiastic response changed Lorayne's approach to performing.\\"Interview with Roger Dreyer\\" , \\"Dead Magicians Society\\", 2010 Lorayne saw his first card trick when he was 11 years old and immediately knew he had to figure out how to do it himself. He stole empty milk bottles from in front of apartments in the tenement in which he lived so that he could collect the $.02 deposit on them and be able to afford a deck of cards. He worked at it and figured out multiple ways to perform the trick, including better ways than the magician he had first seen perform it. Lorayne began appearing on national television in 1958 (after hosting a local show of his own in 1951, The Prof. Magic Show), first on I've Got a Secret, where he demonstrated his ability to remember everybody's name in the audience and later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and numerous other television shows including Jack Paar, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, The Regis Philbin Show, Good Morning America, The Today Show, That's Incredible, David Susskind. He was a regular performer (24 times) on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. To demonstrate his memory, Lorayne would stand beside the president of the club he was visiting and be introduced to each member. The number of members of a club could reach up to 1,500. After an hour and a half, Lorayne would speak about memory for about 20 minutes and then ask if anyone had a question. He promised that he would pay any questioner whose name he could not remember a thousand dollars. He always remembered the names of every member of the audience. Lorayne also made news by memorizing and recalling information from phone books with no errors. On just about every public appearance demonstrating his memory abilities, he would meet all the people in the audience as they arrived, and then would open his show by asking all the people he met to please stand. He would ask them to sit down when he pointed to them and correctly said their name, and would usually make the entire audience sit down. He had a memory school in New York employing such instructors as Bob Elliott and Darwin Ortiz. His Memory Power video course was used as part of the training of many top corporations. He has continued to give lectures and actively write books beyond the age of 90. Writer and publisher Harry Lorayne is a prolific author of memory training books intended for the public, as well as writing books for professional magicians. His The Memory Book has sold over two million copies, whilst in Chronicles: Volume One, Bob Dylan writes that he read Lorayne's book shortly before breaking through as a music star after finding it in the book collection of a friend. \\"Harry Lorayne is the most influential author, publisher, and teacher of magic routines in the world today,\\" according to Randy Wakeman. For twenty years, Lorayne wrote and published the monthly magazine Apocalypse, which was created and started with Richard J. Kaufman, who left after the first year.

Goubau cited in Stulle, Bergoz 2012 The Goubau line, p.148 in 1950, based on work on surface waves on wires from 1899 by Arnold Sommerfeld. cited in Stulle, Bergoz 2012 The Goubau line, p.148 It is used as a feedline at UHF to link high frequency transmitters and receivers to their antennas, and in scientific research. 350 px Description 1955 article on Goubau feedline for UHF television antennas showing line and cone launchers. The Goubau line itself consists of a single wire conductor coated with dielectric material. Coupling to and from the G-line is done with conical metal \\"launchers\\" or \\"catchers\\", with their narrow ends connected for example to the shield of coaxial feed line, and with the transmission line passing through a hole in the conical tips. An advantage of the Goubau line is that it can have lower attenuation due to dielectric losses at high frequencies than other types of transmission line. Parallel line (twin lead) and coaxial cable, which are used to carry lower frequency radio signals, have high losses at the upper end of the UHF band, and are almost useless for distances over 100 feet (33 meters). Goubau lines can serve as low loss antenna feedlines at these frequencies, up to microwave frequencies where a waveguide must be used.\\" A G-line is a type of waveguide, rather than a wire in an electric circuit. The G-line functions by slowing the propagation velocity of EM waves below the free-space velocity, causing the wavefronts to slightly bend inwards towards the conductor, which keeps the waves entrained. Bends of large radius are tolerated, but too sharp a bend in the single wire will cause the line to radiate and lose energy into space. In theory the dielectric coating is a requirement, it slows the wave and focuses it along the wire. But some users note that in practice the finite conductivity of metals may produce a similar effect, and a bare G-line can entrain a propagating wave. Other structures besides horns have been used to couple radio waves into and out of Goubau lines; waves can be \\"launched\\" from planar structures like tapered coplanar waveguides at much higher frequencies, into the terahertz band. The dimension of the single metallic conductor is then typically 1 ¬µm. T.

The ability of surface waves to bend and follow the contour of a conductor explains why AM radio stations can be received on the far side of hills, and how over-the- horizon radar works.

This is in contrast to the usual use of a pair of wires providing a complete circuit, or an electrical cable likewise containing (at least) two conductors for that purpose. The single-wire transmission line is not the same as the single-wire earth return system, which is not covered in this article. The latter system relies on a return current through the ground, using the earth as a second conductor between ground terminal electrodes. In a single- wire transmission line there is no second conductor of any form. History As early as the 1780s Luigi Galvani first observed the effect of static electricity in causing the legs of a frog to twitch, and observed the same effect produced just due to certain metallic contacts with the frog involving a complete circuit. The latter effect was correctly understood by Alessandro Volta as an electric current inadvertently produced by what would become known as a voltaic cell (battery). He understood that such a current required a complete circuit to conduct the electricity, even though the actual nature of electric currents was not at all understood (only a century later would the electron be discovered). All subsequent development of electrical motors, lights, etc. relied on the principle of a complete circuit, generally involving a pair of wires, but sometimes using the ground as the second conductor (as with commercial telegraphy). At the end of the 19th century, Nikola Tesla demonstrated that by using an electrical network tuned to resonance it was possible to transmit electric power using only a single conductor, with no need for a return wire. This was spoken of as the \\"transmission of electrical energy through one wire without return\\".\\"Why did Tesla make his coil in the first place? . . . do they have any practical purposes?,\\" 21st Century Books.Nikola Tesla, \\"Talking with the Planets (1901)\\". Collier's Weekly, February 19, 1901, pp. 4‚Äì5. > \\"Some ten years ago, I recognized the fact that to convey electric currents > to a distance it was not at all necessary to employ a return wire, but that > any amount of energy might be transmitted by using a single wire. I > illustrated this principle by numerous experiments, which, at that time, > excited considerable attention among scientific men.\\" In 1891, 1892, and 1893 demonstration lectures with electrical oscillators before the AIEE at Columbia College, N.Y.C., the IEE, London, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, and National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, it was shown that electric motors and single-terminal incandescent lamps can be operated through a single conductor without a return wire. Although apparently lacking a complete circuit, such a topology effectively obtains a return circuit by virtue of the load's self-capacitance and parasitic capacitance.Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination, American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Columbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891.Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency, Institution of Electrical Engineers Address, London, February 1892. The final reference to \\"burning out\\" a machine was to emphasize the ability of such a system to transmit a large power given a proper impedance match, as can be obtained through electrical resonance. Theory This observation has been rediscovered several times, and described, for instance, in a 1993 patent., \\"Method and apparatus for single line electrical transmission\\". Avramenko, et al. Single-wire transmission in this sense is not possible using direct current and totally impractical for low frequency alternating currents such as the standard 50‚Äì60 Hz power line frequencies. At much higher frequencies, however, it is possible for the return circuit (which would normally be connected through a second wire) to utilize the self- and parasitic capacitance of a large conductive object, perhaps the housing of the load itself. Although the self-capacitance of even large objects is rather small in ordinary terms, as Tesla himself appreciated it is possible to resonate that capacitance using a sufficiently large inductor (depending on the frequency used), in which case the large reactance of that capacitance is cancelled out. This allows a large current to flow (and a large power to be supplied to the load) without requiring an extremely high voltage source. Although this method of power transmission has long been understood, it is not clear whether there has been any commercial application of this principle for power transmission. Single conductor waveguides As early as 1899, Arnold Sommerfeld published a paperA. Sommerfeld, Ann. Phys. u. Chemie (Neue Folge) 67-1, 233 (1899) predicting the use of a single cylindrical conductor (wire) to propagate radio frequency energy as a surface wave. Sommerfeld's \\"wire wave\\" was of theoretical interest as a propagating mode, but this was decades before technology existed for the generation of sufficiently high radio frequencies for any such experimentation, let alone practical applications. What's more, the solution described an infinite transmission line without consideration of coupling energy into (or out of) it. Of particular practical interest, though, was the prediction of a substantially lower signal attenuation compared to using the same wire as the center conductor of a coaxial cable. Contrary to the previous explanation of the full transmitted power being due to a classical current through a wire, in this case the currents in the conductor itself are much smaller, with the energy transmitted in the form of an electromagnetic wave (radio wave). But in this case, the presence of the wire acts to guide that wave toward the load, rather than radiating away. The reduction of ohmic losses compared to using coax (or other two-wire transmission lines) is especially an advantage at higher frequencies where these losses become very large. Practically speaking, use of this transmission mode below microwave frequencies is very problematic due to the very extended field patterns around the wire. The fields associated with the surface wave along the conductor are significant out to many conductor diameters, therefore metallic or even dielectric materials inadvertently present in these regions will distort the propagation of the mode and typically will increase propagation loss. Although there is no wavelength dependence to this dimension in the transverse direction, in the direction of propagation it is necessary to have a minimum of one half wave of conductor length to full support the propagating mode. For these reasons, and at frequencies available prior to about 1950, the practical disadvantages of such transmission completely outweighed the reduced loss due to the wire's finite conductivity. Goubau line In 1950 Georg Goubau revisited Sommerfeld's discovery of a surface wave mode along a wire, but with the intent of increasing its practicality.Georg Goubau, \\"Surface waves and their Application to Transmission Lines,\\" Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 21, Nov. (1950) One major goal was to reduce the extent of the fields surrounding the conductor so that such a wire would not require an unreasonably large clearance. Another problem was that Sommerfeld's wave propagated exactly at the speed of light (or the slightly lower speed of light in air, for a wire surrounded by air). That meant that there would be radiation losses. The straight wire acts as a long wire antenna, robbing the radiated power from the guided mode. If the propagation velocity can be reduced below the speed of light then the surrounding fields become evanescent, and are thus unable to propagate energy away from the area surrounding the wire. Goubau investigated the beneficial effect of a wire whose surface is structured (rather than an exact cylinder) such as would be obtained using a threaded wire. More significantly, Goubau proposed the application of a dielectric layer surrounding the wire. Even a rather thin layer (relative to the wavelength) of a dielectric will reduce the propagation velocity sufficiently below the speed of light, eliminating radiation loss from a surface wave along the surface of a long straight wire. This modification also had the effect of greatly reducing the footprint of the electromagnetic fields surrounding the wire, addressing the other practical concern., \\"Surface wave transmission line\\". George J. E. Goubau Finally, Goubau invented a method for launching (and receiving) electrical energy from such a transmission line. The patented, \\"Launching and receiving of surface waves\\". George J. E. Goubau Goubau line (or \\"G-line\\") consists of a single conductor coated with dielectric material. At each end is a wide disk with a hole in the center through which the transmission line passes. The disk may be the base of a cone, with its narrow end connected typically to the shield of coaxial feed line, and the transmission line itself connecting to the center conductor of the coax. Even with the reduced extent of the surrounding fields in Goubau's design, such a device only becomes practical at UHF frequencies and above. With technological development at terahertz frequencies, where metallic losses are yet greater, the use of transmission using surface waves and Goubau lines appears promising.Tahsin Akalin, \\"Single-wire transmission lines at terahertz frequencies\\", IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (IEEE-MTT), Volume 54, Issue 6, June 2006 Page(s): 2762 - 2767 E-Line From 2003 through 2008 patents were filed for a system using Sommerfeld's original bare (uncoated) wire, but employing a launcher similar to that developed by Goubau., \\"Method and apparatus for launching a surfacewave onto a single conductor transmission line using a slotted flared cone\\". Glenn E. Elmore, \\" Surface wave transmission system over a single conductor having E-fields terminating along the conductor \\" Glenn E. Elmore It was promoted under the name \\"E-Line\\" through 2009. Thus the resulting wave velocity is not reduced by a dielectric coating or special conditioning of the conductor as prescribed as necessary for non-radiation by Goubau for G-Line. This line is claimed to be completely non-radiating, propagating energy by way of a previously unrecognized transverse-magnetic (TM) wave. The intended application in this case is particularly for creating high information rate channels using existing power lines for communications purposes. This has been proposed for transmission of frequencies from below 50 MHz to above 20 GHz using pre-existing single or multistrand overhead power conductors. While Goubau-Line, which requires a conductor having an outer dielectric or special surface conditioning provided to reduce the velocity of the wave on the conductor, has long been known, this more general transverse-magnetic (TM) mode does not have this limitation. E-Line is similar to the Goubau-Line in its use of launchers to couple to and from a radially symmetric wave propagating in the space around a single conductor but different in that it can operate on insulation-free conductors, including those that are polished and completely unfeatured. The propagation velocity of the wave is not reduced and is essentially that of a wave traveling in the same medium in the absence of any conductor at all. Furthermore, practical launchers need not have a cross-section that is a large portion of a wavelength. Energy associated with the wave is confined to a region determined by the diameter and geometry of the conductor rather than the wavelength of the propagating signal. The Launcher has a low frequency cutoff limited by launcher length along the conductor. The behavior of such a system is independent of the operating frequency, but is dependent upon details of the power conductor and its environment. \\"A nearby conductor other than the line itself may provide a termination point and thereby reduce energy coupled into the TM wave\\". (This has relevance to Tesla's 1891-1893 table-top demonstrations.) As for any transmission line, at very high frequencies, the increased losses of the metal conductor, despite the advantage obtained using the surface wave mode, are increased, however because conductor losses are inversely proportional to the square of line impedance, this mode can achieve much lower losses, no more than a few percent of a 50 ohm coaxial line having the same center conductor. The effects of line taps, bends, insulators and other impairments normally found on power distribution systems have been described as \\"predictable and manageable\\". Depending on these factors, the resulting insertion loss, along with the transmitted power and receiver sensitivity, will determine the maximum distance attained by such a system. Like CATV systems, an increased end-to-end communications path can be obtained through the use of repeaters. To take advantage of existing lines, the conical launcher elements are built with a slot through the cone, so that they can be easily fitted over an existing power line (rather than having to be threaded through the cone). Systems can employ a launch device of only 15‚Äì20 cm in diameter from upper HF through millimeter wavelengths as long as the launch has sufficient length along the conductor. Generally structures at least one quarter wavelength long are required. A one meter long launcher with a 10 cm opening can provide under 2 dB of insertion loss from 130 MHz through many GHz. Systems built in this manner can provide both significant energy transfer e. g. providing motive power for electric helicopters acting as aerostats, at the same time they provide low loss transmission line connection to light weight, high altitude antennas.

The shock measured 5.6 on the Richter magnitude scale and was one of Australia's most serious natural disasters, killing 13 people and injuring more than 160. The damage bill has been estimated at A$4 billion (or $8.3 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation), including an insured loss of about $1 billion (or $2 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation). The effects were felt over an area of around in the state of New South Wales, with isolated reports of movement in areas up to from Newcastle. Damage to buildings and facilities was reported over an area of . Death toll and damage to buildings The highest death toll and damage occurred at the Newcastle Workers Club, where the floor collapsed. Nine people were killed and many more were trapped beneath rubble. Another three people were crushed to death under collapsed awnings on Beaumont Street, Hamilton, an inner-city suburb of Newcastle. Following the death of a woman in Broadmeadow from earthquake-related shock, the final death toll was raised to 13. The earthquake caused damage to over 35,000 homes, 147 schools, and 3,000 commercial and/or other buildings, with significant damage caused to 10,000 homes (damage worth over $1,000) and 42 schools (structural damage), within the immediate Newcastle area. The number of people in the city on the day of the earthquake was lower than usual, due to a strike by local bus drivers. The earthquake struck in the middle of an interview by local television station NBN with a union representative.

Cause In early 2007 a United States academic claimed that coal mining in the region triggered the earthquake, although earthquake activity has been present in the area at least since European settlement first occurred. This is in addition to reports by the former head of Geoscience Australia's earthquake monitoring group, Dr David Denham, who stated that the Newcastle earthquake was some distance from mining activity: > \\"The depths of the focus of the earthquake was about 13, 14 kilometres, > whereas the ones associated with mining, they're actually right close to the > mine, because that's where the stress release takes place\\". Despite the existence of records of previous earthquakes in the area, even the most recent construction codes at the time of the earthquake (issued in 1979) required neither the adoption of earthquake-resistant design regulations in Newcastle, nor the strengthening of old buildings, although they did encourage owners to provide more than the minimum strength.

He derived his nickname of Siface from his impersonation of that character in Cavalli's opera, Scipione affricano. It has generally been said that he appeared as Siface in Alessandro Scarlatti's Mitridate, but the confusion is due to his having sung the part of Mitridate in Scarlatti's Pompeo at Naples in 1683. In 1687, he was sent to London by the duke of Modena, to become a member of the chapel of James II. He probably did much for the introduction of Italian music into England, but soon left the country on account of the climate. He was murdered in 1697 on the road between Bologna and Ferrara, by the agents of a nobleman with whose wife he had a liaison. Although later sources indicate that he was killed at the behest of the brothers of Elena Marsili, a widowed Countess, who Siface had an affair with when they were both at the court of the Duke of Modena.

An Oudin coil, also called an Oudin oscillator or Oudin resonator, is a resonant transformer circuit that generates very high voltage, high frequency alternating current (AC) electricity at low current levels, used in the obsolete medical field of electrotherapy around the turn of the 20th century. It is very similar to a Tesla coil, with the difference being that the Oudin coil was connected as an autotransformer. It was invented in 1893 by French physician Paul Marie Oudin as a modification of physician Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval's electrotherapy equipment and used in quack medicine until perhaps 1930. The high voltage output terminal of the coil was connected to an insulated handheld electrode which produced luminous brush discharges, which were applied to the patient's body to treat various medical conditions in electrotherapy. How it works Oudin and Tesla coils are spark-excited air-core double-tuned transformer circuits that use resonance to generate very high voltages at low currents. They produce alternating current in the radio frequency (RF) range. The medical coils of the early 20th century produced potentials of 50,000 up to a million volts, at frequencies in the range 200 kHz to 5 MHz. The primary circuit of the coil has Leyden jar capacitors (C) which in combination with the primary winding of the coil (L1) make a resonant circuit (tuned circuit). In medical coils usually two capacitors were used for safety, one in each side of the primary circuit, to isolate the patient completely from the potentially lethal low frequency primary current. The primary circuit also has a spark gap (SG) that acts as a switch to excite oscillations in the primary. The primary circuit is powered by a high voltage transformer or induction coil (T) at a potential of 2 - 15 kV. The transformer repeatedly charges the capacitors, which then discharge through the spark gap and the primary winding (a detailed description of the operation cycle in the Tesla coil article also applies to the Oudin coil). This cycle is repeated many times per second. During each spark, the charge moves rapidly back and forth between the capacitor plates through the primary coil, creating a damped RF oscillating current in the primary tuned circuit which induced the high voltage in the secondary. The secondary winding (L2) is open-circuited, and connected to the output electrode of the device. In the Oudin coil, one side of the primary winding (L1) is grounded and the other side is connected to the secondary, so the primary and secondary are in series. There were two versions of the Oudin coil: * In earlier Oudin circuits the two coils were separate, not magnetically coupled, with a small horizontal primary \\"D'Arsonval\\" coil (L1) of 20-40 turns with a tap connected to a large vertical secondary \\"Oudin resonator\\" (L2) with many turns of fine wire (400 - 600 in large coils, 100 - 300 in small ones), connected to the high voltage terminal on top. In this circuit the high voltage was generated entirely by resonance in the high Q secondary coil. The addition of the \\"resonator\\" coil to the \\"D'Arsonval\\" coil was Oudin's contribution; the rest of the circuit was invented by Jacques D'Arsonval. * In later Oudin circuits the coils were magnetically coupled, forming an autotransformer, so the primary induces an EMF in the secondary by electromagnetic induction. Both coils were usually wound on the same coil form, the primary consisting of relatively few turns of heavy wire at the bottom with an adjustable tap, connected to the secondary winding, made of many turns of fine wire. Oudin found this circuit produced higher voltages due to the large turns ratio of the transformer. Although it doesn't include a capacitor, the secondary winding is also a resonant circuit (electrical resonator); the parasitic capacitance between the ends of the secondary coil resonates with the large inductance of the secondary at a particular resonant frequency. When it is excited at this frequency by the primary, large oscillating voltages are induced in the secondary. The number of turns in the primary winding, and thus the resonant frequency of the primary, could be adjusted with a tap on the coil. When the two tuned circuits are adjusted to resonate at the same frequency, the large turns ratio of the coil, aided by the high Q of the tuned circuits, steps up the primary voltage to hundreds of thousands to millions of volts at the secondary. The secondary is directly connected to the primary circuit, which carries lethal low frequency 50/60 Hz currents at thousands of volts from the power transformer. Since the Oudin coil was a medical device, with the secondary current applied directly to a person's body, for safety the Oudin circuit has two capacitors (C), one in each leg of the primary, to completely isolate the coil and output electrode from the supply transformer at the mains frequency.Manders, 1902, Some phenomena of high frequency currents, p. 220-221 Because two identical capacitors in series have half the capacitance of a single capacitor, the resonant frequency of the Oudin circuit is :f = {1 \\\\over 2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{L_1C/2}}\\\\; Use Electrodes used for electrotherapy. All attach to the black insulating handle (45, bottom) which is connected by wire to the Oudin terminal. A vacuum electrode. The high voltage terminal of the coil was attached through a wire to various types of handheld electrode which the physician used to apply the high voltage to the patient's body. The treatment was not painful for the patient, because alternating current in the radio frequency (RF) range, above 10 kHz in frequency, does not generally cause the sensation of electric shock. The Oudin coil was a \\"unipolar\\" generator, with the lower end of the coil grounded, so sometimes only one electrode was applied to the patient and the return path for the currents was through the ground. However usually a ground wire from the bottom of the coil was used; attached to a ground electrode which the patient held. A drawback of the Oudin coil was that movement of the electrode and wire during use changed the capacitance of the top terminal of the secondary coil, and thus its resonant frequency.Manders, 1902, Some phenomena of high frequency currents, p. 223 This threw the secondary coil out of resonance with the primary, causing a reduction in voltage. So the tap point on the primary coil had to be constantly adjusted during use to keep the primary and secondary in \\"tune\\" (seen in left image above). Many specialized types of electrodes were used to apply the current to various parts of the patient's body. These generally fell into two types. To apply brush discharges (called \\"effluves\\") to the outside of the patient's body, electrodes consisting of one or more metal points on an insulating handle were used. Care had to be taken to keep these far enough from the body to prevent an arc to the skin, which could cause painful RF burns. To apply current directly to the body surface, as well as to tissues inside the patient's body through the mouth, rectum, or vagina, a vacuum tube \\"condensing\\" electrode was used. This consisted of a partially evacuated glass tube of various shapes, with an electrode sealed inside, attached to the high voltage wire. This produced a dramatic violet glow when energized. The glass envelope of the tube formed a capacitor with the patient's body through which the current had to pass, limiting it to safe values. To apply current to the whole body, a \\"condensing couch\\" was used. This was a bed or couch with a metal back under its mattress, connected by a wire to the high voltage terminal. Metal handrest electrodes at the sides, which the patient grasped during treatment, served as the \\"ground\\" return path and were attached to the bottom of the coil. Thus the couch formed a capacitor, with the patient's body as one electrode. History During the 1800s, experiments in applying electric currents to the human body grew into a Victorian-era medical field, part legitimate experimental medicine and part quack medicine, called electrotherapy. The discovery of radio waves by Heinrich Hertz in 1886 and subsequent development of radio by Oliver Lodge, Guglielmo Marconi sparked interest in radio frequency currents and circuits for generating them. \\"High frequency\\" currents meant any frequency above the audio range, > 20 kHz, and the resonant coils which generated them were generically called \\"oscillation transformers\\". During the 1890s doctors began to experiment with applying these high voltage and high frequency currents to the human body (ethical standards in the medical profession were looser then and physicians could experiment on their patients). In 1890 French physician Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval founded the field of high frequency electrotherapy, performing the first experiments applying high frequency currents to the human body. He discovered that currents above 10 kHz do not cause muscle contraction or activate nerves to cause the sensation of electric shock. In 1891 in America, engineer Nikola Tesla independently discovered the same thing. Three types of apparatus were used, developed by three pioneers in the field, D'Arsonval, Tesla, and Oudin, and separate bodies of clinical technique grew up around them: D'Arsonval apparatus Small medical Tesla coil. The coil is immersed in oil to provide insulation. Unlike the Oudin, the Tesla coil is bipolar. * D'Arsonval apparatus - D'Arsonval first used a high frequency alternator, but this device could not produce frequencies over 10 kHz. To reach higher frequencies he developed a circuit consisting of a single tuned circuit, made of two Leyden jar capacitors and a small coil of relatively few, 10 to 30 turns of heavy wire, with an induction coil and spark gap to excite oscillations. It resembled a Tesla circuit without the secondary winding. The circuit produced relatively low voltage (perhaps 30 kV), high current electricity, called \\"D'Arsonval currents\\". The circuit was \\"bipolar\\" with two wires from opposite ends of the coil connected to electrodes at different places on the patient's body. The high frequency currents could produce heat in the patient's body, similar to the operation of a microwave oven; this was called Diathermy (Behary). Other names were also used such as Thermo-Faradism and Thermo-Penetration depending on whether it was used for therapy or for destructive effects in surgery (Behary) * Oudin resonator - French physician Paul Marie Oudin in 1893 modified the D'Arsonval circuit by adding a second large \\"resonator\\" coil made of many turns of fine wire to a tap on the small D'Arsonval coil. By adjusting the tap point he could bring the second coil to resonance with the tuned circuit, generating higher voltages at lower currents, similar to the Tesla circuit. In early \\"Oudin resonator\\" apparatus the two coils are separate and not magnetically coupled. Later Oudin found that the efficiency could be increased by magnetically coupling the coils, making the small coil the primary winding for the big coil. The Oudin resonator generated very high voltage, low current electricity. It was a \\"unipolar\\" circuit, with one end grounded and a single output terminal. * Tesla-Thomson apparatus - Serbian-American engineer Nikola Tesla pioneered the field of high-voltage RF resonant transformers. He and Elihu Thomson experimented with applying high voltage to their bodies. Although Tesla invented many different resonant transformer circuits, the electrotherapy circuit that bears his name was a \\"bipolar\\" circuit consisting of a spark- excited tuned primary coil of few turns encircling the center of a symmetrical bipolar secondary coil of many turns of fine wire, with output terminals on each end. The D'Arsonval and Oudin apparatus became popular in Europe, while the Tesla-Thompson apparatus was mostly used in America. During the first decades of the 20th century there was a rivalry between these camps, and debate in the medical literature as to whether \\"Tesla currents\\" or \\"Oudin currents\\" were better for various conditions. By 1920 it was realized that the currents were very similar. Since the circuits were so similar, medical suppliers sold combination \\"high frequency\\" units that could be set up for Tesla, D'Arsonval, or Oudin therapy, often also combined with Rontgen ray (x-ray) After Oudin combined the primary and \\"resonator\\" coil together on the same form, making them an air-core autotransformer, the only significant difference between the Tesla and Oudin apparatus was that the medical Tesla coil was \\"bipolar\\" while the Oudin coil was \\"unipolar\\", with one end grounded. As time went on the meaning of the terms changed, until (by perhaps 1920) the term Tesla coil meant a \\"bipolar\\" coil; any high voltage coil with an ungrounded balanced secondary with two output terminals, while the term Oudin coil meant a \\"unipolar\\" coil; any coil with a grounded secondary and a single output terminal. Around the 1930s vacuum tube oscillators replaced spark- excited circuits in high frequency medical equipment. The field of electrotherapy was replaced by the modern field of diathermy, and the Oudin coil became obsolete. Ironically modern day Tesla coil designs are unipolar, with a single high voltage terminal, and so are sometimes called Oudin coils.

(1998). Starlings and Mynas. London: Christopher Helm Publisher Ltd. It is named after the tuft of feathers on its forehead that resembles a crest. The crested myna is typically found in open spaces near urban and agricultural areas. It is a popular cage bird and, as a result, has been accidentally released in a few places outside of its usual range. For example, this species was introduced around 1890 into the Vancouver region of British Columbia. It was initially successful, reaching a population in the thousands, however, it has since then gone locally extinct in the area. Like many starlings, the crested myna is omnivorous. It will eat a variety of food including worms, grubs, grains, fruit, and even garbage. It is a highly beneficial bird to farmers, as it feeds on insects and does not attack crops.  Description  The crested myna is named after the tuft of feathers that form a crest-like structure on its forehead that covers the bird's nostrils. It is mostly black with a slight green sheen. It has a couple of white wing patches under its wings which are more visible during flight. The tips and the base of the primaries are white. The tail feathers also have white tips with the exception of the middle pair. The under-tail coverts are black with a white tip. The adult's eyes are orange, its bill is pale yellow, and its legs are a dull dark yellow. Its bill is slender and very sharp. The males are slightly larger than the females. The female's crest is slightly less well- developed. Otherwise, there is no sexual dimorphism. The hatchlings are born naked except for of a short gray down found on certain parts of the bird. In about 18 to 20 days, the juveniles become fully covered with brown feathers. The crest is usually not well developed at this stage. Immature crested mynas have blue-gray eyes.  Taxonomy  The crested myna is placed in the genus Acridotheres. It was previously placed in the genus Aethiospar, which included the mynas that had a fully feathered or tufted face. Acridotheres was formerly the group of bare-skin faced mynas. Now, the two genera form a new group that keeps the name Acridotheres. There are three recognized subspecies: *A. c. cristatellus, also known as the Chinese crested myna, is the nominate subspecies. It is found from eastern Burma to southeastern and central China. *A. c. brevipennis, also known as the little crested myna, occurs in Hainan, China. It has proportionally smaller wings and a smaller bill. The feathers that form the crest are narrower than the ones from the nominate subspecies. *A. c. formosanus, also known as the Formosan crested myna, is found in Taiwan. It is slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and its bill is greenish-yellow. Its under-tail coverts are white. It has a more developed crest.  Habitat  The crested myna can be found in a wide range of habitats from urban to rural areas. In cities, it can be seen in the eaves of buildings, along roads and alleys, near gardens and parks, in parking lots. It can be found under bridges, in trees, in chimneys, and on roofs. In rural areas, it can be spotted on agricultural fields, in orchards and farmyards, near manure piles. It can be seen near plowed fields to take advantage of the invertebrates found in the tilled soil. It is often seen near cattle as it eats the insects around them. It is also commonly distributed in grasslands, fields and at the edge of forests.  Distribution  The crested myna's range spans from southeastern and central China to northern Indochina. It is found in the Yangtze valley and the southeastern Jiangxi Province in China. The crested myna has also been recorded in Burma, Taiwan and Hainan. left As a popular cage bird, it is often transported outside of its normal range and, on occasion, can be accidentally released and introduced in a new area. For example, in the late 1800s, it was introduced to Vancouver, British Columbia. It was able to proliferate and its population grew to around 20,000 to 30,000 individuals. It could be found anywhere from the south of the province to Washington and Oregon. By the mid-20th century, the numbers began declining, and the bird is now extirpated in North America. Other examples of the crested myna's introduction can be seen in Portugal. The bird was discovered breeding around Lisbon, Portugal in 1997. They are now established on both sides of the Tagus estuary to the west of Lisbon and also on the Set√∫bal Peninsula. The crested myna has also been successfully introduced in Penang, Singapore, Manila, as well as parts of Japan and Argentina.  Behavior = Vocalization  The crested myna has a wide array of songs and calls, from whistles to warbles to chortles.Johnson, S. R. and R. W. Campbell (1995). \\"Crested Myna\\" (Acridotheres cristatellus), version 2.0. In The Birds of North America (A. F. Poole and F. B. Gill, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. When alarmed, it emits a raspy jaaay. Other calls include a series of chuffs or creeks. Vocal mimicry of human voices and other yard birds in crested mynas has been reported. However, birds held in captivity were not found to be good mimics.  Diet  The crested myna is an omnivorous bird. Although it eats mainly insects, this bird can eat a wide variety of items including fruit, grains, meat, manure and garbage. Its diet varies seasonally. On average, 40% of the adult bird's diet is meat and 60% is vegetation. However, in September, the proportion of meat in its diet increases to around 50‚Äì60%, where almost half of it is flies. In the winter months, as insects and fruit are less common, the crested myna eats a lot more garbage (representing about 15% of its diet). Its diet also varies with the life stages of the bird. Juveniles eat proportionally more animal matter than adults Approximately 75% of their diet is made of meat (50% of which is from insects). Similarly to adult crested mynas, the proportion of insects and fruit that the juveniles eat increases with availability and abundance.  Reproduction  A fledgling The crested mynas build their nests in a variety of places. In a forest, it builds its nest in holes caused by woodpeckers or decay. In urban areas, the nests can be found in chimneys, drains, and crevices among other places. Most nests are built in April or May. Both the male and the female take part in the construction of the nest. To build the nest, the crested mynas have been known to use just about anything they can find from grass to branches to garbage. The first clutch of the season appears during the end of April or during May. Most pairs are double-brooded, which means they will have a second clutch in the same season. The second clutch appears in June to mid- August. The eggs are of a light blue-green color and have a similar shape to that of robin eggs. Typically, the clutch size is around 4‚Äì6 eggs. Every day, one egg is hatched. The hatchlings are born altricially. The eggs are incubated for 14 days, after which the fledglings move out of the nest onto a nearby tree or shrub. The parents keep feeding them for about a week. The immature crested mynas do not separate from their parents. They typically form small family groups and form a larger flock with others for feeding and traveling.  Status and conservation  Since 1998, the crested myna has been rated as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. It has a range that is larger than 20,000 km2 and therefore, its range is too large for this bird to be considered vulnerable under the criterion of range size. Also, the population trends seem to be stable (over the last ten years or three generations) and so, this bird cannot be considered vulnerable under the criterion of population trends. Finally, it is believed that the population size exceeds 10,000 mature individuals and therefore its this bird cannot be considered vulnerable under the criterion of population size.

The Tango class was the NATO reporting name of a class of diesel-electric submarines that were built in the Soviet Union to replace the s assigned to the Black Sea and Northern Fleets. The Soviet designation of this class was Project 641B and it was also known as the Som (Catfish) class. The first of the class was completed in 1972 at Gorky. A total of 18 were built in two slightly different versions. The later type was several metres longer than the first, possibly because of the installation of ASW missile equipment. The bow sonar installations appear to be similar to those fitted to Soviet nuclear attack submarines. The propulsion plant was the same as the last subgroup of the Foxtrot class. The Tango class had far more battery capacity, far higher than any previous conventional submarine class in the Soviet Navy; as a result, pressure hull volume increased. This allowed an underwater endurance in excess of a week before snorkeling was required. Coupled with new armament and sensor fit, the Tango class were ideal for ambush operations against Western nuclear submarines at natural chokepoints. Because of its all-hull rubber coating, the sub class was nicknamed \\"rezinka\\" [rubber] Construction of this class has now stopped.

Early career Hamelain went to sea in 1806 as cabin boy with his uncle, Jacques F√©lix Emmanuel Hamelin, on the frigate V√©nus in the era of Napoleon and the French Empire. The V√©nus was part of the French squadron in the Indian Ocean during the Mauritius Campaign of 1809-1811, and young Hamelin had an opportunity of seeing much active service. She, in company with another and a smaller vessel, captured the English frigate Ceylon in 1810, but was immediately afterwards captured herself by the Boadicea, under Commodore Josias Rowley (1765‚Äì1842). Young Hamelin was a prisoner of war for a short time. Career after the First French Empire fell Portrait of Ferdinand Hamelin He returned to France in 1811. On the fall of the Empire he had better fortune than most of the Napoleonic officers who were turned ashore. In 1821 he became lieutenant, and in 1823 took part in the French expedition under the Duke of Angoul√™me into Spain. In 1828 he was appointed captain of the Act√©on, and was engaged till 1831 on the coast of Algiers and in the conquest of the town and country. His first command as flag officer was in the Pacific, where he showed much tact during the dispute over the Marquesas Islands with England in 1844. He was promoted vice-admiral in 1848. During the Crimean War he commanded in the Black Sea, and co-operated with Admiral Dundas in the bombardment of Sevastopol on 17 October 1854. His relations with his English colleague were not very cordial. On 7 December 1854 he was promoted to admiral. Shortly afterwards he was recalled to France, and was named minister of marine. His administration lasted till 1860, and was remarkable for the expeditions to Italy and China organized under his directions; but it was even more notable for the energy shown in adopting and developing the use of armour. The launch of the Gloire in 1859 set the example of constructing seagoing ironclads. When Napoleon III made his first concession to Liberal opposition, Admiral Hamelin was one of the ministers sacrificed. He held no further command, and died on 10 January 1864.

For many years, this farm hamlet was Iowa's smallest incorporated city. The town's population slowly eroded over the years; by 1990 the population had dropped to 7, and the remaining residents voted to disincorporate. Donnan ceased to exist as a city in early 1991. History=Early years Plat map of Donnan from 1916. The post office at Donnan was established on July 10, 1874;Patera, Alan H. and Gallagher, John S. Iowa Post offices, 1833-1986, p. 70. Lake Oswego, Oregon: The Depot The town was platted in 1878 as Donnan Junction, located at the junction of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific railroads. Donnan was named in honor of William G. Donnan (1834‚Äì1908), who served the area in the House of Representatives from 1871-75.Dilts, Harold E. (1993) From Ackley to Zwingle: The Origin of Iowa Place Names, p. 74. Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, . The town plat showed Donnan divided into five blocks, with blocks 2 and 3 divided into 18 parcels each. Blocks 1, 4, and 5 were smaller because of the railroad lines running diagonally through the community. Donnan had three streets running north‚Äìsouth; from westernmost to easternmost the streets were named Maple, Logan, and Sumner. The east‚Äìwest streets were named Woodard Street and Washburn Avenue. By 1916, only six houses had been built, and these were all on Logan Street. Several farmhouses also fronted the Rock Island railroad tracks (see map). Incorporation A Donnan aerial photo taken in the 1930s, showing Donnan's new main street, New Donnan Road (running diagonally from southwest to northeast). Woodard Street and Logan Street can also be clearly seen in the photo. The settlement was officially incorporated (as Donnan) in 1922 so that a school could be built. An area of of land was included within the city limits so the area would meet the state's 25-person minimum population requirements. By the 1930s, several improvements had been made in the town, including a diagonal road built alongside the Rock Island railroad. This road, named New Donnan Road, became the town's main thoroughfare. Aside from the post office and railroad depot, the community also had a meeting hall, a pool hall, stock yards, a restaurant, an implement company, a hardware store, a grain elevator, a livery stable, a blacksmith shop, and a three-story hotel. Despite attracting a number of businesses and the site's prime location at the junction of two railways, the town never attracted many residents. The population of Donnan peaked at around fifty people in the 1940s. The City of Donnan was the state's smallest recognized community in 1954; the post office served 12 families (50 residents) and the school. Officials at the U.S. Postal Service that year decided to close the Donnan post office, but due to protests from residents, in February 1955 the closure was cancelled. Donnan did, however, lose its school in 1957; The hotel at Donnan had been moved to Sumner in 1947 and the building was converted into apartments. Lynn J. Webb served as Donnan's postmaster up until his death in 1955; Webb also ran the filling station and general store run out of the same building. Gertrude Menuey served as postmaster from 1955 to the 1970s. Eileen Lee was the postmaster during the 1980s. A. L. Begalske served as mayor of Donnan until his death in 1955. Matthew Porter was appointed mayor after Begalske's death, and served for the next 35 years. Ruth Holmes was the town clerk, Margaret Gage the treasurer. Decline Gradually, even the small population of Donnan eroded, leaving the town with fewer than 25 residents in 1970, and just 18 in 1972. All businesses except the post office had closed by the early 1970s. County road W-25, a paved highway from nearby Randalia to the county seat at West Union bypassed Donnan's main street, New Donnan Road, in the early 1970s. By 1977, Donnan consisted of \\"an abandoned grain elevator, an unused railroad depot, three farms, four occupied houses, and a few empty buildings\\". The Rock Island Railroad tracks at Donnan were pulled up in 1977. By 1978, the town's population had dropped to 13. That year Donnan residents celebrated the city's 100th anniversary. Donnan's few remaining residents fought \\"long, hard, and unsuccessfully\\" to keep the post office open. By 1982, however, postal officials prevailed. When the post office closed, on July 23, 1982, commemorative covers prepared by the Iowa Postal History Society gave the town's population as ten. Residents resisted the closing of the last business in Donnan \\"because [Donnan] citizens love it and hate to see it die\\", Mayor Porter said in 1988. In 1990, the last seven residentsColumbia Gazetteer of North America. 2000. Columbia University Press. made national headlines when they reluctantly voted to disincorporate, ending their town's status as an officially recognized city. At the disincorporation hearing Matt Porter, who had served as the town's mayor for 35 years, stated \\"Three of us are in our 70s and sooner or later it's got to come. There's no one else to carry on\\". Donnan ceased to exist in March 1991; the final vote was 6 to 1 in favor of disincorporation. A monument on New Donnan Road pays tribute to the empty community, which lies just two miles (3 km) north of its nearly empty sister community of Randalia (population 68). In October 2007, like Donnan before it, Randalia lost its post office, some time after losing its school and general store.McCoy, Terry (November 26, 2007). \\"We're Losing the Feeling of Being a Town\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, p. 1.

The deep cavern is located on the Viste farm, about northwest of the city of Stavanger, situated near the shore of the Visteviga bay, at the mouth of the Hafrsfjorden. The site has yielded numerous Neolithic artifacts that have been excavated and discovered in and around the cave. History The location served as a shelter for a group of about 25 people during the Neolithic since around 6,000 BCE. These people were mainly hunter-gatherers, who adopted a sedentary lifestyle based on agriculture around 4,000 BCE. The occupants of Vistehola engaged in hunting to maintain a diet, that largely consisted of wild boar. Faunal remains of moose and seal were also found. Since around 2,000 BCE, their major form of sustenance had shifted towards farming. The site was first studied in 1907 and 1910, and again in 1939 and 1941. The discovered material is remarkably well preserved and provides comprehensive information on the prehistoric inhabitant's living conditions from between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago. Cultural layers were divided into four distinct strata, that correspond with the local Mesolithic and Neolithic era and the most recent sediment layer has been associated with the Iron Age.. The greater discovery group includes hunting and fishing implements made of stone, antlers and bone as well as residue of shells and ornamental items. The cave houses an inhabited area of approximately and is located about north of today's shoreline. Excavation of the site revealed implement waste and also traces of funerals. At the east wall of the cave a skeleton of a juvenile boy (around 15 year old) was found who lived about 7,500 years ago. It represents one of the earliest known human remains in Norway.

Designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve, it forms part of the Morecambe Bay Pavements Special Area of Conservation due to its supporting some of the best European examples of natural limestone habitats. Also known as Whitbarrow Scar (though properly that term applies to the cliffs lining its western edge), the hill lies about south-west of Kendal, just north of the A590 road, close to the village of Witherslack. Part of the site is a local nature reserve called Whitbarrow Scar. It is a mixture of woodland, grassland and limestone pavement. The hill is prominent from the A590 road with its steep limestone cliffs, laid down in the Carboniferous period some 350 million years ago. The main cliff faces are made up of rocks known as Dalton Beds, above which are Urswick Limestones, of which the limestone pavement (here and elsewhere around Morecambe Bay, including Hutton Roof Crags) has been formed. Whitbarrow, like most of the Lake District, shows many signs of the last ice age, including glacial erratics (boulders left behind when the ice retreated), and the limestone pavement itself, formed when ice left bare limestone exposed to the elements which eroded it and left us with the grikes and clints we see today. The limestone has been used for many purposes including building, agricultural fertiliser, and production of millstones, but is now protected by law and it is an offence to remove any. Whitbarrow NNR is owned and managed by the Forestry Commission, Lake District National Park Authority and the Cumbria Wildlife Trust. Much of Whitbarrow is covered in woodland, initially naturally and from 1919 following planting; the Forestry Commission now holds leases on parts of the hill.

A major extinction, the Kellwasser event, occurred at the boundary that marks the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage (the Frasnian‚ÄìFamennian boundary), about 360‚Äì376 million years ago.Racki, 2005McGhee, George R., Jr, 1996. The Late Devonian Mass Extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian Crisis (Columbia University Press) Overall, 19% of all families and 50% of all genera became extinct. A second, distinct mass extinction, the Hangenberg event, closed the Devonian period.Caplan and Bustin, 1999 Although it is clear that there was a massive loss of biodiversity in the Late Devonian, the timespan of this event is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 25 million years, extending from the mid-Givetian to the end-Famennian.Stigall, 2011 Nor is it clear whether there were two sharp mass extinctions or a series of smaller extinctions, though the latest research suggests multiple causes and a series of distinct extinction pulses during an interval of some three million years.Racki, Grzegorz, \\"Toward understanding of Late Devonian global events: few answers, many questions\\" GSA Annual meeting, Seattle 2003 (abstract); McGhee 1996. Some consider the extinction to be as many as seven distinct events, spread over about 25 million years, with notable extinctions at the ends of the Givetian, Frasnian, and Famennian stages.Sole, R. V., and Newman, M., 2002. \\"Extinctions and Biodiversity in the Fossil Record - Volume Two, The earth system: biological and ecological dimensions of global environment change\\" pp. 297-391, Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change John Wiley & Sons. By the Late Devonian, the land had been colonized by plants and insects. In the oceans, massive reefs were built by corals and stromatoporoids. Euramerica and Gondwana were beginning to converge into what would become Pangaea. The extinction seems to have only affected marine life. Hard-hit groups include brachiopods, trilobites, and reef-building organisms; the reef-building organisms almost completely disappeared. The causes of these extinctions are unclear. Leading hypotheses include changes in sea level and ocean anoxia, possibly triggered by global cooling or oceanic volcanism. The impact of a comet or another extraterrestrial body has also been suggested,Sole, R. V., and Newman, M. Patterns of extinction and biodiversity in the fossil record such as the Siljan Ring event in Sweden. Some statistical analysis suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in speciation than by an increase in extinctions. This might have been caused by invasions of cosmopolitan species, rather than by any single event. Jawed vertebrates seem to have been unaffected by the loss of reefs or other aspects of the Kellwasser event, while agnathans were in decline long before the end of the Frasnian.Sallan and Coates, 2010 Late Devonian world A restored Tiktaalik During the Late Devonian, the continents were arranged differently from today, with a supercontinent, Gondwana, covering much of the Southern Hemisphere. The continent of Siberia occupied the Northern Hemisphere, while an equatorial continent, Laurussia (formed by the collision of Baltica and Laurentia), was drifting towards Gondwana, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The Caledonian mountains were also growing across what is now the Scottish Highlands and Scandinavia, while the Appalachians rose over America. The biota was also very different. Plants, which had been on land in forms similar to mosses, liverworts, and lichens since the Ordovician, had just developed roots, seeds, and water transport systems that allowed them to survive away from places that were constantly wet‚Äîand so grew huge forests on the highlands. Several clades had developed a shrubby or tree-like habitat by the Late Givetian, including the cladoxylalean ferns, lepidosigillarioid lycopsids, and aneurophyte and archaeopterid progymnosperms. Fish were also undergoing a huge radiation, and the first tetrapods, such as Tiktaalik, were beginning to evolve leg-like structures. Duration and timing Extinction rates appear to have been higher than the background rate, for an extended interval covering the last 20‚Äì25 million years of the Devonian. During this time, about eight to ten distinct events can be seen, of which two stand out as particularly severe. The Kellwasser event was preceded by a longer period of prolonged biodiversity loss. The fossil record of the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous period which followed is largely void of terrestrial animal fossils, likely related to losses during the end-Devonian Hangenberg event. This period is known as Romer's gap. The Kellwasser event The Kellwasser event, named for its locus typicus, the Kellwassertal in Lower Saxony, Germany, is the term given to the extinction pulse that occurred near the Frasnian‚ÄìFamennian boundary. Most references to the \\"Late Devonian extinction\\" are in fact referring to the Kellwasser, which was the first event to be detected based on marine invertebrate record. There may in fact have been two closely spaced events here, as shown by the presence of two distinct anoxic shale layers. The Hangenberg event The Hangenberg event is found on or just below the Devonian‚ÄìCarboniferous boundary and marks the last spike in the period of extinction. It is marked by an anoxic black shale layer and an overlying sandstone deposit. Unlike the Kellwasser event, the Hangenberg event affected both marine and terrestrial habitats. Causes Since the Kellwasser-related extinctions occurred over such a long time, it is difficult to assign a single cause, and indeed to separate cause from effect. The sedimentary record shows that the late Devonian was a time of environmental change, which directly affected organisms and caused extinction. What caused these changes is somewhat more open to debate. From the end of the Middle Devonian, into the Late Devonian, several environmental changes can be detected from the sedimentary record. Evidence exists of widespread anoxia in oceanic bottom waters; the rate of carbon burial shot up, and benthic organisms were devastated, especially in the tropics, and especially reef communities. Good evidence has been found for high-frequency sea-level changes around the Frasnian‚ÄìFamennian Kellwasser event, with one sea level rise associated with the onset of anoxic deposits. The Hangenberg event has been associated with sea-level rise followed swiftly by glaciation-related sea-level fall.Algeo et al., 2008 Possible triggers are as follows: Bolide impact Bolide impacts can be dramatic triggers of mass extinctions. An asteroid impact was proposed as the prime cause of this faunal turnover.Digby McLaren, 1969 The impact that created the Siljan Ring either was just before the Kellwasser event or coincided with it.J.R. Morrow and C.A. Sandberg. Revised Dating Of Alamo And Some Other Late Devonian Impacts In Relation To Resulting Mass Extinction, 68th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting (2005) Most impact craters, such as the Kellwasser-aged Alamo and the Hangenberg-aged Woodleigh, cannot generally be dated with sufficient precision to link them to the event; others dated precisely are not contemporaneous with the extinction. Although some minor features of meteoric impact have been observed in places (iridium anomalies and microspherules), these were probably caused by other factors. Supernova event A more recent explanation presents a nearby supernova explosion as the cause for the specific Hangenberg event, which marks the boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, or even for a sequence of events covering several millions of years towards the end of the Devonian period. This could offer a possible explanation for the dramatic drop in atmospheric ozone that could have permitted massive ultraviolet damage to the genetic material of lifeforms, triggering a mass extinction. Recent research offers evidence of ultraviolet damage to pollen and spores over many thousands of years during this event as observed in the fossil record and that, in turn, points to a possible long-term destruction of the ozone layer. A supernova explosion is an alternative explanation to global temperature rise, that could account for the drop in atmospheric ozone. Detecting either of the long-lived, extra- terrestrial radioisotopes 146Sm or 244Pu in one or more end-Devonian extinction strata would confirm a supernova origin. Plant evolution During the Devonian, land plants underwent a hugely significant phase of evolution. Their maximum height went from 30 cm at the start of the Devonian, to Archaeopterids, see Beck (1981) in Algeo 1998 at the end of the period. This increase in height was made possible by the evolution of advanced vascular systems, which permitted the growth of complex branching and rooting systems. In conjunction with this, the development of seeds permitted reproduction and dispersal in areas which were not waterlogged, allowing plants to colonise previously inhospitable inland and upland areas. The two factors combined to greatly magnify the role of plants on the global scale. In particular, Archaeopteris forests expanded rapidly during the closing stages of the Devonian. =Effect on weathering= These tall trees required deep rooting systems to acquire water and nutrients, and provide anchorage. These systems broke up the upper layers of bedrock and stabilized a deep layer of soil, which would have been of the order of metres thick. In contrast, early Devonian plants bore only rhizoids and rhizomes that could penetrate no more than a few centimeters. The mobilization of a large portion of soil had a huge effect: soil promotes weathering, the chemical breakdown of rocks, releasing ions which are nutrients for plants and algae. The relatively sudden input of nutrients into river water may have caused eutrophication and subsequent anoxia. For example, during an algal bloom, organic material formed at the surface can sink at such a rate that decomposing organisms use up all available oxygen by decaying them, creating anoxic conditions and suffocating bottom-dwelling fish. The fossil reefs of the Frasnian were dominated by stromatolites and (to a lesser degree) corals‚Äîorganisms which only thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Therefore, the postulated influx of high levels of nutrients may have caused an extinction. Anoxic conditions correlate better with biotic crises than phases of cooling, suggesting anoxia may have played the dominant role in extinction. =Effect on = The \\"greening\\" of the continents occurred during the Devonian. The covering of the planet's continents with massive photosynthesizing land plants in the first forests may have reduced CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Since is a greenhouse gas, reduced levels might have helped produce a chillier climate. Evidence such as glacial deposits in northern Brazil (near the Devonian South Pole) suggests widespread glaciation at the end of the Devonian, as a broad continental mass covered the polar region. A cause of the extinctions may have been an episode of global cooling, following the mild climate of the Devonian period. The Hangenberg event has also been linked to glaciation in the tropics equivalent to that of the Pleistocene ice age. The weathering of silicate rocks also draws down CO2 from the atmosphere. This acted together with the burial of organic matter to decrease atmospheric CO2 concentrations from about 15 to three times present levels. Carbon in the form of plant matter would be produced on prodigious scales, and given the right conditions, could be stored and buried, eventually producing vast coal measures (e.g. in China) which locked the carbon out of the atmosphere and into the lithosphere.Carbon locked in Devonian coal, the earliest of Earth's coal deposits, is currently being returned to the atmosphere. This reduction in atmospheric would have caused global cooling and resulted in at least one period of late Devonian glaciation (and subsequent sea level fall),(Caputo 1985; Berner 1992, 1994) in Algeo 1998 probably fluctuating in intensity alongside the 40ka Milankovic cycle. The continued drawdown of organic carbon eventually pulled the Earth out of its Greenhouse Earth state into the Icehouse that continued throughout the Carboniferous and Permian.  Magmatism  Magmatism was suggested as a cause of the Late Devonian extinction in 2002. The end of the Devonian Period had extremely widespread trap magmatism and rifting in the Russian and Siberian platforms, which were situated above the hot mantle plumes and suggested as a cause of the Frasnian / Famennian and end-Devonian extinctions. The Viluy and Pripyat- Dnieper-Donets large igneous provinces were suggested to correlate with the Frasnian / Famennian extinction and the Kola and Timan-Pechora magmatism was suggested to correspond to the end Devonian-Carboniferous extinction. Most recently, scientists have confirmed a correlation between Viluy traps (in the Vilyuysk region) on the Siberian Craton and the Kellwasser extinction by 40Ar/39Ar dating. The Viluy Large igneous province covers most of the present day north-eastern margin of the Siberian Platform. The triple-junction rift system was formed during the Devonian Period; the Viluy rift is the western remaining branch of the system and two other branches form the modern margin of the Siberian Platform. Volcanic rocks are covered with post Late Devonian‚ÄìEarly Carboniferous sediments. Volcanic rocks, dyke belts, and sills that cover more than 320,000 km2, and a gigantic amount of magmatic material (more than 1 million km3) formed in the Viluy branch. Ages show that the two volcanic phase hypotheses are well supported and the weighted mean ages of each volcanic phase are and Ma, or and Ma, which the first volcanic phase is in agreement with the age of Ma proposed for the Kellwasser event. However, the second volcanic phase is slightly older than Hangenberg event which place at Ma. Viluy magmatism may have injected enough and into the atmosphere to have generated a destabilised greenhouse and ecosystem, causing rapid global cooling, sea-level falls and marine anoxia occur during Kellwasser black shale deposition.  Other suggestions  Other mechanisms put forward to explain the extinctions include tectonic-driven climate change, sea-level change, and oceanic overturning. These have all been discounted because they are unable to explain the duration, selectivity, and periodicity of the extinctions. Another overlooked contributor could be the now extinct Cerberean Caldera which was active in the Late Devonian period and thought to have undergone a super eruption approximately 374 Million years ago. Remains of this caldera can be found in the modern day state of Victoria, Australia. Effects The extinction events were accompanied by widespread oceanic anoxia; that is, a lack of oxygen, prohibiting decay and allowing the preservation of organic matter. This, combined with the ability of porous reef rocks to hold oil, has led to Devonian rocks being an important source of oil, especially in the USA. Biological impact The Kellwasser event and most other Later Devonian pulses primarily affected the marine community, and had a greater effect on shallow warm-water organisms than on cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by the Kellwasser event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the stromatoporoids, and the rugose and tabulate corals. Reefs of the later Devonian were dominated by sponges and calcifying bacteria, producing structures such as oncolites and stromatolites. The collapse of the reef system was so stark that bigger reef-building by new families of carbonate-secreting organisms, the modern scleractinian or \\"stony\\" corals, did not recover until the Mesozoic era. Further taxa to be starkly affected include the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, conodonts, and acritarchs. Both graptolites and cystoids disappeared during this event. The surviving taxa show morphological trends through the event. Trilobites evolved smaller eyes in the run-up to the Kellwasser event, with eye size increasing again afterwards. This suggests vision was less important around the event, perhaps due to increasing water depth or turbidity. The brims of trilobites (i.e. the rims of their heads) also expanded across this period. The brims are thought to have served a respiratory purpose, and the increasing anoxia of waters led to an increase in their brim area in response. The shape of conodonts' feeding apparatus varied with the oxygen isotope ratio, and thus with the sea water temperature; this may relate to them occupying different trophic levels as nutrient input changed. As with most extinction events, specialist taxa occupying small niches were harder hit than generalists. The Hangenberg event affected both marine and freshwater communities. This mass extinction affected ammonites and trilobites, as well as jawed vertebrates, including tetrapod ancestors.Korn, 2004 The Hangenberg is linked to the extinction of 44% of high-level vertebrate clades, including all placoderms and most sarcopterygians, and the complete turnover of the vertebrate biota. 97% of vertebrate species disappeared, with only smaller forms surviving. After the event only sharks less than a meter and most fishes and tetrapods less than 10 centimeters remained, and it would take 40 million years before they started to increase in size again. This led to the establishment of the modern vertebrate fauna in the Carboniferous, consisting mostly of actinopterygians, chondrichthyans, and tetrapods. Romer's gap, a 15 million- year hiatus in the early Carboniferous tetrapod record, has been linked to this event. Also, the poor Famennian record for marine invertebrates suggests that some of the losses attributed to the Kellwasser event likely actually occurred during the Hangenberg extinction.Foote, 2005 Magnitude The late Devonian crash in biodiversity was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous. A recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22% of all the 'families' of marine animals (largely invertebrates) were eliminated. The family is a great unit, and to lose so many signifies a deep loss of ecosystem diversity. On a smaller scale, 57% of genera and at least 75% of species did not survive into the Carboniferous. These latter estimatesThe species estimate is the toughest to assess and most likely to be adjusted. need to be treated with a degree of caution, as the estimates of species loss depend on surveys of Devonian marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, so it is difficult to estimate the effects of differential preservation and sampling biases during the Devonian.

A large church, St Patrick's Catholic Church of Monti, built in 1870, actually predates the town's existence. A town post office was built in either 1882 or 1885.Post Offices. PostalHistory.com Warner and Foote's 1886 map of Newton Township shows Monti. The plat map shows six houses, two schools, the Catholic church, and the post office/store. Postal service was discontinued in 1902, with the introduction of Rural Free Delivery; mail was routed through nearby Masonville. The nearby villages of Newtonville and Kiene were also located in Newton Township. In 1905, the Chicago, Anamosa and Northern Railway was built through Monti and Kiene . The railroad sparked renewed interest in Monti, and a number of new buildings were constructed in 1905. The townsite was platted that year, and St. Patrick's Church registered 400 members. Monti was a sizeable community in 1913 when E.R. Hensley took a panoramic photograph of the 70 students in St Patrick's confirmation class . However, years of rural migration gradually shrank the area's population, emptying Monti and its nearby sister communities; the town's population began to dwindle. The CAN Railway was sold for scrap after World War I. The remains of the railroad grade can still be seen today at the north edge of the hamlet. This is a panoramic photo of the 1913 confirmation class at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Monti. During the early-to-mid-20th Century, Monti attracted some attention from the ornithology community. Noted ornithologist Fred J. Pierce reported that a large tract of timber 1 mile (2 km) \\"southeast of the village of Monti, in the southeastern corner of the county\\" was a particularly good area for birdwatching. In a 1930 paper, Pierce noted the unusual (for the area) birds he had spotted between 1923 and 1928. Among these were one specimen each of the ruffed grouse (1923), cerulean warbler (1927), and in 1928 a yellow-bellied flycatcher and a Connecticut warbler. As late as 1945, the Monti woods were home to at least 62 species of bird; the area was used as one of fourteen birding stations in the state. The woods contained the largest confirmed populations of gray-cheeked thrushes, bobolinks, eastern vesper sparrows, eastern field sparrows, and ruby-crowned kinglets in the state during the Spring of 1945. (These same woods were the scene of a gruesome hanging of an unidentified man in July 1900). In 1966, the Monti Consolidated School District was disbanded. The northern portions of the district went to East Buchanan Community School District, while the southern areas were ceded to North Linn Community School District. In 1998, RAGBRAI, a massive cross- state bicycle ride across the state, passed through the hamlet.Cedar Falls to Monticello- 92 miles and 1777 Feet of Climbing. main.com Monti today Monti Community Center Today there are fewer than two dozen residents in this dwindling farm community.

Known to the Kriegsmarine as Schiff 45, to the Royal Navy she was named Raider B. After completing one successful raid in the South Pacific, she was sunk by British a motor torpedo boat in October 1942 whilst attempting to break out into the Atlantic on another. Construction and conversion Launched on 16 January 1937 as the merchant ship Ems at Deschimag A.G. Weser shipyard in Bremen for Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL), she was requisitioned at the start of the Second World War in 1939, converted into an auxiliary cruiser at Howaldtswerke in Hamburg, and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on 2 June 1940. The ship was 115.5 m long and 15.3 m wide, had a draught of 6.5 m, and registered . She was powered by two diesel engines that gave her a speed of up to 16 knots (30 km/h). As a commerce raider, Komet was armed with six 15 cm guns, one 7.5 cm gun, one 3.7 cm and four 2 cm AA guns, as well as six torpedo tubes. She also carried a small 15-ton fast boat (\\"Meteorit\\", of the \\"LS2\\" class) intended to lay mines and an Arado 196 A1 seaplane. Drawing of the Komet. Note the Arado 196 seaplane First raid voyage=Breakout into the Pacific After a long period of negotiations between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviets agreed to provide Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route through which Germany could access both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.Philbin III, Tobias R., The Lure of Neptune: German-Soviet Naval Collaboration and Ambitions, 1919‚Äì1941, University of South Carolina Press, 1994, , pages 131‚Äì7 Although the two countries had signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact (with secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe) and an undisclosed commercial agreement (extensive military and civilian aid pact), the Soviet Union still wished to maintain the veneer of being neutral, and secrecy thus was required. Initially, the two countries had agreed to send 26 ships, including four armed merchant cruisers, but because of a variety of difficulties, this was soon reduced to just one vessel, the Komet, the smallest one of the units that Germany wanted to use as auxiliary raiders. Prior to being sent on the Northern Sea Route, the Komet was equipped with a specially strengthened bow and a propeller suitable for navigating through ice.Philbin III, Tobias R., The Lure of Neptune: German-Soviet Naval Collaboration and Ambitions, 1919‚Äì1941, University of South Carolina Press, 1994, , page 138‚Äì39 Under the command of Kapit√§n zur See (later Konteradmiral) Robert Eyssen, HSK7 departed for her first raiding voyage from Gotenhafen (now Gdynia in Poland), on 3 July 1940 with a crew of 270. The ship stopped in Bergen on 9 July to refuel and resupply.Philbin III, Tobias R., The Lure of Neptune: German-Soviet Naval Collaboration and Ambitions, 1919‚Äì1941, University of South Carolina Press, 1994, , page 139 Then she started again her route towards the northern seas. With the consent of the then supposedly neutral Soviet Union, Komet initially made her way along the Norwegian coast disguised as the Soviet icebreaker Semyon Dezhnev. While waiting in Teriberka Bay in July and August because of Soviet security concerns, she took the fake name the Donau. With assistance from the Soviet icebreaker Lenin, she passed through the several Arctic Ocean passages in August.Philbin III, Tobias R., The Lure of Neptune: German-Soviet Naval Collaboration and Ambitions, 1919‚Äì1941, University of South Carolina Press, 1994, , pages 140‚Äì1 She also later received help from the Joseph Stalin. In early September, the Komet crossed the Bering Strait into the Pacific Ocean. Komet disguised as the Manyo Maru The passage was an amazing achievement and would have ended in disaster had it not been for the Soviets, whose help had come at a price: 950,000 Reichsmarks. For many of the German crew, this was their first experience in Arctic waters. Movements of the three German ships in December 1940 and January 1941 Once in the Pacific, Eyssen sailed down to the Japanese island of Lamutrik and met the Orion and Kulmerland in mid-October. After a conference on strategy, the three captains decided to work together, concentrating on the New Zealand to Panama passage taken by most of the Allied merchant ships. They decided on Japanese disguises ‚Äì Komet and Kulmerland had the names Manyo Maru and Tokio Maru painted on their hulls. Raiding in South Pacific waters In early November, Komet resupplied and refueled in Japan, disguised as the Japanese merchantman Manio Maru. She operated with the Orion, disguised as Mayebashi Maru and the supply ship Kulmerland, posing as the Tokio Maru. Together with the other two ships, on 25 November she sunk the coaster Holmwood and two days later the passenger liner Rangitane, raiding her precious food load. By that time, Komet had already been at sea for 140 days and Eyssen admitted in his war diary that he had become depressed and frustrated at not having encountered the enemy.Rangitane story During December, Komet and Orion casually met and sunk in the waters surrounding Nauru Island five Allied merchant ships, with a combined tonnage of about 41,000 tons, that had been waiting off the island to load phosphate (of which Komet sank three).John Asmussen, Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser) Komet Retrieved 16 October 2010Rafal Kaczmarek (in Polish): Korsarski rejs wsr√≥d lod√≥w obu biegun√≥w [Corsair raid through ice of both poles] in: Okrety Wojenne Nr. 11 (1994 r.), p.32‚Äì39 Between 6 and 7 December the Komet sunk the merchant ships Triona, Vinni and Komata,Robinson, pp. 128‚Äì130 taking more than 500 prisoners, that were landed a few days after on Emirau Island.Duffy, p. 134 Attack on Nauru At the end of December Eyssen planned to lay a minefield at the entrance of the Rabaul's harbour. He was forced to abandon his plan due to an engine failure on the Meteorit boat that was designed for the mission. He, therefore, decided to set course towards Nauru, wanting to land his troops and occupy the phosphate processing and loading facilities on the island. The bad weather though convinced Eyssen to change his plans into a direct attack to the island infrastructures. On 27 December 1940 the Komet sent a warning to the island and announced that the attack was about to begin. She shelled and heavily damaged the loading plants and mooring buoys of the port. The bombing lasted an hour, and it caused the loss of 13,000 tons of oil. The Nauru phosphate extraction facilities did not resume their pre-war output levels until the end of the conflict. The action caused also the promotion of Eyssen to Konteradmiral on 1 January 1941. After the Nauru attack (probably the major German success in the pacific operational area during the war) the Komet received the order to set a new course towards south, crossing the Indian Ocean and scouting the presence of Allied whalers.Robinson, p. 200 After a few months with no success, the ship reached the shores of Antarctica on 16 February 1941; later on 6 March she had a stop on the French Kerguelen Islands and had there a brief meeting with the other German auxiliary ship Pinguin. Operations in the Atlantic Ocean and Galapagos Islands The hunt for allied ships in the Indian Ocean had no success; after some months, Eyssen sailed towards the Panama Canal, hoping to find more convoys in the Pan- American Security Zone, recently opened to military actions from the Kriegsmarine high command. From 14 July 1941 until 25 July the Komet was resupplied by the German freighter Anneliese Essberger near the Tuamotu Archipelago.Waters, p. 51 At this time, the Komet was disguised as the Osaka Shosen Kaisha line Ryoku Maru. On 14 August the ship met near the Gal√°pagos Islands the British freighter Australind and sunk it.Duffy, p. 138 Three days later the German cruiser met the Dutch 7,300 ton freighter Kota Nopan, loading more than 2,000 tons of tin and manganese. Due to her precious load, the supply ship was spared from sinking and captured. On 19 August Komet met the freighter Devon and sunk it. Except for some casualties, the German sailors saved the crew members of the enemy ships, that became prisoners of war.Bertke, p. 205 Pacific Ocean and return voyage After these three successes, Eyssen decided to move out of the area, fearful of the reaction of the Allied navy. Komet headed towards New Zealand accompanied by the captured Kota Nopan. At the end of September she had a brief meeting with the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis and transferred to her a part of the prisoners and cargo loadDuffy, p. 30 Komet then received the order to return to Germany. The ship set a new course towards Cape Horn, sailing at a slower speed in the Atlantic Ocean disguised as the Portuguese freighter S. Thom√©. The captured Kopa Notan was sent as a prize to Bordeaux, in occupied France, arriving there on 17 November. Komet reached the French port of Cherbourg on 26 November, disguised as the freighter Sperrbrecher 52. The day after she had a short stop in Le Havre and then sailed towards Germany. Some British torpedo bombers spotted her in the English Channel but were not able to sink her. After having landed all her prisoners of war at Cuxhaven, the auxiliary cruiser finally reached Hamburg on 30 November 1941Bertke, p. 368 after a voyage of 516 days and about . The ship had sunk seven ships (two in conjunction with the raider Orion) for a total of 41,568 tons. Second raid The Komet was prepared for a second raiding voyage in October 1942, after 11 months of complete repair. Only two of her original officers had remained on board and Kapit√§n zur See Ulrich Brocksien took over command. On 7 October 1942 the raider, disguised as a minesweeper, departed from the Dutch-occupied port of Vlissingen with the objective to reach the Atlantic Ocean. After a short stay in Dunquerque, on 12 October the Komet set course towards Le Havre. Initial attempts by the Royal Navy to attack the ship in the Straits of Dover had failed. On 13 October, Komet sailed from Le Havre with an escort of 4 or 5 torpedo boats. Unsure of the exact route that the German ship would follow, and aware of the fast speed of the German vessels, 4 groups of warships were assembled to make an interception to the West of the Cherbourg Peninsula. Group A, consisted of Cottesmore, Quorn, Albrighton, Glaisdale and Eskdale. Two flotillas of MTBs made up Groups C and D. These 3 groups headed for a position near Cap de la Hague. Group B (the destroyers Brocklesby, Fernie, Tynedale and Krakowiak) were further West, near the Channel Islands. The German convoy were spotted by a Coastal Command aircraft in the middle of the Baie de la Seine, travelling at 16 knots, and groups A C and D hurried to get into position. In the particularly dark night and moderately rough sea conditions, the MTB flotillas became separated from the destroyers. At just before 1:00 am, Cottesmore sighted the German vessels. The allied ships fired star shells to illuminate the target and then opened fire. To the British attackers, the Germans appeared taken completely by surprise and in the confusion, opened fire on each other, until eventually firing torpedoes at the allied ships (all of which missed). Two of the escorts were on fire and the other German ships turned inshore to gain the protection of the coastal artillery batteries. The most junior Commanding Officer in group D was Sub-Lt R Q Drayson, who had just taken over in MTB 236 after the previous C.O. had gone sick. As junior, Drayson was last in the line of MTBs and became separated from the rest of the flotilla as they crossed the Channel. Drayson continued independently to Cap de La Hague. None of the other allied MTBs arrived in the area. After a while, Drayson saw star shells and tracer as the battle started and increased speed. He decided to approach the action from the shoreward side to catch any German vessel trying to get away. This put MTB 236 in position to see Komet illuminated by a star shell. The German ship was travelling at more than 15 knots, exchanging fire with the allied destroyers who were in pursuit. Drayson's MTB was ahead of the German ship and crept in at slow speed to fire 2 torpedoes at a range of 500 yards. MTB 236 immediately turned away and \\"crash-started\\" her main engines to escape under cover of a smoke-screen. Komet had now sighted her and switched fire. Within a few seconds, the 2 torpedoes struck, followed by a huge secondary explosion. The force of this blast lifted the stern of MTB 236 out of the water and put out of action 2 of the boat's 3 engines, leaving her to return home at reduced speed. Group B had moved to join the battle and engaged some of the remaining German vessels, but with the main target gone and shore battery fire now becoming more accurate, broke off the action and returned home. Komet sank with no survivors. Sub-Lt Drayson was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his part in the action. The allied forces experienced only 2 minor casualties, despite being under heavy fire.Bob Drayson (Obituary) dated 26 October 2008 at telegraph.co.uk/news.

At ground floor level two unfluted ionic columns at each corner support a decorative cornice. The columns are decorative only, and appear to serve no structural purpose. The design of the towers creates the impression that the building was once more of a miniature cathedral than a parish church. However, the main body of the church was small and occupied the (now empty) site between the two towers. It was a single storey structure with a simple hipped roof and entrance porticos at its centre. This was the part of Adam's church which was demolished in 1870.

They are popular in the United Kingdom, where they are often referred to simply as 'car boots'. Some scientific research has studied people's shopping habits at car boot sales. These groups of scientists see the rotation of surplus household stock as essential as it prevents waste and disposal costs, and also produces a small community where thriftiness and entrepreneurship flourish. The term \\"car boot sale\\" refers to the selling of items from a car's boot. Although a small proportion of sellers are professional traders selling goods, or indeed browsing for items to buy, most of the goods on sale are used personal possessions. Car boot sales are a way of attracting a large group of people in one place to recycle useful but unwanted domestic items that otherwise might have been thrown away.

Car boot sales are also very popular in parts of Australia, and have a growing presence in mainland Europe. Locations Car boot sales are held in a variety of locations, including the grounds of schools and other community buildings, or in grass fields or car parks. Usually they take place at a weekend, often on a Sunday. Sellers will typically pay a small fee for their pitch and arrive with their goods in the boot of their car. Usually the items are then unpacked onto folding trestle tables, a blanket or tarpaulin, or the ground. Entry to the general public is usually free, although sometimes a small admission charge is made. Advertised opening times are often not strictly adhered to: often the nature of the venue makes it impossible to prevent keen bargain hunters from wandering in as soon as the first stallholders arrive. History It has been said that Father Harry Clarke, a Catholic priest from Stockport, introduced the car boot sale to the UK as a charity fundraiser, after seeing a similar event or trunk fair in Canada, while on holiday there in the early 1970s.

For much of its existence, it has been allied with Agudat Yisrael under the name United Torah Judaism.  History  Degel HaTorah was founded in 1988 as a splinter from Agudat Israel. Its establishment by Rabbi Elazar Shach was due to ongoing policy disputes with the Hasidic rabbis within Agudat Yisrael. In the 1988 elections, the party won two seats, taken by Moshe Gafni and Avraham Ravitz, and joined Yitzhak Shamir's coalition government. For the 1992 elections, the party allied itself with Agudat Yisrael under the name United Torah Judaism. Although the party split shortly before the 1996 elections, they re-united for the elections. This was repeated for the 1999, 2006, and 2009 elections. Currently, the party has three MKs (of the seven representing United Torah Judaism): Moshe Gafni, Uri Maklev, Ya'akov Asher. Yitzchak Pindrus joined after a Knesset slot was opened, following Gimmel's taking advantage of the Norwegian Law.  Ideology  A Degel HaTorah gathering. (L-R) Rabbis Shlomo Shimshon Karelitz, Chaim Kanievsky, Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, Elazar Shach Degel HaTorah represents the \\"Lithuanian wing\\" of the non-Hasidic Haredim (known by some as \\"Mitnagdim\\"), as opposed to the Hasidic-dominated Agudat Yisrael party. Sometimes, the parties compete against each other; at other times, they join forces within a political alliance called United Torah Judaism (UTJ) (Yahadut HaTorah in Hebrew). In Jerusalem, it was based on a long-standing argument against a 1989 agreement between Degel HaTorah's then-spiritual leader, Rabbi Elazar Shach, the venerated Rosh yeshiva of the famed Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak, and the spiritual leader of Agudat Yisrael, the Pnei Menachem of Gur, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter. The deal, based on the demographics of the time, stated that when UTJ would join forces, Aguda would receive 60% of the seats, and Degel 40%. This agreement was first contested in May 2016, when Degel's Knesset leader, Moshe Gafni, demanded that the Deputy Education Minister, Meir Porush, resign from the Knesset, in order to give Degel 3 out of the 6 seats held by UTJ. Porush was able to keep his ministerial position, under the 2015 so-called Norwegian Law. In 2018, Degel reached a 50-50 agreement with Aguda, with an Aguda representative as the Chairman of the party. Degel HaTorah's rabbinical arbiter (\\"posek\\") was, until his death in 2012, centenarian Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv of Jerusalem.

Hamon was born at Plouha, in today's C√¥tes-d'Armor d√©partement, in France. At an early age he was intended for the priesthood, and placed under the care of the brothers Lamennais, but his strong desire to become a painter finally triumphed over family opposition, and in 1840 he left Plouha for Paris--his sole resources being a pension of five hundred francs, granted him for one year only by the municipality of his native town. At Paris Hamon received valuable advice and encouragement from Paul Delaroche and Charles Gleyre, and in 1848 he made his appearance at the Salon with \\"Le Tombeau du Christ\\" (Mus√©e de Marseille), and a decorative work, Dessus de Porte. The works which he exhibited in 1849 Une Affiche romaine, L'√âgalit√© au s√©rail, and Perroquet jasant avec deux jeunes filles obtained no marked success. His lack of success led Hamon to accept a job as a designree in the S√®vres porcelein factory, but an enamelled casket designed by him attracted notice at the London International Exhibition of 1851. He received a medal, and, inspired by his success, left his post to try his chances again at the Salon of 1852. \\"La Com√©die humaine\\", which he then exhibited, turned the tide of his fortune, and Ma s≈ìur n'y est pas (purchased by the emperor Napoleon III) obtained for its author a third-class medal in 1853. At the Paris International Exhibition of 1855, when Hamon re-exhibited the casket of 1851, together with several vases and pictures of which L'Amour et son troupeau, Ce n'est pas moi, and Une Gardeuse d'enfants were the most important, he received a second class medal, and the ribbon of the legion of honor. In the following year he was absent in the East, and in 1857 he reappeared with Boutique √† quatre sous, Papillon encha√Æn√©, Cantharide esclave, D√©videuses, etc., in all ten pictures; L'Amour en visite was contributed to the Salon of 1859, and Vierge de Lesbos, Tutelle, La Voli√®re, L'Escamoteur and La S≈ìur a√Æn√©e were all seen in 1861. Hamon now spent some time in Italy, chiefly at Capri, whence in 1864 he sent to Paris L'Aurore and Un Jour de fian√ßailles. The influence of Italy was also evident in Les Muses √† Pomp√©i, his sole contribution to the Salon of 1866, a work which enjoyed great popularity and was re-exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1867, together with, La Promenade and six other pictures of previous years. His last work, Le Triste Rivage, appeared at the Salon of 1873. It was painted at Saint-Rapha√´l, where Hamon had finally settled in a little house on the shores of the Mediterranean, close by Alphonse Karr's famous garden. In this house he died on 29 May 1874. A school in his home town of Plouha was named after him, and a monument was erected to him by the Blues of Brittany.

The Arthur Kill shoreline north of the expressway--most commonly called Port Ivory--is considered part of the North Shore, while the land along the Arthur Kill south of Fresh Kills is generally included within the South Shore. While only one residential neighborhood--Travis--can actually be found on the West Shore, other place names are used to identify locations to the north of Travis, chief among them Bloomfield and Chelsea. A study by the New York City Department of City Planning also identified Howland Hook/Arlington, Rossville, Woodrow, Charleston and Tottenville as being part of the West Shore, along with Fresh Kills Park.\\"Staten Island West Shore - Land Use & Transportation Study: Introduction\\", 'New York City Department of City Planning.

Accessed June 2, 2009.), most notably oil refining and construction; in the latter example, much property in the region is devoted to the storage of heavy equipment, such as cement mixers. These have led to some incidents, such as the 1973 Staten Island gas explosion, which killed 40 people. In addition, a few horse stables and riding academies exist in the area, which is the least densely populated section of Staten Island. Many species of migratory birds can be found in the area, especially on nearby Prall's Island. In the 1990s, a string of large office complexes were built along South Avenue, which begins in Mariners Harbor on the North Shore, and ends in Travis; other businesses arrived later, including several hotels, Hilton Garden Inn in 2001, Hampton Inn & Suites in 2007, Comfort Inn and Holiday Inn Express in 2010.

Visual examination The patient and/or health care worker in the office or at the bedside is able to make some important observations. * Color * Texture/consistency‚Äîformed * Classify type of feces (diagnostic triad for irritable bowel syndrome) based on Bristol stool scale Cancer screening Fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test are the most common stool tests to diagnose many conditions that caused by bleeding in the gastrointestinal system, including colorectal cancer or stomach cancer. Cancers, and to a lesser extent, precancerous lesions, shed abnormal cells into the stool. Cancers and precancerous lesions (polyps) that are ulcerated or rubbed by passing stool also may shed blood into the stool, which can be identified by a hemoglobin assay. The American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended colorectal cancer screening with a fecal immunochemical test every year, or a multi-target stool DNA test for every three years from the age of age 45. Other options include a sigmoidoscopy or virtual colonoscopy (CT colonography) for every five years or a colonoscopy for every 10 years. Fecal occult blood test is no longer recommended due to the high false-positive rate as well as the dietary and pharmaceutical restrictions. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) issued an update to the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) for 2017, while the guideline remains for the patients aged 50 or over. A multi-target stool DNA test was approved in August 2014 by the FDA as a screening test for non-symptomatic, average-risk adults 50 years or older. A 2017 study found this testing to be less cost effective compared to colonoscopy or fecal occult blood testing. Three-year multi-target stool DNA test has been estimated to cost $11,313 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with no screening. Microbiology tests Parasitic diseases such as ascariasis, hookworm, strongyloidiasis and whipworm can be diagnosed by examining stools under a microscope for the presence of worm larvae or eggs. Some bacterial diseases can be detected with a stool culture. Toxins from bacteria such as Clostridium difficile (\\"C. diff.\\") can also be identified. Viruses such as rotavirus can also be found in stools. Chemical tests A fecal pH test may be used to determine lactose intolerance or the presence of an infection.

The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, silk, or cotton.  Historical definition  Historically, camisole referred to jackets of various kinds, including overshirts (worn under a doublet or bodice), women's n√©glig√©es, and sleeved jackets worn by men.  Modern usage  Lycra led to closer fitting camisoles in the late 2000s and the 2010s. In modern usage, a camisole or cami is a loose-fitting sleeveless undergarment which covers the top part of the body but is shorter than a chemise. A camisole normally extends to the waist but is sometimes cropped to expose the midriff, or extended to cover the entire pelvic region. Camisoles are manufactured from light materials, commonly cotton-based, occasionally satin or silk, or stretch fabrics such as lycra, nylon, or spandex. A camisole typically has thin \\"spaghetti straps\\" and can be worn over a brassiere or without one. Since 1989, some camisoles have come with a built-in underwire bra or other support which eliminates the need for a bra among those who prefer not to wear one. Starting around the 2000s, camisoles have been known to be used as outerwear. A variety of sleeveless body shaping undergarments have been derived from the camisole shape, offering medium control of the bust, waist and/or abdomen. Such control camisoles are the most casual of shaping garments, covering the torso from above the chest to at or below the waist. They look similar to tight-fitting cotton or silk camisoles, but the straps are usually wider, the hems longer, and the stretchy, shiny fabric provides a smoothing touch.

Different OS-specific implementations allow more types than what POSIX requires (e.g. Solaris doors). A file's type can be identified by the \`ls -l\` command, which displays the type in the first character of the file system permissions field. For regular files, Unix does not impose or provide any internal file structure; therefore, their structure and interpretation is entirely dependent on the software using them. However, the \`file\` command can be used to determine what type of data they contain.  Representations = Numeric  In the stat structure, file type and permissions (the mode) are stored together in a bit field, which has a size of at least 12 bits (3 bits to specify the type among the seven possible types of files; 9 bits for permissions). The layout for permissions is defined by POSIX to be at the least-significant 9 bits, but the rest is undefined. By convention, the mode is a 16-bit value written out as a six-digit octal number without a leading zero. The format part occupies the lead 4-bits (2 digits), and \\"10\\" ( in binary) usually stands for a regular file. The mid 3 bits (1 digit) are usually used for setuid, setgid, and sticky. The last part is already defined by POSIX to contain the permission. An example is \\"100644\\" for a typical file. This format can be seen in git, tar, and ar, among other places. The type of a file can be tested using macros like \`S_ISDIR\`. Such a check is usually performed by masking the mode with \`S_IFMT\` (often the octal number \\"170000\\" for the lead 4 bits convention) and checking whether the result matches \`S_IFDIR\`. \`S_IFMT\` is not a core POSIX concept, but a X/Open System Interfaces (XSI) extension; systems conforming to only POSIX may use some other methods.  Mode string  Take for example one line in the \`ls -l\` output: drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 1 1970 home POSIX specifies the format of the output for the long format (\`-l\` option). In particular, the first field (before the first space) is dubbed the \\"file mode string\\" and its first character describes the file type. The rest of this string indicates the file permissions. Therefore, in the example, the mode string is \`drwxr-xr-x\`: the file type is \`d\` (directory) and the permissions are \`rwxr-xr-x\`.  Examples of implementations  The GNU coreutils version of \`ls\` uses a call to \`filemode()\`, a glibc function (exposed in the gnulib library) to get the mode string. FreeBSD uses a simpler approach but allows a smaller number of file types. Regular file Regular files show up in \`ls -l\` with a hyphen-minus \`-\` in the mode field: $ ls -l /etc/passwd -rw-r--r-- ... /etc/passwd Directory The most common special file is the directory. The layout of a directory file is defined by the filesystem used. As several filesystems are available under Unix, both native and non-native, there is no one directory file layout. A directory is marked with a \`d\` as the first letter in the mode field in the output of \`ls -dl\` or \`stat\`, e.g. $ ls -dl / drwxr-xr-x 26 root root 4096 Sep 22 09:29 / $ stat / File: \\"/\\" Size: 4096 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 directory Device: 802h/2050d Inode: 128 Links: 26 Access: (0755/drwxr- xr-x) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root) ... Symbolic link A symbolic link is a reference to another file. This special file is stored as a textual representation of the referenced file's path (which means the destination may be a relative path, or may not exist at all). A symbolic link is marked with an \`l\` (lower case \`L\`) as the first letter of the mode string, e.g. lrwxrwxrwx ... termcap -> /usr/share/misc/termcap lrwxrwxrwx ... S03xinetd -> ../init.d/xinetd FIFO (named pipe) One of the strengths of Unix has always been inter-process communication. Among the facilities provided by the OS are pipes, which connect the output of one process to the input of another. This is fine if both processes exist in the same parent process space, started by the same user, but there are circumstances where the communicating processes must use FIFOs, here referred to as named pipes. One such circumstance occurs when the processes must be executed under different user names and permissions. Named pipes are special files that can exist anywhere in the file system. They can be created with the command \`mkfifo\` as in \`mkfifo mypipe\`. A named pipe is marked with a \`p\` as the first letter of the mode string, e.g. prw-rw---- ... mypipe Socket A socket is a special file used for inter- process communication, which enables communication between two processes. In addition to sending data, processes can send file descriptors across a Unix domain socket connection using the \`sendmsg()\` and \`recvmsg()\` system calls. Unlike named pipes which allow only unidirectional data flow, sockets are fully duplex-capable. A socket is marked with an \`s\` as the first letter of the mode string, e.g. srwxrwxrwx /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 Device file (block, character) In Unix, almost all things are handled as files and have a location in the file system, even hardware devices like hard drives. The great exception is network devices, which do not turn up in the file system but are handled separately. Device files are used to apply access rights to the devices and to direct operations on the files to the appropriate device drivers. Unix makes a distinction between character devices and block devices. The distinction is roughly as follows: * Character devices provide only a serial stream of input or accept a serial stream of output * Block devices are randomly accessible Although, for example, disk partitions may have both character devices that provide un-buffered random access to blocks on the partition and block devices that provide buffered random access to blocks on the partition. A character device is marked with a \`c\` as the first letter of the mode string. Likewise, a block device is marked with a \`b\`, e.g. crw------- ... /dev/null brw-rw---- ... /dev/sda Door A door is a special file for inter-process communication between a client and server, currently implemented only in Solaris. A door is marked with a \`D\` (upper case) as the first letter of the mode string, e.g. Dr--r--r-- ... name_service_door See also * file (command) References Unix file system technology ","title":"Unix file types"},{"id":"1350683","text":"A n√©glig√©e on a mannequin The negligee or n√©glig√©e ( ; ), also known in French as d√©shabill√© (), is a form of see-through clothing for women consisting of a sheer usually long dressing gown. It is a form of nightgown intended for wear at night and in the bedroom. It was introduced in France in the 18th century, where it mimicked the heavy head-to-toe style of women's day dresses of the time. By the 1920s, the negligee began to mimic women's satin single-layer evening dress of the period. The term \\"negligee\\" was used on a Royal Doulton run of ceramic figurines in 1927, showing women wearing what appears to be a one-piece knee-length silk or rayon slip, trimmed with lace.

Modern negligees are often much looser and made of sheer and diaphanous fabrics and trimmed with lace or other fine material, and bows. Multiple layers of fabric are often used. The modern negligee thus perhaps owes more to women's fine bedjackets or bed-capes, and up-market slips than to the nightgown. It spread to a mass market, benefitting from the introduction of cheap synthetic fabrics such as nylon and its finer successors. From the 1940s to the 1970s, the trend was for negligees to become shorter in length (e.g. the babydoll of the 1970s). Negligees made from the 1940s to the 1970s are now collectible vintage items. In the UK in 2004, negligees accounted for only four percent of women's nightwear sales, women's pyjamas having dominated since the mid-1980s. However, UK negligee sales are said to have been the fastest increasing sector of the market since 1998.

Semmering () is a mountain pass in the Eastern Northern Limestone Alps connecting Lower Austria and Styria, between which it forms a natural border. Location Semmering Pass is located west of Sonnwendstein and Hirschenkogel and east of the Pinkenkogel. With the Wechsel Pass, the Semmering is the most important connection between Lower Austria and Styria. It can be crossed by road (via an Autobahn with a tunnel), or using the Semmering Railway, a Railway tunnel is currently under construction. The village of Semmering is on the pass. The villages of Maria Schutz and Spital am Semmering are slightly below the pass, on the Lower Austrian and Styrian sides respectively. Schottwien and M√ºrzzuschlag are the closest sizeable towns on either side. Rail transportation As the Semmering is a major bottleneck in the Austrian railway network, the Semmering Railway, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, is planned to be supplemented by a tunnel at the base of the mountains. The project is supported by the Austrian Federal Government and the governments of Styria and Carinthia, but has been heavily opposed by the government of Lower Austria, which stalled the project by issuing negative environmental impact statements. The project has now been revised according to the advanced state of technology and the layout of the line has been altered in order to minimize effects on ground water. A ground-breaking ceremony was held at Gloggnitz on April 25, 2012 to officially launch preliminary construction works for the 27.3 km Semmering Base Tunnel. Opening is planned for 2024.

It will eliminate the current bottleneck on the 41 km Semmering Railway route where steep gradients and numerous curves require freight trains to use two or three locomotives. The tunnel will comprise two 10 m bores between 40 and 70 m apart, linked by cross passages every 500m. Boring is planned to start in 2014, with excavation completed ready for fitting out from 2021. The tunnel will be designed for passenger trains to run at up to 230 km/h, shortening Vienna - Graz journey times by 40 min to 1 h 50 min, which is expected to attract more customers to rail. Austria 25 Euro 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway Coin Skiing The Semmering ski resort, called Zauberberg, which also hosts World Cup events, is located at the pass and extends on to the Hirschenkogel mountain. It is mainly used by skiers from Vienna, from where it can be reached within one hour, but increasingly also by people from Hungary and Slovakia. Numismatics The Semmering Pass is featured on a famous commemorative coin: the 25 euro 150 Years of the Semmering Alpine Railway Coin. The reverse of the coin shows a typical Semmering view.

He became famous in Europe for his melodramatic depictions that often portrayed subjects from English and French history. The emotions emphasised in Delaroche's paintings appeal to Romanticism while the detail of his work along with the deglorified portrayal of historic figures follow the trends of Academicism and Neoclassicism. Delaroche aimed to depict his subjects and history with pragmatic realism. He did not consider popular ideals and norms in his creations, but rather painted all his subjects in the same light whether they were historical figures, figures of Christianity, or real people of his time like Napoleon Bonaparte and Marie-Antoinette. Delaroche was a leading pupil of Antoine-Jean Gros and later mentored a number of notable artists such as Thomas Couture, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, and Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. Delaroche was born into a generation that saw the stylistic conflicts between Romanticism and Davidian Classicism. Davidian Classicism was widely accepted and enjoyed by society so as a developing artist at the time of the introduction of Romanticism in Paris, Delaroche found his place between the two movements. Subjects from Delaroche's medieval and sixteenth and seventeenth-century history paintings appealed to Romantics while the accuracy of information along with the highly finished surfaces of his paintings appealed to Academics and Neoclassicism. Delaroche's works completed in the early 1830s most reflected the position he took between the two movements and were admired by contemporary artists of the time‚Äîthe Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833; National Gallery, London) was the most acclaimed of Delaroche's paintings in its day. Later in the 1830s, Delaroche exhibited the first of his major religious works. His change of subject and ‚Äúthe painting‚Äôs austere manner‚Äù were ill-received by critics and after 1837, he stopped exhibiting his work altogether. At the time of his death in 1856, he was painting a series of four scenes from the Life of the Virgin. Only one work from this series was completed: the Virgin Contemplating the Crown of Thorns. Biography Delaroche was born in Paris and stayed there for the majority of his life. Most of his works were completed in his studio on Rue Mazarin. His subjects were painted with a firm, solid, smooth surface, which gave an appearance of the highest finish. This texture was the manner of the day and was also found in the works of Vernet, Ary Scheffer, Louis L√©opold Robert and Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Among his students were British landscape artist Henry Mark Anthony, British history painters Edward Armitage and Charles Lucy, and American painter/photographer Alfred Boisseau (1823‚Äì1901). The first Delaroche picture exhibited was the large Jehosheba saving Joash (1822). This exhibition led to his acquaintance with Th√©odore G√©ricault and Eug√®ne Delacroix, with whom he formed the core of a large group of Parisian historical painters. He visited Italy in 1838 and 1843, when his father-in-law, Horace Vernet, was director of the French Academy in Rome. In 1845, he was elected into the National Academy of Design, New York, as an Honorary Academician.  Early life  Paul Delaroche was born into the petty lord de la Roche family, a family of artists, dealers, collectors, and art administrators. His father, Gregoire-Hippolyte Delaroche, was a prominent art dealer in Paris. Paul Delaroche was the second of two sons and was introduced to fine art at a young age. At age nineteen, Delaroche was afforded by his father the opportunity to study at L'√âcole des Beaux-Arts under the instruction of Louis √âtienne Watelet. Delaroche was influenced by his father to focus on landscapes while he was at L‚Äô√âcole because his brother, Jules-Hippolyte Delaroche, already focused on painting history. After two years at L‚Äô√âcole, Delaroche voiced his disinterest in landscapes and acted on his overall disagreement to the French academic system. He left L'√âcole des Beaux-Art in at the end of 1817. In the year 1818, Delaroche entered the studio of Antoine-Jean Gros (who was trained by David, yet found his greatest success in his un-Davidian productions of contemporary history) where he could pursue his greater interest of history painting.  Artistic independence  Delaroche's debuted at the Salon in 1822 where he exhibited Christ Descended from the Cross (1822: Paris, Pal. Royale, Chapelle) and Jehosheba Saving Joash (1822; Troyes, Mus. B.-A. & Arch√©ol). The latter was a product of Gros's influence and was praised by G√©ricault who supported the beginning of Romanticism. The schooling Delaroche received at L‚ÄôEcole des Beaux-Arts tied him to the ideas of Academicism and Neo-Classicism while his time spent in the studio of Gros aroused his interest of history and its representation through Romanticism. His painting, Joan of Arc in Prison (1824; Rouen, Mus. B.-A.), which was exhibited in the Salon of 1824, along with his following works reflect the middle ground he occupied. Delaroche studied the recent tradition of English history painting at the time, which he incorporated into his own productions. In 1828 he exhibited the first of his English history paintings, Death of Queen Elizabeth. Delaroche's focus on English history achieved him popularity in Britain in the 1830s and 1840s. In the 1830s, Delaroche produced some of his most lauded works, including Cromwell Gazing at the Body of Charles I (1831. Mus. B.-A., N√Æmes), The Princes in the Tower (1831, Louvre, Paris) and his most acclaimed piece, the Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833, NG, London). Recognizing his talent and popularity, the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts elected Delaroche a member of the society in 1832. A year following, he became a professor at L‚ÄôEcole des Beaux- Arts. The same year, he was requested to paint a large mural at the central nave of L'√âglise de la Madeleine in Paris. Delaroche recognized his lack of experience in religious painting and so travelled for one year in Italy to educate himself on the religious works of the past. Upon his return to France, he was told he was to work with Jules-Claude Ziegler, but abandoned the project altogether thinking that Ziegler would soil the image he already had in mind. In 1837 he exhibited St. Cecilia (1836; London, V&A;), which was the first of his significant religious paintings. Delaroche's change of subject was less impressive to French critics than his previous works.  Style and themes  Delaroche as a history painter aimed to present in his work a ‚Äúphilosophical analysis‚Äù of a historical event and link it to ‚Äúthe nineteenth- century understanding of historical truth and historical time.‚Äù Although there are some discrepancies between history and his history painted, Delaroche saw importance in being faithful to the presentation of facts. German literary critic, Heinrich Heine, says \\"[Delaroche] has no great predilection for the past in itself, but for its representation, for the illustration of spirit, and for writing history in colours.\\" Delaroche painted all of his subjects in the same light whether they were great historical figures from the past, founders of Christianity, or important political figures of his time like Marie Antoinette or Napoleon Bonaparte. Delaroche carefully researched the costumes and accessories and settings he included in his paintings in order to accurately present his subject. To accentuate historical accuracy, Delaroche painted with meticulous detail and finished his paintings with clear contours. The varying movement of his brush strokes along with the colors and placement of his subjects give each of them a unique appearance and allows them to act in the spirit and tone of their character and the event. The public eye is less observant of fine details and nuances in painting, but Delaroche appreciated the literary value of his paintings over their pictorial value. He balances the literary aspects with the theatricality, narrativity, and visuality of his historical paintings. Historical works and accuracy His dramatic paintings include Strafford Led to Execution, depicting the English Archbishop Laud stretching his arms out of the small high window of his cell to bless Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, as Strafford passes along the corridor to be executed, and the Assassination of the duc de Guise at Blois. Another famous work shows Cardinal Richelieu in a gorgeous barge, preceding the boat carrying Cinq-Mars and De Thou carried to their execution. Other important Delaroche works include The Princes in the Tower and La Jeune Martyre (showing a young female martyr floating dead on the Tiber). Delaroche's work sometimes contained historical inaccuracies. Cromwell lifting the Coffin-lid and looking at the Body of Charles is based on an urban legend, and The Execution of Lady Jane Grey is represented as taking place in a dungeon, which is badly inaccurate. He tended to care more about dramatic effect than historical truth: see also The King in the Guardroom, where villainous Puritan soldiers blow tobacco smoke in the face of King Charles, and Queen Elizabeth Dying on the Ground.  Later works and the close of his career  After 1837, Delaroche stopped exhibiting his work altogether. The disappointing public reception of his painting, St. Cecilia, along with his overall rejection of Davidian values in French society and government led him to his ‚Äúself-imposed exile from the government-sponsored Salons.‚Äù Delaroche then commenced the creation of his most famous work, The Hemicycle, painted on a semicircular saloon at L‚ÄôEcole des Beaux-Arts. The Hemicycle was a 27-meter panoramic that included over seventy of the most famous artists since Antiquity. The artists included represent Gothic, Greek, Roman, and Renaissance art. The subjects of this painting appeal to the academic taste of the nineteenth-century. Delaroche paints with encaustic mixtures to create this monumental piece‚Äîa technique in which pigment is mixed with hot wax and painted onto the plaster to create a smooth surface. Delaroche did not complete this project alone; four of his students assisted him and together they worked from 1837 to 1841. In 1855 the work was severely damage by fire and Delaroche spent the last year of his life restoring his work. Delaroche died in 1856 and restoration was taken over by Tony Robert-Fleury, a student of Delaroche. Marriage to Louise Vernet Paul Delaroche sketch of his wife Louise Vernet on her death bed Delaroche's love for Horace Vernet's daughter Louise was the absorbing passion of his life. He married Louise in 1835, in which year he also exhibited Head of an Angel, which was based on a study of her. It is said that Delaroche never recovered from the shock of her death in 1845 at the age of 31. After her loss he produced a sequence of small elaborate pictures of incidents in Jesus's Passion. He focused attention on the human drama of the Passion, as in a painting where Mary and the apostles hear the crowd cheering Jesus on the Via Dolorosa, and another where St. John escorts Mary home after her son's death.

This was a mural 27 metres (88.5 ft) long, in the hemicycle of the award theatre of the √âcole des Beaux Arts. The commission came from the √âcole's architect, F√©lix Duban. The painting represents seventy-five great artists of all ages, in conversation, assembled in groups on either hand of a central elevation of white marble steps, on the topmost of which are three thrones filled by the creators of the Parthenon: architect Phidias, sculptor Ictinus, and painter Apelles, symbolizing the unity of these arts. To supply the female element in this vast composition he introduced the genii or muses, who symbolize or reign over the arts, leaning against the balustrade of the steps, depicted as idealized female figures. The painting is not fresco but done directly on the wall in oil. Delaroche finished the work in 1841, but it was considerably damaged by a fire in 1855. He immediately set about trying to re-paint and restore the work, but died on 4 November 1856, before he had accomplished much of this. The restoration was finished by Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury. Fake or Fortune In 2016, the BBC TV programme Fake or Fortune? investigated the authenticity of a version of Delaroche's Saint Amelia, Queen of Hungary. After reviewing the show's findings, Professor Stephen Bann, a leading Delaroche expert, concluded that the version, bought for ¬£500 in 1989 by the late art collector and dealer Neil Wilson, and housed at Castle of Park in Cornhill, Aberdeenshire, was in fact the lost original. Wilson's widow, Becky, was reported to have decided to keep the painting, but allow it to go on display at the British Museum in London when a Delaroche exhibition takes place. Subsequently, the painting was sold via Christie's in July 2019 for ¬£33,750.Sainte Am√©lie, Reine de Hongrie ‚Äì Christie‚Äôs.

The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re is a being in ancient Egyptian mythology that functions as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. The Eye is an extension of Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The Eye goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the Eye goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The Eye of Ra is similar to the Eye of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the Eye goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology. The Eye of Ra was involved in many areas of ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with it. Its life-giving power was celebrated in temple rituals, and its dangerous aspect was invoked in the protection of the pharaoh, of sacred places, and of ordinary people and their homes. Roles=Solar The Egyptians often referred to the sun and the moon as the \\"eyes‚Äù of particular gods. The right eye of the god Horus, for instance, was equated with the sun, and his left eye equated with the moon. At times the Egyptians called the lunar eye the \\"Eye of Horus\\", a concept with its own complex mythology and symbolism, and called the solar eye the \\"Eye of Ra\\"‚ÄîRa being the preeminent sun god in ancient Egyptian religion. However, in Egyptian belief, many terms and concepts are fluid, so the sun could also be called the \\"Eye of Horus\\". The yellow or red disk-like sun emblem in Egyptian art represents the Eye of Ra. Because of the great importance of the sun in Egyptian religion, this emblem is one of the most common religious symbols in all of Egyptian art. Although Egyptologists usually call this emblem the \\"sun disk\\", its convex shape in Egyptian relief sculpture suggests that the Egyptians may have envisioned it as a sphere. The emblem often appears atop the heads of solar- associated deities, including Ra himself, to indicate their links with the sun. The disk could even be regarded as Ra's physical form. At other times, the sun god, in various forms, is depicted inside the disk shape, as if enclosed within it. The Egyptians often described the sun's movement across the sky as the movement of a barque carrying Ra and his entourage of other gods, and the sun disk can either be equated with this solar barque or depicted containing the barque inside it. The disk is often called Ra's \\"daughter\\" in Egyptian texts. As the sun, the Eye of Ra is a source of heat and light, and it is associated with fire and flames. It is also equated with the red light that appears before sunrise, and with the morning star that precedes and signals the sun's arrival. Procreative The eyes of Egyptian deities, although they are aspects of the power of the gods who own them, sometimes take active roles in mythology, possibly because the word for \\"eye\\" in Egyptian, jrt, resembles another word meaning \\"do\\" or \\"act\\". The presence of the feminine suffix -t in jrt may explain why these independent eyes were thought of as female. The Eye of Ra, in particular, is deeply involved in the sun god's creative actions. In Egyptian mythology, the sun's emergence from the horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, an event that revitalizes him and the order of the cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky‚Äîusually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also take the form of a goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration. Ra is not unique in this relationship with the Eye. Other solar gods may interact in a similar way with the numerous goddesses associated with the Eye. Hathor, a goddess of the sky, the sun, and fertility, is often called the Eye of Ra, and she also has a relationship with Horus, who also has solar connections, that is similar to the relationship between Ra and his Eye. Hathor can even be called \\"the Eye of Horus\\"‚Äîone of several ways in which the distinctions between the two eyes are blurred. The Eye can also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra. Sometimes this eye is called the Eye of Atum, although at other times the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Atum are distinct, with Ra's Eye the sun and Atum's Eye the moon. The uraeus on the royal headdress of Amenemope A myth about the Eye, known from allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055‚Äì1650 BC) and a more complete account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664‚Äì332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her ability to act independently. The myth takes place before the creation of the world, when the solar creator‚Äîeither Ra or Atum‚Äîis alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this creator god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. The Eye returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that the creator has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. The creator god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead in the form of the uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of the Eye with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, the creator god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is the Eye that weeps instead, so the Eye is the progenitor of humankind. The tears of the Eye of Ra are part of a more general connection between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, at the start of the Egyptian year, Sothis's heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt. Aggressive and protective The Eye of Ra also represents the destructive aspect of Ra's power: the heat of the sun, which in Egypt can be so harsh that the Egyptians sometimes likened it to arrows shot by a god to destroy evildoers. The uraeus is a logical symbol for this dangerous power. In art, the sun disk image often incorporates one or two uraei coiled around it. The solar uraeus represents the Eye as a dangerous force that encircles the sun god and guards against his enemies, spitting flames like venom. Four uraei are sometimes said to surround Ra's barque. Collectively called \\"Hathor of the Four Faces\\", they represent the Eye's vigilance in all directions. Ra's enemies are the forces of chaos, which threaten maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye is one of the few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil. The Eye's aggression may even extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra was believed to swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter. In the myth called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550‚Äì1070 BC), Ra uses the Eye as a weapon against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye‚ÄîHathor, in her aggressive manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet‚Äîto massacre them. She does so, but after the first day of her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes to the heat and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt that accompanied the subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune. The solar Eye's volatile nature can make her difficult even for her master to control. In the myth of the \\"Distant Goddess\\", a motif with several variants, the Eye goddess becomes upset with Ra and runs away from him. In some versions the provocation for her anger seems to be her replacement with a new eye after the search for Shu and Tefnut, but in others her rebellion seems to take place after the world is fully formed. Dimitri Meeks and Christine Favard-Meeks interpret these events as the Eye's reaction to being deceived by Ra after her slaughter of humanity, whereas Carolyn Graves-Brown sees it as a later elaboration of the myth related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. With the solar Eye gone, Ra is vulnerable to his enemies and bereft of a large part of his power. The Eye's absence and Ra's weakened state may be a mythological reference to solar eclipses. Moreover, it may be part of a larger motif in Egyptian myth in which a god's Eye is lost and then restored with the help of another deity. This motif also applies to the Eye of Horus, which in the Osiris myth is torn out and must be returned or healed so that Horus may regain his strength. Meanwhile, the Eye wanders in a distant land‚ÄîNubia, Libya, or Punt. She takes the form of a wild feline, as dangerous and uncontrolled as the forces of chaos that she is meant to subdue. To restore order, one of the gods goes out to retrieve her. In one version, known from scattered allusions, the warrior god Anhur searches for the Eye, which takes the form of the goddess Mehit, using his skills as a hunter. In other accounts, it is Shu who searches for Tefnut, who in this case represents the Eye rather than an independent deity. Thoth, who often serves as a messenger and conciliator in the Egyptian pantheon, can also seek the wandering goddess. His role in retrieving the Eye of Ra parallels his role in the Osiris myth, in which he heals or returns Horus's lost Eye. In a Late Period papyrus dubbed \\"The Myth of the Eye of the Sun\\", Thoth persuades the Eye of Ra to return through a combination of lectures, enticement, and entertaining stories. His efforts are not uniformly successful; at one point, the goddess is so enraged by Thoth's words that she transforms from a relatively benign cat into a fire- breathing lioness, making Thoth jump. When the goddess is at last placated, the retrieving god escorts her back to Egypt. Her return marks the beginning of the inundation and the new year. Joachim Friedrich Quack points out that when Sirius reappears in the sky it first appears reddish before turning blue- white, and he suggests the Egyptians connected this change in color with the pacification of the Eye goddess. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort for the sun god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents. The dual nature of the Eye goddess shows, as Graves-Brown puts it, that \\"the Egyptians saw a double nature to the feminine, which encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love.\\" This same view of femininity is found in texts describing human women, such as the Instruction of Ankhsheshonq, which says a man's wife is like a cat when he can keep her happy and like a lioness when he cannot. Manifestations Sekhmet as a woman with the head of a lioness, wearing the sun disk and uraeus The characteristics of the Eye of Ra were an important part of the Egyptian conception of female divinity in general, and the Eye was equated with many goddesses, ranging from very prominent deities like Hathor to obscure ones like Mestjet, a lion goddess who appears in only one known inscription. The Egyptians associated many gods who took felid form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with the Eye. Bastet was depicted as both a domestic cat and a lioness, and with these two forms she could represent both the peaceful and violent aspects of the Eye. Yet another goddess of the solar Eye was Mut, the consort of the god Amun, who was associated with Ra. Mut was first called the Eye of Ra in the late New Kingdom, and the aspects of her character that were related to the Eye grew increasingly prominent over time. Mut, too, could appear in both leonine and cat form. Likewise, cobra goddesses often represented the Eye. Among them was Wadjet, a tutelary deity of Lower Egypt who was closely associated with royal crowns and the protection of the king. Other Eye- associated cobra goddesses include the fertility deity Renenutet, the magician goddess Weret-hekau, and Meretseger, the divine protector of the burial grounds near the city of Thebes. The deities associated with the Eye were not restricted to feline and serpent forms. Hathor's usual animal form is a cow, as is that of the closely linked Eye goddess Mehet-Weret. Nekhbet, a vulture goddess, was closely connected with Wadjet, the Eye, and the crowns of Egypt. Many Eye goddesses appear mainly in human form, including Neith, a sometimes warlike deity sometimes said to be the mother of the sun god, and Satet and Anuket, who were linked with the Nile cataracts and the inundation. Other such goddesses include Sothis, the deified form of the star of the same name, and Maat, the personification of cosmic order, who was connected with the Eye because she was said to be the daughter of Ra. Even Isis, who is usually the companion of Osiris rather than Ra, or Astarte, a deity of fertility and warfare who was imported from Canaan rather than native to Egypt, could be equated with the solar Eye. Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, representing different aspects of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt. These goddesses and their iconographies frequently mingled. Many combinations such as Hathor-Tefnut, Mut-Sekhmet, and Bastet-Sothis appear in Egyptian texts. Wadjet could sometimes be depicted with a lion head rather than that of a cobra, Nekhbet could take on cobra form as a counterpart of Wadjet, and a great many of these goddesses wore the sun disk on their heads, sometimes with the addition of a uraeus or the cow horns from Hathor's typical headdress. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, the hieroglyph for a uraeus could be used as a logogram or determinative for the word \\"goddess\\" in any context, because virtually any goddess could be linked with the Eye's complex set of attributes. Worship The Eye of Ra was invoked in many areas of Egyptian religion, and its mythology was incorporated into the worship of many of the goddesses identified with it. The Eye's flight from and return to Egypt was a common feature of temple ritual in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (305 BC ‚Äì AD 390), when the new year and the Nile flood that came along with it were celebrated as the return of the Eye after her wanderings in foreign lands. The Egyptians built shrines along the river containing images of animals and dwarfs rejoicing at the goddess' arrival. Scholars do not know how well developed the myth and the corresponding rituals were in earlier times. One of the oldest examples is Mut's return to her home temple in Thebes, which was celebrated there annually as early as the New Kingdom. At the temple of Montu at Medamud, in a festival that may date back to the late Middle Kingdom, it was Montu's consort Raet-Tawy who was equated with Hathor and the Eye of Ra. The return of this Eye goddess, in fertile, moisture-bearing form, set the stage for her subsequent marriage to Montu and the birth of their mythological child, a form of Horus. The temple's new year festival celebrated her homecoming with drinking and dancing, paralleling the goddess' inebriated state after her pacification. In other cities, two goddesses were worshipped as the belligerent and peaceful forms of the Eye, as with Ayet and Nehemtawy at Herakleopolis or Satet and Anuket at Aswan. In another temple ritual, the pharaoh played a ceremonial game in honor of the Eye goddesses Hathor, Sekhmet, or Tefnut, in which he struck a ball symbolizing the Eye of Apep with a club made from a type of wood that was said to have sprung from the Eye of Ra. The ritual represents, in a playful form, the battle of Ra's Eye with its greatest foe. Frieze of uraei bearing sun disks at the top of a wall in the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut The concept of the solar Eye as mother, consort, and daughter of a god was incorporated into royal ideology. Pharaohs took on the role of Ra, and their consorts were associated with the Eye and the goddesses equated with it. The sun disks and uraei that were incorporated into queens' headdresses during the New Kingdom reflect this mythological tie. The priestesses who acted as ceremonial \\"wives\\" of particular gods during the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1059‚Äì653 BC), such as the God's Wife of Amun, had a similar relationship with the gods they served. Amenhotep III even dedicated a temple at Sedeinga in Nubia to his wife, Tiye, as a manifestation of the Eye of Ra, paralleling the temple to Amenhotep himself at nearby Soleb. The violent form of the Eye was also invoked in religious ritual and symbolism as an agent of protection. The uraeus on royal and divine headdresses alludes to the role of the Eye goddesses as protectors of gods and kings. For similar reasons, uraei appear in rows atop shrines and other structures, surrounding and symbolically guarding them against hostile powers. Many temple rituals called upon Eye goddesses to defend the temple precinct or the resident deity. Often, the texts of such rituals specifically mention a set of four defensive uraei. These uraei are sometimes identified with various combinations of goddesses associated with the Eye, but they can also be seen as manifestations of \\"Hathor of the Four Faces\\", whose protection of the solar barque is extended in these rituals to specific places on earth. The Eye of Ra could also be invoked to defend ordinary people. Some apotropaic amulets in the shape of the Eye of Horus bear the figure of a goddess on one side. These amulets are most likely an allusion to the connection between the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Ra, invoking their power for personal protection. In addition, certain magical spells from the New Kingdom involve the placement of clay model uraei around a house or a room, invoking the protection of the solar uraeus as in the temple rituals. These uraei are intended to ward off evil spirits and the nightmares that they were believed to cause, or other enemies of the house's occupant. The spell says the models have \\"fire in their mouths\\". Models like those in the spells have been found in the remains of ancient Egyptian towns, and they include bowls in front of their mouths where fuel could be burnt, although the known examples do not show signs of burning. Whether literal or metaphorical, the fire in the cobras' mouths, like the flames spat by the Eye of Ra, was meant to dispel the nocturnal darkness and burn the dangerous beings that move within it. The Eye's importance extends to the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, the realm of the dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.

It begins at the Outerbridge Crossing toll plaza and runs from southwest to northeast to a merge with Drumgoole Road in the island's Greenridge section. The parkway is designated New York State Route 909C (NY 909C), an unsigned reference route, which continues northeast along Drumgoole Road for a short distance to its end at an intersection with Richmond Avenue. The westernmost of the parkway overlaps with NY 440\\\\. The parkway opened in 1972 as the Richmond Parkway. It was renamed the Korean War Veterans Parkway in 1997; however, the highway is still widely known as Richmond Parkway. As originally planned, the parkway would have continued northeast to an interchange with Interstate 278 in Sunnyside, and would have also connected to Wolfe's Pond Park on Staten Island's South Shore by way of a spur known as Wolfe's Pond Parkway. The section of the Richmond Parkway east of Richmond Avenue was canceled sometime after the 1960s as a result of community opposition; likewise, Wolfe's Pond Parkway was canceled in the 1970s. Today, the part of the Staten Island Greenbelt where the parkway would have run is still known as Richmond Parkway. Route description The Korean War Veterans Parkway, facing northeast from Tyrellan Avenue The Korean War Veterans Parkway begins concurrent with NY 440 at the Outerbridge Crossing toll plaza east of the New Jersey state line on Staten Island. NY 440 and the parkway remain overlapped to Pleasant Plains, where NY 440 splits from the parkway and heads north on the West Shore Expressway. Past NY 440, the four-lane parkway gains frontage roads as Drumgoole Road begins to run along both sides of the highway. Not far to the east, the parkway runs along the southern edge of Bloomingdale Park and connects to Maguire Avenue by way of ramps leading to and from Drumgoole Road. The parkway continues slightly northeastward through Pleasant Plains to Huguenot, serving Huguenot Avenue with southbound exit and northbound entrance ramps. From Huguenot Avenue, the highway takes a more pronounced northeasterly track through the neighborhoods of Woodrow and Annadale, meeting Arden Avenue by way of an interchange in the latter community. The parkway continues as a four-lane limited-access highway to Greenridge, where the road merges with the northern half of Drumgoole Road to create a four-lane, two-way surface street with a Jersey barrier in the median. The Korean War Veterans Parkway ends at the merge; however, NY 909C, the unsigned reference route designation for the parkway, continues to follow Drumgoole Road to its end a short distance later at an intersection with Richmond Avenue. Stubs intended to continue both directions of the parkway past Greenridge are present at the merge with Drumgoole Road. The unused highways roughly parallel Drumgoole Road, crossing over Richmond Avenue before abruptly becoming a small two-lane road just east of the overpasses. The road continues as a non-public asphalt roadway used for construction vehicles. History The parkway that exists today represents less than half of the highway that was originally planned. From Richmond Avenue, the parkway would have continued northeast to Staten Island's Sunnyside neighborhood, where it would connect to the Staten Island Expressway. The section west of Richmond Avenue was constructed along Drumgoole Road from 1966 to 1972 and opened to traffic in late 1972. As a result, the parkway's one-way service roads were named Drumgoole Road East and Drumgoole Road West. Drumgoole Road itself was named for Father John Drumgoole, the Irish-born founder of the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, a Roman Catholic orphanage better known today as Mount Loretto. In the late 1960s, intense community opposition erupted over the portion east of Richmond Avenue‚Äîmuch of it from environmentalists‚Äîbecause the parkway's planned route would have bisected the Staten Island Greenbelt and would have required the condemnation and razing of miles of private property. The section of the parkway between Richmond Avenue and the proposed Staten Island Expressway interchange ended up never being built, and the route was subsequently demapped. From time to time, proposals have been made to revive the aborted section of the parkway in response to steadily increasing traffic congestion on Staten Island. However, none of these proposals have received significant support from the island's elected officials or residents. Robert Moses had an interchange built at the junction with the Staten Island Expressway (I-278) in Todt Hill, with the intention of using it for the terminus of the Richmond Parkway. However, this never came to be finished and the interchange was demolished in 2012 as part of a project to widen the Staten Island Expressway. Wolfe's Pond Parkway, a spur route connecting Richmond Parkway to Wolfe's Pond Park on Staten Island's South Shore, was proposed by Robert Moses in 1941. The highway never advanced past the planning stage, and it was ultimately cancelled in the 1970s. In 1997, the Richmond Parkway was renamed the Korean War Veterans Memorial Parkway; however, when signs announcing the change were erected, the word \\"Memorial\\" was inadvertently omitted.

Attributes = Depiction  Headcrabs are depicted as parasitic lifeforms roughly long.The description for the plush headcrab collectible item indicates that the six-inch toy is quarter-scale, meaning that a normal-sized headcrab would be typically two feet in length. The common headcrab variant has rounded bodies with four legs for movement, two of which are long clawed legs at the front and two stubby legs at the back. Their pair of large frontal claws are for attacking, and as additional support when standing still. Under the headcrab's body is a large rounded mouth surrounded by mangled, rigid flesh with a sharp claw-like beak. Physically, headcrabs are frail: a few bullets or a single strike from the player's melee weapon being sufficient to dispatch them. They are also relatively slow-moving and their attacks inflict very little damage. However, they can leap long distances and heights. Headcrabs seek out larger human hosts, which are converted into zombie-like mutants that attack any living lifeform nearby. The converted humans are more resilient than an ordinary human would be and inherit the headcrab's resilience toward toxic and radioactive materials. Headcrabs and headcrab zombies die slowly when they catch fire. The games also establish that while headcrabs are parasites that prey on humans, they are also the prey of the creatures of their homeworld. Bullsquids, Vortigaunts, barnacles and antlions will all eat headcrabs and Vortigaunts can be seen cooking them in several locations in-game.  Variations  While the original Half-Life only contains one type of headcrab, Half-Life 2 introduced two major variations: fast headcrabs and poison headcrabs. Headcrab zombies also receive these variations in Half-Life 2. = Gonarch = The Gonarch is a massive, heavily armored version of a headcrab that appears only once as a boss fight towards the end of Half-Life in Xen. The Gonarch appears to act as a sort of hive queen, endlessly spawning infant headcrabs from a bulbous fleshy sack located on its underside. Unlike other types of headcrabs, the Gonarch lacks a mouth on its underside, suggesting it is unable to zombify a host. = Fast headcrab = The fast headcrab is a faster, more spider-like version of the ordinary headcrab. Its skin is slightly lighter, and it has long, spider-like legs that allow it to move much faster and climb on walls (first demonstrated in Half-Life 2 in Ravenholm). It does not have a beak like the other varieties, instead using the sharp talons at the ends of its legs to latch to hosts. The zombies it creates are stripped of most of their flesh and muscle. When a fast headcrab is shot off the zombie itself it will reveal a completely bare skull with no tissue, which suggests that the fast headcrab completely takes over control of the host's muscles and nervous system and furthermore becomes the potential brain for the host/zombie. The resulting zombies are, like the headcrab itself, much faster than ordinary zombies. It also makes the same shriek that their standard cousins make. = Poison headcrab = The poison headcrab (also known as the black headcrab or venomous headcrab) is slightly larger than its counterparts with dark sage-green-colored skin and thick hairs on the joints of its body and inward-bending legs. To distinguish it further, it has white bands that encircle its knee joints, wider legs, and a more flattened body, giving it a generally more crab-like appearance. It also makes a chirp at range and a hissing-rattling similar to that of a rattlesnake's tail when it detects a viable host. Immediately before pouncing, they emit a loud, distinctive shriek. There is also a whipping noise as they pounce. Unlike the other headcrabs, the poisonous headcrab has some survival instinct, as it will retreat when injured. Although it is the slowest-moving version of the headcrab when calm, it can outpace an ordinary headcrab when retreating. Another difference is that the poison headcrab takes a longer time to burn to death than the other types. Poison headcrabs get their name from the neurotoxin they carry, which reduces the player's health to one point instantly on contact, meaning that minimal additional damage can easily kill the player. Gordon's HEV suit provides an antidote that will restore the missing health over a short period, minus the damage caused by the attack itself. While this makes a single poisonous headcrab unable to fully kill Gordon, it can make survival much more problematic if other enemies are present. Half-Life 2: Raising The Bar notes that play-testers would prioritize poison headcrabs as targets, regardless of any other present dangers. They will group together on a single host once one is found: the attacking poison headcrab controls the host, while the others use the new host as transportation, having it throw them at new victims. (It is also possible that these additional headcrabs are produced by the host human as a method of reproduction on the part of the primary headcrab). = Headcrab zombie = A headcrab's primary goal is to attach to the head of a suitable host using its mouth (typically covering the face and most of the head). The headcrab then burrows its claws and hind legs into the host and opens up portions of the skull with its mouth, incorporating parts of its biological workings with the motor cortex of the host's nervous system. The victim is thus taken over by the headcrab and mutated into a mindless zombie-like being known as a headcrab zombie, referred to as a \\"necrotic\\" by the Combine Overwatch. Once the headcrab has converted a host into a headcrab zombie, the torso of the host is open and the organs can be seen. In the first Half-Life the player can see the texture of the host's skull on the headcrab. However, this was removed in future installments. They are slow-moving but powerful, using their claws to beat their victims to death. They moan almost constantly, and growl when they detect prey. In Half-Life 2, they can swat loose objects when they run into them, creating potentially lethal projectiles. Half-Life 2 also introduced still-moving zombies which are severed at the waist and crawl toward the player using their arms. Host bodies are in an unconscious state immediately after infestation, and after a while, rise to attack. There are six main variants of the headcrab zombie, the \\"standard zombie\\", \\"fast headcrab zombie\\", \\"poison headcrab zombie\\", \\"armored zombie\\", the \\"Gonome\\", and \\"Zombine\\", or Combine Zombie. These have multiple differences from each other and the normal headcrab zombie. As their names would imply, the fast and poison headcrab zombies are created when a fast headcrab or poison headcrab respectively attach to a host. The Gonome is unique in that it is a more aggressive and armored mutation of a standard zombie. The Zombine is created when a headcrab zombie is created from \\"former\\" Combine Overwatch soldiers. Alyx Vance coins the term \\"zombine\\" for them as a portmanteau of \\"zombie\\" and \\"Combine\\". The introduction of the Zombine was meant to indicate that, in the wake of the devastation caused by the player in Half-Life 2, what was once a valuable weapon in the Combine arsenal is now just as dangerous to them as it is to regular humans. Along with being able to move faster than normal zombies, zombines also have the unique ability to pull out a live grenade and charge the player, killing themselves in the process. It is as yet unclear as to what specific function in the Headcrab ecology or reproductive cycle the zombification process serves. = Armored headcrab = Half-Life: Alyx introduces a new variation whose back is covered by a bullet-proof shell with dark bulbs and some thick spikes on it. To fight one effectively, the player must target the creature's weak underbelly when the opportunity presents itself, such as when the crab balances on its hind legs in preparation for a jump, or when it lands on its back after jumping, after which it can take a few seconds for the headcrab to recover its posture. A single pistol hit to the exposed underbelly is commonly enough to kill the creature.  Appearances = Half-Life  Headcrabs are one of the first enemies introduced in Half-Life. They are frequently encountered by players throughout Half-Life and its three expansions, Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay. They also see appearances in the official port of Half-Life, titled Half-Life: Source, as well as the third-party fan modification remake titled Black Mesa. Because the games are remakes or ports, headcrabs play essentially the same role as they do in the original Half-Life.  Half-Life 2  The design of the headcrab changes between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Half-Life headcrabs have exposed teeth and intestines at their mouth, while the Half-Life 2 version does not. As such, it is initially apparent that the headcrab only walks with its large front claws and hind legs, while the stubby legs form part of the headcrab's mouth. The headcrabs found in Half-Life are also noticeably smaller than those in Half-Life 2, which have bodies approximately the size of a watermelon. Half-Life and Half-Life 2 also reverses the headcrab's tolerance to water and toxins: headcrabs in Half-Life can swim in water but die in toxic environments, while in Half-Life 2 they drown within seconds in deep water but easily survive in contaminated pools. Half-Life 2 shows that rather than just wild parasites in Half-Life the Earth-occupying Combine have put them to use as an unstable but effective biological weapon against the human Resistance. A coffin-like missile is filled with headcrabs, and fired from a mortar (as seen in Half-Life 2: Lost Coast) The Combine will bombard distant areas with these missiles and the payload of each shell is released, free to infest or kill nearby victims without risk to the Combine forces. As is the unfortunate case of the devastated town Ravenholm, repeated bombings can neutralize entire towns and cities in a short span of time. Half-Life 2 also featured the first appearance of Dr. Kleiner's \\"pet\\" headcrab. Referred to as \\"Lamarr\\" (after actress and scientist Hedy Lamarr), it serves as an important plot device for a number of scenes in the game, most notably in the second chapter of the game, when, by damaging the teleporter that the player is in, causes it to teleport Freeman outside Kleiner's lab, forcing escape through City 17's canals, and also alerting the combine to the players presence.  Appearances in other media  *A headcrab is an unlockable character in the Windows, OS X, and Linux versions of Super Meat Boy as an exclusive character for those who purchase the game from Steam. *A headcrab helm was included in the April 1, 2011 event in Vindictus as an exclusive. *A headcrab pet was made available in a 2013 update to the action role-playing game Torchlight II. The headcrab pet is available in versions of the game purchased both from Steam and non- Steam storefronts. *A headcrab cosmetic item was added to Team Fortress 2 in the Summer 2020 Cosmetic Case update  Cultural impact = Merchandise  Due to popular request, Valve released a plush headcrab for sale at the Valve Store. It featured posable limbs, a number of teeth and claws and a gaping maw. For a 2006 Christmas special, along with the re-release of the plush headcrab, fans could buy a headcrab hat, specially designed to give the impression that the wearer is under attack from the parasitic alien. As part of Valve's new marketing relations with the dedicated third-party merchandise selling group, For Fans by Fans, the official Valve website is no longer used as the main platform to sell the aforementioned merchandise. The official headcrab hat is available on the For Fans by Fans' Valve Store section, with its third revision for a new design.  Reception  In 2008, the poisonous headcrab was ranked the second most terrifying video game enemy of all time by Cracked due to their venom's ability to drain the players' health to one. In 2011, the poisonous headcrab was ranked at number one on the list of \\"enemies that scuttle and jump at your face\\" by GamesRadar.

They are distinguished from treasury shares, which are shares held by the corporation itself, thus representing no exercisable rights. Shares outstanding and treasury shares together amount to the number of issued shares. Shares outstanding can be calculated as either basic or fully diluted. The basic count is the current number of shares. Dividend distributions and voting in the general meeting of shareholders are calculated according to this number. The fully diluted shares outstanding count, on the other hand, includes diluting securities, such as warrants, capital notes or convertibles. If the company has any diluting securities, this indicates the potential future increased number of shares outstanding. Finding the number of shares outstanding The number of outstanding shares may change due to changes in the number of issued shares as well as the change in treasury shares. Both can occur at any time of the year. There are several useful public sources to find the number of shares outstanding of a given corporation. Public traded companies' investor relations The financial reporting obligation of the publicly traded company also ensures the publication of issued and outstanding shares. The reports are usually available in the investor relations section of the company's website. Web directories are supporting direct access to company websites. Publicly traded companies bundle the reports in the investor relations section, e.g. Deutsche Bank, Eni S.p.a., AB InBev, EDP - Energias do Brasil SA or Accor SA. Authorized information service In many countries, there is an information service authorized or provided by the local financial authority which gives access to companies' financial reporting. In the United States, the number of shares outstanding may be obtained from quarterly filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Quarterly filings are accessible using the US EDGAR. In Germany, those figures are available using the German company register, the central platform for storage of company data. In the Netherlands, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) provides on its website a register of issued capital. In Italy, the Commissione Nazionale per le Societ√† e la Borsa (CONSOB) provides on its website a register of issuers with latest total shares. Local stock exchanges Since outstanding shares are an essential detail of publicly traded companies the number can be found on the local stock exchange websites. Beyond stock charts and listed prices, they also provide the companies' number of outstanding shares. Examples include the Brazilian BM&FBOVESPA;, the Swiss SIX, the Borsa Italiana and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (where shares outstanding are termed \\"Capital Listed for Trading\\").

Penetration into a semi-infinite or massive target is penetration (in the strict sense of the word) of targets so thick that the level of penetration is not affected by the target's thickness. There is a transition region between semi-infinite penetration and perforation, in which the target is not perforated but the projectile, as it nears the back face of the target, meets reduced resistance and is capable of penetrating a greater distance than it would in a semi-infinite target. This effect is variously named the back or rear surface, plate, or face effect and is also present when perforation occurs. A penetrating projectile may cause the target to break into multiple pieces, spewing from both the front and back of the target, themselves at high velocity. These pieces are collectively referred to as spall. Spall can be generated even if a perforation is not achieved (the projectile fails to pass through the target), generated instead by the shock wave generated by the impact of the projectile. Bombs designed for great penetration into the earth or for perforation of hardened targets are known as bunker busters.

It is part of the state university system of Massachusetts. It is a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. Originally established as part of the state's normal school system for training teachers, it now offers a wide variety of programs leading to Bachelor of Science and Arts degrees, as well as a Master of Education track. History Murdock Hall, one of the college' s classroom buildings. MCLA was founded in 1894 as North Adams Normal School, and it offered first instruction at post-secondary level three years later. By 1897, the Normal School enrolled just 32 students and employed four teachers. Out of those 32 students, only three of them were men In 1932, North Adams Normal School became State Teachers College of North Adams. Along with the name change, it added an upper-division curriculum and awarded the first degree (baccalaureate). Four years later, the school instituted an upper-graduate program. In 1960, the college changed its name to North Adams State College and, later in 1997, to Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, the latter name reflecting its position as the public liberal arts college within the Massachusetts state university system. In 2004, President Mary Grant initiated collaborations with other institutions to strengthen MCLA's leadership position. The college launched the Berkshire Compact for Higher Education and MCLA Gallery 51. MCLA also is the lead partner in the Berkshire STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Pipeline Network. In 2008, Governor Deval Patrick signed the Higher Education Bond Bill that includes $54.5 million for a new Center for Science and Innovation at MCLA. On Oct. 4, 2013 the newly named Feigenbaum Center for Science and Innovation was opened on the MCLA campus. In 2014, Dr. Mary Grant left the college and Dr. Cynthia F. Brown was appointed Interim President of the college. On March 5, 2015, Dr. Greg Summers was unanimously named the 12th President of the school by the college's board of trustees. Dr. Summers later withdrew his acceptance to be the 12th President of the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, citing family health concerns. On December 9, 2015, Dr. Jamie Birge was chosen by the trustees to be the 12th President of the school. Academics MCLA has a rolling admissions plan but requires graduation from an accredited secondary school or a GED. MCLA uses SAT or ACT composite scores for entrance consideration. MCLA accepts transfer students with grade-point average requirements or with an associate degree. MCLA awards the Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science on the undergraduate level and also confers master's degrees in both education and business administration, as well as a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS). MCLA offers 19 major programs of study and 35 minors. On average, MCLA offers 300 academic courses each semester. Graduation from MCLA requires completing 120 credits of academic work. From these 120 credits, about 40 should be college-wide core curriculum credits. Another 40 credits are required to complete a major. Like many higher education programs, 40 upper-division credits are also required. MCLA has a college residence requirement saying at least 45 credits must be earned in residence at the college. Students must earn at least a 2.0 grade point average overall and a 2.0 in their major. Smith House, previously the residence of the sitting college president, currently serves as administrative offices. Distinctive educational programs MCLA offers internships for undergraduates through the Berkshire Hills Internship Program. It also offers undergraduates coursework in other countries through its travel abroad program. MCLA belongs to the Massachusetts Council for International Education (MaCIE), College Consortium for International Studies (CCIS), and the National Student Exchange (NSE). Through these associations and connections, students are sent on semester- or year-long programs to colleges around the world. The college Honors Program includes ten percent of the student body for whom it offers special interdisciplinary courses in such topics as \\"The Mathematics of Fairness,\\" \\"Ethics and Animals\\" or \\"The Romantic Movement.\\" The college is authorized by the state to grant the distinction \\"Commonwealth Scholar\\" to students who complete the honors program with a capstone thesis. Athletics MCLA has 13 varsity sports. The college's varsity teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the NCAA Division III level in the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference (MASCAC). Active intercollegiate female teams are basketball, volleyball, tennis, cross country, soccer, softball, and lacrosse; while active intercollegiate male teams are baseball, basketball, golf, cross country, tennis and soccer. The college also has NERFU club rugby which was re-activated in 2011. From 1963, the college's athletic teams were known as the Mohawks, after the Mohawk Trail which runs along Massachusetts Route 2. In response to concerns over using a Native American name (Francis Boots, cultural-preservation officer of the Mohawk tribe, has told college officials that his people were not honored by the namehttp://search.proquest.com/docview/214690218), the mascot was changed to the Trailblazers in 2002. In 2013, a new mascot, the Mountain Lion, was adopted. The most successful team in the college's history was the men's ice hockey team, which was cut in 2003. Organization and administration MCLA is governed by the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education. Beyond that, MCLA has extra-institutional representation of 11 voting members and the Board of Trustees, whose members are appointed by the governor which has 11 voting members. A student representative to the board of trustees is elected every spring by the student body to sit for one academic year. Administration positions include 12 men and 24 women. Academic affairs is headed by the vice president for academic affairs. Business and finances is headed by the vice president for administration and finance. Student affairs is headed by the vice president of student affairs. The full-time instructional faculty has 52 men and 36 women. The academic governance body, All College Committee, meets an average of nine times each year. Publications The school has two student publications: The Beacon, a weekly newspaper, and Spires, a literary magazine published each year. Radio Station WJJW broadcasts for 140 hours each week, and episodes of the student-run college TV news program, Beacon Web News, are produced once a week.

The family's surname was changed to Sigler during World War I. He was educated at the University of Michigan, and later at the Detroit Law School where, in 1918, he received a law degree. Sigler established a successful legal career in various firms in Detroit, Hastings and Battle Creek, Michigan. He was also the special prosecutor in the grand jury investigation of corruption in the state legislature. He married Mae L. Pierson and they had one child together. Politics In 1928, Sigler was the Democratic candidate for Michigan Attorney General, yet was unsuccessful losing to Republican Wilber Marion Brucker, who was elected Governor of Michigan two years later. Sigler would later switch to the Republican Party. In 1942, he was a candidate in the Republican primary from the 8th District for a seat in the state senate. He was also a member of Rotary International. On November 5, 1946, Sigler, nicknamed Hollywood Kim, was elected Governor of Michigan, defeating former governor Murray Van Wagoner in the general election.

Kantar Worldpanel (formerly TNS Worldpanel) is an international company dealing in consumer knowledge and insights based on continuous consumer panels. Kantar Worldpanel is part of the Kantar GroupKantar Group the Data Investment management Division of WPP. Kantar Worldpanel has a team of 3,500 people and services covering 60 countries with direct ownership or through partners. They work in fields such as fast-moving consumer goods, impulse products, beauty and personal care, fashion, baby, telecommunications and entertainment.  History  Kantar Worldpanel's first panels were founded in the 1940s by companies like Attwood Statistics Limited in the UK (1948) and Secodip in France (1969). The latter soon started to expand their coverage, firstly to Spain in 1973 and afterwards to Portugal in 1989. In the 1970s and the 1980s, other companies also started creating new panels. In 1976 Taylor Nelson launched the first usage panel for food and drinks in the UK. In 1980 NFO created a usage panel for beverages in the United States. And in 1985, IBOPE launched a consumer panel in Brazil (1985). In the 1990s the consolidation and development of the consumer panels network accelerated. In the UK, AGB and Taylor Nelson merged to create Taylor Nelson AGB in 1991, so bringing purchase and usage panels into the same company. In France, Sofres acquired Secodip in 1992 and soon started planning the development of new consumer panels in Asia and Latin America. Both groups came together in 1997 when Taylor Nelson AGB and Sofres merged to create Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS). All consumer panels were then taken into a specific division that in 2003 started using the TNS Worldpanel brand. While all these corporate movements were taking place, the network expanded across different regions. In Asia, between 1997 and 2002, six new consumer panels were developed and launched using the Frank Small Associates' network that Secodip had bought in 1995. The first launch took place in Taiwan in 1997. Two years after, in 1999, Korea and Thailand were added to the network, and Philippines and Malaysia then joined in 2000 followed by Vietnam in 2002. Meanwhile, In China, TNS began a partnership in 1999 with local research company CVSC, who had started a panel two years earlier. In 2001, TNS and the parent company of CVSC formed a new joint venture company called CTR (CVSC TNS Research) and the consumer panel in China joined the Worldpanel network. In Latin America, after the first Secodip panel launch in Argentina in 1996, a partnership between IBOPE and NDP launched another new panel in Chile in 1998. In 2000, IBOPE, NPD and TNS created the LatinPanel joint venture, representing the existing Brazil, Argentina and Chile operations. The acquisition of Samimp added the existing panels in Peru and Bolivia to LatinPanel in 2002. In 2004 TNS acquired two additional companies, Data in Central America and CIMA in Colombia and Venezuela, bringing their consumer panels into the regional network. Finally, Ecuador and Mexico panels were also built and launched in 2004 and 2005 respectively, consolidating LatinPanel business in the region. In 2007 TNS became owner of LatinPanel to bring together the Latin American network with Worldpanel in other regions. In North America, as a result of the Taylor Nelson Sofres' acquisition of NFO in 2003, the beverages usage panel was incorporated to the group. In 2006, TNS Worldpanel reinforced its presence in the US with a new personal care usage panel. In 2008 TNS was bought by WPP, which resulted in the strategic decision to create a stand-alone company focused on consumer panels and branded Kantar Worldpanel. The initial focus on fast-moving consumer goods was later widened to increase the number of sectors covered. Now Kantar Worldpanel measures fashion, telecommunications, entertainment and fuel among other products. The range of methodologies has also been transformed from traditional mail questionnaires to a wider range including bar-code scanners, internet and SMS. The company developed its first international panel (Worldpanel Comtech) in 2006 and the delivery tool Worldpanel Online in 2010. In 2011, a new panel in Indonesia was launched.

He is noted as a member of Blue Mink, T. Rex and Sky and as one of Britain's best-known session bass players. Flowers has contributed to recordings by Elton John (Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water), David Bowie (Space Oddity, Diamond Dogs), Lou Reed (Transformer, including the prominent bass line of \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\"), Melanie (Candles in the Rain), Roy Harper (Bullinamingvase), David Essex (Rock On), Allan Clarke, Al Kooper (New York City (You're a Woman)), Bryan Ferry (The Bride Stripped Bare), Harry Nilsson (Nilsson Schmilsson, Son of Dracula), Cat Stevens (New Masters, Foreigner), Paul McCartney (Give My Regards to Broad Street), George Harrison (Somewhere in England, Gone Troppo, Brainwashed) and Ringo Starr (Stop and Smell the Roses). He also played bass on Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds. By the end of the 1970s, Flowers had played bass on an estimated 500 hit recordings. Biography Flowers was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, England and began his musical training in 1956 when conscripted into the Royal Air Force: electing at first to serve for nine years as a bandsman playing tuba. He took up double bass as a second instrument to secure his \\"junior technician\\" stripe, and later moved to electric bass. After completing his military service he passed through the line-ups of several Dixieland jazz bands in the early 1960s, then discovered modern jazz. In 1965 he was engaged as a bandsman on the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth. After hearing an electric bass in a New York nightclub, he acquired his own solid-body electric instrument, a Lake Placid Blue 1960 Fender Jazz Bass that he purchased from Manny's Music in New York City for $79. Later in the 1960s, Flowers began to acquire his reputation as a session player, working for record producers such as Shel Talmy, Mickie Most, Steve Rowland, Richard Perry, Gus Dudgeon, and Tony Visconti. In 1969, Flowers was a founding member of the group Blue Mink and played on their song \\"Melting Pot\\", which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. He was also a member of CCS and the final lineup of T. Rex. In 1979, shortly after taking part in the annual A Song For Europe contest, performing \\"Mr Moonlight\\" with his group, \\"The Daisies\\", he became a co-founder of the band Sky, which had success in the United Kingdom and Australia. Flowers is also known for having composed the novelty hit \\"Grandad\\" for Clive Dunn in 1970. According to Flowers,On the BBC Radio 2 show Jammin' he came up with it after following an easy primer book on composing. All he needed was a hook, and he was struggling to come up with anything. He phoned a friend (Ken Pickett) who came round, ringing the doorbell, and the sound of the doorbell provided the hook he needed. Perhaps Flowers' most famous bass line is the one he created for Lou Reed's \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" from the album Transformer (1972), the only song by Reed to reach the Top 20 in the US. Flowers was also a member of the final line-up of T-Rex, working with Marc Bolan from late 1976 until Marc's death in September 1977. Following Sky's demise in the early 1990s, Flowers has spent most of his time playing jazz. He has also worked as a bass guitar teacher at Ardingly College and leads many \\"Rockshops\\" at schools, helping young people to create and perform their own songs, as well as covering many others. In 1998, session drummer Peter Boita again teamed up with Flowers to form a rhythm section in musical settings of the words of poet Sir John Betjeman on a second album they recorded together. The album was called Betjeman & Read. They had previously worked together on the Poetry in Motion album (released on Silhouette Records as MDKR 1), which also consisted of settings of Betjeman's It featuring Boita and Flowers playing with a line- up of artists that included David Essex, Justin Hayward, Steve Harley, Donovan, Alvin Stardust, Captain Sensible and Annie Haslam amongst others with Beatles‚Äô producer George Martin overseeing proceedings. Boita and Flowers reprised their roles when Poetry in Motion was performed live for a charity show at the Richmond Theatre on 5 April 1992. Betjeman & Read was one of the last albums recorded at the RG Jones Recording studio in Wimbledon. The vocal artists performing on this album include Cliff Richard, Marc Almond, Paul Young, Jon Anderson, Colin Blunstone, Gene Pitney, Leo Sayer, Donovan, Mike Read, The Rodolfus Choir and David Essex. In September 2009 Flowers founded a community choir, Shoreham Singers-by-Sea, which has in excess of 150 members, followed in September 2010 by the Ditchling Singers.

He was the podczaszy of Krak√≥w from 1678 to 1685. He is remembered as one of the most important Polish baroque artists. His most famous works are: Transakcja wojny chocimskiej (also known as Wojna chocimska or The Chocim War) and his collection of epigrams, Ogr√≥d fraszek (Garden of Rhymes). They give a vivid picture of ideas and manners among the szlachta (Polish gentry) towards the end of the Polish Golden Age, and of many political and religious conflicts. Biography Wac≈Çaw Potocki was born to a minor szlachta family, belonging to the Arian Christian sect of the Polish brethren. It is likely that he attended the Polish brethren Racib√≥rz academy. After The Deluge (the Swedish invasion and occupation of Poland from 1655 to 1657), the Polish brethren were sentenced to be exiled from the Commonwealth for their support of the invading Swedes. Wac≈Çaw was given a choice between exile and conversion to Roman Catholicism, and he reluctantly chose conversion. His wife, however, refused at first, and for many years he feared for her life. He then worked on his estate in ≈Åuzna in the Podkarpacie region of the Commonwealth. He participated in the fight against the Cossack uprisings in 1638, took part in the Battle of Beresteczko in 1651, and in the wars against Sweden (1656-1657). Between 1665 and 1666 he supported the rokosz of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. Later he supported kings Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki and Jan III Sobieski. He argued for the reform of the Commonwealth political system, and for stabilisation through the introduction of an hereditary monarchy instead of the elective monarchy. When the Polish brethren were exiled after the Deluge for the support they gave to invaders, he supported them, and for this he was criticized by some Catholic szlachta. He outlived his wife and children: two of his sons died during the wars, and his daughter, rumoured to have inherited his literary talent, died young. He lived with his family until his death in 1696, and was buried in Biecz. Szreniawa Coat of Arms. Works He started writing around 1646, mostly for his own pleasure, and initially with no intention of publication, but he was convinced to share his works by his relative, Samuel Przypkowski. He wrote many classic poems and novels about the life of the szlachta. During his lifetime only Poczet herb√≥w (Herbary) and two shorter works were published. His most famous work, Transakcja wojny chocimskiej (The Progress of the War of Chocim), was written during the period 1669-1672, and first printed in 1850. It is his biggest novel, and is generally considered to be the best epic novel written in the Commonwealth. Historically accurate, though somewhat idealizing the Polish heroes, it describes the battle of Chocim in 1621 and is based on the diaries of Jakub Sobieski. His epigrams were written around 1670 and 1695, and first published in 1907. He translated John Barclay's Argenis (1621), published in 1697.

Some of his best known comics are series focusing on the Justice Society of America, in particular the Starman character he co-created with Tony Harris. Career=Comics James Robinson has been writing for three decades, with an early comics work, \\"Grendel: The Devil's Whisper\\", appearing in the 1989 series of the British anthology A1. The series for which he is arguably most renowned is the DC Comics series Starman, where he took the aging Golden Age character of the same name and revitalized both the character and all those who had used the name over the decades, weaving them into an interconnected whole. In 1997, Robinson's work on the title garnered him an Eisner Award for \\"Best Serialized Story\\". He is also known for his The Golden Age limited series, which, despite being an Elseworlds story, established much of the backstory he would later use in Starman. He has written the Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight series, and served as a consultant and co-writer in the first year of JSAManning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 287: \\"With a successful Starman revamp and acclaimed Elseworlds limited series The Golden Age already under his belt, Robinson had set the stage for his newest opus ‚Äì the return of the Justice Society of America.\\" and its subsequent spin-off Hawkman. Other work for DC includes a Vigilante miniseries and the Sandman spin-off Witchcraft for Vertigo. Robinson wrote a brief run of Wildcats, teamed with artist Travis Charest, that further developed the book's mythology, along with a spinoff mini-series called Team One. Similarly, he served as a transitional writer on the Marvel Comics titles, Cable and Generation X in 1997‚Äì1998 including the \\"Operation: Zero Tolerance\\" crossover event. He wrote several issues of the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" version of Captain America Leave It to Chance, created by Robinson with penciller Paul Smith, won Robinson two more Eisner Awards in 1997, for \\"Best New Series\\" and \\"Best Title for Younger Readers\\". His other work includes Ectokid, one of the series created by horror/fantasy novelist Clive Barker for Marvel Comics' Razorline imprint, and Firearm for Malibu Comics' Ultraverse line. In 2006, Robinson wrote Batman and Detective Comics, penning the eight-issue \\"Face The Face\\" storyline, as part of the \\"One Year Later\\" project. In 2008‚Äì2010, Robinson was the writer of Superman. This run included the storyline \\"The Coming of Atlas\\". He wrote the 2009‚Äì2010 mini- series Justice League: Cry for Justice and began writing Justice League of America in October 2009 with art by Mark Bagley. Robinson was joined by artist Brett Booth on Justice League of America in February 2011. In May 2010, Robinson and Sterling Gates co-wrote, with artist Eddy Barrows, War of the Supermen, a Superman-based event that was the culmination of two years of story starting from Superman: New Krypton. He concluded his work on Superman with issue #700 (Aug. 2010).Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 341: \\"Writer James Robinson brought his epic run to an end with a touching tale that brought Superman back to Lois Lane after his time on New Krypton.\\" Robinson later wrote a twelve-issue series starring The Shade, a character closely identified with his Starman series and recreated Earth 2 in an eponymous ongoing series for DC's The New 52 initiative in 2011 and 2012. One of the revisions which Robinson introduced was making the Earth Two Green Lantern (Alan Scott) gay. In May 2013, Robinson ended his long relationship with DC Comics. His last issue of Earth 2 was #16. Many observers found the departure abrupt, since Robinson had teased of long term plans for Earth 2. Despite the abrupt nature of Robinson's departure from DC, Robinson's relationship with the company remains amicable. Robinson took new assignments from Marvel Comics after then. His first announced project for Marvel was a collaboration with co-writer Mark Waid and illustrator Gabriele Dell'Otto on an original graphic novel titled Spider-Man: Family Business. A second announced project for Marvel was All-New Invaders, an ongoing monthly comic series with artist Steve Pugh. He and Leonard Kirk launched a new Fantastic Four series in February 2014. The Saviors was released in December 2013 by Image Comics. This story described what happens when Tomas Ramirez, a man working at a gas station stumbles upon an extraterrestrial plot that could mean the end of the Earth. In 2016-2017 Dynamite Entertainment published Grand Passion, a six issue monthly series by Robinson. His description of the series is \\"Grand Passion is definitely a departure from what I've been doing in the last few years. This series is about two wayward characters Doc and Mabel ‚Äì one a cop, the other a crook ‚Äì who are fated to fall in love at first sight even as Mabel swears she'll kill Doc if it's the last thing she does. It marries elements of a Harlequin romance with hard-boiled crime and takes it off in a direction that's surprising, funny, violent, and sexy. I'm very excited to roll up my sleeves and immerse myself in writing this tale.\\" He wrote an ongoing Scarlet Witch series for Marvel which began in late 2015. Robinson explained that he has been influenced by the work of Matt Fraction and David Aja on the Hawkeye title stating \\"How they [Matt Fraction and David Aja] managed to stay true to the character in the Avengers while also taking it in a fresh direction, so it wasn't just that same Avengers character doing solo things, which I don't think ever really works for any sustained period of time for any of those second-tier characters.\\" Archive requires scrolldown Robinson returned to DC Comics in late 2017 to write Wonder Woman. He completed his run on the series as of issue #50 (Sept. 2018). Screenwriting In addition to his work in comics, Robinson wrote the screenplay for the 1993 direct-to-video film Firearm, and wrote and directed the 2002 feature Comic Book Villains, starring Cary Elwes and Michael Rapaport, as well as producing the screenplay for the 1995 film Cyber Bandits with Martin Kemp, Alexandra Paul, Grace Jones and singer Adam Ant. His best known screenplay was for the 2003 movie version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This last script caused some controversy among fans of the original work, many of whom were disappointed an established comics writer's take on Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's series took so many liberties with and considerably changed the tone of the source material. Early drafts had reportedly relocated much of the action from England to America, allegedly in an attempt to make it more acceptable to an American audience. In 2020 he was credited as the writer for episode #10 (Brainwave Jr.) of the Stargirl TV series, based on the Geoff Johns and Lee Moder co-created character that spun out of Robinson's own co-creation, Jack Knight aka \\"Starman\\", son of Ted Knight aka (the original) \\"Starman\\" created by Gardner Fox and Jack Burnley (as referenced above). Critical reception Robinson's book London's Dark: A tale of love & war, life, death (& afterlife) (1989) has been named one of the 500 \\"essential\\" graphic novels, as it was \\"at the vanguard [...] of British graphic novels as a whole\\" although it was \\"a very raw work, full of experimentation\\". Personal life Robinson lived in Los Angeles, where he was good friends with fellow writers and collaborators Geoff Johns and Sterling Gates. In 2009, he and Jann Jones, co-ordinating editor of the Johnny DC comics imprint, announced their engagement. They have since relocated to San Francisco and married. Awards James Robinson received an Inkpot Award in 2012.

He served as the tenth Chief Justice of New Zealand from 1978 to 1989, Early life and family Born in Kaponga on 16 November 1920, Davison was the son of Joseph James Davison and Florence Minnie Davison (n√©e McCleland). He was educated at Te Kuiti District High School. During World War II, he served with the New Zealand Army (1941‚Äì1942) and Royal New Zealand Air Force (1942‚Äì1945), before compleing a Bachelor of Laws degree at Auckland University College in 1947. In 1948, Davison married Jacqueline May Carr, and the couple had three children, including Paul Davison , a barrister who prosecuted, among other cases, the trial of Scott Watson for the disappearance of Ben Smart and Olivia Hope in the Marlborough Sounds on 1 January 1998.  Career  Davison presided over the case of the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior. His sentence of 10 years jail for the French secret service agents was highly applauded, and he made a memorable statement: > People who come to this country and commit terrorist activities cannot > expect to have a short holiday at the expense of our Government and return > home as heroes. When The New Zealand Herald celebrated its 150th birthday in November 2013, they named a \\"New Zealander of the Year\\" for each year of their history. Davison was their New Zealander of the Year for 1985 for his conduct during the trial of the French secret service agents. Davison headed the government inquiry (1994‚Äì1997) into certain matters related to overseas company taxation, popularly known as the Winebox Inquiry. This involved allegations against a number of parties including the merchant bank Fay Richwhite. He also presided over the 1994 inquiry into the Family court proceedings involving the Bristol family, which resulted in a number of changes being made to New Zealand's child protection legislation. In the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours, Davison was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public services. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 11 February 1978, just after his appointment as Chief Justice. Also in 1978, he was appointed to the Privy Council.

In this role he developed his batting to such an extent that for a brief period he became an England regular and even captained them in one match as a deputy for Bob Wyatt. However, he unexpectedly completely gave up cricket soon after that, to the dismay of his country and county. Biography Walters was born Bedlinog, Glamorgan, Wales. Originally from Neath Grammar School, he first played for Glamorgan as a seventeen-year-old in 1923. Although he only made one score of over fifty in three full seasons, Glamorgan's batting was of such a standard that he remained in the eleven, especially with his energetic fielding. The following year, his business as a surveyor and architect kept him out of the team in the first half of the season, but on returning he improved phenomenally with 116 in his first match against Warwickshire and 114 against Leicestershire. These innings showed him as a classically graceful batsman with many strokes and led to him being seen as an England prospect. However, business prevented Walters playing in 1927 after May, and Worcestershire, interested in having a permanent secretary, saw him as an ideal candidate. He accepted the position of secretary to that county in 1928 and, despite playing without success for Glamorgan in a few matches that year, began a period of qualification for Worcestershire. Though his sole first-class match in 1929 was for Wales against the MCC, when qualified in 1930 Walters' batting helped Worcestershire rise from perennial wooden-spooners to a respectable position. The following year Walters became captain of Worcestershire, and he advanced steadily despite his team falling off and two very wet summers, scoring over 1,500 runs in 1932 including 190 against Warwickshire. However, it was not until 1933 that Walters entered the front rank of batsmen. Whereas he had hit only one century in each of his first three seasons at Worcestershire, that year he hit a county-record nine centuries. With the Nawab of Pataudi, Maurice Nichol and Harold Gibbons Walters gave Worcestershire a quartet of batsmen who contributed twenty-five centuries between them. Although Worcestershire won only two games because of deplorable bowling, with Herbert Sutcliffe suffering a surprise decline, Walters was chosen to open the batting in all three Tests against the touring West Indians. With scores of 51 and 46 in the first two Tests he did not disappoint, and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1934. In the following series in India Walters definitely established himself as England's first choice opening bat, averaging 71 for six innings. Although he was unsuccessful captaining England at Trent Bridge in 1934, Walters went from strength to strength as a batsman, scoring 2,000 runs for the second successive year and over 400 runs in the five Tests. 1935 started well, but after a month Walters broke down in health and was advised to take a long rest. However, 271 runs in two matches on returning had him selected for the last Test at Kennington Oval but he had to withdraw as his health broke down again. Overall, he had a remarkable record in Test cricket of having reached 40 in twelve of his eighteen innings. At the end of 1935 Walters resigned as secretary and captain of Worcestershire, but said he still hoped to play for the county as often as possible.Brookes, Wilfrid H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack for 1936; part II, page 336. Published by John Wisden & Co. Ltd However, as it turned out, his career was already over as he concentrated on his marriage. Even when Walters did not appear in first-class cricket in 1936, however, Worcestershire believed he would play regularly in 1937Brookes, Wilfrid H.

Ltd and complement a bowling attack that in a few years had gone from woeful to excellent. However, he did not play at all, and by the end of that year Worcestershire finally knew he would not be seen in the cricket field again. He had \\"married well\\" and his wife's private income may have played a part in his not playing again. He was a sham amateur in the days of gentlemen and players. On Peggy's death in 1974 he returned to Neath, where he died. In later life Walters had difficulty watching cricket because he believed its appeal could distract him from his business duties.

Brangwyn was an artistic jack-of-all-trades. As well as paintings and drawings, he produced designs for stained glass, furniture, ceramics, table glassware, buildings and interiors, was a lithographer and woodcutter and was a book illustrator. It has been estimated that during his lifetime Brangwyn produced over 12,000 works. His mural commissions would cover over of canvas, he painted over 1,000 oils, over 660 mixed media works (watercolours, gouache), over 500 etchings, about 400 wood-engravings and woodcuts, 280 lithographs, 40 architectural and interior designs, 230 designs for items of furniture and 20 stained glass panels and windows. Brangwyn received some artistic training, probably from his father, and later from Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo and in the workshops of William Morris, but he was largely an autodidact without a formal artistic education. When, at the age of seventeen, one of his paintings was accepted at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, he was strengthened in his conviction to become an artist. Initially, he painted traditional subjects about the sea and life on the seas. His 1890 canvas, Funeral At Sea won a medal of the third class at the 1891 Paris Salon.Horner, p. 245 The murals for which Brangwyn was famous, and during his lifetime he was very famous indeed, were brightly coloured and crowded with details of plants and animals, although they became flatter and less flamboyant later in his life. Biography Frank Brangwyn c.1900 Early life and career Frank Brangwyn was born in Bruges, Belgium where his father, William Curtis Brangwyn, moved after winning a competition organised by the Belgian Guild of St Thomas and St Luke to design a parish church. His forenames were registered as Guillaume Fran√ßois. In Bruges, his father maintained a large workshop with several staff and worked on numerous civic projects as well as the parish church. William Curtis Brangwyn had been born in Buckinghamshire to a Welsh family and married Eleanor Griffiths, who was from Brecon. In 1874 the family moved back to the United Kingdom where William Curtis Brangwyn established a successful design practice. Frank Brangwyn attended Westminster City School but often played truant to spend time in his father's workshop or drawing in the South Kensington Museum. Through contacts made at the Museum, among them Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo, he obtained an apprenticeship with William Morris for whom he worked first as a glazer before undertaking embroidery and wallpaper work. At the age of seventeen, one of Brangwyn's paintings was accepted and then sold to a shipowner, at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, which strengthened him in his conviction to become an artist. Brangwyn joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and began painting seascapes. He convinced the shipowner who had bought his Royal Academy picture to let him sail on a freighter to Istanbul. This trip provided Brangwyn with the material for several notable paintings. Whereas Funeral at Sea, which won a medal at the Paris Salon in 1891 was mostly composed in grey, The Golden Horn, Constantinople was much brighter and full of colour. Although Brangwyn held his first one-man show in London in 1891, he spent most of that year and 1890 at sea, visiting Spain several times as well as returning to Istanbul and travelling to South Africa and Zanzibar. In 1892 he visited northern Spain with the Scottish artist Arthur Melville, travelling from Saragossa along the Canal Imperial de Aragon on the barge, the Santa Maria.McConkey, Kenneth & Topsfield, Charlotte (2015), Arthur Melville: Adventures in Colour, National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh, p.85 Soon Brangwyn was attracted by the light and the bright colours of these southern countries at a time when Orientalism was becoming a favoured theme for many painters. He made many paintings and drawings, particularly of Spain, Egypt, Turkey and Morocco, which he visited in 1893. This lightened his palette, a change that initially did not find critical favour but helped establish his international reputation. In 1895 the French government purchased his painting Market in Morocco. In 1895, the Parisian art dealer Siegfried Bing commissioned Brangwyn to decorate the exterior of his Galerie L'Art Nouveau, and encouraged Brangwyn into new avenues: murals, tapestry, carpet designs, posters and designs for stained glass to be produced by Louis Comfort Tiffany. In 1896 he illustrated a six-volume reprint of Edward William Lane's translation of One Thousand and One Nights.The Thousand & One Nights,: or, Arabian Nights' Entertainments. 6 Vol. Translated by Edward William Lane; with an introduction by Joseph Jacobs, and illustrations by Frank Brangwyn. London: Gibbings. Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1896. In 1917 he collaborated with the Japanese artist Urushibara Mokuchu on a series of woodblock prints. For his austere but decorative designs he was recognized by continental and American critics as a prominent artist, while British critics were puzzled as to how to evaluate him. Through his collecting Japanese works, he became friends with Kojiro Matsutaka the Japanese industrial magnate, who became his patron. Brangwyn had an affair with Ellen Kate Chesterfield, which produced a son, James Barron Chesterfield- Brangwyn, born 1885 in Mevagissey, Cornwall. James later emigrated to Australia in 1909, initially working on a farm in Townsville, Queensland and later moving to Brisbane. In 1896, Brangwyn married Lucy Ray, a nurse, who died in 1924. They had no children. He leased Temple Lodge, 51 Queen Caroline Street, Hammersmith, London from 1900 to 1937/38 and bought The Jointure, Ditchling, Sussex in 1918. Mural commissions Brangwyn was commissioned by his friend the artist Robert Hawthorn Kitson to design the dining room of Casa Cuseni, his house in Taormina, Sicily, built from 1902 to 1905. Brangwyn was responsible for the furniture, panelling, detailing and murals of the dining room. The house is now a museum.

Rockefeller, Jr. to decorate the concourse of the RCA Building in New York City (1930‚Äì34) with murals. A sequence of large murals on canvas (originally from Horton House, Northamptonshire) is held by the Dunedin Public Art Gallery, Dunedin, New Zealand and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. He was also chosen to decorate the first-class dining room of the Canadian Pacific liner, RMS Empress of Britain (1930‚Äì1931)]. World War One World War I poster for a fundraising event in support of Welsh troops. (1915) Lithograph. Digitally restored. Brangwyn's etching, Canon Street Station, was presented by founder of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra, R. Noel Middleton, in 1911 at the Leeds Art Gallery. Although Brangwyn produced more than 80 poster designs during the First World War, he was not an official war artist.Horner, p. 137 He donated most of these poster designs to charities such as the Red Cross, the Belgian and Allied Aid League, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and L'Orphelinat des Armees, an American charity supporting a French orphanage. His grim poster of a Tommy bayoneting an enemy soldier (Put Strength in the Final Blow: Buy War Bonds) caused deep offence in both Britain and Germany. The Kaiser himself is said to have put a price on Brangwyn‚Äôs head after seeing the image. In 1917 Brangwyn produced six lithographs under the title Making Sailors and one entitled The Freedom of the Seas for the Ministry of Information's Britain's Efforts and Ideals portfolio of images which were exhibited in Britain and abroad and were also sold as prints to raise money for the war effort. Brangwyn was the Chairman of the English Committee for Dixmude. Dixmude, near Ostend that had been the site of heavy fighting throughout the war. To aid its reconstruction, Brangwyn donated a series of woodcuts to the town on the theme of the Tragedy of Dixmude. During the war Brangwyn created a number of propaganda images highlighting atrocities committed against Belgium and the suffering endured by the country. Among the latter were his oil painting of 1915, Mater Dolorosa Belgica. The British Empire Panels In 1926 Brangwyn was commissioned by Lord Iveagh to paint a pair of large canvases for the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords at Westminster to commemorate those peers and their family members who had been killed in the war. Brangwyn painted two battle scenes which included life-size images of troops advancing into battle alongside a British tank. The Lords regarded the panels as too grim and disturbing and, in 1928, refused to accept them. Instead, they commissioned Brangwyn to produce a series celebrating the beauty of the British Empire and the Dominions to fill the Royal Gallery. Known as the British Empire Panels Brangwyn spent a further five years producing 16 large works that cover . However, after five of the panels were displayed in the Royal Gallery for approval by the Lords, the peers refused to accept them because they were \\"too colourful and lively\\" for the location. In 1934 the 16 panels were purchased by Swansea Council and are now housed in the Brangwyn Hall, Swansea. Later life British Empire Panels in the Brangywn Hall, Swansea The rejection of the Panels by the Lords caused a lasting depression in Brangwyn. He became increasingly pessimistic and a hypochondriac and began disposing of his possessions during the 1930s. Brangwyn donated many of his own and other artworks to museums and galleries in Britain and Europe including the British Museum and the William Morris Gallery. In 1936 he presented Bruges with over 400 works, now in the Arents House Museum. In return Bruges made him Citoyen d'Honneur de Bruges, only the third time the award had been given.Horner, p. 238 The two battle scenes rejected by the House of Lords were donated to the National Museum Wales as part of a large group of gifts he made to the Museum between 1929 and 1935. Brangwyn specified precisely where in the Museum's Main Hall the works were to be hung and they remain there today. In 1944, he recovered and secured designs by Frederic Shields for the Chapel of the Ascension built by Herbert Horne, which was destroyed in 1940 during the London Blitz. In 1950, one of his last works provided illustrations for the book Sixty Years of Yachts by Herbert Julyan, a good friend. In his final years Brangwyn lived as a recluse at Ditchling.

Brangwyn was buried in St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green. In 1952 Clifford Musgrave estimated that Brangwyn had produced over 12,000 works.Clifford Musgrave (1953) Sir Frank Brangwyn RA, The Studio, p. 136 Brangwyn's mural commissions would cover over of canvas, he painted over 1,000 oils, over 660 mixed media works (watercolours, gouache), over 500 etchings, about 400 wood engravings and woodcuts, 280 lithographs, 40 architectural and interior designs, 230 designs for furniture, and 20 stained-glass panels and windows.Libby Horner, Frank Brangwyn. A Mission to Decorate Life, The Fine Art Society & Liss Fine Art  Interpretations  The art writer Marius Gombrich links the decline of interest in Brangwyn's works to the decline of the British Empire, pointing out that Brangwyn's bold, vigorous, outward-looking art was suited to the expansive spirit of late-Victorian British society‚Äîbut inconsistent with the inward-looking, less confident, and intellectually effete ethos prevalent in the post World War I period.

He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for the Chicago Cubs from to . In his short big-league career he was an excellent fielder, already earning a Gold Glove Award; assessments of his hitting were more mixed, as he was still developing as a hitter. In , becoming the first rookie in baseball history to win a Gold Glove Award, Hubbs set several fielding records and convincingly won the 1962 National League Rookie of the Year Award. At the time of his death, Hubbs was among the best defensive second basemen in the game. Hubbs was killed at age 22 when the private plane he was piloting crashed near Provo, Utah prior to the 1964 season. Early life Hubbs was born in Riverside, California, on December 23, 1941, the son of Eulis and Dorothy Hubbs. The family resided in nearby Colton, California. Ken was the second oldest of five boys, raised with brothers Keith, Gary, and twins Kirk and Kraig. When he was a few months old, in the spring of 1942, Hubbs suffered a ruptured hernia, and wore a truss for five years until it healed while he was in kindergarten. A doctor had told the family that Hubbs \\"will never be able to do things other kids can do in sports.\\" Hubbs played in the 1954 Little League World Series, as his Colton little league team advanced and represented California.Team roster http://www.littleleague.org/series/history/rosters/1954rstr.htm California beat Virginia in the first round and Illinois in the second. In the final game of the Series, the team from Schenectady, New York beat California 5-3.LLWS scores 1954 http://www.littleleague.org/series/history/scores/1954line.htm Two future big league players played on the Schenectady team: Jim Barbieri and Billy Connors. Connors and Hubbs would become minor league teammates. Highlights of Hubbs playing defense at shortstop were captured on film.Film of '54 Colton LL team found, by John Murphy, The Sun, (San Bernardino, CA), August 15, 2004 The video includes a play where Hubbs ran from the shortstop position to back up the second baseman and caught a bloop fly into short right field. Hubbs had stepped in a hole during a picnic, just before Colton's trip to the Little League World Series, breaking his toe. Hubbs played the entire tournament with the injury, hobbling around the bases when he hit a home run. High School career At Colton High School, Hubbs was a four sport athlete. He excelled in three sports, baseball, basketball and football at a national level and also competed in track as a high jumper. Honored by the California Interscholastic Federation in all three sports, Hubbs was an All- Southern Section for two years in football, basketball and baseball, an achievement matched at the time, 1959, by only three others: Glenn Davis, Bill McColl and Marty Keough. A gifted athlete, Hubbs could pitch with either arm and at 6'2\\", could stand flat-footed under a basket, jump and dunk a basketball behind his head with both hands. In 1958-1959, he was a high school All-American in two sports, football (quarterback) and basketball. He was recruited by the University of Notre Dame to play quarterback and offered a scholarship by UCLA's John Wooden to play basketball. In 1958, in a well- publicized basketball game at Long Beach City College against Santa Maria High School, Hubbs made a half-court shot to end the first half. He followed up by scoring five points in the last 23 seconds of regulation, including a jumper at the buzzer to send the game into overtime, scoring 23 points in a Colton 53-49 win. After breaking his foot before a football game, Hubbs put his foot with a cast inside a size-14 shoe and played that Friday night. \\"Ken was undoubtedly the best football player I ever coached,\\" said Joe Lash, his football coach at Colton High School. His basketball coach, Tom Morrow, said, \\"Kenny Hubbs was the best all-around basketball player I ever saw for a boy his age.\\"\\"The Natural\\" by Bob Cunningham. Inland Empire magazine, May 1999, pg 50-53. After high school graduation in 1959, Hubbs was weighing attending college at either the University of Southern California or Brigham Young University. However, Cubs scout Gene Handley signed Hubbs to a contract that came with a $50,000 signing bonus. Baseball career =Minor leagues Hubbs signed as an amateur free agent with the Chicago Cubs prior to the 1959 season. In 1959, Hubbs played for the Morristown Cubs of the Class D Appalachian League. Playing outfield and shortstop in the all-rookie competition, Hubbs appeared in 59 games, had 198 at-bats and a batting average of .298. His 50 runs batted in and 8 home runs were enough to earn a nomination for player of the year. On July 18, 1959, he led Morristown to a 20-0 victory over the first place Salem Pirates. Hubbs hit 2 home runs and a double and scored 5 runs. Morristown continued the offensive barrage five days later against Wytheville. Hubbs started a 7-run first inning with a home run, and his team won the slugfest, 9-7.\\"Pair in Strikeout Show\\" The Sporting News, August 5, 1959, page, 42.\\"Two Long Streaks Snapped\\" The Sporting News, July 29, 1959, page 38. Organized baseball initiated a player draft in 1959, in an attempt to cut down on large signing bonuses given to young players. The Cubs' AAA club, the Fort Worth Cats of the American Association, recalled Hubbs in October and then purchased his contract outright in November. Hubbs appeared in nine games for Fort Worth, with two hits in nine at bats. This maneuvering protected Hubbs from being drafted by another club, and was a sign that the Cubs clearly expected Hubbs to make the major league team in the near future. Hubbs attended the Cubs' rookie camp in 1960 as a shortstop/outfielder, however with Ernie Banks established at shortstop, Hubbs moved to second base in 1961.\\"Cubs Tout Santo as an Outsider in Hot Sack Derby\\" The Sporting News, by Edgar Munzel, February 3, 1960, page 9. In 1960, Hubbs began the season with the Class A Lancaster Red Roses of the Eastern League, where he hit .216 with 6 home runs and 47 RBI in 97 games and 366 at bats playing under manager Phil Cavarretta. He finished 1960 by playing 38 games with the Class AA San Antonio Missions of the Texas League, hitting .220 with one home run and 9 RBI. Coach Bobby Adams was instrumental in Hubbs transition to second base. \\"He had me work on the pivot 100 times a day. I was doing it in my sleep.\\" Hubbs said of Adams. \\"Every day, Lou Klein and Bobby Adams would have me out there practicing the double play, thousands of times, I was almost ready to quit and go home. I don't know what kept me going, but I'm glad I didn‚Äôt quit. I've decided this is where I want to be.\\" Hubbs played in 1961 for the Class AA Wenatchee Chiefs of the Northwest League. With Wenatchee, Hubbs played 138 games, hitting .286 with nine home runs and 68 RBI, along with 20 doubles, six triples and nine stolen bases. Hubbs was then called up to the Chicago Cubs in September, 1961. Hubbs also committed only eight errors all season. Major league career Hubbs in 1964 During the 1961 season, the Cubs played both Don Zimmer and Jerry Kindall at second base. Zimmer made the National League All-Star team that year, and hit .252, while Kindall hit.242. Hubbs made his major league debut on September 10, 1961 against the Philadelphia Phillies, with three at-bats, two hits and one run batted in in a 12-5 Cub loss. Outfielder Lou Brock also made his debut that day for the Cubs. Overall, Hubbs played in ten games in September 1961, with five hits in 26 at-bats and one home run, at age 19. Prior to the 1962 season, the expansion New York Mets drafted Don Zimmer in the 1961 expansion draft and the Cubs subsequently traded Kindall. Their departures opened the door for the 20-year-old Hubbs to become the starting second baseman for the eventual ninth-place Cubs in . Hubbs played in 160 games in 1962 hitting .260, with 172 hits with five home runs and 49 runs batted in. He led all National League rookies in games, hits, doubles, triples, runs and batting average. On April 17, 1962, Hubbs went 5-for-5 with two runs in a 10-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. \\"Better learn how to pitch to this boy, he'll be around a long time,\\" said Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh. Hubbs was named the 1962 Rookie of the Year, earning 19 out of 20 votes. He was also named the Rookie of the year by The Sporting News, receiving 120 votes. Hubbs became the second consecutive Cubs player to win the award, after Billy Williams had won the award in 1961. The next Cub to win the award was Jerome Walton in . In the field, Hubbs was outstanding. As a rookie, he set major league records with 78 consecutive games and 418 total chances without an error, breaking Bobby Doerr's Major League records in both categories. In post season awards, Hubbs became the first rookie to win a Gold Glove Award. He also led the league in two less desirable categories that season by striking out 129 times and grounding into 20 double plays. On September 30, he started a triple play in the final game of the season against the Mets. His glove from 1962 is on display at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Partway through the 1962 season, Cubs owner Philip Wrigley called Hubbs into his office, tore up his existing contract and doubled his salary. Hubbs was well liked by his teammates, who included future Hall of Famers Billy Williams, Ernie Banks, Ron Santo and Lou Brock. Banks remembered, \\"Lots of young players do something special and you can't talk to them any more. Not Ken. One day, he got seven hits in a doubleheader. Pretty good for a rookie. But he didn't talk or act any differently than when he didn't get a hit.\\" Hubbs was known for his faith. Reporters often noted that he did not smoke or drink alcohol, and that he attended church services while on the road with the team. With Hubbs's encouragement, Ron Santo quit smoking.Mormons in the Major Leagues  by Jim Ison  Action Sports  Cincinnati  1991 pg. 66-69. \\"He was a Mormon, deeply religious, never swore, never drank, played hard, played the game,\\" reflected Santo. \\"He was talented. You knew this guy was going to be great. He would always go out with us. He wouldn't drink, but he'd have as much fun as we did.\\" In Hubbs played in 155 games and batted .235 with eight home runs and 47 runs batted in and his superior fielding helped the Cubs finish over .500 at 82-80. Death Hubbs decided to challenge a fear of flying head-on by taking flying lessons in the winter between 1963 and 1964, and received his pilot's license in January 1964. On February 12, Hubbs flew from California to Provo, Utah with his friend Denny Doyle to surprise Doyle's wife, who had recently given birth to the couple's child. That night, Hubbs played in a charity basketball game sponsored by Brigham Young University. A snow storm developed in the Utah Valley the morning of February 13. Hubbs attempted to beat the storm, and he and Doyle took off in a red and white Cessna 172 from Provo Airport. Hubbs had not filed a flight plan but told airport staff that the pair were heading for Morrow Field near Colton, California. Euliss Hubbs, Ken's father, reported that they had not arrived in Colton by Friday the 14th, prompting a search in areas of Utah, Nevada and California along the possible flight path. There was no radio contact with Hubbs after takeoff, prompting Utah's civil aeronautics director, Harlon Bement, to suspect \\"the plane could be fairly close [by].\\" The wreckage was found a quarter mile south of Bird Island in Utah Lake. Both Hubbs and Doyle died in the crash. The air temperature was estimated as -1 ¬∞F, and it had been snowing heavily. Hubbs's funeral was held several days later in his hometown of Colton. Services were held in the Colton High School Whitmer Auditorium because of the huge crowd., and the automobile procession to his burial was two miles long. Fellow Cubs Ron Santo, Ernie Banks, Glen Hobbie and Don Elston were among the pallbearers. He was buried at Montecito Memorial Park, in Colton. Santo had visited his friend and teammate in California two days before the crash and had gone up in Hubbs' plane during the visit. After parting, Santo went home to Seattle, while Hubbs headed to Provo. Santo recalled Hubbs saying, \\"When I get up there, Ron, and I fly, it's like being next to God. It's like I‚Äôm next to God.\\"Ernie Banks: The Life and Career of \\"Mr. Cub\\" Lew Freedman 2019, p. 92. . Ernie Banks said, \\"Any athlete who ever played with Hubbs will dedicate the rest of his career to Ken because he was the zenith in inspiration and enthusiasm as well as desire and determination.\\" Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Kenneth Douglass Hubbs was more than just another baseball player. He was the kind of athlete all games need. A devout Mormon, a cheerful leader, a picture-book player, blond-haired, healthy, generous with his time for young boys; he was the kind of youth in short supply in these selfish times.\\"Los Angeles Times; \\"The Pride of Colton\\" by Jim Murray, April 28, 1964 \\"There isn't a man in Chicago who wouldn't have been proud to have him as a son,\\" said Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. \\"Ken and I were both religious, we were always joking ‚Äì trying to convert each other. I'm Catholic, he was a Mormon. But after he died, I had to see a priest,\\" said Ron Santo. \\"I couldn‚Äôt understand it. I mean, he loved life. He was a great human being. This was a kid who didn't even smoke or drink. Why him?\\" Lou Boudreau, who then was a Cubs' radio announcer, said, \\"At the time he died, I felt he was on his way to a Hall of Fame career. His bat hadn't come around, but it would have.\\" \\"Kenny would have been one of the all-time greats,\\" said Don Elston. \\"Kenny was one of the to-be all-stars, Hall of Famers.\\" Billy Connors, Hubbs' Little League world series rival, became a teammate and friend in the minor leagues. Connors eventually became a long time major league pitching coach. He said of Hubbs, \\"I've seen a lot of professional players through the years, but I would describe Kenny as a perfect player. He had great talent, great makeup, an amazing will to win.\\" Personal Hubbs came from a devout Mormon family and often visited children in hospitals and spoke to church groups. Ken's older brother, Keith Hubbs, played football at Brigham Young University. Later, Keith served as President of the Ken Hubbs Foundation for 38 years and oversaw the annual selection process for the Ken Hubbs Award until his death in 2018 at age 80. Keith named his first son after his late brother and his son, Ken, threw out a first pitch at Wrigley Field in 2003. The Ken Hubbs Foundation was established shortly after his death. Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley donated gate receipts and other monies from a May 4, 1964 Cubs-Dodgers game to the foundation. The Ken Hubbs Foundation also received many donations from fans. Topps baseball mistakenly used a photo of Hubbs on its 1966 card of Cubs pitcher Dick Ellsworth. (Card 447) Honors Hubbs was awarded the 1959 Los Angeles Examiner Trophy as the ‚ÄúBest All-Around Athlete in Southern California‚Äù. After his death, the Ken Hubbs Foundation was established in his honor. Hubbs' glove used in the errorless streak in 1962 is on display at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Since 1964, the Ken Hubbs Award has been given to the best high school male athletes in the greater San Bernardino, California area. Beginning in 2012, a female athlete is also honored. Beginning in 2019, an athlete of high character is also honored. Pro Football Hall of Fame player Ronnie Lott was a recipient in 1977. Other recipients include MLB player Greg Colbrunn (1987), Olympic runner Ryan Hall (2001) and Green Bay Packers 1st round pick Kenny Clark (2013). Colton High School named their gymnasium the \\"Ken Hubbs Gymnasium\\". A collection of trophies and other memorabilia are on site. Hubbs's uniform number 16 was never retired by the Cubs, but was kept out of circulation for about three years before being issued to another player. In 1964, Topps issued a special card for Hubbs with a black band and reverse white text reading, \\"In Memoriam\\" on the card face. The card was numbered 550. On June 26, 2002, the Chicago Cubs honored Hubbs' memory, with ‚ÄúKen Hubbs Memorial‚Äù day at Wrigley Field. Fans in attendance received a replica of his 1962 Topps Rookie Baseball card.

History=1996‚Äì2014: Phantom Logo of Phantom FM until 2014. Until 2003, Phantom operated as a pirate station, staying on air the majority of the time, apart from outages caused by frequency collisions with newly licensed stations, fear of raids by Comreg, and once, the theft of their transmission equipment from Three Rock Mountain. Since 2003, they have operated as an internet radio station, and under two temporary radio contracts (2003 and 2004) from the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Funding for Phantom during their pirate era came from sponsorship and advertising from local bands and promoters and even contributions from station staff. A number of times during this period, the station went off air for licence applications. After two successful temporary licenses, Phantom applied for an alternative rock license offered by the BCI for Dublin in July 2004. They finally won a licence for an alternative rock station for Dublin in November 2004, beating the Zed FM consortium, XFM and two other applicants.*Mulally, Una \\"Phantom and Zed's rock 'n' roll radio ructions at the BCI\\", Irish Independent, 12 February 2006. Phantom's expected launch was delayed due to a legal challenges against the BCI regarding the license from Scrollside Ltd./Zed FM. An unsuccessful challenge to the High Court was followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court which was rejected on 6 April 2006.*Mulally, Una \\"Phantom Apparition\\" , Sunday tribune, 29 October 2006.

In 2010, Communicorp took a 30% stake and the station was relocated to Marconi House in January 2011 where it shares facilities with Today FM and Newstalk. A number of redundancies resulted from the move and cost cutting including the redundancies of Marketing Manager Brian Daly and Traffic Manager Laura Lee Conboy (she continued with her presenter role) along with the resignation of Chief Executive Ger Roe and the dismissal of General Manager Simon Maher. Ricky Geraghty has replaced Ger Roe as CEO and Keith Walsh has replaced Fiona Scally as Programme Director. In August 2012 it was announced that a number of weekend presenters would be leaving the station in a bid to cut costs. They include Pearl, Dee Reddy, Shane Galvin, James Byrne and Derek Byrne. Co-host of Pure Morning, Michelle Doherty also left in mid- September to pursue an acting career. Subsequently, Dee Reddy and Derek Byrne were reinstated. Keith Walsh left Phantom in December 2013 for 2FM. TXFM is operated by the holders of the Alternative Rock franchise for Dublin City and County. 2014: Job cuts and restructuring plans On 14 February 2014, the board of directors of Dublin Rock Radio Ltd, trading as Phantom 105.2 announced that up to twenty staff would be made redundant. In a statement issued to the press, managers of the station said that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland had granted permission to restructure the business \\"in order to ensure its long-term viability\\". In February 2014, it was announced that an agreement had been reached with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to restructure the station resulting in the loss of many full and part-time staff with the exception of a handful of presenters. The station would then be rebranded as TXFM with closer operational links with Today FM, also owned by Communicorp and who also broadcast from the same building. On 16 March 2014 the station ceased broadcasting as Phantom 105.2. The last live show was Power House presented by John Caddell. Back to back music was then broadcast with the station being renamed 105.2 with no reference to Phantom. The following presentation lost their jobs alongside backroom and support staff: Richie Ryan, Richie McCormack, Ray McGowan, Laura Lee Conboy, Charlotte Flood, Jack Hyland, Sinead Ni Churnain and Will St. Ledger. 2014‚Äì2016: As TXFM It was subsequently confirmed that TXFM would relaunch on 31 March 2014, with a mix of existing and new presenters. Initially, it was announced that only three of the daytime presenters would be left. In the event, more presenters were kept on. Presenters who kept their positions included John Caddell, going from weekday to weekend but appointed as PD for TXFM, Nadine O'Regan, Orlagh Donnelly, Derek Byrne, Joe Donnelly, Claire Beck, Cathal Funge and Kelly-Anne Byrne. The latter two went from being part-time presenters on Phantom to full- time presenters on TXFM. Charlotte Flood is a broadcasting assistant on Today FM. She was reinstated on TXFM in 2015. A number of new weekend and once a weeknight presenters were included in the new schedule, including musician Gavin Glass who went on to Radio NOVA. The new lineup would see presented programmes from 7am to midnight on weekdays, including nightly two-hour specialist shows from 10pm; weekends will see a mix of presenter-led and specialist shows, including a Saturday night 'indie anthems' marathon.Martin, Roy.

He was imprisoned at Tothill Field outside London over the winter of 1651‚Äì1652. He was transported to the New World in 1652 and entered into indentured servitude. His later victory over servitude became the legal precedent in Massachusetts. The Alexander Gordon line is the earliest Gordon family in the New World according to the Gordon Genealogy DNA Project, and descends from Adam de Gordoun through Sir William Gordon 1265 Laird of Strathbogie (now Huntly). Along with many other Scottish prisoners, he sailed on the ship \\"Liberty\\", commanded by Capt. James Allen to Boston, and was confined at Watertown as a prisoner of war. For a year or more Alexander remained with John Cloyes, a boatswain, or mate, of the vessel living in Cambridge on the road to Watertown‚Äînear the site of Cambridge Hospital today. While there he formed an acquaintance with Samuel Stratton of Watertown, with whom he made a six-year contract on 25 April 1653, as an apprentice, to learn the art of husbandry. This contract should have ended in 1659, but after a year's work without pay, Cloyes sold Alexander, like chattel, to Samuel Stratton in Watertown as a \\"husbandry apprentice.\\" The term apprentice was used in name only. As news of the first consignment spread, further consignments of this virtually free workforce were shipped to America and used in the towns of Massachusetts and adjacent provinces. These \\"apprentices\\" were sold to planters and mill owners; the usual term of service was six years. Those who engaged in such traffic obscured it with the euphemism \\"apprenticeship.\\" The idea was that this label would encourage the masters not to drive their helpless servants to the point of ill treatment. On 3 November 1663, through the kindness of a resident of Cambridge, Alexander appealed again to the court in Massachusetts and was released from his contract. His six-year contract with Samuel Stratton ended on paper in 1659. But Alexander was forced to continue working until November 1663 when he won his freedom in a landmark court case in Massachusetts. Alexander made his way to New Hampshire, where in the company of other Scots ex-prisoners, he helped found the town of Exeter. He found employment at the sawmill of Nicholas Lisson. At 28, Alexander Gordon married the owner's daughter, Mary Lisson (19) and became the forefather of the extensive Gordon family in New England. Notable New Hampshire Gordons descending from Alexander include U.S. Representative for New Hampshire William Gordon, Rhode Island State Representative Daniel P. Gordon Jr., and founder of Gordon College (Massachusetts), Adoniram Judson Gordon. Alexander Gordon died in 1697.

He also served a Vogt (reeve) of the Lambach, Traunkirchen, Oberm√ºnster, and Persenbeug monasteries and was co-founder of Admont Abbey. From 1056, he appeared as margrave of the Carantanian march, later to be known as the March of Styria (, after the town of Steyr, where Ottokar was count). In the rising Investiture Controversy he remained a loyal supporter of King Henry IV. Ottokar died in Rome, while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Marriage and children He married Willibirg of Eppenstein, possibly a daughter of Duke Adalbero of Carinthia. The later margraves Adalbero and Ottokar II were his sons.

Otakar was Count of Steyr in the Traungau, in what is today Upper Austria. Together with Margrave Luitpold, he may have been killed at the 907 Battle of Pressburg. His descendant Ottokar I (died 1064), Count in the Chiemgau, became ruler of the Carantanian march in 1056. The Carantanian march, then subject to the Duchy of Carinthia, was subsequently named March of Styria () after the dynasty's original seat at Steyr. In 1180 Margrave Ottokar IV gained the ducal title from Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, thereby establishing the Duchy of Styria. The reign of the Otakars however ended with the extinction of the line upon Duke Ottokar's death in 1192.

It was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, California. It is found predominantly in potting soil and compost. In humans, the infection is sometimes called Pontiac fever. Human infection from L. longbeachae is particularly common in Australia, but cases have been documented in other countries including the United States, Japan, Greece and the UK. The infection can be very serious, often leading to hospitalisation and sometimes death. Like other Legionella species, person-to-person transmission has not been documented. However, unlike other species, the primary transmission mode has not been proven but it seems likely that it is inhalation or aspiration of dust from contaminated compost or soil that contains the organism causing legionellosis. Modes of transmission include poor hand-washing practices after gardening, long-term smoking, and being near dripping hanging flower pots. Awareness of a possible health risk with potting mix protected against illness. Inhalation and ingestion are possible modes of transmission. Exposure to aerosolized organisms and poor gardening hygiene may be important predisposing factors to L. longbeachae infection. Compost and potting mix warning labels Compost must be handled with care, damped down with water to reduce dust before handling, and use of a face mask covering the nose and mouth to reduce the risk of inhaling the dust is needed, especially for those at high risk from infection. Studies advocate the introduction of an industry standard that ensures the use of face masks when handling potting mix and attaching masks and warning labels to potting mix bags sold to the public. Compost packaging in Australia has an L. longbeachae warning label. The New South Wales state government recommends that people reduce exposure to potting mix dust by following the manufacturers' warning present on potting mix labels, including: * Wetting down the potting mix to reduce the dust * Wearing gloves and a P2 mask when using potting mix * Washing hands after handling potting mix or soil, and before eating, drinking or smoking Symptoms Early symptoms include fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, sometimes dry cough, and muscle aches and pain. Most people who breathe in the bacteria do not become ill. The risk of disease is increased with age, smoking, and in people with weakened immune systems.

In the early 1980s he was a member of The Medway Poets. In 1999 he named and co-founded the Stuckists art movement with Billy Childish. He has curated Stuckist shows, organised demonstrations against the Turner Prize, run an art gallery, stood for parliament and reported Charles Saatchi to the OFT. He is frequently quoted in the media as an opponent of conceptual art. He was briefly married to artist Stella Vine. Early life Charles Thomson was born in Romford, London Borough of Havering, East London, and educated at Brentwood School, Essex, where he was a classmate of Douglas Adams. While still at school, he organised mixed media arts events and contributed to Broadsheet, a magazine edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone and published by Artsphere, a school arts group.Broadsheet, n.d., edited Paul Johnstone, Artsphere Outside school, he started the Havering Arts Lab. this resulted in a headline \\"Sex Orgy Tale‚ÄîGroup Banned\\" in the local Havering Express newspaper. In 1970 he produced a satirical magazine, called 'Lubricant', which ran for 10 issues. In 1971 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Dwarf candidate in the Havering council elections, and was involved in anti-pollution protests. He distributed \\"underground\\" magazines around London, including \\"Schoolkids OZ\\". In 1975 he went to Maidstone College of Art, where he was the only person in ten years to fail the painting degree. 1979‚Äì87 he worked part-time as a telephonist and receptionist at Kent County Ophthalmic and Aural Hospital. 1987‚Äì99 he was a full-time poet, with work in over 100 anthologies.Milner, Frank, ed., The Stuckists Punk Victorian, p.106, National Museums Liverpool, 2004, The Medway Poets Sexton Ming, Tracey Emin, Charles Thomson, Billy Childish and musician Russell Wilkinson at the Rochester Adult Education Centre 11 December 1987 to record The Medway Poets LP In 1979, Thomson was a founder member of The Medway Poets, a punk performance group, who read in pubs, as well as the Kent Literature Festival and the 1981 international Cambridge Poetry Festival. There were, however, personality clashes in the group, particularly between Billy Childish and Thomson, who said, \\"There was friction between us, especially when he started heckling my poetry reading and I threatened to ban him from a forthcoming TV documentary.\\"Interview with Charles Thomson on 3ammagazine.com However, a TV South documentary on the group in 1982 brought them to a wider regional audience.

In 1987 Thomson printed her first book of writing, Turkish Tales, which had been edited by Lewis and was published by Childish.Milner p.8 Stuckism A Long Way from Greece In 1999 Thomson was reconciled with Childish and together they founded the Stuckists art group with eleven other artists. Thomson coined the name \\"Stuckism\\" after an insult from Tracey Emin to ex-boyfriend Childish that he was \\"stuck\\", which Childish had recorded in a 1993 poem. The group stated its aims as promoting figurative painting and opposing conceptual art, being particularly critical of the Turner Prize and Charles Saatchi's promotion of Britart. Childish left the group in 2001 and Thomson remained as the figurehead, gaining extensive media coverage for his activities and outspoken views. In the meantime the Stuckists grew to a worldwide movement of over 100 groups in 30 countries. From 2000 to 2005 he staged yearly Stuckist demonstrations against the Turner Prize (making use of props such as clown costumes and blow-up sex dolls). He stood in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, as a Stuckist candidate against the then-Culture Secretary, Chris Smith. The same year he exhibited the then- unknown artist, Stella Vine (later made famous by Charles Saatchi). The couple married in New York and separated after two months. The Stuckism International Gallery, Shoreditch, London Thomson opened the Stuckism International Gallery in Shoreditch (2002‚Äì2005). In 2004 he reported Saatchi to the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) for alleged unfair trading practices in the art world: the complaint was not upheld. He co-curated the Stuckists' first major exhibition in a public gallery, The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery, for the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. In 2005 he offered of a donation of 175 paintings by Stuckists artists from the Walker Gallery show to the Tate Gallery: this was rejected by the trustees. Later that year he obtained, under the Freedom of Information Act, Tate Gallery minutes about the purchase of a trustee Chris Ofili's work The Upper Room.

It is a Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra for which the generalized Cartan matrix is positive semi-definite and has corank 1. From purely mathematical point of view, affine Lie algebras are interesting because their representation theory, like representation theory of finite dimensional, semisimple Lie algebras is much better understood than that of general Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras. As observed by Victor Kac, the character formula for representations of affine Lie algebras implies certain combinatorial identities, the Macdonald identities. Affine Lie algebras play an important role in string theory and two-dimensional conformal field theory due to the way they are constructed: starting from a simple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}, one considers the loop algebra, L\\\\mathfrak{g}, formed by the \\\\mathfrak{g}-valued functions on a circle (interpreted as the closed string) with pointwise commutator. The affine Lie algebra \\\\hat{\\\\mathfrak{g}} is obtained by adding one extra dimension to the loop algebra and modifying a commutator in a non-trivial way, which physicists call a quantum anomaly (in this case, the anomaly of the WZW model) and mathematicians a central extension. More generally, if œÉ is an automorphism of the simple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} associated to an automorphism of its Dynkin diagram, the twisted loop algebra L_\\\\sigma\\\\mathfrak{g} consists of \\\\mathfrak{g}-valued functions f on the real line which satisfy the twisted periodicity condition f(x+2œÄ) = œÉ f(x). Their central extensions are precisely the twisted affine Lie algebras. The point of view of string theory helps to understand many deep properties of affine Lie algebras, such as the fact that the characters of their representations transform amongst themselves under the modular group.  Affine Lie algebras from simple Lie algebras = Definition  If \\\\mathfrak{g} is a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra, the corresponding affine Lie algebra \\\\hat{\\\\mathfrak{g}} is constructed as a central extension of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}[t,t^{-1}], with one-dimensional center \\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}c. As a vector space, : \\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak{g}}=\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}[t,t^{-1}]\\\\oplus\\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}c, where \\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}[t,t^{-1}] is the complex vector space of Laurent polynomials in the indeterminate t. The Lie bracket is defined by the formula : [a\\\\otimes t^n+\\\\alpha c, b\\\\otimes t^m+\\\\beta c]=[a,b]\\\\otimes t^{n+m}+\\\\langle ab\\\\rangle n\\\\delta_{m+n,0}c for all a,b\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex} and n,m\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}, where [a,b] is the Lie bracket in the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} and \\\\langle\\\\cdot \\\\cdot\\\\rangle is the Cartan-Killing form on \\\\mathfrak{g}. The affine Lie algebra corresponding to a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra is the direct sum of the affine Lie algebras corresponding to its simple summands. There is a distinguished derivation of the affine Lie algebra defined by : \\\\delta (a\\\\otimes t^m+\\\\alpha c) = t{d\\\\over dt} (a\\\\otimes t^m). The corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra is defined by adding an extra generator d satisfying [d,A] = Œ¥(A) (a semidirect product). Constructing the Dynkin diagrams The Dynkin diagram of each affine Lie algebra consists of that of the corresponding simple Lie algebra plus an additional node, which corresponds to the addition of an imaginary root. Of course, such a node cannot be attached to the Dynkin diagram in just any location, but for each simple Lie algebra there exists a number of possible attachments equal to the cardinality of the group of outer automorphisms of the Lie algebra. In particular, this group always contains the identity element, and the corresponding affine Lie algebra is called an untwisted affine Lie algebra. When the simple algebra admits automorphisms that are not inner automorphisms, one may obtain other Dynkin diagrams and these correspond to twisted affine Lie algebras. { class=wikitable width=660 + Dynkin diagrams for affine Lie algebras - align=center valign=top360px The set of extended (untwisted) affine Dynkin diagrams, with added nodes in green 300px \\"Twisted\\" affine forms are named with (2) or (3) superscripts. (k is the number of nodes in the graph) } Classifying the central extensions The attachment of an extra node to the Dynkin diagram of the corresponding simple Lie algebra corresponds to the following construction. An affine Lie algebra can always be constructed as a central extension of the loop algebra of the corresponding simple Lie algebra. If one wishes to begin instead with a semisimple Lie algebra, then one needs to centrally extend by a number of elements equal to the number of simple components of the semisimple algebra. In physics, one often considers instead the direct sum of a semisimple algebra and an abelian algebra \\\\mathbb{\\\\Complex}^n. In this case one also needs to add n further central elements for the n abelian generators. The second integral cohomology of the loop group of the corresponding simple compact Lie group is isomorphic to the integers. Central extensions of the affine Lie group by a single generator are topologically circle bundles over this free loop group, which are classified by a two-class known as the first Chern class of the fibration. Therefore, the central extensions of an affine Lie group are classified by a single parameter k which is called the level in the physics literature, where it first appeared. Unitary highest weight representations of the affine compact groups only exist when k is a natural number. More generally, if one considers a semi-simple algebra, there is a central charge for each simple component. Representation theory The representation theory for affine Lie algebras is usually developed using Verma modules. Just as in the case of semi-simple Lie algebras, these can be gotten as the highest weight modules. There are no finite-dimensional representations; this follows from the fact that the null vectors of a finite- dimensional Verma module are necessarily zero; whereas those for the affine Lie algebras are not. Roughly speaking, this follows because the Killing form is Lorentzian in the c,\\\\delta directions, thus (z, \\\\bar{z}) are sometimes called \\"lightcone coordinates\\" on the string. The \\"radially ordered\\" current operator products can be understood to be time-like normal ordered by taking z=\\\\exp(\\\\tau + i\\\\sigma) with \\\\tau the time-like direction along the string world sheet and \\\\sigma the spatial direction. Weyl group and characters The Weyl group of an affine Lie algebra can be written as a semi-direct product of the Weyl group of the zero-mode algebra (the Lie algebra used to define the loop algebra) and the coroot lattice. The Weyl character formula of the algebraic characters of the affine Lie algebras generalizes to the Weyl- Kac character formula. A number of interesting constructions follow from these. One may construct generalizations of the Jacobi theta function. These theta functions transform under the modular group. The usual denominator identities of semi-simple Lie algebras generalize as well; because the characters can be written as \\"deformations\\" or q-analogs of the highest weights, this led to many new combinatoric identities, include many previously unknown identities for the Dedekind eta function. These generalizations can be viewed as a practical example of the Langlands program. Applications Due to the Sugawara construction, the universal enveloping algebra of any affine Lie algebra has the Virasoro algebra as a subalgebra. This allows affine Lie algebras to serve as symmetry algebras of conformal field theories such as WZW models or coset models. As a consequence, affine Lie algebras also appear in the worldsheet description of string theory.

He attended Harbord Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario,Sweethearts, The Builders, The Mob and the Men, page 6 ‚Äì author Catherine Wismer () and briefly attended the University of Western Ontario before he dropped out to become a newspaper reporter. He said, \\"I was a reporter on the street at 19 and never went to college.\\" Career Safer began his journalism career as a reporter for various newspapers in Ontario (Woodstock Sentinel-Review, London Free Press, and Toronto Telegram) and England in 1955 (Reuters and Oxford Mail). Later, he joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as a correspondent and producer. International news and war correspondent One of his first jobs with CBC was to produce CBC News Magazine in 1956, where his first on-screen appearance as a journalist was covering the Suez Crisis in Egypt. Still with the CBC, in 1961 he worked from London where he was assigned to cover major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the Algerian War of independence from France. Also in 1961, he was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin at the time the Communists began building the Berlin Wall. In 1964, CBS hired Safer as a London-based correspondent. He worked from the same desk that had once been used by Edward R. Murrow. The following year, in 1965, he became the first full-time staff reporter of the CBS News bureau in Saigon to cover the growing military conflict in Vietnam. By 1967 he was made the CBS bureau chief in London where his news stories covered numerous global conflicts, including the Nigerian Civil War, the Arab- Israeli war of 1967, and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. With the help of some clandestine skills, Safer and his news team became the first United States journalists to report from inside Communist China, broadcast in 1967 as a Special CBS News Report, \\"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\\". Safer's 1965 Vietnam broadcast, \\"The Burning of Cam Ne,\\" was notable and controversial because he had accompanied a company of Marines to the village for what was described as a \\"search and destroy\\" mission. When the Marines arrived, they were fired on by snipers. They told the inhabitants to evacuate the village, which the Marines then burned down. Safer's report was among the earliest to paint a bleak picture of the Vietnam War, showing apparently innocent civilians as victims. However, many American military and political leaders judged the story to be harmful to United States interests and criticized CBS News for showing it.Laurence, John. The Cat from Hue: A Vietnam War Story, Public Affairs (2002) ebook United States President Lyndon Johnson reacted to this report angrily, calling CBS's president and accusing Safer and his colleagues of having undermined America's role there.Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2005, Pacifica Radio/UC Berkeley Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests in the San Francisco Bay Area & Beyond Some ex-Marines who saw Safer's story on television during the war shared President Johnson's opinion. They claim that Safer never had time to be properly briefed on the operation, and was therefore not aware that four Marines had already been killed there and twenty-seven wounded.Coram, Robert. Brute: The Life of Victor Krulak, U.S. Marine, Little, Brown (2010) ebook Ex-Marine Larry Engelmann, author of a story on the Vietnam War, claimed Safer's story was \\"highly sensational\\". Justifying collective punishment, he alleged: \\"The fact is that this village had been a pretty tough village and these people had been warned repeatedly that the village would be torched if they continued to shoot at Marines... But there was none of that in Morley Safer's story.\\"Engelmann, Larry. Tears Before the Rain: An Oral History of the Fall of South Vietnam, Oxford Univ. Press (1990) p. 187. In the PBS series, Reporting America At War, Safer himself said, \\"...the denials themselves were absurd. [Officials claimed] I had gone on a practice operation in a model village ‚Äî a village the Marines had built to train guys how to move into a village. Or the whole thing was a kind of \\"Potemkin\\" story that I had concocted. There are still people who believe that.\\"http://www.pbs.org/weta/reportingamericaatwar/reporters/safer/camne.html After the incident was broadcast, Marines were forbidden from burning any more villages. While reporting another story from Vietnam, Safer and two CBS cameramen were shot down in a helicopter by Vietcong ground fire, although they all escaped serious injury.Rader, Peter. Mike Wallace: A Life, Macmillan (2012) ebook Brig. Gen. Joe Stringham, who commanded a Green Beret unit with Safer reporting, commented that Safer \\"was all business and he reported what he saw. ...We looked at eternity right in the face a couple of times...and he was as cool as a hog on ice.\\" Safer received an Emmy Award in 1971 for his investigation and reporting of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Although the war reports were consistently broadcast on television, Safer said it was the country's inability to clearly explain to the public why they were at war that became the main source of people's \\"disillusionment\\": During his career as a war correspondent, Safer covered over nine wars. He authored the bestselling book, Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam. It describes his 1989 return to Vietnam and features his interviews with known and less-well-known Vietnamese people, most of them veterans of the war.Flashbacks, Safer, 1991, St Martins Press / Random House His trip was the basis of a 60 Minutes show in 1989, which Safer said got a reaction of annoyance from some veterans, and a positive reaction from others.CSPAN booknotes: Flashbacks from vietnam, 1990, Brian Lamb / Morley Safer 60 Minutes reporter In 1970, CBS producer Don Hewitt asked Safer to replace Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes, as Reasoner had just left to anchor the ABC Evening News. Hewitt had created 60 Minutes, and he was, according to Diane Sawyer, the program's \\"guiding, self-renewing, revitalizing genius.\\"\\"Playboy Interview, Playboy magazine, March 1985. Safer, who had been covering the funeral of Charles de Gaulle in Paris,Hewitt, Don. Tell Me A Story: 50 Years and 60 Minutes in Television, Public Affairs (2001) p. 121. accepted the new position and joined 60 Minutes. The show had by then aired for only two seasons, and Safer, who had until that time reported and traveled alone, recalls that he accepted the new position on condition that if the show failed, he would be given his old job back: \\"I was the new kid, with a lot of pressure, because we were trying something new. We were utterly unheard of. I was utterly a stranger to working in a head office.\\" Until that new position, says Safer, \\"my staff, when I was abroad, consisted of only me.\\" Over the subsequent decades, along with Safer, the other veteran reporters for the program included Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, Walter Cronkite, Ed Bradley, Charles Kuralt, Diane Sawyer and Bob Simon. Reasoner had also returned to do some 60 Minutes segments before he retired. Safer's style of interviewing was consistently done in a friendly and gentlemanly manner, which gave him the ability to ask penetrating questions that average viewers might ask. He was persistent in the pursuit of facts needed to support the accuracy of his stories. While he often added his own point of view to reports, Safer always maintained high professional standards, a style that helped establish the tone of 60 Minutes shows. He typed stories on his manual typewriter even after computers were in common use. To investigate and write his 60 Minutes stories, Safer often traveled as much as 200,000 miles a year. Hewitt credited Safer with having a \\"great eye for stories\\", whether they were sympathetic or tough. He could write about offbeat subjects to give the show flavor, such as a piece he did in Finland about the Finns' obsession with the tango dance. Or he could write a hardcore report, such as one which helped save the life of a black man imprisoned in Texas. For that 1983 story, about Lenell Geter, a 25-year-old black aerospace engineer serving a life sentence for robbery, Safer sifted through details of the case and found factual inconsistencies and implied racial biases. After Safer's report was broadcast, Geter was subsequently released.\\"How Morley Safer‚Äôs dogged reporting saved a black aerospace engineer‚Äôs life\\", Vox Identities, May 19, 2016. During his 60-year career as a broadcast journalist, Safer had received numerous awards, including twelve Emmys, such as the Lifetime Achievement Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 1966. He received that award when he was only 35, although it was usually given after someone's lifetime achievement. Including his three Overseas Press Awards, three Peabody Awards, two Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, and the Paul White Award from the Radio- Television News Directors Association, Safer had won every major award given in broadcast journalism.\\"Newsman Morley Safer Dies At 84: ‚Äô60 Minutes‚Äô Star Helped Change War Reporting\\", Deadline, May 19, 2016. 60 Minutes became the most-watched and most profitable program in television history. In addition to the Gulf of Tonkin report, he also won Emmys for other 60 Minutes programs, including \\"Pops\\" (1979); \\"Teddy Kollek's Jerusalem\\" (1979); Investigative Journalism \\"Air Force Surgeon\\" (1982); and Correspondent \\"It Didn't Have to Happen\\" (1982). In 1994 he hosted a CBS News Special, One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer, which marked Kuralt's retirement from CBS. Safer's remarks at the time of President Reagan's death brought charges of liberal bias. Safer said regarding Reagan: \\"I don't think history has any reason to be kind to him.\\"http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/the-crusader-ronald-reagan-and- the-fall-of-communism He retired after 46 years with CBS, a week before his death; by then Safer had set the record for the show's longest-serving correspondent. A few days after he retired, CBS broadcast an hour-long special, Morley Safer: A Reporter's Life.video: \\"Morley Safer: A Reporter's Life\\", CBS News, May 15, 2016, 44 min. The Morley Safer Award for Outstanding Reporting In January 2019, the Morley Safer Award was created and sent out its inaugural call for entries. A program of The University of Texas at Austin‚Äôs Briscoe Center for American History, where Safer‚Äôs archival papers are preserved, the Safer Award seeks to recognize a story or series of stories of creativity, vision and integrity. The award is presented at a luncheon in Manhattan each fall. Personal life He married Jane Fearer, an anthropology student, in 1968 in London, where he was serving as bureau chief for CBS News. Their daughter, Sarah Alice Anne Safer, is a 1992 graduate of Brown University and a freelance journalist. Safer maintained dual Canadian/American citizenship. Death Safer died at his New York home from pneumonia on May 19, 2016, just eight days after announcing his retirement from 60 Minutes following 46 seasons with the show. Four days prior to his death, CBS aired a special 60 Minutes episode covering Safer's 61-year journalism career. Safer was laid to rest at Roselawn Avenue Cemetery in Toronto.

It is located in Braniewo County and had a population of 2,975 in 2004.  History =Middle Ages Pieniƒô≈ºno Castle, Nicolaus Copernicus' home in 1518-19 During the Middle Ages, an Old Prussian fort called Malcekuke, loosely translated as \\"woods of the subterraneous\\" or \\"devil's ground\\", was located near the current site of Pieniƒô≈ºno. This was linguistically corrupted by German settlers to Mehlsack, meaning \\"flour sack\\", and then by Poles to Melzak. In the 14th century it was founded as a town west of Heilsberg (Lidzbark) in Warmia. The town's coat of arms depicts three bags of flour spaced in between a golden sword and a silver key, all on a blue background. The website recalls a story that the inhabitants defied a Swedish siege in the 17th century by spilling their last sack of flour as a deception to convince them that they still had plenty of food left. The Teutonic Knights built an Ordensburg castle near Malcekuke in 1302. Both the castle and the town which developed nearby were destroyed during warfare between the Teutonic Order and the Kingdom of Poland in 1414. During the Thirteen Years' War, Mehlsack surrendered to the Order, and the castle burned down during Poland's recapture of the town. Modern era Nicolaus Copernicus was an administrator for the districts of Olsztyn and Melzak for a few years in the early 16th century. From October 1518 - March 1519 Copernicus was based out of the castle while he settled nearby villages. From 1589-1599, Prince Andrew Cardinal B√°thory of Transylvania, nephew of Polish King Stephen B√°thory, was the administrator for the castle. In 1550, the Prussian army laid siege to the city and partially burned it down. Historical seminary The town was captured by Swedish troops in 1626 during the Polish-Swedish War of 1625-29, recovered by Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Rewera Potocki, and then had its castle partially destroyed by Swedish troops in 1627. The town hall, dating from the 14th century and rebuilt in the 15th century, was destroyed during the Swedish occupation in 1626. It was rebuilt in 1666, but burnt in a fire the same year, only to be rebuilt again in 1770. The castle was restyled in 1640 with Baroque gables, and its function changed from being a fortress to being a ch√¢teau. Tower of the former Lutheran church The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, and administered in the Province of East Prussia the following year. It became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. During the 19th and 20th centuries the castle lost some of its Gothic and Baroque features, and in 1870 its eastern and southern wings were demolished after extensive deterioration. The remainder of the castle was used as administrative offices for Prussian officials. From 1920-31 the western wing was renovated so the castle could be used as a school and museum. In 1945, near the end of World War II, Mehlsack, including its castle, was 90 per cent destroyed by fighting and was conquered by the Soviet Red Army. The town was placed under Polish administration under border changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the postwar Potsdam Conference. Most of the remaining German-speaking residents were expelled and replaced with Poles, many of whom had themselves been expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The town was renamed from Mehlsack to Pieniƒô≈ºno after Seweryn Pieniƒô≈ºny (1890-1940), an editor for the Polish-language newspaper Gazeta Olszty≈Ñska in Olsztyn, imprisoned and murdered by the Germans during World War II.

The party supported states' rights and increased Southern cultural and regionalist activism. The party was formed by the League of the South in 1999 and experienced moderate success following the framing of the Asheville Declaration, which was touted by the party as a second Declaration of Independence. Despite its initial success, the Southern Party was disbanded in 2003 following internal factionalism; all that exists of the Southern Party today are the remnants of its state chapters in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Mississippi. History The merits of a political party representing the regional interests of the Southern United States and border states were first discussed in December 1998 by James Lancaster, George Kalas (both of whom have since renounced and left the Southern movement) and Michael Hill at a League of the South conference held in Monroe, Louisiana. The League authorized the formation of a Southern Party Exploratory Committee (SPEC), which was organized at a later meeting in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which was held in January 1999. During this meeting Kalas was elected to chair the committee. The Southern Party achieved its first electoral victory on August 22, 2000 when party member Wayne Willingham was elected to the nonpartisan office of Mayor of West Point, Alabama. The SPEC operated until May 1999, when internal disagreements over ideology and strategy, exacerbated by personal animosities among some members of the committee, led to the fracture of the SPEC into two competing factions. One faction, which continued to operate under the name SPEC, remained loosely affiliated with the League, while the other faction, led by Kalas, Jerry Baxley, and Thomas Reed, among others, formed the Southern National Committee (SNC). Its purpose was to launch the Southern Party as soon as possible. Continued disagreements between the SNC-led faction and the League of the South prompted the SNC to vote for a formal break with the League in May 1999. While the decision to break with the League was influenced by many factors, the leadership of the SNC faction also had become increasingly concerned about the League of the South's apparent unwillingness to purge elements from its ranks that had become more vocal and seemingly more influential within the previous few months before the break. The SPEC and SNC factions continued to compete for the allegiance of Southern political activists throughout the spring and summer of 1999. While the SPEC faction continued to enjoy the official support of the League of the South, it appeared to gain little political traction as the date of the SNC-sponsored launch of the Asheville Declaration approached.  Launch of the Asheville Declaration The highlight of the launch of the Asheville Declaration was the presentation of flags of the Southern states and the reading and signing of the Asheville Declaration,Southern Party of the South West Archives ‚Äì Asheville Declaration August 7, 1999 which articulated the SP's paleoconservative founding philosophy. The National Convention called for state conventions. In October 1999, the NCSP held a statewide convention in Hillsdale, the first capital of North Carolina, at a colonial inn dating back to before the American Revolution. The chairman was Dr. Douglas Schell, Professor of Management. There were 78 people in attendance. The Asheville Declaration was adopted by the Convention as well as the State Party Platform. The Convention's theme was \\"A Second American Revolution.\\" There was statewide media coverage including a 20-minute segment on NC Public TV.  Position on secession  The party advocated peaceful secession of the Southern States from the American union and the restoration of an independent Southern nation. The party believed this was a real and achievable goal, though they did not know whether it could be achieved in the short-term or in the long-term. In the interim, they believed in working toward a devolution of powers from the Federal Government to state governments. The Southern Party disbanded around 2002, primarily due to infighting and fractures that developed among the party leaders. A \\"Southern Parties of the Southwest\\", operating in Arizona, had 120 members in Arizona and New Mexico. It was not affiliated with the SP organization. However the Southern Parties of the Southwest was disbanded, after the founder and long- time Chairman Charles Goodson was replaced in an election in 2005. Goodson declined to run for re-election citing personal and financial reasons, and claimed that he was not interested anymore in the Chairman seat. After the elections, the party membership decided to merge with the Confederate Party of Arizona, the Southern Parties of the Southwest was dissolved.  Factionism  Despite its initial media success at Flat Rock, North Carolina, the SP soon squandered its momentum, falling to the same type of internal squabbling that resulted in the earlier rift within SPEC ranks. The rift was sparked by disagreement over a proposed increase in SNC dues for state party organizations. While seemingly a mundane administrative matter, it soon escalated out of control, culminating in a deep and irreconcilable split of the SNC into two factions ‚Äì one led by party Chairman George Kalas, the other by party Vice-Chairman Jerry Baxley. A protracted power struggle ensued for control of the party's Web site, treasury and state-party organizational affiliations. In December 1999, SNC chairman George Kalas tried to end the bickering by voluntarily resigning his post. The SNC reluctantly accepted the resignation, though voting to recognize Kalas as \\"Chairman Emeritus\\" of the Southern Party in recognition of past services. Mike Crane, a Georgia activist and SNC member, whose immediate goal was to head the rift, subsequently was elected interim chairman. Even so, the conflict continued into the early months of 2000, sowing additional disillusionment and leading to a rapid outflow of dues-paying members from the state party organizations. Realizing that the feud had undermined the party's viability, the Baxley faction finally agreed to a truce proposed by Crane. The factions began negotiating to reunite the SP, successfully concluding these talks in March 2000. New elections also were scheduled to elect a fresh slate of officers to lead the Southern National Committee. However, the subsequent election resulted in the surprise selection of Jerry Baxley by a narrow margin as the new national SNC chairman. Substantial voting irregularities, which, in the view of many, were orchestrated by the Baxley faction, produced additional disaffection within party ranks. This dissatisfaction was further exacerbated by what many viewed as Baxley's abrasive, erratic and unpopular leadership style. The party reunion was short-lived and Baxley soon found himself presiding over a rapidly shrinking party organization as other SNC members resigned and state party organizations began disaffiliating from the SNC as their recognized national party organ. The steady departure of established state party organizations ultimately led to the final dissolution of the SNC in 2002.  Dissolution  In the aftermath of the SNC's collapse, one faction formed the Federation of States and various state-based Southern Independence Parties (SIPs). Two state SPs (Georgia's and North Carolina's) disaffiliated from the SNC and became wholly independent, refusing to recognize any national/regional authority. Many of the other remaining state SPs were, in reality, only \\"paper parties\\" led by a few officers and lacking substantial numbers of dues-paying members. These parties soon proved untenable and ultimately collapsed due to their inability to recruit party members and raise operating funds.  Reunion  In the Spring of 2003 the League of the South attempted to re- establish its influence in the Southern Party by volunteering to serve as an honest broker to coordinate the reunion of all SP supporters (excluding the now-discredited Baxley faction) under one flag. The League invited all anti- Baxley factions of the SP to a meeting in North Carolina for the purpose of realigning all of the invited state parties into a loose confederation with no centralized governing body. This approach was publicly endorsed by all of the original founders of the Southern Party with the exception of the Baxley faction, which was not invited to the meeting. Although the North Carolina meeting marked the end of the SP's internal wars, it did not result in a substantial increase in public interest in the SP. By 2003 the Southern Party had lost credibility with many of its erstwhile supporters and had squandered what little political capital it had ever had as a result of its seemingly endless internal squabbles.  Cause of the factions  The widespread factionalism that derailed the Southern Party's seemingly promising prospects has sometimes been characterized by former supporters as the result of a wide- ranging ideological struggle between \\"centralizers\\" versus \\"decentralizers.\\" This was reflected in the public statements of many of the key Southern Party players after the dissolution of the SNC. Kalas, the principal founder of the SP, was a committed paleoconservative whose interest in Southern heritage and regionalism tended to constitute more a reflection than a foundation of his core beliefs. On the other hand, Lancaster, the author of the Asheville Declaration, was a moderate-conservative Republican in many respects who nonetheless harbored strong regionalist sympathies, a fact subsequently reflected in later writings. Mike Crane, who succeeded Kalas for a brief time, was far more the stereotypical Southern nationalist, a longstanding Southern heritage activist and nationalist with strong libertarian convictions. Many others within the SP rank-and-file mirrored these differences. Still, despite significant differences in political convictions, the major players in the various SP factions nevertheless professed a strong allegiance to the Southern tradition of decentralized government and localized control. The party infighting was actually driven more by personal conflicts between competing party leaders than by genuinely substantive disagreements over party ideology. As one prominent supporter once humorously described the problem: \\"Organizing Southerners is harder than herding cats!\\" This factionalist trait was not lost on outside observers, more than one of whom noted the irony that a party advocating secession found itself undone by multiple secessions within its own ranks.  Aftermath After the party's demise, there was little regionally coordinated political effort ‚Äì a lack often attributed to a longstanding reluctance among Southern movement activists to empower a \\"national\\" coordinating body. Even so, some activity continued at the state level. Sometime after their departure from the Southern Party and from the League of the South-led Southern movement, Lancaster and Kalas experimented with a concept known as Home Rule for Dixie, the purpose of which was to provide a forum through which a more mainstream, center-right, racially inclusive movement could be developed. A hallmark of this nascent movement was its emphasis on the abandonment of Confederate restorationist symbolism and ideology. For a time, the movement garnered attention and sparked debate within Southern movement ranks. However, the Home Rule concept and Web site were abandoned in 2003 after Lancaster and Kalas concluded that the factionalized Southern movement was beyond repair. The most successful remnant of the original Southern Party was the Southern Party of Georgia. The Georgia SP fielded multiple candidates for local and state offices in the 2002, 2004, and 2006 electionsSouthern Party of Georgia Candidate, Mike Crane, for the Georgia Senate District 51 and was an enduring presence in the statewide political struggle over the redesign of the Georgia State Flag.

Earlier, in 1961, he had become the titular Maharaja of Gwalior being a descendant of the Scindia dynasty of the Marathas. However, after the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses). Early life Scindia was born to the last ruling Maharaja of Gwalior, Jivajirao Scindia. He underwent his schooling in Scindia School, Gwalior and thereafter went for higher studies in Winchester College and at New College, Oxford. On his return from the UK, Scindia followed the political tradition set by his mother Vijaya Raje Scindia by joining politics. He was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) in 1971 from Gwalior. Career=Electoral victories A nine-term member of the Lok Sabha, Madhavrao Scindia never lost an election since 1971, when he won for the first time from Guna constituency at the age of 26. He contested the election on the ticket of Jan Sangh, a party that his family had long patronised. In the 1977 election after the emergency was lifted, he contested from Guna constituency as an Independent candidate and still won the seat a second time in spite of the wave in favour of Janata Party (Bhartiya Lok Dal- BLD). In the 1980 election, he switched allegiance to Indian National Congress and won from Guna a third time. But in 1984, he was nominated as the Congress candidate from Gwalior in a last-minute manoeuvre to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and won by a massive margin. After that Scindia contested from either Gwalior or Guna and won on each occasion. Ministerial appointments The 1984 election brought Scindia his first experience as a Minister. He made his mark as an excellent administrator during his stint as Railways Minister (22 October 1986 ‚Äì 1 December 1989)Railway Ministers. Irfca. Retrieved on 14 November 2018. in the Rajiv Gandhi Ministry. Prime Ministers P. V. Narasimha Rao made him Minister for Civil Aviation. He faced a turbulent period of agitation by the staff of the domestic carrier, Indian Airlines, and as part of a strategy of disciplining the workforce he leased a number of aircraft from Russia. Early in 1992 one of these aircraft crashed, though without any loss of life, and Scindia promptly submitted his resignation. Although not known to be too finicky about such notions as ministerial accountability, the prime minister accepted his resignation. Scindia was later reinducted into the Cabinet in 1995 as Minister for Human Resource Development. Scindia is also credited with setting up the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management (IIITM) at Gwalior as an institution of repute, which got renamed after Atal Bihari Vajpayee as ABV-IIITM. Rebellion and return In 1996, he along with Arjun Singh and other Congress dissidents had the opportunity to be part of the United Front (U.F.) government at the Centre. Although his Madhya Pradesh Vikas Congress was part of the U.F., Scindia himself opted to stay out of the Cabinet. He was the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from 1990 to 1993.  Death  Madhavrao Scindia died in a plane crash on the outskirts of Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh on 30 September 2001. All eight people on board the private plane (Beechcraft King Air C90) died in the crash. This included his personal secretary Rupinder Singh, journalists Sanjeev Sinha (The Indian Express), Anju Sharma (The Hindustan Times), Gopal Bisht, Ranjan Jha (Aaj Tak), pilot Ray Gautam and co-pilot Ritu Malik. The autopsies were conducted and other legal formalities completed at AIIMS New Delhi by Professor T D Dogra.

Paving materials include asphalt, concrete, stones such as flagstone, cobblestone, and setts, artificial stone, bricks, tiles, and sometimes wood. In landscape architecture, pavements are part of the hardscape and are used on sidewalks, road surfaces, patios, courtyards, etc. The term pavement comes from Latin pavimentum, meaning a floor beaten or rammed down, through Old French pavement.\\"Pavement\\", The Century Dictionary The meaning of a beaten-down floor was obsolete before the word entered English.\\"pavement, n.\\" Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press, 2009 Pavement laid in patterns like mosaics were commonly used by the Romans.

In a factory, concrete pavers are made by pouring a mixture of concrete and some type of coloring agent into a mold of some shape and allowing to set. They are applied by pouring a standard concrete foundation, spreading sand on top, and then laying the pavers in the desired pattern. No actual adhesive or retaining method is used other than the weight of the paver itself except edging. Pavers can be used to make roads, driveways, patios, walkways and other outdoor platforms. Interlocking concrete pavers Interlocking concrete paver driveway An interlocking concrete paver is a type of paver. This special type of paver, also known as a segmental paver, has emerged over the last couple of decades as a very popular alternative to brick, clay or concrete. An interlocker is a concrete block paver which is designed in such a way that it locks in with the next paver. The locking effect allows for a stronger connection between pavers and with this interlocking effect the paving itself is resistant to movement under traffic. Segmental pavers have been used for thousands of years. The Romans built roads with them that are still there. But it was not until the mid-1940s that pavers began to be produced out of concrete. It started in the Netherlands where all the roads are made to be flexible because the country is below sea level and the ground shifts, moves and sinks. Poured concrete is not an option because it will crack. Individual units not set in concrete, and placed in sand perform far better than concrete. Before the paver was made from concrete, either real stone or a clay product was used. The first production of concrete pavers in North America was in Canada, in 1973. Due to their success, paving stone manufacturing plants began to open throughout the United States working their way from East to West. The first concrete pavers were shaped just like a brick, 4‚Äù by 8‚Äù (10 cm x 20 cm) and they were called Holland Stones and still are today. These units turned out to be economical to produce and were exceedingly strong. In addition to being economical, interlocking concrete pavers are also widely available in water-permeable designs, which have added ecological benefits. By allowing water to drain through the pavers in a way that mimics natural absorption, builders and landscapers are able to limit surface runoff and prevent soil erosion or buildup of standing water in the surrounding land area. Some permeable paver installations are designed to harvest rainwater, which can then be repurposed for uses such as irrigation or washing a car. Stone pavers A stone paver is another type of paver. This type of paver is used widely in building and landscaping as it is highly prized for beauty, strength and durability. Stone pavers are made of many materials including limestone, bluestone, basalt (such as that from The Palisades used in New York City), sandstone and granite. Travertine is a durable, low-porous stone that stays cool in direct sunlight, making it a popular choice for pool-sides, patios, walkways and outdoor entertainment areas. Travertine is salt tolerant and has a low sunlight reflection. Granite pavers have high integral strength and density making it easy to maintain and hard-wearing in outdoor use. Limestone pavers are cut from natural limestone blocks, a sedimentary rock found in mountainous areas and ocean sea beds. Limestone tends to have unique natural colour variations. Sandstone pavers are derived from natural stone and tend to be used for sidewalks, patios and backyards.

In the beginning of 2004, it was announced that the Co-operative Group had purchased Conveco outright.

Biography Jones was born in Clarke County, Virginia, son of Major General Roger ap Catesby Jones and Mary Ann Mason. (The \\"ap\\" in his name is a Welsh patronymic meaning \\"son of\\".) His mother was a lineal descendant of William Byrd II of Westover and Robert \\"King\\" Carter, making her also a cousin of General Robert E. Lee. His uncle was Thomas ap Catesby Jones, a naval officer during the War of 1812 and Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Jones was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy in 1836, and served extensively at sea, receiving promotion to the rank of lieutenant in 1849. During the 1850s, Jones was involved in development work on navy weapons and served as ordnance officer on the new steam frigate when she began active service in 1856. When Virginia left the Union in April 1861, Lieutenant Jones resigned his U.S. Navy commission, joining the Virginia State Navy soon thereafter and becoming a Confederate Navy lieutenant in June. In 1861‚Äì62, he was employed in converting the steam frigate USS Merrimack into an ironclad and was the ship's executive officer when she was commissioned as .

A noted cycling activist, he was known as \\"the father of vehicular cycling\\", for creating the Effective Cycling program of bicycle training along with its associated book of the same title, and for coining the phrase \\"the vehicular cycling principle\\" ‚Äì \\"Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles\\". His published works also included Bicycle Transportation: A Handbook for Cycling Transportation Engineers. Early life Born in East Dulwich, London, England, Forester was the elder son of the writer and novelist C. S. Forester and his wife Kathleen. He moved with his family to Berkeley, California, in March 1940 and attended public schools there until after his parents' divorce, when he finished high school at a preparatory school on the East Coast.Forester, John. My history Forester Website. Accessed November 1, 2007. He later attended the University of California at Berkeley, starting as a physics major, but graduating with a bachelor's degree in English in August, 1951. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Navy in the early 1950s during the Korean War, Forester eventually settled in California to become, as he described it, \\"an industrial engineer, a senior research engineer, a professor, and, of all things, an expert in the science of bicycling\\". In April 1966, Forester's father died. The unexpectedly large estate, its contents, and its disposition proved to Forester that his father, whom he had loved and admired, had consistently lied to him for years, and strongly suggested evidence of another secret life. That discovery was a traumatic experience, and led to his two-volume biography of his father, Novelist and Story Teller: The Life of C. S. Forester.. Publisher's excerpt Cycling advocacy Forester was a passionate cyclist from childhood. He became a cycling activist in 1971, after being ticketed in Palo Alto, California for riding his bicycle on the street instead of a recently legislated separate bikeway for that section of the street, the sidewalk. He contested the ticket and the city ordinance was overturned. His first published article‚Äîthe first of his many publications on alternatives to bikeways over the following four decades‚Äîappeared in the February 1973 issue of Bike World, a regional Northern California bimonthly magazine. In May 1973, his focus broadened as the Food and Drug Administration (later the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC) issued extensive product safety regulations for bicycles. Originally intended only for children's bicycles, the regulations were soon expanded to include all bicycles except for track bikes and custom-assembled bicycles. That October , Forester published an article in Bike World denouncing both the California Department of Transportation and the CPSC. He targeted the new CPSC regulations, especially the \\"eight reflector\\" system, which required front, rear, wheel and pedal reflectors. The front reflector replaced the bicycle headlight. Forester argued that motor vehicle drivers about to cross the path of the cyclist would not see the cyclist because the headlights of their motor vehicle did not shine onto the front reflector of the bicycle, often resulting in a crash. (Only if the bicycle was directly in front of the car and only if the bicycle was headed the wrong way, would the car's headlights illuminate the bicycle's front reflector, until the inevitable head-on crash.) After the rules were finalized, Forester sued the CPSC. Acting as his own lawyer (pro se), Forester did not understand that United States federal law did not grant jurisdiction to the appeals court to review the technical merit of the rules (a so-called \\"de novo\\" review) unless the procedure used to create the rules was flawed. The CPSC argued that a challenger must prove the process was \\"arbitrary and capricious.\\" The judge ordered a de novo review of the rules; threw out four of them, but left the \\"eight reflector\\" standard untouched. Forester, emboldened by this partial success, proceeded to launch further challenges to administrative rules in court, but did not duplicate that early success. His legal advocacy remains highly controversial. Famously abrasive and inflexible, Forester was critical of Dutch cycleways, stating them to be dangerous despite never cycled in the Netherlands. In addition to legal advocacy, Forester was known for his theories regarding cycling safety.Smith, David. The bicycle driver. Cranked Magazine #5, pp. 22-25\\\\. Accessed November 1, 2007. His Effective Cycling educational program, developed after his research which claimed that integrating motorists and educated cyclists reduced accidents more than creating separate bicycle lanes, was implemented by the League of American Bicyclists (formerly, the League of American Wheelmen) until Forester withdrew his permission for that organization to use the name.

He currently lives in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.Matt, J. (2007). Spent. Drawn and Quarterly. Career In his autobiographical comic Peepshow, Joe Matt examines his inadequate social skills, his addiction to pornography, his cantankerous relationship with his then-girlfriend Trish, and the lingering effects of his Catholic upbringing. Matt began creating 'Peepshow' in 1987. In 1992, his 'Peepshow' strips were serialized by Kitchen Sink Press under the title 'Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary of Joe Matt'. His work is now published by Canadian publishing house Drawn and Quarterly. Joe Matt's work on Peepshow is part of the autobiographical comics genre, kick-started by the confessional stories of Harvey Pekar and Robert Crumb. Along with these artists, Joe Matt's work frequently involves soliloquies \\"to camera\\". Peepshow is part of a self- referential universe that includes Matt's contemporaries Chester Brown and Seth, all of whom have included each other in their books. In 2004, it was reported that HBO was developing an animated series based on Matt's comic \\"The Poor Bastard,\\" a collection of stories within Peepshow #1 to #6. The series would be produced by Matt and David X. Cohen . However, Joe Matt later stated, \\"Yes, HBO was interested in making a series based on The Poor Bastard, but they came to their senses and changed their mind.

According to cricket writer Colin Bateman, Emburey's participation in two South African rebel tours \\"cost him six lost years as far as Test cricket was concerned... and, more significantly, probably an extended run as England captain, a job for which he was better suited than some who held the position post-Mike Brearley\\". Playing career Emburey was a right arm spin bowler and a slightly eccentric but useful lower-order batsman with the style of a grafter. He was more notable as an economical performer than a \\"demon\\" spin bowler, but on his day could leave the best batsmen groping outside off-stump. One of his dangerous balls was his arm ball outswinger. Emburey was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1984. Emburey was briefly made England Test captain in 1988, the notorious \\"Summer of four captains\\".John Emburey, CricInfo. Retrieved 2019-06-13. Mike Gatting was sacked after the first Test match against the West Indies and Emburey was appointed for two matches, both of which were lost. Emburey too was fired and was replaced by Chris Cowdrey for the fourth Test. Cowdrey lasted just one match, replaced in turn by Graham Gooch. Emburey was the only cricketer to go on both the England rebel tours to South Africa in 1981/2 and 1989/90; the rebels were banned from Test match cricket because of the apartheid r√©gime. According to Graham Gooch's published tour diary, Emburey had dressed up as a member of the Ku Klux Klan at a fancy dress party on tour just before the news of the first rebel tour broke. Later in his Test career, Emburey tended to be picked for single Tests in England, as happened in 1993 against Australia, when statistically, he was the leading all rounder in the country, and 1995 against the West Indies. At county level, Emburey's Middlesex career coincided with that of Phil Edmonds. The right and left arm spin combination was a powerful contribution towards Middlesex's successes in the 1980s. They also combined at England level, although the pair often competed for the same place in the Test team. A highlight of Emburey's Middlesex career was taking 12 wickets in a single day in a championship match at Lord's in 1980. Emburey holds the dubious distinction of being the highest England Test run-scorer never to have made a Test century. Emburey held the batting record for the highest innings made entirely from boundaries. Despite his chronic lack of footwork, he scored 46 for the England XI against Tasmania at Hobart in 1986‚Äì87, with ten fours and a six. Whilst not the most agile in the field, he seldom dropped anything, pulling off many a stunning catch, often at gully, and had an excellent arm in the deep.

Gau ( , or goa ) is a Germanic term for a region within a country, often a former or actual province. It was used in the Middle Ages, when it can be seen as roughly corresponding to an English shire. The administrative use of the term was revived as a subdivision during the period of Nazi Germany in 1933-1945\\\\. It still appears today in regional names, such as the Rheingau or Allg√§u. Middle Ages=Etymology The Germanic word is reflected in Gothic gawi (neuter; genitive gaujis) and early Old High German gewi, gowi (neuter) and in some compound names still -gawi as in Gothic (e.g. Durgawi \\"Canton of Thurgau\\", Alpagawi \\"Allg√§u\\"), later g√¢i, g√¥i, and after loss of the stem suffix gaw, gao, and with motion to the feminine as gawanumerous variant spellings; gauwa, gowa, gouwa, geiwa, gauia, gawia, gowia, govia, gaugia besides gowo (from gowio). Old Saxon shows further truncation to g√¢, g√¥.Deutsches W√∂rterbuch As a gloss of Latin pagus, a gau is analogous with a pays of the Kingdom of France. Old English, by contrast, has only traces of the word, which was ousted by scire from an early time, in names such as Noxga gƒÅ, Ohtga gƒÅ and perhaps in g≈çman, ƒ°ƒìman \\"yeoman\\", which would then correspond to the Old High German gaumann,Deutsches W√∂rterbuch although the Oxford English Dictionary prefers connection of yeoman to young. Conceptual history In the Carolingian Empire, a Gau was a subdivision of the realm, further divided into Hundreds. The Frankish gowe thus appears to correspond roughly to the civitas in other barbarian kingdoms (Visigoths, Burgundians, or the Italian Kingdom of the Lombards). After the end of the Migration Period, the Hundred (centena or hunaria, Old High German huntari) had become a term for an administrative unit or jurisdiction, independent of the figure hundred. The Frankish usage contrasts with Tacitus' Germania, where a pagus was a subdivision of a tribal territory or civitas, corresponding to the Hundred, i.e. areas liable to provide a hundred men under arms, or containing roughly a hundred homesteads each, further divided into vici (villages or farmsteads).Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, Fourth Edition, 1885-1892. Charlemagne, by his capitulary legislation, adopted the comitatus subdivision and appointed local rulers as deputies of the central Imperial authority. In the German-speaking lands east of East Francia, the ' formed the unit of administration of the realm during the 9th and 10th centuries and ruled by a Gaugraf (\\"gau count\\"). Similar to many shires in England, during the Middle Ages, many such ' came to be known as counties or Grafschaften, the territory of a Graf (count) within the Holy Roman Empire. Such a count or ' would originally have been an appointed governor, but the position generally became an hereditary vassal princedom, or fief in most of continental Europe. Nazi period The term Gau was revived in German historical research in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was erroneously considered an ancient administration structure of Germanic peoples. It was adopted in the 1920s as the name given to the regional associations of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Each Gau denoted an administrative region, created by a party statute dated 22 May 1926. Each Gau was headed by a Gauleiter. The original 33 Gaue were generally coterminous with the Reichstag election districts of the Weimar Republic, based on the constituent states (L√§nder) and the provinces of Prussia. Following the suppression of the political institutions of the L√§nder in the course of the Nazi Gleichschaltung process and the appointment of Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governors) in 1933, the Gaue became the de facto administrative regions of the government and each individual Gauleiter had considerable power within his territory. Reichsgaue With the beginning of the annexation of neighbouring territories by Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, a new unit of civil administration, the Reichsgau, was established. German-speaking territories annexed to Germany from 1938 were generally organised into Reichsgaue. Unlike the pre-existing Gaue, the new Reichsgaue formally combined the spheres of both party and state administration. Following the annexation of Austria in 1938, the country, briefly renamed \\"Ostmark\\" between 1938 and 1942, was sub-divided into seven Reichsgaue. These had boundaries broadly the same as the former Austrian L√§nder (states), with the Tyrol and Vorarlberg being merged as \\"Tyrol-Vorarlberg\\", Burgenland being divided between Styria and \\"Lower Danube\\" (Niederdonau, the renamed Lower Austria). Upper Austria was also renamed \\"Upper Danube\\" (Oberdonau), thus eliminating the name of \\"Austria\\" (√ñsterreich in German) from the official map. A small number of boundary changes also took place, the most significant of which was the massive expansion of Vienna's official territory, at the expense of \\"Lower Danube\\". Northern and eastern territory annexed from the dismembered Czechoslovakia were mainly organised as the Reichsgau of Sudetenland, with territory to the south annexed to the Reichsgaue of Lower and Upper Danube. Following the Axis invasion of Poland in 1939, territories of the Pomeranian and Pozna≈Ñ voivodeships as well as the western half of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ voivodeship were reannexed to Germany as the Reichsgaue of Danzig-Westpreussen (which also incorporated the former Free City of Danzig) and Wartheland. Other parts of Nazi-occupied Poland were incorporated to bordering gaus of East Prussia and Upper Silesia i.e. Zichenau (region); and Silesian voivodeship with the counties of O≈õwiƒôcim, Bia≈Ça respectively. After the successful invasion of France in 1940, Germany re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine. The former d√©partement of Moselle was incorporated into the Gau of Saar-Palatinate, while Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin became part of the Gau Baden. Similarly, the formerly independent state of Luxembourg was annexed to Koblenz-Trier, and the Belgian territories of Eupen and Malmedy were incorporated into Cologne-Aachen.

Time Out Group provides entertainment, food, and drink recommendations to an international audience through print and digital platforms. Time Out was established in 1968, by founder Tony Elliott and has developed into a global platform across 315 cities and in 58 countries. It provides original editorial content for users to find things to do in the city as well as curated lists of the best films, food, attractions, art, culture, shopping and nightlife activities.

New Time Out Markets are set to open in Miami, New York, Boston, Chicago and Montreal in 2019 and in London-Waterloo and in Prague in 2021 ‚Äì all bringing the best of the city under one roof. History The original Time Out magazine was first published in 1968 by Tony Elliott with Bob Harris as co-editor, and has since developed into a global platform across 315 cities and 58 countries. The magazine was a one-sheet pamphlet with listings for London. It started as a counter-culture publication that had an alternative viewpoint on issues such as gay rights, racial equality, and police harassment. Early issues had a print run of around 5,000 and evolved to a weekly circulation of 110,000. One of the editors in the 1970s was Roger Hutchinson. The brand was expanded to North America with Time Out New York magazine also known as TONY in 1995 followed by Time Out New York Kids in 1996. The success of taking the Time Out brand abroad led to the expansion of the magazine worldwide. The brand grew to include travel magazines, city guides, and books. Time Out was able to withstand print competition; however, its late integration of a digital platform during the online revolution proved to be a challenge. When Time Out New York launched it did not have a website and was competing against well-established online publications such as Citysearch and The Village Voice. The company; however, continued to expand with licensing of the brand and in 2009 launched its iPhone app in New York and then London, which was sponsored by Smirnoff, enabling the app to be free of charge. Financial loss and the necessity to expand the Time Out brand led Tony Elliott to sell half of Time Out London and 66 percent of TONY to private equity group Oakley Capital in May 2011. Under new ownership, the company expanded the brand digitally through partnerships with software companies to develop a common online platform for the brand and to create multi-city mobile applications. The company continued to grow digitally and launched an iPad app for New York and London in July 2012. The iPad app was initially sponsored by MasterCard. In July 2015, Time Out Group announced a ¬£7 million investment in Flypay, a pay-at-table mobile app that will integrate its technology into Time Out's media platform. In June 2016, Time Out Group underwent an initial public offering and trades under the symbol TMO on London's AIM stock exchange. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Time Out website altered its logo to read Time In, and the site began recommending activities that could be enjoyed at home. Time Out publications Time Out magazine is available in 40 cities around the world including Lisbon, Porto, L.A., Miami, Chicago, Sydney, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Madrid, Barcelona, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Tel Aviv, Mexico City, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dubai and Istanbul among others. Time Out London magazine is a free weekly publication based in London. Time Out provides event listings and editorial on film, theatre and the arts in London to inform readers of the availability of entertainment in the city. Time Out New York (referred to as TONY) was the brand's first magazine launch in North America and debuted in 1995. Time Out New York is now available for free every other Wednesday in vending boxes and newsstands across New York City and there are copies inside cultural establishments, cafes and other locations. The web audience is estimated to 4.5 million unique visitors a month.

It was used also by Western and Central Asian peoples: the Medes, Persians, Parthians, Indo-Saka, Kushans, Mossynoeci, and others living within the milieu of Iranian peoples. According to Aristarchus of Samothrace, the legendary Amazons used the sagaris, as well.

Examples have been collected from Eurasian steppe archeological excavations, and are depicted on the Achaemenid cylinders and ancient Greek pottery and other surviving iconographic material. It is a long-shafted weapon with a metal head, with an either sharp (axe-like) or blunt (hammer-like) edge on one side and a sharp (straight or curving) 'ice-pick'-like point on the other. It may have been the sagaris that led medieval and Renaissance authors (such as Johannes Aventinus) to attribute the invention of the battle-axe weapon to the Amazons ‚Äì as some Scythian women seen hunting and along warrior riders gave rise to the legend to the Amazons themselves ‚Äì and to the modern association of the Amazons with the labrys.

Description and history left Glebe Point Road's southern end begins at the northeastern tip of Victoria Park, where Broadway becomes Parramatta Road. This area is frequented by a mix of students from the University of Sydney and University of Technology as well as residents of nearby suburbs: Darlington, Ultimo, Chippendale, and Haymarket (also known as Chinatown). Glebe Point Road extends north through Glebe, terminating at Bicentennial Park located on Rozelle Bay.Glebe, Forest Lodge & Broadway - City of Sydney The street is lined with terrace houses and is one of the most historic streets in Sydney, dating from the early days of settlement, when the area was granted to the Anglican Church. St John's Church was built on the corner of Glebe Point Road and St Johns Road, after a design by Edmund Blacket. Built from 1868‚Äì1870, the church is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishing Company, 1981, pp. 2/38 Blacket also built his own family home, the heritage-listed Bidura, on Glebe Point Road in 1858.Sydney Architecture, John Haskell (UNSW Press) 1997, p. 62 This street is the main entry point to the Glebe Estate which was originally owned by the Anglican Church and which was taken over by the Whitlam Government in 1973 for an urban renovation program. The start of Glebe Point Road has trendy caf√©s and restaurants. Further down the road are very fashionable and expensive terrace houses with city and harbour views that go for over a kilometre to the water's edge. In the past thirty years the area has become gentrified, resulting in rising property and rental prices. This has led to an increase in white-collar workers and a decrease in students, artists, writers and musicians. Professionals, administrative and sales staff make up 44 per cent of all residents, which is above the city average of 30 per cent. There is student accommodation at the heritage-listed University Hall and Cottages, located on the junction of Glebe Point Road, Broadway and Parramatta Road. The cottages date from 1837 and the hall, originally the University Hotel, was built between 1889 and 1890.

Even after the company did begin building custom choppers, 60% of revenue still came from sales of WCC-branded marketing tie-ins such as clothing, beverages and tools. Yearly sales of approximately 12-15 motorcycles at prices of around US$150,000 each actually lost money for the company, but attracted positive attention. Publicizing the names of celebrity clients, including Shaquille O'Neal, Kid Rock, Keanu Reeves, Ty Law of the Denver Broncos, wrestling star Bill Goldberg, actor Tyson Beckford, and NFL running back Jamal Anderson, was a central feature of the WCC marketing strategy. The other key to this strategy was the star power of Jesse James, presented mainly through television on the Discovery Channel in the Motorcycle Mania series and the 2002-2006 series Monster Garage. The Long Beach, California headquarters of West Coast Choppers shut down in 2010, but later reopened in 2013 with a new headquarters in Austin, Texas. History Founded in the early 1990s West Coast Choppers gained notice with the 2001 shows Motorcycle Mania I and II, on the Discovery Channel. In 2004 James starred with Kid Rock in Motorcycle Mania III. With the release of these shows interest in Jesse James and the West Coast Choppers allowed the firm to expand knowledge of its brand and to expand its following. Jesse James also narrated a 2006 Discovery show called History of the Chopper, where he makes his own motorcycle to commemorate the 1960s. In 2004, the company's merchandise, along with the No Fear brand, was banned from the Simi Valley Unified School District in California for using the German Iron Cross, in reaction to violence between black and white students. Jesse James and a spokesman for No Fear have said the cross is based on the Maltese cross and does not represent white power or Nazism. James said the cross is used by many fire departments, for example. A skateboarding store employee pointed out that West Coast Choppers sells a T-shirt which combines both the cross symbol and a WWII German-style helmet, representing \\"things he‚Äôd rather not be associated with.\\" A similar ban in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2003 drew protests from students. In 2005 West Coast Choppers agreed to pay $35,000 to settle a claim by the Business Software Alliance that unlicensed copyrighted software was used in the design of the company's motorcycles. In 2007 Jesse James was fined over a quarter-million dollars because West Coast Choppers sold more than 50 motorcycles from 1998 to 2005 that failed to comply with the air pollution limits of the California Air Resources Board (CARB). James explained that he was unaware of rule changes that required small-volume manufactures to comply with regulations. James said the CARB refused his offer to recall and modify the uncompliant choppers. Since 2005 West Coast Choppers has built emissions- compliant choppers. James said the fines were excessive and intended to make an example of him due to his company's fame and his celebrity marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, but CARB spokesmen stated their enforcement efforts were aimed at the entire custom industry, and further that they were aware of no offer by West Coast Choppers to recall the motorcycles in question. In 2008 West Coast Choppers worked with the City of Long Beach to design steel artwork that will be placed in concrete planters between two city streets. West Coast Choppers also designed the \\"Long Beach 2030 Plan Van,\\" a mobile classroom that will be used to promote the city's long range planning projects. The City of Long Beach renamed part of a street as \\"West Coast Choppers Place\\" in 2009 to honor the company. In 2009 West Coast Choppers stopped selling motorcycle customizing parts, offering only complete bikes, or clothing and other non- bike merchandise. Jesse James was reported to be trying to exercise more personal control over production, and to \\"battle knockoffs and establish a measure of quality control.\\" In October 2010, West Coast Choppers closed the shop in Long Beach. James' other Long Beach business, Cisco Burgers, remained, but no other details of the closing were announced, and it was not clear whether James would continue operations from his new home in Texas. Cisco Burgers has since also closed shop. The website westcoastchoppers.com redirected to www.westcoastchoppers-australasia.com, which sells merchandise with the West Coast Choppers brand and logo, operated by Rev Head Apparel under a license agreement with Jesse James. However, Jesse James, decided to open the company back up in 2013. In 2019, it launched the KIMI by West Coast Choppers range of merchandise, in partnership with Kimi Raikkonen, 2007 F1 World Champion. Marketing The personality behind the brand, Jesse James. The star personality of the company's founder and president Jesse James is a key asset in the marketing of the West Coast Choppers image. Monster Garage producer Thom Beers describes him as, \\"the perfect Gen-X antihero. He doesn't want to be worshiped ... he really believes in what he does, and he has a great sense of style.\\" Advertising Age Editor-in-Chief Scott Donaton says James is a, \\"relatable bad boy with blue-collar appeal\\" adding that West Coast Choppers, \\"has made a lot out of this bad boy image, has made a lot out of this connection to the name Jesse James and this sort of Wild West romance,\\" which will remain profitable for years to come so long as it is \\"authentic.\\" James is compared with entrepreneurs like Martha Stewart and Coco Chanel for his ability to turn an image into multiple lines of profitable fashions. The celebrity clients who order WCC bikes are a main avenue of promotion. The motorcycle made for Shaquille O'Neal cost US$150,000 and was customized for the athlete's weight and inseam, and enormous hands, resulting in a dramatic long bike with footpegs made for size 24 feet. The result was, \\"priceless publicity\\". WCC/Coors tie-in beer can adapted as a hotrod part. West Coast Choppers tie-in boombox. James sometimes displays a little unveiled contempt for his customers, as when he explained to Popular Mechanics how they conceived their US$3,000 kit for a chopper frame by saying, \\"We geared this towards the do-it-yourself mother‚Äî.\\" Or when he joked with the Los Angeles Times at the high prices of his branded clothing, saying, \\"Wife beaters for $200 bucks, I'm like--sucker. I could get three for 10 bucks\\" at a swap meet. This image is used mainly to sell clothing, the top moneymaker for the company. Sales in Europe are ten times the US, according to James. At one time, there were five clothing lines, including two sold by West Coast Choppers, two at Wal-Mart, as well as high-end lines available in more expensive department stores, such as T-shirts for \\"$100 a pop in Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, and Fred Segal\\". Koral Industries of Vernon, California is responsible for the design and manufacture of WCC clothing, as well as supplying the sales force to place the products in stores. Clothing items include hoodies, tank tops, T-shirts and jackets. There is also a line of Jesse James/WCC-branded bib overalls and other workwear. Besides clothing, and the small scale production of choppers made to order, tie-ins with other companies were a major part of West Coast Choppers. One such tie-in was a 2004 contest to win a motorcycle, with entries contained in bottles of chocolate Yoo-hoo, which helped to promote the launch of a new flavor, Dyna-Mocha, which is Yoo-hoo and coffee. West Coast Choppers also signed a multi-year agreement with Huffy in which West Coast Choppers will design Huffy choppers, to be sold at Wal-Mart. The objective was to duplicate success of Pacific Cycles' Schwinn Sting-Ray model designed by rival Orange County Choppers (OCC). While the OCC and WCC branded bikes had some success, the kids' bikes' sales at Wal-Mart and K-Mart was a fraction of bikes branded with children's characters such as Barbie, Disney Princess, Dora the Explorer, Power Rangers and Spider-Man. Other brand tie-ins are a plasma arc cutter and other welding torches made by ESAB, designed by and named after Jesse James. Airstream trailers had a deal as well, which included a WCC motorcycle with a sidecar made with a polished aluminum body to simulate the appearance of the iconic camper trailers. Besides Yoo-hoo, another beverage company, Coors Brewing Company, added West Coast Choppers logos and pictures of bikes to their product in a mutually beneficial brand tie-in.\\"Coors(R) Original Goes West Coast Style with Jesse James; The Official Beer of 'Guy's Night Out(TM)' Has a New Spokesperson.\\" PR Newswire 7 May 2004 Trademark style A chopper in Japan with a West Coast Choppers accessory cross. West Coast Choppers motorcycles are described as old school and minimalist. WCC bikes have been called more stripped down when contrasted with decades-long established chopper builders like Arlen Ness, that is, a bike with, \\"not much there but engine, what the law requires, and something to hold onto.\\" In spite of this characterization, a WCC trademark is the use of 9√ó19mm and .44 Magnum shell casings as purely non-functional decorations, adorning the fuel or oil filler caps or top of the motorcycle's handlebar risers, or elsewhere. The presence of this 20th-century gun ammunition is intended to evoke Jesse James' distant ancestor, old west outlaw and gunfighter Jesse James. A strong metaphorical tie between the chopper- riding biker and old west outlaws is a mainstay of biker culture, established by \\"the biker world's Norman Rockwell,\\" painter David Mann. The biker's cross logo, a version of the Iron Cross or the Maltese Cross, is also typical of a WCC bike, though that symbol is nearly ubiquitous in Kustom Kulture regardless. The old school label of WCC bike designs fits loosely as well, especially in recent years as WCC has moved away from the traditional Harley- Davidson chopper, seen by James as too mainstream, and stretched the style in search of originality. Specific influences include Lambretta scooters, Honda 305 Scramblers, and Schwinn Black Phantom bicycles.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors. Allen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932‚Äì33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates. From 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936‚Äì37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3‚Äì2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947‚Äì48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure. As Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989. Early life Allen was born on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia,Swanton, p. 20. the second of three children to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), n√©e Lamb, the daughter of Edward Lamb, a Queensland government minister. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London‚Äîhoping that the children would benefit from an English education‚Äîwhere they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages.Swanton, p. 21. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.Swanton, p. 2. After being educated by a governess, Allen joined Summer Fields School in Oxford in 1912. He began to play cricket seriously at school; by his second year, he reached the school second team, from where he progressed to the first team then the captaincy.Swanton, pp. 20‚Äì23. His ability attracted the attention of Eton College, where a friend of Allen's father, C. M. Wells, was a housemaster. The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury, but Wells persuaded Allen senior to send his son to Eton instead, although it was a considerable financial burden on the family. Allen, although not initially keen on the prospect, started there in the winter of 1915‚Äì16.Swanton, pp. 25‚Äì27. At Eton, Allen played many sports,Swanton, pp. 43‚Äì44. but his academic performance was no more than respectable, and he later admitted to laziness.Swanton, p. 43. In cricket, Allen played for his school house team and had reasonable success with bat and ball; by 1918 he was house cricket captain. After a trial match, and a spell in the school second team, he progressed to the Eton first team in 1919.Swanton, pp. 27‚Äì30. The effects of a rib injury limited his bowling, and he achieved little with the bat. Even so, he was chosen to play in the prestigious match against Harrow School, played annually at Lord's in London.Swanton, p. 31. In his second innings, he scored 69 runs, the highest individual score of the game, and Eton won the match.Swanton, pp. 32‚Äì33. His rib injury continued to trouble him in 1920, and caused him such pain that he considered abandoning bowling altogether. The new Eton coach George Hirst persuaded him to continue,Swanton, p. 37. and a few weeks later Allen took nine for 19 (nine wickets while conceding 19 runs) in an innings against Winchester. But other than this performance, Allen was ineffective.Swanton, pp. 38‚Äì39. More successful in 1921, he opened the batting for a time; he also opened the bowling, topping the Eton bowling averages.Swanton, p. 42. He had some success at Lord's against Harrow and a particularly fast bowling spell in this match was seen by Hubert Ashton, who was to captain the Cambridge University team the following yearSwanton, pp. 41‚Äì42.‚ÄîAllen had already been approved for a place at Trinity College, Cambridge beginning later that year.Swanton, p. 40. He was chosen to play in the annual matches at Lord's in which two teams representing the best public schoolboys opposed each other, but was forced to withdraw with sunstroke.Swanton, pp. 42‚Äì43. Towards the end of the 1921 season, Allen was invited to play first-class cricket as an amateur for Middlesex,Swanton, p. 45. for whom he qualified by residence.Swanton, p. 46. Allen believed that Pelham Warner, who often supported young Middlesex cricketers, encouraged his selection by the club, despite the potential risks to the team's position in the County Championship from playing an inexperienced cricketer.Marshall, pp. 8‚Äì9. Allen made his first-class debut against Somerset on 21 August 1921 and made one other appearance that season without achieving much in either match. First-class cricketer=Cambridge University Allen played for Cambridge in 1922.Swanton, p. 47. He was left out of the team's first game; as the University was playing Middlesex, he played for the opposition instead and took six for 13. Around this time, he began to bowl fast for the first time.Swanton, p. 48. After success in the following games‚Äîincluding ten wickets in the game against Sussex‚ÄîAllen was awarded his blue by being selected for the University Match against Oxford at Lord's.Swanton, pp. 47‚Äì49. In that game, he had match figures of nine for 78 in a comfortable Cambridge victory.Swanton, p. 51. This was Cambridge's last game of the season‚ÄîAllen had taken 49 first-class wickets at an average of 15. There were suggestions in the press at the time that Allen illegally threw, rather than bowled, the ball. In his biography of Allen, E. W. Swanton writes that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen's career, and that they may have resulted from a one-off lapse. Towards the end of the season, Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him at the top of the county's bowling averages.Swanton, p. 52. Allen played rugby for the Trinity team before resuming cricket for the 1923 season.Swanton, p. 57. He began well, reaching fifty in a first-class match for the first time against Middlesex and taking six for 89 in the same game. Further bowling success followed but before the University Match, he once more injured his rib muscles. Persuaded to play anyway, Allen could only bowl short spells which lacked incisiveness and Cambridge lost heavily.Swanton, pp. 54‚Äì55. Several critics, including some teammates, believed he did not try. During the match, Allen consulted a specialist over his frequent rib injuries; the specialist's treatment and a period of rest cured the problem for the remainder of his career.Swanton, p. 56. Allen's Cambridge season was further marred by differences with his captain, Claude Ashton, over team selections and tactics.Swanton, p. 54. The 1923 University Match was his final game for Cambridge as Trinity, unhappy with his lack of academic work, rusticated him in the summer. Later in the 1923 season, Allen was recalled by Middlesex and played five games for the county. At the end of the season, he was chosen in two Scarborough Festival games; one of these was the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match, in which he appeared for the amateur \\"Gentlemen\\".Swanton, p. 58. This was the first of Allen's 11 appearances for the Gentlemen in this fixture between 1923 and 1938.Marshall, p. 336. In the whole season, he took 66 wickets at 19.50 and scored 528 runs at an average of 24.00. Middlesex In late 1923, having decided not to return to Cambridge, Allen took a job in the City (London's financial district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially,Swanton, p. 65. he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business.Marshall, p. 113. He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket‚Äîincluding for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)‚Äîand country house cricket. Allen was free to play regularly for Middlesex in 1924. The team was involved in a close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire, and Allen had several successful matches.Swanton, p. 63. He ended the season with 568 runs at 21.84 and 50 wickets at 17.48. Playing less often in 1925, he scored 392 runs, took 39 wickets, and scored his maiden first-class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval.Swanton, pp. 68‚Äì69. He was also chosen for the first time to represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he scored 52, and his reputation grew steadily.Swanton, pp. 70‚Äì71. By the beginning of the 1926 season, he and fellow fast bowler Harold Larwood were tipped in the press to be chosen for the England team against Australia that summer. Allen began well for Middlesex but was less successful in a trial match to help choose the England team. Larwood was chosen for the Test series; Allen was not.Swanton, pp. 72‚Äì73. In county cricket, Allen scored his first century for Middlesex,Swanton, p. 74. and began to open the bowling occasionally, having been the third or fourth bowler in previous seasons.Swanton, pp. 72, 74. Overall, he scored 771 runs, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career, at an average of 29.65 and took 44 wickets at 28.27. During the northern winter of 1926‚Äì27, Allen toured Argentina to play first-class cricket with an MCC team.Swanton, pp. 75‚Äì77. When he returned to England, he played eight matches before the end of June, including a game for the MCC against the touring New Zealand team in which he scored a century and took ten wickets.Swanton, p. 77. In total, he scored 482 runs at an average of 43.81 and took 19 wickets; this was his last regular cricket until 1929.Swanton, pp. 77‚Äì78. He declined an invitation to tour South Africa with an MCC team,Swanton, p. 95. and work limited him to two first-class games for Middlesex in 1928.Swanton, p. 79. Through Vivian Hugh Smith, the father of some old school-mates, Allen had the opportunity to work in France. He moved to Lyons for 18 months to work for a silk company. During his time there, Allen became aware that the firm's finances were unsound; he warned Hugh Smith, who after some enquiries, withdrew from the business, along with his fellow investor Sir Frederick Richmond. The latter subsequently offered Allen work at Debenhams, of which he was chairman.Swanton, pp. 78‚Äì79. Allen worked at Debenhams until 1933, initially as first assistant to the Works Department manager, then as the assistant to the assistant general manager.Swanton, p. 142. While at Debenhams, Allen was allowed leave to play cricket. During his first appearance of the 1929 season he performed well but suffered a strain in his next game, which reinforced an impression in the press‚Äîarticulated by Pelham Warner among others‚Äîthat he was injury-prone and inclined to hypochondria.Swanton, pp. 80‚Äì81. His next appearance came a fortnight later, at Lord's against Lancashire; that team had won the County Championship every year since 1926.Swanton, p. 81. Owing to work commitments, Allen arrived by prior agreement around 20 minutes after play started. He took the first three wickets, but Lancashire were batting comfortably at 215 for three wickets. Around the tea interval, Allen took the last seven wickets in 69 deliveries while conceding 13 runs from his bowling, including the last four wickets in five balls.Swanton, p. 82. In total, he took all ten wickets at a cost of 40 runs, to become only the second man to take all ten wickets in a first-class match at Lord's since 1874, and the last to date. He was praised in the press, although the Manchester Guardian correspondent suggested that a weak batting performance helped him, and Wisden merely described this as one of several good performances in the game. Despite his success, the England selectors preferred Larwood in the Test team against South Africa; even when Larwood was injured, Allen was passed over.Swanton, pp. 82‚Äì85. Swanton suggests that Allen's bowling was inconsistent throughout the season;Swanton, p. 84. he finished with 31 wickets at 25.87 and scored 544 at 45.33. Test match career=Debut During 1930, Allen again had leave in which he could play cricket,Swanton, p. 85. and was among the front-runners for a place in the England team.Swanton, pp. 85‚Äì86. His first appearance of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77.Swanton, p. 86. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press.Swanton, p. 87. On the morning of the match, Larwood was unfit and Allen played. England batted first, and Allen scored three runs before being dismissed on the first afternoon.Swanton, p. 88. On the second morning, an article in the Daily Express by Trevor Wignall, a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories, suggested that the crowd's enjoyment of the day was marred by Allen's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth. Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted, and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace.Swanton, pp. 88‚Äì90. That day, Allen opened the bowling for England; after a slow start, the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket fell. Like the other bowlers, Allen then rapidly conceded runs to Donald Bradman, who scored 254 runs. Australia scored 729 for six declared in reply to England's 425, and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 overs.Swanton, pp. 89‚Äì90. England lost early wickets in their second innings, and when Allen came in to bat, the score was 147 for five wickets, still 167 behind the Australians. He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain, Percy Chapman, to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets.Swanton, pp. 89, 91. In contrast to the reaction to his bowling, Allen's innings was praised in the press.Swanton, p. 92. This was his only Test of the series. Allen was unsuccessful in the Gentlemen v Players game, but performed effectively with the ball for Middlesex. He continued to struggle when batting, and his highest innings of the year was 77 runs scored in the end-of-season Scarborough Festival.Swanton, p. 94. In total, he scored 281 runs at 17.56 and took 42 wickets at 22.19. He was not invited on the MCC tour of South Africa.Swanton, pp. 95‚Äì96. Success Allen's cricket remained limited in 1931.Swanton, p. 96. Despite all-round success in several early games for Middlesex, he was initially omitted from the team for the first Test against the New Zealand team. When Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury, Allen was added to the team;Swanton, pp. 96‚Äì97. according to Anthony Meredith, writing in The Cricketer in 2002, Pelham Warner made this decision himself without consulting his fellow selectors, to their considerable annoyance. Allen did not have a particularly good match as a bowler,Swanton, p. 97. but was successful with the bat. When he started his innings at the beginning of the second day, England had scored 190 for seven wickets in reply to New Zealand's 224.Swanton, p. 98. He scored 98 in the 150-minute first session, and went on to score 122; with Les Ames, he added 246 for the eighth wicket. This was a record partnership in Test matches for the eighth wicket until 1996, and an England record for that wicket until 2010. England scored 454, but New Zealand replied with 469 and the match was drawn on the third and final day. This was Allen's only innings of the series. After a gap of three weeks with no cricket, Allen took six wickets in his first match back. Meanwhile, Larwood was ruled out of the England team after an injury in a car crash;Swanton, p. 100. Allen played in the second Test and took five for 14 in New Zealand's first innings.Swanton, p. 101. England won that game, and the next was drawn after rain washed out the first two days; Allen neither batted nor bowled. In the series, he took eight wickets at an average of 16.12. He ended the season with 401 first-class runs at 30.84 and 40 wickets at 18.77. Allen played less frequently in 1932, even though he wanted to secure a place in the MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932‚Äì33 season.Swanton, p. 103. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match.Swanton, p. 104. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the second trial was named in the MCC team.Swanton, p. 106. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour.Douglas, p. 121. Having been named in the team, Allen did not play again in the season.Swanton, p. 107. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36. Bodyline series A team photograph of England's 1932‚Äì33 side: Allen is seated second from the right on the front row. alt=A cricket team arranged in three rows. Seventeen men are dressed as players, the other three men are in suits. The MCC tour of Australia during the 1932‚Äì33 season was highly controversial owing to the England team's use of what came to be known as Bodyline bowling. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at the batsman's body and with a ring of fielders ranged on the leg side to catch any defensive deflections from the bat. Bodyline bowling was intimidatory,Douglas, p. 103. and was largely designed and implemented by Douglas Jardine, the MCC captain,Swanton, p. 110. in an attempt to curb the prolific scoring of Bradman.Douglas, pp. 86, 111. Allen was one of four fast bowlers chosen for the tour,Swanton, p. 111. but did not go along with Jardine's instructions to \\"hate\\" the opposition. Nevertheless, the two men got along,Swanton, p. 109. and Allen later claimed to be Jardine's \\"best friend\\" on the tour. Allen also wrote home that Jardine was \\"the stupidest man I know\\", claimed to be terrified of him and suggested that at times he felt like killing him.Frith, pp. 107, 116. Jardine did not initially plan to include Allen in the Test team, but the latter's bowling in the opening tour matches brought him into the frame.Swanton, p. 113. In his first game, he unsettled and dismissed Bradman with his pace; in later years Jack Hobbs, who reported on the game, suggested that Bradman was intimidated by Allen, and Jack Fingleton, who played in the team with Bradman, claimed that he refused to face Allen's bowling.Frith, p. 83. Allen later wrote to his father that Bradman was a \\"terrible little coward of fast bowling\\"; the two men later became friends, and Bradman was never made aware of what Allen wrote. Allen played in England's victory in the first Test but took only one wicket. He retained his place as part of a four-man pace attack in the second Test, took four wickets and was one of the most successful English batsmen in the match. Australia levelled the series after Bradman scored a century,Swanton, pp. 118‚Äì22. but England won the remaining three matches of the series. In the third game, Allen opened the bowling and took four wickets in each innings. His performance was praised by critics and enhanced his reputation.Swanton, p. 128. As Voce missed the fourth Test with injury, Allen bowled more in that game and took five wickets, but suffered a side-strain in the second innings.Swanton, p. 130. The injury prevented Allen bowling at full pace in the final Test; he played despite his own reservations and struggled throughout.Swanton, p. 132. In total, Allen took 21 Test wickets at an average of 28.23 and scored 163 runs at 23.28. In his review of the tour for Wisden, Sydney Southerton wrote: \\"G. O. Allen, about whose selection many hard things were at the time said, fully justified his choice ... He accomplished great work, often getting rid of batsmen likely to be dangerous; his fielding close in on the leg side was uniformly good and he played several excellent innings. Altogether a most useful man in the team.\\" Jardine praised his contribution after the tour, both to Allen's family and in his official report.Swanton, p. 136. In all first-class matches, Allen scored 397 runs at 24.81 and took 39 wickets at 23.05. In his biography of Jardine, Christopher Douglas suggests: \\"[Allen] thrived on the intensive programme of matches and was able to build up his form and consistency to a standard that he hardly ever matched in England.\\" Throughout the series, Allen refused to use Bodyline tactics, and openly said so within the team.Swanton, p. 127.Douglas, p. 133. His attitude made him popular with Australian spectators.Frith, p. 116. Jardine twice tried to force the issue. Before the first Test, he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side; Allen refused, saying he did not want to play cricket like that and that Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy. Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: \\"Well, I burst and said a good deal about swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners.\\"Quoted in Frith, p. 146. Allen threatened not to play, and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter.Frith, p. 146. Others in the team also opposed Bodyline. The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the \\"leg trap\\"‚Äîthe ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries‚Äîduring the first Test.Frith, p. 118.Douglas, p. 148. Allen had no compunction fielding there; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series. Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC, and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season.Swanton, pp. 143‚Äì58. Change of career During the Bodyline tour, his first visit to Australia since the age of six, Allen spent time visiting friends and family.Swanton, pp. 112, 114‚Äì15. Before returning to England, the MCC played two Tests in New Zealand. Allen played in both, but batted just once and, still feeling the effects of his injury, took only two wickets.Swanton, p. 140. The team returned to England via Canada, but Allen parted company in Vancouver to meet friends in Los Angeles. During his trip, he met several Hollywood stars and passed through Chicago and New York on his way back to England.Swanton, pp. 140‚Äì42.Frith, p. 346. In New York, he met and fell in love with Norah Grace, the daughter of a shipping magnate. She travelled to England in 1934, and the pair wrote frequently to each other, but Grace died from Bright's disease in 1935.Swanton, pp. 141‚Äì42. Allen did not feel suited to working in a department store, and on his return home took a job with the stockbroking company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933.Swanton, p. 143. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test.Swanton, p. 144. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team.Swanton, p. 146. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected as a member of the Stock Exchange. As the 1934 season began, Allen was recovering from an operation to repair a rupture and played only once before that summer's Ashes series, in which Bob Wyatt captained England.Swanton, pp. 147‚Äì49. Injury ruled him out of the second Test, but he was fit for the third.Swanton, p. 148. In a drawn game, he scored 61 runs but took no wickets; troubled by uneven footholds, he bowled three wides and four no-balls during his first over, which lasted for 13 deliveries.Swanton, pp. 150‚Äì51. He was selected for the fourth Test but, unhappy with his fitness, withdrew to play for Middlesex. He was successful in several games preceding the final, deciding Test, and was included in the team.Swanton, pp. 152‚Äì54. Australia won comfortably after scoring 701 in their first innings; Allen took four for 170 and was wicketless in the second innings.Swanton, pp. 155‚Äì56. In two Tests, he took five wickets at an average in excess of 70 and scored 106 runs at 35.33. In all first-class games that season he scored 438 runs at 25.76 and took 51 wickets at 27.49. Amid growing speculation that Allen would be chosen as the next England captain, Warner arranged for him to captain a low-key tour to Gibraltar in early 1935. During the return journey, Allen pulled a muscle when his ship pitched unexpectedly; the injury limited his cricket during 1935. He played twice before withdrawing from the rest of the season on medical advice.Swanton, pp. 159‚Äì60. Off the field, Allen was elected to the MCC Committee at the unusually young age of 32.Swanton, p. 209. England captain Allen c. 1935 Selection as captain Prior to the 1936 season, Allen was the leading contender to replace Wyatt as England captain; under Wyatt's leadership, the team had lost three successive Test series.Swanton, pp. 161, 164. Although still unable to appear regularly,Swanton, p. 161. Allen played 16 first-class matches, his most in a season since 1926; he scored 598 runs at an average of 35.17, and took 81 wickets, his best return in a season. When selected to lead one of the teams in a Test trial match, he was effective enough for the selectors to name him as England captain for the series against India.Swanton, pp. 162‚Äì64. England won the first Test by eight wickets. Allen took five for 35 in his first innings as captain and a further five wickets in the second innings, making this the only Test in which he took ten wickets.Swanton, pp. 165‚Äì66. The selectors at this time set about choosing a captain and team for the MCC tour of Australia in the 1936‚Äì37 season. At least one selector favoured Claude Ashton, who played first-class cricket infrequently; Allen informed the selectors that, were Ashton to be made captain, he would not take part in the tour.Marshall, p. 114. Soon after the first Test, Allen was chosen to captain the Gentlemen against the Players, the only time he did so, and the MCC announced that he would captain the MCC in Australia.Swanton, p. 167. Allen believed that Warner was influential in securing his appointment, but that his Australian background was also important given that the tour had to repair tensions left over from 1932‚Äì33. Allen captained England in the remaining two Tests against India. The second game was drawn but England won the third and Allen took seven for 80, his best figures in Test matches.Swanton, pp. 168‚Äì69, 172‚Äì73. In the Tests, Allen scored 27 runs in three innings, and took 20 wickets at 16.50. His good form for Middlesex continued throughout the season and he performed well against some of the strongest opposition; he topped the county's batting averages and came second in bowling.Swanton, pp. 172‚Äì73. The MCC team for Australia was chosen in several stages with input from Allen.Swanton, pp. 167‚Äì68. Larwood was not considered; he had spoken out in the press against Australia and opponents of Bodyline, and like Voce, had not played a Test since the 1932‚Äì33 series.Swanton, pp. 154‚Äì55. The selectors wished to include Voce but Allen at first threatened to resign were he to be included. He met Voce to discuss matters and the latter agreed to sign a statement in which he apologised for the past and in effect promised not to bowl Bodyline. He was therefore named in the touring team.Swanton, pp. 167‚Äì71. Tour of Australia, 1936‚Äì37 Allen bowling to alt=A cricketer has just bowled a ball towards a batsman, who is waiting for the ball to arrive The inexperience of the tour manager, Rupert Howard, and Allen's vice-captain, Walter Robins, left Allen with a heavy workload for the 1936‚Äì37 tour;Swanton, p. 174. he later suggested to the MCC that this affected his form.Swanton, p. 206. In the early part of the tour, Allen selected the team by himself, but later used Robins, Bob Wyatt, Wally Hammond and Maurice Leyland as a selection committee. The team was hampered throughout by injuries‚Äîat one point, seven of the sixteen players were unfit‚Äîand the absence of senior players meant that Allen had to play more matches.Swanton, p. 179. He played well in the early games, but the team's results were poor as players struggled to adapt to the Australian pitches. When the Test series began, Australia were clear favourites.Swanton, pp. 179‚Äì80. In the first Test, in reply to England's first innings of 358, Australia were bowled out for 234. When England batted again, Allen top-scored with 68, an innings he later rated the best of his career. England made 256 and, on a pitch affected by rain, Allen took five for 36 as Australia were bowled out for 58 to lose by 322 runs.Swanton, pp. 181‚Äì82. Allen's team also won the second Test. England scored 426 for six on the first two days before rain prompted Allen to declare. On a damaged pitch, he took four for 10; Australia were bowled out for 80 and eventually lost by an innings.Swanton, pp. 184‚Äì85. During the second Australian innings, Bradman, the Australian captain, who went on to score 82, was at one point dropped by Robins. The latter apologised, but Allen replied: \\"Oh, forget it, old boy, it's probably cost us the rubber, but what the hell!\\"Swanton, p. 186. Rain affected the third Test; on the second day, Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings. In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including members of his own team, suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered the risk to be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine.Swanton, pp. 188‚Äì90. Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased; the tactic worked, as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket. Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs.Swanton, pp. 190‚Äì91. In the fourth Test, Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings, when several of Allen's tactical moves worked well. England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings. Needing to score 392 to win, England were bowled out for 243, and the series was level at 2‚Äì2.Swanton, pp. 193‚Äì96. Complaining of exhaustion, and struggling with an injury, Allen rested from the MCC's next tour games. He was criticised for this, by Warner among others, particularly when the team lost in his absence. Allen proposed that he miss the final Test, but the other selectors insisted he play.Swanton, pp. 198‚Äì99. For the game, Australia chose a fast bowler, Laurie Nash, who had returned to first-class cricket after a three-year absence to play for Victoria against the MCC. Allen, concerned over the possible use of Bodyline by Nash, who had bowled short against the MCC, spoke to Bradman before the game. Bradman replied that an opposing captain could not veto members of his team, at which Allen went to the umpires and threatened to bring his team off the field if Bodyline was used.Frith, pp. 413‚Äì14. Struggling with a leg injury, Allen was below his best. Australia won the toss, scored 604 and, assisted by rain, bowled England out for 239 and 165 to win the match and series;Swanton, pp. 199‚Äì201. Nash did not bowl short. The series was watched by over 900,000 people in total; the MCC took home a larger profit than on any previous tour.Swanton, p. 202. Allen was treated sympathetically by press and public.Swanton, p. 203. The Wisden review of the tour suggested: \\"It would be churlish to criticise Allen's captaincy. During the first two Tests, almost every one of his moves succeeded instantly ... No doubt, Allen had studied his opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses, and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful. Those who attributed so much of the England captain's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him\\". In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94. During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team.Swanton, pp. 197‚Äì98. He clashed over tactics with one of his team, Joe Hardstaff; the pair never got along thereafter.Marshall, pp. 115‚Äì16. The team played three games in New Zealand before returning home via America; Allen left the team early and spent time in Hollywood.Swanton, pp. 206‚Äì07. In all first-class games, he scored 380 runs at 25.33 and took 38 wickets at 26.23. Later career=Before the war A combination of fatigue from the Australian tour and his need to return to work reduced the amount of cricket Allen played in 1937,Swanton, p. 204. and he announced his unavailability for the summer's Test series against New Zealand.Swanton, p. 208. He played just four first- class games that season, scored 161 runs and took 15 wickets. When the following season began, he remained in contention for the England captaincy for the 1938 Ashes series. Wally Hammond, formerly a professional, became an amateur before the season, immediately making him another candidate.Swanton, p. 211. Allen played several times in the early season for Middlesex and performed well with bat and ball, but injured his back. Even so, he was selected to captain \\"the Rest\\" against England in a Test trial, but was annoyed that Hammond was preferred as captain of the England team, particularly as Warner had not discussed the matter with him. In the event, Allen withdrew on the grounds of fitness,Swanton, pp. 211‚Äì12. and did not play again for over a month. When he returned, his form was good but a succession of injuries plagued him for the rest of the season.Swanton, pp. 212‚Äì13. In 13 first-class games, Allen scored 431 runs, with a highest score of 64, at an average of 26.93. He also took 23 wickets at 25.00. In July 1938, Allen was commissioned into the Territorial Army as a second lieutenant. He joined the City of London Yeomanry along with several friends and colleagues, and this took up much of his time in 1938 and 1939.Swanton, pp. 213‚Äì14. He had time for five first-class games in 1939, scoring 164 runs and taking 16 wickets, before he was called up to the regular army on 24 August 1939.Swanton, p. 215. War service Allen's regiment was part of the Royal Artillery; he quickly became involved with Anti-Aircraft Command and began to associate with Royal Air Force (RAF) officers.Swanton, pp. 214‚Äì16. In 1940, he was appointed as an Anti-Aircraft (AA) liaison officer to RAF Hawkinge, part of an initiative to share intelligence on German AA operations with bomber groups; these posts were controlled by a branch of Military Intelligence, MI14E.Swanton, pp. 216‚Äì17. Later that year, Allen's brother Geoffrey was killed fighting in France.Swanton, pp. 218‚Äì19. In June 1940, Allen was appointed as a flak liaison officer to Five Group, an RAF Bomber Command group responsible for distributing intelligence on German air defences collated by MI14 to bomber stations. Through this position, Allen became friends with Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris, who commanded Five Group at the time. As part of his work there, Allen accompanied one bombing mission to the Ruhr, to gain first hand experience of AA defences.Swanton, p. 220. In December, Allen was appointed to lead the MI14E section which collated AA intelligence; aside from appointing flak liaison officers, Allen received sensitive intelligence data from a variety of sources on German air defences.Swanton, pp. 221‚Äì22. He remained in this position for the rest of the war, being promoted to lieutenant colonel when MI14E became MI15. Throughout the war, he also found time to play regular charity cricket matches.Swanton, pp. 223‚Äì29. Allen left the army in July 1945.Swanton, p. 228. Last years as a cricketer After the war, Allen dedicated most of his time to stockbroking and was made a partner by David Bevan and Co.Swanton, p. 230. He had little time for cricket, although he appeared twice for Middlesex in 1946.Swanton, p. 231. The following season, he played once for Middlesex, and captained their second team. He also played twice for the Free Foresters, a club of wandering amateurs, in first-class games.Swanton, p. 232. Late in the 1947 season, Allen was asked to captain and manage an MCC team which was to tour the West Indies that winter. The young and experimental team suffered badly with injuries; Allen missed several matches himself through strains.Swanton, pp. 233‚Äì34. In first-class games on the tour he scored 262 runs and took six wickets, but writing in Wisden, Norman Preston judged: \\"Allen was too old.\\" Allen also clashed with several members of his team; he did not get along with Ken Cranston, his vice-captain, nor Joe Hardstaff, his senior professional. When Allen tried to impose discipline on the team to prevent his players staying out late to drink alcohol, neither Cranston nor Hardstaff backed him.Marshall, p. 154. With many players indisposed and his options limited, Allen requested reinforcements and the MCC sent out Len Hutton in time for the third Test; in the meantime, Allen asked S. C. Griffith, not a highly regarded batsman, to open the batting for England in the second Test. Griffith responded by batting the entire first day and scoring 140 runs in total, his maiden century in first-class cricket.Swanton, pp. 235‚Äì36. The West Indies won the last two Tests (the first two having been drawn) to win the series; the MCC team did not win a single match on the tour. Allen later regretted accepting the invitation to lead the team.Swanton, pp. 234‚Äì40. In three Tests, he scored 94 runs and took five wickets. Allen did not play any more Test cricket; in 25 matches, he scored 750 runs at an average of 24.19 and took 81 wickets at 29.37. Although Allen appeared four times for Middlesex in 1948, most of his remaining cricket was played for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University. On very good batting pitches, the matches lacked a competitive edge, but in 12 games between 1948 and his retirement, he scored four centuries and averaged over 80 with the bat. In 1948, he scored 180 in the fixture, the highest score of his career; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches, he finished on top of the English batting averages that season.Swanton, pp. 242‚Äì43. He played his final Middlesex games in 1950, captaining the team in four matches in the absence of the regular captain,Swanton, p. 248. and made his final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954. In all first-class cricket, he scored 9,233 runs at an average of 28.67 and took 788 wickets at 22.23. Cricketing technique Allen was capable of bowling unusually quickly. Critics judged him to have an excellent bowling action, through which he achieved his pace. He bowled from sideways on, and according to his Wisden obituary, had \\"a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through\\". R. C. Robertson- Glasgow described Allen in 1943: \\"Of no more than medium height, he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which is used in the delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen.\\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 67. Robertson-Glasgow continued: \\"His bowling, though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance, has often touched greatness.\\" Although opposed to Bodyline tactics in Australia, Allen often bowled short to intimidate batsmen in county cricket‚Äîfor example, he once struck Wyatt over the heart with a fast ball.Marshall, p. 16.Douglas, pp. 133, 135. alt=A cricketer pictured just after having bowled the ball During the early part of his career, Allen was often in competition with Larwood. Swanton suggests that, had he played regularly, Allen may have matched the achievements of Larwood. Other critics had reservations. Alan Gibson, in his study of England captains, wrote that Allen \\"was a fast bowler, not quite of the highest class\\"; he noted that Allen became more accurate as he got older, but this was offset by a loss of pace.Gibson, p. 169. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Allen suffered from not bowling regularly. When called upon to play while lacking practice, he often \\"bowled wildly or inconsistently\\".Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 66‚Äì67. But Woodcock and Robertson-Glasgow believed that, in this period, only Larwood was capable of more devastating spells of fast bowling among Englishmen. As a batsman, Allen was technically sound. Robertson-Glasgow described him as a \\"correct, strong and courageous\\" batsman who was at his best when his team most needed runs. Gibson called him as a \\"hard-hitting batsman in the middle of the order\\". In later years, his understanding of batting technique enabled him to co-write the MCC coaching book. Gibson described Allen as an unlucky captain, affected by injuries and poor selection, who had little opportunity to lead teams. He judged him to be an orthodox tactician, possibly influenced by the fact that his two predecessors, Jardine and Wyatt, often used highly unusual tactics. Gibson stated that Allen was popular with his teams and that his influence during the potentially difficult Australia tour of 1936‚Äì37 was crucial.Gibson, pp. 169‚Äì70. Wyatt rated him as a good captain, and stated: \\"As a captain, he was a disciplinarian but was always most considerate to the members of his side\\". Administrative career Allen's Wisden obituary stated: \\"[He] had a stronger influence on the welfare and development of cricket than anyone since Lord Harris [who died in 1932] over a period of more than 50 years.\\" Gibson, writing in 1979, described Allen as \\"a patriarchal, though not aloof, figure at Lord's\\". Ian Peebles, a teammate of Allen's at Middlesex and later a journalist, said of him: \\"Allen's impact [as an administrator at Lord's] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game.\\" After the Second World War In the final stages of his playing career, Allen became increasingly influential off the field. After the war, he rejoined the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers.Swanton, p. 244. Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Unlike many of the cricketing Establishment, who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top-class facilities.Quelch, \\"At last the 1948 show\\", Location 673. In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951, which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with Harry Altham; Allen was responsible for the technical aspects of the publication.Swanton, pp. 248‚Äì49. In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator. In his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little opportunity to play cricket. Test selector In July 1954, Allen was involved in the selection of the MCC team to tour Australia in 1954‚Äì55, as the MCC's representative. That winter, he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches, which ensured victory in the series.Swanton, pp. 252‚Äì53. Before the 1955 season, he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors, and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection, he accepted. The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end.Swanton, p. 254. Allen served as chairman from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain.Swanton, p. 255. Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly.Swanton, pp. 256‚Äì57. While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line-up.Marshall, pp. 185‚Äì86. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals.Marshall, 253‚Äì54. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed.Marshall, pp. 193‚Äì96. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain,Marshall, p. 201. and speaking to the press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship.Swanton, pp. 257‚Äì58. When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.Swanton, pp. 269‚Äì70. Allen and May's first series in control resulted in a 3‚Äì2 win over South Africa.Swanton, pp. 258‚Äì60. In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2‚Äì1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed for the inclusion of Cyril Washbrook, who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years. The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes, a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, Fred Trueman, to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place.Quelch, Chapter 14: \\"Look Back in Anger\\", Location 4056. Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, David Sheppard, who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94.Swanton, pp. 261‚Äì64. The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: \\"I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [the selectors] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them.\\" Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to give a lot of assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series. Allen denied any involvement.Swanton, pp. 263‚Äì64. During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.Swanton, p. 265. England won the 1957 Test series against the West Indies 3‚Äì0 and the 1958 series against New Zealand 4‚Äì0.Swanton, pp. 265‚Äì67. But despite having what was regarded as a strong team, England lost 4‚Äì0 in Australia in 1958‚Äì59.Swanton, p. 267. The team was more successful afterwards, beating India 5‚Äì0 in 1959,Swanton, p. 269. defeating West Indies 1‚Äì0 in 1959‚Äì60 and South Africa 3‚Äì0 in 1960. Allen's final series as chairman was against Australia in 1961; England lost after making tactical mistakes in the fourth Test.Swanton, pp. 272‚Äì73. Influence behind the scenes In 1956, Allen became chairman of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing the size of the ball would help bowlers.Swanton, pp. 275‚Äì76. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part.Swanton, pp. 270‚Äì71, 276‚Äì77 Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team.Swanton, p. 278. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing. When the MCC abolished amateur status in cricket in 1963, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change.Swanton, p. 280. In 1963, he was appointed as MCC President.Swanton, p. 281. When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he was appointed to the influential role of MCC Treasurer,Swanton, pp. 284‚Äì85. a position he filled until 1976. During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968.Swanton, pp. 286‚Äì87. He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new Test and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC,Swanton, pp. 287‚Äì88. and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.Swanton, pp. 293‚Äì94. Allen was prosperous by this stage of his life. An inheritance from his mother, his earnings on the Stock Exchange and the success of investments he had made in Australia left him affluent‚Äîhis knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City.Swanton, p. 279. In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may have brought about his hip problems.Swanton, p. 286. D'Oliveira affair In 1968, the MCC was involved in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour.Oborne, pp. 145‚Äì46. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead.Swanton, p. 288. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances.Oborne, pp. 146‚Äì47. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, but that it was likely no protest would be made.Swanton, p. 289. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team,Oborne, p. 137. but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.Oborne, pp. 148‚Äì49. In March 1968, Lord Cobham, an MCC member who wanted the tour to go ahead,Oborne, pp. 152‚Äì54. met Vorster, who told him that D'Oliveira would not be an acceptable selection to the South African government. Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member, whose identity has never been made public, by private letter. Other than the recipient, only Allen, Griffith and the then-President Arthur Gilligan were aware of the letter, but they chose to keep its contents from the rest of the committee. Allen's justification was that Douglas-Home, a statesman and former Prime Minister, had given advice which contradicted this; also, other Committee members were Test selectors and Allen believed that the information would place non-cricketing pressures on their choices for the England team.Swanton, p. 290. Oborne suggests that Douglas-Home's advice was made redundant by Cobham's letter, and that Allen's supposed desire to protect the other selectors was \\"preposterous\\" as the tour would have been cancelled.Oborne, pp. 154‚Äì55. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but Oborne suggests that Allen made it clear that he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds.Oborne, pp. 193‚Äì94. D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to considerable anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player, Vorster said that the MCC would not be welcome and the tour was cancelled.Oborne, pp. 201‚Äì28. Some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year; the MCC came under heavy public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign.Swanton, p. 291. Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.Oborne, p. 212. In 1970, the proposed visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC was no longer solely responsible for any decisions, being only a part of the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.Swanton, pp. 292‚Äì93. Final years Allen retired from the Stock Exchange in 1972, resigned as MCC Treasurer in 1976 and left the Cricket Council in 1982. He was appointed a CBE in 1962 and knighted in 1986. In 1968, Allen moved to a flat directly behind the Pavilion at Lord's,Swanton, pp. 291‚Äì92. where he lived until his death. Following his retirement, he spent much of his time in the MCC Committee room, watching cricket at Lord's. He never married, and died at home on 29 November 1989, suffering from the effects of a stomach operation earlier in the year.

He was renowned for acting as a capable and loyal regent for his young nephew King Cheng, and for successfully suppressing the Rebellion of the Three Guards and establishing firm rule of the Zhou dynasty over eastern China. He is also a Chinese culture hero credited with writing the I Ching and the Book of Poetry,Hinton, David. (2008). Classical Chinese Poetry: an Anthology. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. establishing the Rites of Zhou, and creating the yayue of Chinese classical music. Life His personal name was Dan (). He was the fourth son of King Wen of Zhou and Queen Tai Si. His eldest brother Bo Yikao predeceased their father (supposedly a victim of cannibalism); the second- eldest defeated the Shang Dynasty at the Battle of Muye around 1046 BC, ascending the throne as King Wu. King Wu distributed many fiefs to his relatives and followers and Dan received the ancestral territory of Zhou near present-day Luoyang. Only two years after assuming power, King Wu died and left the kingdom to his young son King Cheng.Chin, Annping. (2007). The Authentic Confucius. Scribner. The Duke of Zhou successfully attained the regency and administered the kingdom himself, leading to revolts not only from disgruntled Shang partisans but also from his own relatives, particularly his older brother Guan Shu.Edward L. Shaughnessy in Cambridge History of Ancient China, page 311. Within five years, the Duke of Zhou had managed to defeat the Three Guards and other rebellions and his armies pushed east, bringing more land under Zhou control. Statue of the Duke of Zhou who founded a city on the site of modern Luoyang BCE The Duke of Zhou was credited with elaborating the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, which countered Shang propaganda that as descendants of the god Shangdi they should be restored to power. According to this doctrine, Shang injustice and decadence had so grossly offended Heaven that Heaven had removed their authority and commanded the reluctant Zhou to replace the Shang and restore order.Hucker, Charles O. (1978). China to 1850: a short history. Stanford University Press. On a more practical level, the Duke of Zhou expanded and codified his brother's feudal system, granting titles to loyal Shang clansmen and even establishing a new \\"holy\\" city at Chengzhou around 1038 BC.Schinz, Alfred. The Magic Square: Cities in Ancient China, pp. 69 ff. Axel Menges (Stuttgart), 1996. Accessed 8 Jan 2014. Laid out according to exact geomantic principles, Chengzhou was the home of King Cheng, the Shang nobility, and the nine tripod cauldrons symbolic of imperial rule, while the Duke continued to administer the kingdom from the former capital of Haojing. Once Cheng came of age, the Duke of Zhou dutifully gave up the throne without trouble. Legacy The duke's eight sons all received land from the king. The eldest son received Lu; the second succeeded to his father's fief.Âß¨‰ºØÈæÑ‰∏∫Âë®ÂÖ¨Á¨¨ÂõõÂ≠ê---‰∏≠ÂçéËíãÊ∞èÁ•ñÊ†πÊñáÂåñÁΩë „ÄäÂÖÉÂú£Ë£îÂë®Ê∞èÊóèË∞±„Äã‰∏ñÁ≥ªË°® In later centuries, subsequent emperors considered the Duke of Zhou a paragon of virtue and honored him with posthumous names.

In 2004, Chinese archaeologists reported that they may have found his tomb complex in Qishan County, Shaanxi. God of Dreams Duke of Zhou is also known as the \\"God of Dreams\\". The Analects record Confucius saying, \\"How I have gone downhill! It has been such a long time since I dreamt of the Duke of Zhou.\\" This was meant as a lamentation of how the governmental ideals of the Duke of Zhou had faded, but was later taken literally. In Chinese legends, if an important thing is going to happen to someone, the Duke of Zhou will let the person know through dreams: hence the Chinese expression \\"Dreaming of Zhou Gong\\". Descendants Êù±ÈáéÂÆ∂ÊóèÂ§ßÂÆó‰∏ñÁ≥ª Family Tree of the descendants of the Duke of Zhou in Chinese The main line of the Duke of Zhou's descendants came from his firstborn son, the State of Lu ruler Bo Qin's third son Yu () whose descendants adopted the surname Dongye ().

History The first articles in the Romanian Wikipedia were written in July 2003, with the first version of the main page being drafted on 12 July. The user interface, initially in English, started being translated into Romanian by Bogdan StƒÉncescu (registered with the username Gutza) as soon as he was given sysop rights.International Wiki mailing list The same user subsequently contacted several Romanian universities that were available on the internet, as well as the Romanian Academy, in order to attract new contributors. His efforts were soon remarked by the Romanian media, who invited him on several occasions to introduce the project to the public. AcasƒÉ.ro, 16 December 2004: Enciclopedie gratis pe Internet, √Æn rom√¢nƒÉ BƒÉnƒÉ≈£eanul, 24 July 2004: Informa≈£ie la click By the end of 2003, the Romanian Wikipedia had exceeded 3,000 articles, ranking 16th among all Wikipedias. The 10,000th article was written on 13 December 2004, and the 50,000th on 5 January 2007. In April 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia supported the launch of the Aromanian Wikipedia (see Aromanian language). In June 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia encountered problems concerning its division and the creation of a separate Moldovan Wikipedia (see Moldovan language). A Moldovan-language version of Wikipedia exists as it was created automatically together with a larger number of other Wikipedias, because the language had been assigned a separate ISO 639 code (mo/mol--which were deprecated in November 2008 by the ISO authoritieshttps://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php). At its beginnings, it worked as a portal redirecting to the Romanian Wikipedia, but in March 2005, it eventually began allowing content (although only intended for Cyrillic Moldovan/Romanian as it was used before 1989 in the Moldavian SSR and remains in use only in Transnistria), starting big editing wars and endless discussion. Between December 2006 up to its deletion in November 2017, it was frozen and editing was no longer permitted. This question was raised from time to time, although users on Wikipedia voted on its closure and its deletion.Vote and discussion on the closure of Moldovan Wikipedia on Meta-WikiVote and discussion on the deletion of Moldovan Wikipedia on Meta-Wiki The Romanian Wikipedia reached the 100,000 article milestone on 11 January 2008. As of April 2015, it has 300,000 articles and 330,000 registered users, of which 21 are administrators. Peculiarities The logo of the Romanian Wikipedia was slightly different from the logos of other Wikipedias. The letter –ò in the logo was replaced with the Romanian letter ƒÇ (A-breve), further adapting this Wikipedia to the local readership.2004 news report on Meta-Wiki Articles can contain small spelling variations, mostly regarding the use of the letters √¢ and √Æ, both used for the close central unrounded vowel (cf. Romanian alphabet). According to the 1993 spelling rules promoted by the Romanian Academy, is transcribed as either √Æ, when used as the first or last letter of words, or √¢, when it occurs in the middle of the word (with some exceptions). Still, between 1953 and 1993, the Romanian language only used √Æ - after 1964 an exception was made for derivations of the words Rom√¢nia (\\"Romania\\"), rom√¢n (\\"Romanian\\") and related words. The Academy rules are mandatory in government organisations and in state schools in Romania. Moldova adopted the Latin alphabet for the Romanian language before the spelling reform in 1993, and it didn't switch to the new spelling up until 2001, using the letter √Æ before exclusively (exceptions were made for Rom√¢nia and the other related words, spelled with √¢). In practice, either usage is acceptable in both countries, and indeed there are publishing houses and printed magazines that use either or both of the two rules. Vojvodina uses the new Romanian spelling. Other spelling differences include sunt/s√Ænt or niciun/nici un. The Romanian Wikipedia community adopted a language policy stating that both pre-1993 and post-1993 spelling norms are permitted, and editing an article just to switch it from one norm to the other is not acceptable; switching is allowed if the article is significantly expanded or rewritten.Versions of Romanian spelling (official policy) on the Romanian Wikipedia Concerning the addressing policy, Romanian Wikipedia uses the polite forms of the personal pronouns and verbs. A policy on this was discussed in early 2006, and consensus was reached for the use of dumneavoastrƒÉ (polite \\"you\\") instead of tu (familiar \\"you\\") on its pages.Addressing policy (discussion and policy) on the Romanian Wikipedia  Timeline  ;Annual number of articles as of December (each year) since the creation of edition.Wikipedia Statistics: Romanian  Monthly counts & Quarterly rankings ;Number of total articles at a specific time *October 2003: 250 articles *7 April 2004: 5000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Comunicate de presƒÉ/ArhivƒÉ/7 aprilie 2004 *12 December 2004: 10,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Comunicate de presƒÉ/ArhivƒÉ/12 noiembrie 2004 *5 January 2007: 50,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Comunicate de presƒÉ/ArhivƒÉ/5 ianuarie 2007 *11 January 2008: 100,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Comunicate de presƒÉ/ArhivƒÉ/13 ianuarie 2008 *21 May 2009: 125,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Comunicate de presƒÉ/ArhivƒÉ/22 mai 2009 *13 September 2010: 150,000 articlesList of Wikipedias/Table (Archived version of this page, as edited by JoaquinF at 00:11, 13 September 2010) *5 August 2012: 200,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Cafenea/ArhivƒÉ/2012/august#Articolul 200.000 *25 July 2014: 250,000 articles:ro:Wikipedia:Cafenea/ArhivƒÉ/2014/iulie#250k *13 April 2015: 300,000 articles *2 September 2015: 350,000 articles ReferencesExternal links * Romanian Wikipedia * Romanian Wikipedia mobile version * Aromanian Wikipedia * Aromanian Wikipedia mobile version Wikipedias by language Internet properties established in 2003 Wikipedia Romanian encyclopedias ","title":"Romanian Wikipedia"},{"id":"1351051","text":"T68 may refer to: *AnsaldoBreda T-68, former tram in Manchester, England *International medical code for Hypothermia *INS Baratang, Indian Navy vessel with the pennant T68 *Sony Ericsson T68, mobile phone ","title":"T68"},{"id":"1351055","text":"Bahujana Nidahas Peramuna (People's Freedom Front/Mass Freedom Front) is a political party in Sri Lanka that was formed by Chandrika Kumaratunga when she broke away from Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya.

It is Sinding's most popular piece of music. It is written in Salon style as a piece meant for entertainment. It was very popular in the United States. Bearing the expression marking agitato, much of the piece is played with a rapid arpeggio in the right hand part, while the left hand carries the melody. The work's title indicates that its sense of constant motion is symbolic of the excited restlessness of springtime. The score has some technically challenging sections, but is, for the most part, easier to play than it sounds, with most of the rapidity made up of simply arpeggiated passages. For its popularity and ability to impress, the piece is a common part of many pianists' repertoires. The piece is in D-flat major, and several times shifts to related keys such as F minor and A-flat major, as well as modulating via chromatic harmonies to more remote keys like G minor and A major. Its form may be summed up thus: * (a) 16-bar main theme, starting in B-flat minor, passing through F minor, and ending in A-flat major (the dominant); * (b) 14-bar extension to main theme, beginning in F minor, and further developing the theme, and moving via sequence through G minor and A major, before shifting suddenly back to D-flat major as a climax; * (c) Varied repetition of (a); * (d) Varied repetition of (b); * (e) Near-exact repetition of (a) (except for first 4 bars, which are varied yet again); * (f) Exact repetition of (b); * (g) Coda, consisting of shortened version of (a) (varied in the same manner as (c)), this time staying in D-flat major instead of modulating, followed by a cadence based on this theme, and decorated by extensive scale and arpeggio passages. It appears in the second episode of Dennis Potter's 1986 TV series The Singing Detective, and as a quoted version in a few parts of Meredith Willson's 1957 musical The Music Man. It also appears very prominently in the 1939 Hollywood film Intermezzo, first in an orchestral arrangement, then its main melody is hummed by Ingrid Bergman and played on the piano by Bergman.

He retired from playing cricket to concentrate on his career as a dentist. Life and career Cranston was born in Aigburth, Liverpool, where his father Henry Selby Cranston was a dentist. He and his elder brother Ronald were educated at Liverpool College, but Ronald died aged 23 after showing early cricketing talent. Ken Cranston played for the Lancashire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship before World War II. He served as a dental officer in the Royal Navy during the war. He played cricket for the Royal Navy and Combined Services, and played club cricket in Lancashire after the war. He also played hockey for the county. Cranston was appointed captain of Lancashire in 1947, replacing acting captain Jack Fallows. He was an all-rounder who bowled fast-medium and batted in the middle of the batting order. He made his first-class debut on 14 May as captain of Lancashire, in the match against Oxford University. He was immediately successful in first-class cricket, and made his Test cricket debut in the Third Test against South Africa at Old Trafford on 5 July, less than eight weeks after his first-class debut. In the Fourth Test at Headingley, he took four wickets in six balls (w.w.ww) to end the South African second innings. He was selected as vice-captain of the relatively weak Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side that toured West Indies in 1947‚Äì48. He captained England once, in the first Test against the West Indies at Bridgetown, as Gubby Allen had pulled a muscle on board the boat carrying them there. The match was drawn, but England ended up losing the four-match series 2‚Äì0. He was dropped from the Test side at the start of the following summer, but played one final Test later in 1948, when he was selected for the Fourth Test in the Ashes series against Australia's Invincibles, in which the tourists scored 404 on the final day to win the match. Cranston led Lancashire to third place in the County Championship in 1947, with the team losing only one march. The team was fifth in 1948. Cranston himself scored over 1,000 runs in each year, and took 84 and then 79 wickets. He also played in two Gentlemen v Players matches in 1947, at Lord's and Scarborough, and again at Lord's in 1948. He resigned as captain of Lancashire at the end of his second season to concentrate on his dental practice in Liverpool. He played for the North of England against the South in 1947, 1949 and 1950, and played his last first-class match in 1950. He was president of Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1993‚Äì94, and was a president of the Lancashire Former Players' Association. He practised as a dentist in Aigburth until 1990. He married twice. He first married Mary Joyce Harrison in 1942. They had a daughter and a son, but were divorced in 1964. He married Joanne Legg later that year; they had a son.

Described by Rolling Stone as ‚Äúthe best band you‚Äôve never heard of,‚Äù Luna combine intricate guitar work, traditional rock rhythms, and poetic lyrics. The earliest edition of the band also included drummer Stanley Demeski and bassist Justin Harwood (Demeski formerly of The Feelies and Harwood formerly of New Zealand band The Chills). The original line-up was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994's Bewitched. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997's Pup Tent, and Britta Phillips of Ultra Baby Fat and The Belltower (also known as the singing voice of animated character Jem) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000. Phillips and Wareham became romantically involved and eventually married in 2007. History In 1991, after the end of Galaxie 500's US tour supporting the Cocteau Twins, Dean Wareham told his bandmates Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang that he was quitting the band. Wareham then signed a demo deal with Elektra Records and recorded a number of tracks with Mercury Rev drummer Jimmy Chambers. Some of these recordings were later released on the \\"Anesthesia\\" single on No.6 Records in the US and Mint Tea in the UK under the name \\"Dean Wareham.\\" The same year, Krukowski and Yang released an album as Pierre Etiole, later renaming their new project Damon & Naomi. Elektra's VP of A&R;, Terry Tolkin, was impressed and Wareham signed a deal with Elektra, and started pulling together a band. He first contacted Justin Harwood, whom he had met while Harwood was playing with The Chills, and they recruited drummer Byron Guthrie, formerly from Ultra Vivid Scene. The trio recorded demos (produced by Dave Fridmann) and played a series of live dates with Mercury Rev guitarist Grasshopper. Guthrie was replaced by former Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski, and this line-up recorded the first album, Lunapark, produced by Fred Maher and released by Elektra under the name Luna¬≤ to avoid confusion with a new-age musician known as \\"Luna\\". (Later an accord was reached which allowed the band to use the name Luna.) Shortly after the release of Lunapark, the band placed an advertisement in the Village Voice for a guitarist, and Canadian former drama student Sean Eden was recruited. The new four-piece recorded a number of cover versions that would become the Slide EP, and then toured the US. In mid-1993 the band supported the reformed Velvet Underground on their European tour, after which they recorded their second album. Bewitched was recorded in New York City and co-produced by the band with Victor Van Vugt. Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison played guitar on two tracks. The album was released in 1994. In 1995, the band went into Sorcerer Sound studio in New York City with producer Pat McCarthy and engineer Mario Salvati to record their third album Penthouse. The album featured Television guitarist Tom Verlaine on the tracks \\"Moon Palace\\" and \\"23 Minutes in Brussels.\\" The album was released in August 1995 to critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone declaring it one of the essential albums of the 1990s.Rolling Stone Essential Recordings of the '90s last accessed: October 19, 2006 The album featured a cover of Serge Gainsbourg's \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" as a hidden track; the song featured L√¶titia Sadier of Stereolab duetting with Dean Wareham. \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" was released as a single in the UK and was named Melody Maker single of the week. Pup Tent followed in 1997. In 1999, the band recorded The Days of Our Nights for Elektra, but the label declined the album as \\"not commercially viable\\" and dropped the band.Full Of Wishes Luna Dropped By Elektra last accessed: October 28, 2014 The record was ultimately released on Jericho Records in the US. Prior to the album's release, Justin Harwood left the band, and was replaced by Britta Phillips.

Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips continued on as the duo Dean & Britta, initially formed in 2003.

Each year the festival brought over 1000 young people in performing arts companies and music groups from across the globe. It provided a showcase for their talents, bringing them together with professionals and artists. As well as the ticketed events the Festival staged a parade, open-air performances and a fringe programme in community venues. A programme attracted over 30,000 people to more than seventy events throughout north east Scotland each year. Concerts, dance shows and galas in Aberdeen were held in venues such as His Majesty's Theatre, The Music Hall and The Lemon Tree as well as smaller venues such as churches (such as Queen's Cross Church, Aberdeen) and also featured a touring programme taking events to rural venues. The AIYF programme included symphony orchestras and steel bands, song recitals and jazz, traditional music, world music, ballet, contemporary and traditional dance. The festival also produced an opera, (Opera Garden) as well as performances developed by the participating companies working together over the course of the Festival. In November 2017 it was announced that Aberdeen City Council was to cease funding the event. In March 2018, it was announced that the festival was to be wound up. Information * The Aberdeen International Youth Festival was formerly known as the International Festival of Youth Orchestras (IFYO). * AIYF welcomed over 30,000 performers to Aberdeen History The event began as the International Festival of Youth Orchestras. In 1973, at the invitation of the British Tourist Authority, the festival moved to the UK and established a base both in Aberdeen and London for five years. Due to the facilities and support in the City of Aberdeen and its university, the festival was able to expand to incorporate all forms of dance, jazz and choral music. Internationally renowned guest conductors such as Claudio Abbado, Carlo Maria Giulini, Walter Susskind and Leopold Stokowski, were invited to conduct the Festival Orchestra - a specially created orchestra, which was invited to appear at the BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and also played at the opening concert of the Edinburgh International Festival in 1978 (the first youth orchestra to appear at The Edinburgh Festival). Due to the success and support from both the City of Aberdeen, local businesses and growing audiences, in 1979 the management focussed the event entirely in Aberdeen and the north east of Scotland. Nicola Wallis, who had been associated with IFYO since 1973, was appointed Director in 1980, with Roy Hendry Thomson as Marketing Director, and the name of the Festival changed to the Aberdeen International Youth Festival. Nicola Wallis ran the Festival until 2003, when she became the Chief Executive of the Voices Foundation. In 2003 the Festival established a full-time office base in Aberdeen and a new Chief Executive, Stephen Stenning was appointed in May 2003. Developments during this time include the creation of Grampian Youth Orchestra. In November 2007 Stewart Aitken, formerly Artistic Director of Wigan Pier Theatre Company became the Chief Executive. International Festival of Youth Orchestras The International Festival of Youth Orchestras was created in the late 1960s by the late Blyth Major, Music Director of the Midland Youth Orchestra and Lionel Bryer, later Chairman of the International Youth Foundation. They conceived the idea of bringing together youth orchestras from all over the world at a festival using music as a unifying bond to promote international understanding. The first International Festival of Youth Orchestras was held in 1969 in St Moritz in Switzerland. Opera Garden Opera Garden was the Aberdeen International Youth Festival's Opera Project. Named after the Aberdonian opera singer, Mary Garden, the project aspired to continue her work, providing new challenges and performances for young singers. Conceived by Artistic Director Gidon Saks, the project brought together young singers from across the world and in three weeks produced a full-scale opera production. Opera Garden staged Cos√¨ fan tutte, Eugene Onegin, Don Giovanni, Carmen, The Magic Flute, Falstaff, The Turn of the Screw and Hansel and Gretel. AIYF Dance School The Festival's Dance Summer School ran for 25 years and welcomed teachers from major schools and companies worldwide including the Paris Opera Ballet School and the Kirov and Bolshoi companies. A Dance Summer School was held annually as part of the Aberdeen International Youth Festival. The school offered an intensive course in dance for students aged 12‚Äì16, a performance course for advanced level students in full-time training for a career in dance, a music theatre course and a 'taster day' for younger dance students.

European patents granted by the EPO under the European Patent Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties. An opposition can only be based on a limited number of grounds,\\"The function of Article 100 EPC is to provide, within the framework of the EPC, a limited number of legal bases, ie a limited number of objections on which an opposition can be based.\\" in Decision G 1/95 (19 July 1996), reasons 4.1. i.e. on the grounds that the subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The notice of opposition to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an opposition fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. Opposition Divisions of the EPO are responsible for the examination of oppositions. The opposition procedure may involve multiple opponents. According to the EPO, a European patent was once opposed by a record number of 27 opponents.European Commission Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report - 28 November 2008, Comments from the EPO, 10.03.2009 (Final), page 5. Purpose, framework, and available grounds  The purpose of the opposition proceedings is to give opponents, such as competitors, the opportunity to challenge the validity of a granted European patent.G9/93, 6 July 1994, Reasons, point 3. Opponents may also challenge only some of the claims of the European patent (although this is in practice rather unusualDecision G 9/91 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of 31 March 1993, point 8.), therefore limiting the framework of the opposition to the challenged claims.\\"By limiting the extent to which the patent is opposed to only certain subject-matters, the opponent deliberately refrains from making use of his right under the EPC to oppose remaining subject-matters covered by the patent. Such subject-matters are therefore, strictly speaking, not subject to any \\"opposition\\" in the sense of Articles 101 and 102 EPC, nor are there any \\"proceedings\\" in the sense of Articles 114 and 115 EPC in existence concerning such non-opposed subject-matters. Consequently, the EPO has no competence to deal with them at all.\\" in Decision G 9/91 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of 31 March 1993, Reasons for the Decision, item 10. However, an opposition can only be based on a limited number of grounds (i.e., objections) specified in the European Patent Convention, namely the grounds listed in . An opposition can be based on the grounds that the subject-matter of the patent is not patentable (Article 100(a) EPC, for instance because the claimed invention is not new or not inventive), on the ground that the invention is insufficiently disclosed to allow a person skilled in the art to carry it out (Article 100(b) EPC), or on the ground that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed ‚Äì\\"or, if the patent was granted on a divisional application or on a new application filed under , beyond the content of the earlier application as filed\\"‚Äì (Article 100(c) EPC). An opposition can for instance not be validly based on the grounds that the invention lacks unity () or that the right to the European patent does not belong to the proprietor of the patent ().  Filing and admissibility  Before starting the substantive examination of the opposition, the Opposition Division examines whether the opposition must be considered as filed (\\"Is there an opposition?\\") and whether it is admissible (\\"Is the opposition admissible?\\"). The Opposition Division may find that the opposition is not deemed to have been filed, for instance because the opposition fee has not been paid within the nine-month opposition period, because the notice of opposition is not signed, or because the notice is not in an accepted language. In order for an opposition to be admissible it must meet the provisions of * , i.e. a notice of opposition must be filed by a natural or legal person within nine months from the publication of the mention of grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin (the start of the nine- month opposition period depends on the publication of the mention of grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin, not on the publication of the specification of the European patent Decision T 1644/10 (Vers√§umnis der Einspruchsfrist/UTISOL) of 26.10.2011, Catchword 1, Boards of Appeal of the EPO.), and * , (formerly ) i.e. the notice of opposition must contain a statement of the extent to which the European patent is opposed and of the grounds on which the opposition is based, as well as an indication of the facts and evidence presented in support of these grounds. In addition, an opposition is also rejected as inadmissible if it fails to meet the requirements of (formerly ) after the opponent was invited to remedy to these failures within a given time limit. If the opposition is not admissible, the opposition is rejected under . (formerly ) Inadmissible oppositions and oppositions which are deemed not to have been filed are not substantively examined (no examination on the merits). An opposition can only be rejected as inadmissible if the opposition has been first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have been filed, the opposition exists, even if later the opposition is rejected as inadmissible. If an opposition is deemed not to have been filed, any opposition fee which has been paid is refunded.: \\"Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied, as a result of which the opposition is deemed not to have been filed\\". In contrast, if an opposition is rejected as inadmissible, an already paid opposition fee is not refunded.: \\"Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied in accordance with Rule 77(1) and (2), resulting in the opposition being rejected as inadmissible\\"; Visser, \\"The Annotated European Patent Convention\\", ed. 2009, p. 227 (Art. 99(1), point 4 \\"Procedure after filing\\".).  Straw man  An opposition may be filed by a straw man to conceal the identity of the party actually interested in having the patent revoked. A strawman is \\"a party acting on behalf of another person.\\" In 1999, the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the use of a straw man did not render the opposition inadmissible unless \\"the involvement of the opponent is to be regarded as circumventing the law by abuse of process.\\"Decision G 3/97 (Opposition on behalf of a third party) of 21 January 1999, Headnote 1(a), 1(b).

Substantive examination  Buildings of the EPO in Munich where some oppositions are handled. If the opposition is admissible, the grounds for opposition are examined as to their merits. The patent proprietor has also the opportunity to reply to the grounds of opposition developed by the opponent. Arguments and, to a certain extent, amendments may be filed in reply by the patent proprietor. In view of the grounds of opposition, and in view for instance of a prior art document introduced into the proceedings by the opponent, the patent proprietor may amend the patent, i.e. the description, claims and drawings of the patent, although amendments may not be filed of right at any stage during the opposition proceedings.Decision T 0383/11 of 17 April 2012, Reasons for the decision, 1.1. \\"The Boards of Appeal have derived, in particular from Rule 79(1) EPC, the principle that the proprietor does not have a right to have amendments admitted at any stage of opposition proceedings. At the discretion of the opposition division or the Board of Appeal, amendments can be refused if they are neither appropriate nor necessary (see case law of the Boards of Appeal, 6th edition 2010, VII.D.4.1.2, second paragraph).\\" The patent proprietor is master of its own patent in that the decision to amend or not, and how to amend the patent, is a decision of the patent proprietor alone (although the Opposition Division or the opponent may apply pressure to have amendments made). EPO Board of Appeal decision T 1099/06, Reasons 6. The patent, however, may not be amended in such a manner that the amendment would lead to an extension of the protection conferred by the patent. If amendments are made to the patent during the opposition proceedings, the patent (and the invention to which it relates) must meet the requirements of the EPC.Decision G 9/91 of 31 March 1993, point 19 of the reasons: \\"(...) in case of amendments of the claims or other parts of a patent in the course of opposition or appeal proceedings, such amendments are to be fully examined as to their compatibility with the requirements of the EPC (...)\\". These requirements notably include the requirements of support in the description and clarity (), even though those are not listed as grounds of opposition in .See also decision T 936/04 of 24 April 2008 on whether the double patenting prohibition can be raised in opposition proceedings: \\"It is within the discretion of the instances of the EPO to raise the objection in opposition or opposition appeal proceedings against proposed amended claims, but this should be done only in clear cases\\" (catchword 1). However, the requirements to be met by the amended patent do not include the requirement of unity of invention (because divisionals cannot be filed after grant).Decision G 1/91 of 9 December 1991. The reference to Article 102(3) in the decision is a reference to , corresponding to (of the revised text of the Convention, the so-called EPC 2000). During the opposition, oral proceedings may take place at the request of the EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the patentee or an opponent. The oral proceedings are held before the Opposition Division itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site.EPO web site, Oral proceedings calendar. Consulted on 28 October 2012. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard.\\"The right to oral proceedings according to Article 116 EPC is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard according to Article 113(1) EPC.\\" in Decision T 1012/03 of 1 December 2006, Reasons 25. A decision is generally pronounced at the end of the oral proceedings, with reasons to follow in writing.: \\"Delivery of the decision\\"  Outcome and effects of the opposition  The opposition proceedings may have one of three outcomes: * The patent is maintained as granted. This is the outcome if the opposition is rejected or if the Opposition Division decides to discontinue the opposition proceedings. The Opposition Division may decide to discontinue the opposition proceedings notably if the sole opposition or all the oppositions have been withdrawn and the patent proprietor is therefore the only remaining party to the proceedings. The withdrawal of an opposition may result from a settlement reached between the proprietor and the opponent.See for instance decision T 36/11 of 30 January 2012, Reasons for the Decision, item 1.4. See also (formerly ) and : \\"Continuation of the opposition proceedings in the cases covered by Rule 84\\". The opposition proceedings may also be discontinued \\"[i]f the European patent has been surrendered in all the designated Contracting States or has lapsed in all those States\\". * The patent is maintained in an amended form. In this case, a new patent specification is published. * The patent is revoked. This is the most successful outcome for the opponent, although the maintenance of a patent in an amended form may also be regarded as a success. The opposition has effect on all designated states in the European patent. Decisions by Opposition Divisions, like any other final decisions of first instance divisions, are appealable. A decision of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents.Malwina Mejer, Bruno van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, \\"Economic Incongruities in the European Patent System\\", ECARES working paper 2009‚Äê003, January 2009. In contrast, a decision of the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent at the national level (at least before the English courts).Glaxo Group Ltd v Genentech Inc & Anor [2008] EWCA Civ 23 (31 January 2008) The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction. Apportionment and fixing of costs Each party to the opposition proceedings normally bears the costs it has incurred, unless the Opposition Division (or, in appeal proceedings, the Board of Appeal under Article 16 of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA)), for reasons of equity, orders a different apportionment of costs. and For example, in case T 1306/05, a highly relevant document had been lately filed, without any valid justification, by the opponent during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal, thus rendering useless both the oral proceedings and the patent proprietor preparation thereto. Decision T 1306/05 of 10 July 2008, Boards of Appeal of the EPO. A different apportionment of costs has been ordered by the Board of Appeal. The patent proprietor has requested, under and , about ‚Ç¨26,000 to be paid by the opponent. Laurent Teyssedre, T1306/05 : r√©partition des frais, Le blog du droit europ√©en des brevets, 19 October 2008. Consulted on 8 November 2008. During first instance proceedings, a decision on apportionment of costs forms part of the main decision of the Opposition Division. The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs (apportionment), whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs.: \\"Decisions on the apportionment of costs\\". A decision on the award of costs is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect. When a Board of Appeal has to rule on an apportionment of costs, both the apportionment of costs and the fixing of costs to be apportioned are dealt with in a single decision.: \\"Procedure for fixing costs\\", third paragraph: \\"Where the boards of appeal have to rule on the apportionment of costs, they have the power (...) not only to apportion but also to fix the costs (...).\\" See for example T 1663/13 of 14 July 2016.  Transfer of opponent status  The opponent status cannot be freely transferred.Decision G 2/04 of 25 May 2005, Headnote I.(a).EPO Board of Appeal decision T 0384/08 of 26 June 2009, Reasons 24. As far as legal persons are concerned, the opposition can only be transferred or assigned to a third party together with the business assets belonging to a company, i.e. its economic activity, and more precisely the assets in the interests of which the opposition was filed. However, the status of an opponent passes to, i.e. is transmitted to, the opponent's universal successor in law in the case of a universal succession, such as for example in the case of a merger of two companies.G 4/88, OJ EPO 1989, 468, point 4 of the Reasons; see also Decision T 518/10 of 9 April 2013, point 3.1 of the Reasons. Intervention and observations by third parties =Intervention under Article 105 EPC  Under , any third party may intervene in ongoing opposition proceedings after the 9-month opposition period has expired, if the third party proves that \\"(a) proceedings for infringement of the same patent have been instituted against him, or (b) following a request of the proprietor of the patent to cease alleged infringement, the third party has instituted proceedings for a ruling that he is not infringing the patent.\\". Regarding the need for ongoing opposition proceedings for an intervention to be admissible, see for example \\"(...) opposition proceedings before the EPO cannot be \\"reopened\\" due to the advent of an intervener (...)\\" in Decision T 1713/11 of 12 December 2012, reasons 2.7. In other words, a third party may intervene \\"if faced with an infringement action or allegation of infringement (...) instituted in a national jurisdiction under national law.\\"Decision T 1713/11 of 12 December 2012, reasons 2.2. The admissibility of an intervention is subject to conditions. The so-called notice of intervention must notably be filed within three months of the date on which proceedings referred to in Article 105 are instituted. An admissible intervention is treated as an opposition. If the intervention is admissible, the intervener becomes party to the opposition proceedings. An intervention may be based on any ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC, and the intervener may naturally also introduce new facts and arguments, which can therefore not be regarded as late filed.Decision G 1/94 (OJ 1994, 787), headnote; and decision T 1235/14 of 10 October 2018, point 3. The possibility to intervene not only exists during pending opposition proceedings before an Opposition Division (i.e., during the first instance proceedings), but also during subsequent pending appeal proceedings before a Board of Appeal (i.e., during the second instance proceedings).Decision G 1/94 (OJ 1994, 787), point 10. An intervener who intervened during appeal proceedings is, however, not treated as appellant, but merely as party as of right within the meaning of . This has the consequence that, if the sole appellant withdraws their appeal, the appeal cannot continue with only an intervener who intervened during the appeal.Decision G 3/04. Observations by third parties under Article 115 EPC  Independently from the possibility to intervene in opposition proceedings (and then to become party to the proceedings), anyone may also file observations under . After publication of a European patent application, and a fortiori after grant of a European patent, anyone may file observations regarding the patentability of the invention which is the subject of the application (during examination proceedings) or patent (during opposition proceedings). In contrast to an intervener however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the \\"bundle of procedural rights\\" created \\"in respect of the opponent\\", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken.G4/88, 24 April 1989, Reasons, point 2. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online.Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 10 May 2011 concerning the filing of third party observations under Article 115 EPC by means of an online form, EPO Official Journal 7/2011, p. 418; Notice from the European Patent Office dated 10 May 2011 concerning the filing of third party observations under Article 115 EPC by means of an online form, EPO OJ 7/2011, p. 420. According to Board of Appeal 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed \\"in order to allow an identification of the third party\\" and, unless \\"adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own\\" or by the competent organ of the EPO of its own motion, \\"anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether.\\"Decision T 0146/07 of the Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.08 of 13 December 2011, Reasons for the Decision, 3 to 6, citing Schachenmann in: Singer/Stauder, Europ√§isches Patent√ºbereinkommen, 5th ed., Art. 115 marg. no. 13 Statistics, costs and duration Overall, about 5.5-6% of the European patents granted by the European Patent Office are opposed.EPO web site, CA/PL 29/99 dated 8.11.1999, Revision of the EPC: limitation procedure, in Travaux pr√©paratoires 1997-2000, Patent Law Committee documents, item II.7. Of those, over the course of 1980‚Äì2005, about 1/3 were revoked, 1/3 were maintained in an amended form, which generally means \\"reduced in scope\\", and 1/3 were maintained as granted, that is, the opposition was rejected. The same figures were cited in 2013. The opposition rate (i.e. the number of oppositions filed per 100 granted patents) before the EPO is consistently higher in the closest available proxy for the pharmaceutical sector than it is in organic chemistry and in all sectors (overall EPO average).European Commission, Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper), 28 November 2008, pages 10-11 (pdf, 1.95 MB). The success rate depends however on the technical area (i.e., on the IPC classes). The main reasons for revocation of a patent in opposition are a lack of inventive step (43%), a lack of novelty (22%) and an extension beyond the content of the application as filed (11%). Filing an opposition before the EPO is reportedly relatively affordable, \\"as the cost varies between ‚Ç¨6000 and ‚Ç¨50,000 (including patent lawyers‚Äô fees)\\" (as of 2009). In contrast, the costs for litigating a European patent can be much higher (\\"For example, in Germany the total litigation costs can be as high as ‚Ç¨2 million with ‚Ç¨10 million at stake\\"). An opposition case is reported to take on average three years to be handled by the EPO. Parallel national proceedings The \\"possibility of parallel validity proceedings in national courts and in the EPO is inherent in the legal arrangements in the EPC under which the EPO was established\\". If a third party files an opposition to a European patent with the EPO and also, in parallel, initiates a revocation action (also called \\"nullity action\\" or \\"validity proceedings\\") against the same patent before a national court, the national court (at least in England) may exercise its discretion to either * stay the national proceedings, in order to wait the outcome of the EPO opposition proceedings, or * allow the revocation proceedings to go ahead, without waiting the outcome of the EPO proceedings. The rules and practice differ from country to country in that respect. \\"For example, as of 2008, Belgium and France will stay the main proceeding until a final decision has been reached by the EPO whereas in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom such a stay is not automatic and in most cases the courts will continue the proceedings notwithstanding the opposition. ... However, in Germany national nullity proceedings cannot be started before the Federal Patent Court until the EPO opposition proceedings have been concluded or the opposition period has expired.\\"  Composition of an Opposition Division  According to , \\"[a]n Opposition Division shall consist of three technically qualified examiners, at least two of whom shall not have taken part in the proceedings for grant of the patent to which the opposition relates. An examiner who has taken part in the proceedings for the grant of the European patent may not be the Chairman.\\" Violations of Article 19(2) EPC are considered to be substantial procedural violations.See for instance Board of Appeal decision T 1349/10 (Composition of Opposition Division/ETHICON) of 2 February 2011, Reasons 4, citing also decisions T 251/88, T 939/91, T 382/92, T 476/95, and T 838/02. If an Opposition Division considers it necessary in a particular case, the Opposition Division may be enlarged by the addition of a legally qualified examiner (who cannot \\"have taken part in the proceedings for grant of the patent\\"). The same principles should constrain the composition of a Board of Appeal in opposition appeal proceedings vs. its composition in examination appeal proceedings in relation respectively to a European patent and the European patent application that gave rise to that patent.T 1028/96 (Suspected partiality/DU PONT DE NEMOURS) of 15.9.1999, reasons 6.6: \\"Article 19(2) EPC requires i.a. that an examiner who has taken part in the proceedings for the grant of the European patent shall not be the chairman of the Opposition Division. The Board does have some sympathy for the respondents' argument that, in the circumstances set out above, such prohibition should apply all the more to the second instance in view of its judicial function at supreme level within the European patent system.

Early life and education Griffin's father was an army officer, and his family moved frequently before eventually settling in Dallas, Texas in 1979. Griffin studied the trumpet and has a BA in Music from Morehead State University as well as an advanced degree in music from North Texas State University. Before becoming MC 900 Ft. Jesus, Griffin played in local Dallas bands The Telefones and Lithium X-Mas. Career Griffin's stage name came from a sermon by Oral Roberts, in which the televangelist claimed that he had received a vision of a Jesus, who commanded him to build a hospital (CityPlex Towers) on the campus of Oral Roberts University. Hell with the Lid Off (1990) was Griffin's first full-length release for MC 900 Ft. Jesus as well as the first time Griffin had appeared on a major record label. Featuring DJ Zero (Patrick Rollins) and the single \\"Truth is Out of Style\\" which gained a cult following. The following year Welcome to My Dream (1991) was released. DJ Zero appears on Welcome to My Dream under his real name, Patrick Rollins, because of uncertainty about whether he would be able to tour in support of the album. His subsequent single, \\"The City Sleeps\\", was featured in the album which explored the mind of a serial arsonist. The song sparked controversy in Baltimore when a then ABC affiliate, WJZ, ran a report suggesting that a series of arsons in the area was a result of WHFS's airing the song.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/01/29/on-the- beat/5911bb51-a181-4dba-8675-1eaeab741822/ His final album, One Step Ahead of the Spider, was released in 1994; it contained the single \\"If I Only Had a Brain\\", which became his best-known song. The song gained increased exposure from the music video directed for it by Spike Jonze, as well as exposure on MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head cartoon show. Rollins once again appears but is not listed in the credits.

The mile-long building, in the shape of a \\"U\\", was completely demolished in 2013. K-25 was the codename given by the Manhattan Project to the program to produce enriched uranium for atomic bombs using the gaseous diffusion method. Originally the codename for the product, over time it came to refer to the project, the production facility located at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the main gaseous diffusion building, and ultimately the site. When it was built in 1944, the four-story K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was the world's largest building, comprising over of floor space and a volume of . Construction of the K-25 facility was undertaken by J. A. Jones Construction. At the height of construction, over 25,000 workers were employed on the site. Gaseous diffusion was but one of three enrichment technologies used by the Manhattan Project. Slightly enriched product from the S-50 thermal diffusion plant was fed into the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. Its product in turn was fed into the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. The enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. In 1946, the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant became capable of producing highly enriched product. After the war, four more gaseous diffusion plants named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33 were added to the site. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Production of enriched uranium ended in 1964, and gaseous diffusion finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Demolition of all five gaseous diffusion plants was completed in February 2017. Background The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission in uranium by the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up the possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At the Pupin Laboratories at Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt. This prompted Roosevelt to initiate preliminary research in late 1939. Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler applied the liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies was due to the uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in natural uranium, about one in every 140; natural uranium is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, which accounts for just 0.006 percent. At Columbia, John R. Dunning believed this was the case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium-235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched. At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists‚ÄîOtto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls‚Äîthe task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within an order of magnitude of , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber aircraft of the day. Gaseous diffusion Gaseous diffusion uses semi- permeable membranes to separate enriched uranium. Stages are connected together to form a cascade. A, B and C are pumps. In April 1940, Jesse Beams, Ross Gunn, Fermi, Nier, Merle Tuve and Harold Urey had a meeting at the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C. At the time, the prospect of building an atomic bomb seemed dim, and even creating a chain reaction would likely require enriched uranium. They therefore recommended that research be conducted with the aim of developing the means to separate kilogram amounts of uranium-235. At a lunch on 21 May 1940, George B. Kistiakowsky suggested the possibility of using gaseous diffusion. Gaseous diffusion is based on Graham's law, which states that the rate of effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser. Gaseous diffusion had been used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had also used the process to separate gases. Uranium hexafluoride () was the only known compound of uranium sufficiently volatile to be used in the gaseous diffusion process. Before this could be done, the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University and the Kellex Corporation had to overcome formidable difficulties to develop a suitable barrier. Fortunately, fluorine consists of only a single isotope , so that the 1percent difference in molecular weights between and is due solely to the difference in weights of the uranium isotopes. For these reasons, was the only choice as a feedstock for the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium hexafluoride, a solid at room temperature, sublimes at at . Applying Graham's law to uranium hexafluoride: :{\\\\mbox{Rate}_1 \\\\over \\\\mbox{Rate}_2}=\\\\sqrt{M_2 \\\\over M_1}=\\\\sqrt{352 \\\\over 349} \\\\approx 1.0043 where: :Rate1 is the rate of effusion of 235UF6. :Rate2 is the rate of effusion of 238UF6. :M1 is the molar mass of 235UF6 ‚âà 235 + 6 √ó 19 = 349g¬∑mol‚àí1 :M2 is the molar mass of 238UF6 ‚âà 238 + 6 √ó 19 = 352g¬∑mol‚àí1 Uranium hexafluoride is a highly corrosive substance. It is an oxidant and a Lewis acid which is able to bind to fluoride. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and is very difficult to handle on an industrial scale. Organization Booth, Dunning and von Grosse investigated the gaseous diffusion process. In 1941, they were joined by Francis G. Slack from Vanderbilt University and Willard F. Libby from the University of California. In July 1941, an Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) contract was awarded to Columbia University to study gaseous diffusion. With the help of the mathematician Karl P. Cohen, they built a twelve-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant at the Pupin Laboratories. Initial tests showed that the stages were not as efficient as the theory would suggest; they would need about 4,600 stages to enrich to 90 percent uranium-235. The Woolworth Building in Manhattan housed the offices of the Kellex Corporation and the Manhattan District's New York Area A secret contract was awarded to M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District, the US Army component of the Manhattan Project, as the effort to develop an atomic bomb became known, contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because the scope of the project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million. For security reasons, the Army had Kellogg establish a wholly owned subsidiary, the Kellex Corporation, so the gaseous diffusion project could be kept separate from other company work. \\"Kell\\" stood for \\"Kellogg\\" and \\"X\\" for secret. Kellex operated as a self-contained and autonomous entity. Percival C. Keith, Kellogg's vice president of engineering, was placed in charge of Kellex. He drew extensively on Kellogg to staff the new company, but also had to recruit staff from outside as well. Eventually, Kellex would have over 3,700 employees. Dunning remained in charge at Columbia until 1May 1943, when the Manhattan District took over the contract from OSRD. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it was working on the most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in five other groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, Dunning becoming head of one of its divisions. It would remain this way until 1March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by Union Carbide. The expansion of the SAM Laboratories led to a search for more space. The Nash Garage Building at 3280 Broadway was purchased by Columbia University. Originally an automobile dealership, it was just a few blocks from the campus. Major Benjamin K. Hough Jr. was the Manhattan District's Columbia Area engineer, and he moved his offices here too. Kellex was in the Woolworth Building at 233 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. In January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel James C. Stowers was appointed New York Area Engineer, with responsibility for the entire K-25 Project. His small staff, initially of 20 military and civilian personnel, but which gradually grew to over 70, was co-located in the Woolworth Building. The Manhattan District had its offices nearby at 270 Broadway until it moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in August 1943. Codename The codename \\"K-25\\" was a combination of the \\"K\\" from Kellex, and \\"25\\", a World War II-era code designation for uranium-235 (an isotope of element 92, mass number 235). The term was first used in Kellex internal reports for the end product, enriched uranium, in March 1943. By April 1943, the term \\"K-25 plant\\" was being used for the plant that created it. That month, the term \\"K-25 Project\\" was applied to the entire project to develop uranium enrichment using the gaseous diffusion process. When other \\"K-\\" buildings were added after the war, \\"K-25\\" became the name of the original, larger complex. Research and development=Diffusers A gaseous diffusion cell, showing the diffuser The highly corrosive nature of uranium hexafluoride presented several technological challenges. Pipes and fittings that it came into contact with had to be made of, or clad with nickel. This was fine for small objects, but impractical for the large diffusers, the tank-like containers that had to hold the gas under pressure. Nickel was a vital war material, and although the Manhattan Project could use its overriding priority to acquire it, making the diffusers out of solid nickel would deplete the national supply. The director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., gave the contract to build the diffusers to Chrysler. In turn, its president, K. T. Keller assigned Carl Heussner, an expert in electroplating, the task of developing a process for electroplating such a large object. Senior Chrysler executives called this \\"Project X-100\\". Electroplating used one-thousandth of the nickel of a solid nickel diffuser. The SAM Laboratories had already attempted this and failed. Heussner experimented with a prototype in a building built within a building, and found that it could be done, so long as the series of pickling and scaling steps required were done without anything coming in contact with oxygen. Chrysler's entire factory at Lynch Road in Detroit was turned over to the manufacture of diffusers. The electroplating process required over of floor space, several thousand workers and a complicated air filtration system to ensure the nickel was not contaminated. By the war's end, Chrysler had built and shipped more than 3,500 diffusers. Pumps The gaseous diffusion process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, it would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or of oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high for this type of pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps. In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith approached the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, saying it could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers. Barriers Difficulties with the diffusers and pumps paled into insignificance besides those with the porous barrier. To work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope that this could be overcome. Setting up a process pump In 1943, Urey brought in Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University to look at the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made progress on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of fifty percent was probably infeasible, and the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment which could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems. Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex had made researchers at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not taking advantage of the latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM Laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and the Norris-Adler barriers. Groves summoned British help, in the form of Wallace Akers and fifteen members of the British gaseous diffusion project, who would review the progress made thus far. Their verdict was that while the new barrier was potentially superior, Keith's undertaking to build a new facility to produce the new barrier in just four months, produce all the barriers required in another four and have the production facility up and running in just twelve \\"would be something of a miraculous achievement\\". On 16 January 1944, Groves ruled in favor of the Johnson barrier. Johnson built a pilot plant for the new process at the Nash Building. Taylor analyzed the sample barriers produced and pronounced only 5percent of them to be of acceptable quality. Edward Mack Jr. created his own pilot plant at Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia, and Groves obtained of nickel from the International Nickel Company. With plenty of nickel to work with, by April 1944, both pilot plants were producing barriers of acceptable quality 45 percent of the time. Construction The site chosen was at the Clinton Engineer Works in Tennessee. The area was inspected by representatives of the Manhattan District, Kellex and Union Carbide on 18 January 1943. Consideration was also given to sites near the Shasta Dam in California and the Big Bend of the Columbia River in Washington state. The lower humidity of these areas made them more suitable for a gaseous diffusion plant, but the Clinton Engineer Works site was immediately available and otherwise suitable. Groves decided on the site in April 1943. Under the contract, Kellex had responsibility not just for the design and engineering of the K-25 plant, but for its construction as well. The prime construction contractor was J. A. Jones Construction from Charlotte, North Carolina. It had impressed Groves with its work on several major Army construction projects, such as Camp Shelby, Mississippi. There were more than sixty subcontractors. Kellex engaged another construction company, Ford, Bacon & Davis, to build the fluorine and nitrogen facilities, and the conditioning plant. Construction work was initially the responsibility of Lieutenant Colonel Warren George, the Chief of the Construction Division of the Clinton Engineer Works. Major W. P. Cornelius became the construction officer responsible for K-25 works on 31 July 1943. He was answerable to Stowers back in Manhattan. He became Chief of the Construction Division on 1March 1946. J. J. Allison was the resident engineer from Kellex, and Edwin L. Jones, the General Manager of J. A. Jones. Power plant K-25 power plant (the building with three smoke stacks) in 1945. The dark building behind it is the S-50 thermal diffusion plant. Construction began before completion of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Because of the large amount of electric power the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers. A site was chosen for this on the western edge of the Clinton Engineer Works site where it could draw cold water from the Clinch River and discharge warm water into Poplar Creek without affecting the inflow. Groves approved this location on 3May 1943. Surveying began on the power plant site on 31 May 1943, and J. A. Jones started construction work the following day. Because the bedrock was below the surface, the power plant was supported on 40 concrete- filled caissons. Installation of the first boiler commenced in October 1943. Construction work was complete by late September. To prevent sabotage, the power plant was connected to the gaseous diffusion plant by an underground conduit. Despite this, there was one act of sabotage, in which a nail was driven through the electric cable. The culprit was never found, but was considered more likely to be a disgruntled employee than an Axis spy. Electric power in the United States was generated at 60 hertz; the power house was able to generate variable frequencies between 45 and 60 hertz, and constant frequencies of 60 and 120 hertz. This capability was not ultimately required, and all but one of the K-25 systems ran on a constant 60 hertz, the exception using a constant 120 hertz. The first coal-fired boiler was started on 7April 1944, followed by the second on 14 July 1944 and the third on 2November 1944. Each produced of steam an hour at a pressure of and a temperature of . To obtain the fourteen turbine generators needed, Groves had to use the Manhattan Project's priority to overrule Julius Albert Krug, the director of the Office of War Utilities. The turbine generators had a combined output of 238,000 kilowatts. The power plant could also receive power from TVA. It was decommissioned in the 1960s and demolished in 1995. Gaseous diffusion plant A site for the K-25 facility was chosen near the high school of the now-abandoned town of Wheat. As the dimensions of the K-25 facility became more apparent, it was decided to move it to a larger site near Poplar Creek, closer to the power plant. This site was approved on 24 June 1943. Considerable work was required to prepare the site. Existing roads in the area were improved to take heavy traffic. A new road was built to connect the site to US Route 70, and another, long, to connect with Tennessee State Route 61. An old ferry over the Clinch River was upgraded, and then replaced with a bridge in December 1943. A railroad spur was run from Blair, Tennessee, to the K-25 site. Some of sidings were also provided. The first carload of freight traversed the line on 18 September 1943. K-25 under construction It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946. Work began on the main facility area on 20 October 1943. Although generally flat, some of soil and rock had to be excavated from areas up to high, and six major areas had to be filled in, to a maximum depth of . Normally buildings containing complicated heavy machinery would rest on concrete columns down to the bedrock, but this would have required thousands of columns of different length. To save time soil compaction was used instead. Layers were laid down and compacted with sheepsfoot rollers in the areas that had to be filled in, and the footings were laid over compacted soil in the low-lying areas and the undisturbed soil in the areas that had been excavated. Activities overlapped, so concrete pouring began while grading was still going on. Cranes started lifting the steel frames into place on 19 January 1944. K-25 under construction Kellex's design for the main process building of K-25 called for a four-story U-shaped structure long containing 51 main process buildings and 3purge cascade buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively, within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. When completed, there were 2,892 stages. The basement housed the auxiliary equipment, such as the transformers, switch gears, and air conditioning systems. The ground floor contained the cells. The third level contained the piping. The fourth floor was the operating floor, which contained the control room, and the hundreds of instrument panels. From here, the operators monitored the process. The first section was ready for test runs on 17 April 1944, although the barriers were not yet ready to be installed. The main process building surpassed The Pentagon as the largest building in the world, with a floor area of , and an enclosed volume of . Construction required of concrete, and of gas pipes. Because uranium hexafluoride corrodes steel, and steel piping had to be coated in nickel, smaller pipes were made of copper or monel. The equipment operated under vacuum pressures, so plumbing had to be air tight. Special efforts were made to create as clean an environment as possible to areas where piping or fixtures were being installed. J. A. Jones established a special cleanliness unit on 18 April 1944. Buildings were completely sealed off, air was filtered, and all cleaning was with vacuum cleaners and mopping. Workers wore white lintless gloves. At the peak of construction activity in May 1945, 25,266 people were employed on the site. Other buildings Although by far the largest, the main process building (K-300) was but one of many that made up the facility. There was a conditioning building (K-1401), where piping and equipment were cleaned prior to installation. A feed purification building (K-101), was built to remove impurities from the uranium hexafluoride, but never operated as such because the suppliers provided feed good enough to be fed into the gaseous diffusion process. The three-story surge and waste removal building (K-601) processed the \\"tail\\" stream of depleted uranium hexafluoride. The air conditioning building (K-1401) provided per minute of clean, dry air. K-1201 compressed the air. The nitrogen plant (K-1408) provided gas for use as a pump sealant and to protect equipment from moist air. The K-1001 administration building provided of office space The fluorine generating plant (K-1300) generated, bottled and stored fluorine. It had not been in great demand before the war, and Kellex and the Manhattan District considered four different processes for large-scale production. A process developed by the Hooker Chemical Company was chosen. Owing to the hazardous nature of fluorine, it was decided that shipping it across the United States was inadvisable, and it should be manufactured on site at the Clinton Engineer Works. Two pump houses (K-801 and K-802) and two cooling towers (H-801 and H-802) provided of cooling water per day for the motors and compressors. The administration building (K-1001) provided of office space. A laboratory building (K-1401) contained facilities for testing and analyzing feed and product. Five drum warehouses (K-1025-A to -E) had of floor space to store drums of uranium hexafluoride. Originally this was on the K-27 site. The buildings were moved on a truck to make way for K-27. There were also warehouses for general stores (K-1035), spare parts (K-1036) and equipment (K-1037). A cafeteria (K-1002) provided meal facilities, including a segregated lunch room for African Americans. There were three changing houses (K-1008-A, B and C), a dispensary (K-1003), an instrument repair building (K-1024), and a fire station (K-1021). In mid-January 1945, Kellex proposed an extension to K-25 to allow product enrichment of up to 85 percent. Grove initially approved this, but later canceled it in favor of a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27, which could process a slightly enriched product. This could then be fed into K-25 or the calutrons at the Y-12. Kellex estimated that using the enriched feed from K-27 could lift the output from K-25 from 35 to 60 percent uranium-235. Construction started at K-27 on 3April 1945, and was completed in December 1945. The construction work was expedited by making it \\"virtually a Chinese copy\\" of a section of K-25. By 31 December 1946, when the Manhattan Project ended, 110,048,961 man-hours of construction work had been performed at the K-25 site. The total cost, including that of K-27, was $479,589,999. Operations The K-25 control room The preliminary specification for the K-25 plant in March 1943 called for it to produce a day of product that was 90 percent uranium-235. As the practical difficulties were realized, this target was reduced to 36 percent. On the other hand, the cascade design meant construction did not need to be complete before the plant started operating. In August 1943, Kellex submitted a schedule that called for a capability to produce material enriched to 5percent uranium-235 by 1June 1945, 15 percent by 1July 1945, and 36 percent by 23 August 1945. This schedule was revised in August 1944 to 0.9 percent by 1January 1945, 5percent by 10 June 1945, 15 percent by 1August 1945, 23 percent by 13 September 1945, and 36 percent as soon as possible after that. A meeting between the Manhattan District and Kellogg on 12 December 1942 recommended the K-25 plant be operated by Union Carbide. This would be through a wholly owned subsidiary, Carbon and Carbide Chemicals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was signed on 18 January 1943, setting the fee at $75,000 per month. This was later increased to $96,000 a month to operate both K-25 and K-27. Union Carbide did not wish to be the sole operator of the facility. Union Carbide suggested the conditioning plant be built and operated by Ford, Bacon & Davis. The Manhattan District found this acceptable, and a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was negotiated with a fee of $216,000 for services up to the end of June 1945. The contract was terminated early on 1May 1945, when Union Carbide took over the plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis was therefore paid $202,000. The other exception was the fluorine plant. Hooker Chemical was asked to supervise its construction of the fluorine plant, and initially to operate it for a fixed fee of $24,500. The plant was turned over to Union Carbide on 1February 1945. A worker on a bicycle in the K-25 operating level Part of the K-300 complex was taken over by Union Carbide in August 1944, and was run as a pilot plant, training operators and developing procedures, using nitrogen instead of uranium hexafluoride until October 1944, and then perfluoroheptane until April 1945. The design of the gaseous diffusion plant allowed for it to be completed in sections, and for these to be put into operation while work continued on the others. J. A. Jones completed the first 60 stages by the end of 1944. Before each stage was accepted, it underwent tests by J. A. Jones, Carbide and Carbon and SAM Laboratories technicians to verify that the equipment was working and there were no leaks. Between four and six hundred people devoted eight months to this testing. Perfluoroheptane was used as a test fluid until February 1945, when it was decided to use uranium hexafluoride despite its corrosive nature. The Manhattan District engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols, placed Major John J. Moran in charge of production at K-25. Production commenced in February 1945, and the first product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, the gaseous diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing uranium hexafluoride feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, the gaseous diffusion plant would take the product of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. Highly enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the bombing of Hiroshima on 6August 1945. Air compressors and water pumps in the K-1101 air conditioning building With the end of the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's priority shifted from speed to economy and efficiency. The cascades were configurable, so they could produce a large amount of slightly enriched product by running them in parallel, or a small amount of highly enriched product through running them in series. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the facility was producing per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident. After some deliberation, with opinions sought and obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, it was decided that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as a satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1January 1947. Closure and demolition K-25 became a prototype for other gaseous diffusion facilities established in the early post-war years. The first of these was the K-27 completed in September 1945. It was followed by the K-29 in 1951, the K-31 in 1951 and the K-33 in 1954. Further gaseous diffusion facilities were built at Paducah, Kentucky, in 1952, and Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1954. The K-25 plant was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Demolition of K-25 in progress in April 2012 Today, uranium isotope separation is usually done by the more energy-efficient ultra centrifuge process, developed in the Soviet Union after World War II by Soviet and captured German engineers working in detention. The centrifuge process was the first isotope separation method considered for the Manhattan project, but was abandoned due to technical challenges early in the project. When German scientists and engineers were released from Soviet captivity in the mid-1950s the West became aware of the ultra centrifuge design and began shifting uranium enrichment to this much more efficient process. As centrifuge technology advanced, it became possible to carry out uranium enrichment on a smaller scale without the vast resources that were necessary to build and operate 1940s and '50s \\"K\\" and \\"Y\\" style separation plants, a development which had the effect of increasing nuclear proliferation concerns. Centrifuge cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1961. A gas centrifuge test facility (K-1210) opened in 1975, followed by a larger centrifuge plant demonstration facility (K-1220) in 1982. In response to an order from President Lyndon B. Johnson to cut production of enriched uranium by 25 percent, K-25 and K-27 ceased production in 1964, but in 1969 K-25 began producing uranium enriched to 3to 5percent for use in nuclear reactors. Martin Marietta Energy replaced Union Carbide as the operator in 1984. Gaseous diffusion ceased on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Production of enriched uranium using gaseous diffusion ceased in Portsmouth in 2001, and at Paducah in 2013. Nowadays all commercial uranium enrichment in the United States is carried out using gas centrifuge technology. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) contracted with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) in 1997 to decontaminate and decommission the facilities. Its subsidiary Reactor Sites Management Company Limited (RSMC) was acquired by EnergySolutions in June 2007. Initially K-29, K-31 and K-33 were to be retained for other uses, but it was subsequently decided to demolish them. Bechtel Jacobs, the environmental management contractor, assumed responsibility for the facility in July 2005. Demolition of K-29 began in January 2006, and was completed in August. Demolition of K-33 began in January 2011, and was completed ahead of schedule in September 2011. It was followed by the demolition of K-31, which began on 8October 2014, and was completed on 26 June 2015. Bechtel Jacobs was contracted to dismantle and demolish the K-25 facility in September 2008. The contract, valued at $1.48 billion, was made retrospective to October 2007, and ended in August 2011. Since then demolition work has been carried out by DOE's current environmental management contractor, URS  CH2M Hill Oak Ridge (UCOR). Demolition of the K-25 facility was expected to be completed by July 2014. By 23 January 2013, demolition of the north and west wings was complete, with only a small portion of the east wing remaining (6 units out of 24 on the east wing). The final section of the east wing was brought down on 19 December 2013. The last debris was removed in 2014. Demolition of K-27, the last of the five gaseous diffusion facilities at Oak Ridge, began in February 2016. US Senator Lamar Alexander and US Congressman Chuck Fleischmann joined 1,500 workers to watch the final wall come down on 30 August 2016. Its demolition was completed on 28 February 2017.

Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vaticanus Palatinus lat. 1632, fol. 51v. The Georgics (; ) is a poem by Latin poet Virgil, likely published in 29 BCE.Thomas, Richard F. Georgics Vol.I: Books I‚ÄìII. Cambridge, 1988. I. As the name suggests (from the Greek word , ge≈çrgika, i.e. \\"agricultural (things)\\") the subject of the poem is agriculture; but far from being an example of peaceful rural poetry, it is a work characterized by tensions in both theme and purpose. The Georgics is considered Virgil's second major work, following his Eclogues and preceding the Aeneid. The poem draws on a variety of prior sources and has influenced many later authors from antiquity to the present. Description and summary The work consists of 2,188 hexametric verses divided into four books. The yearly timings by the rising and setting of particular stars were valid for the precession epoch of Virgil's time, and so are not always valid now. Book One Virgil begins his poem with a summary of the four books, followed by a prayer to various agricultural deities as well as Augustus himself. It takes as its model the work on farming by Varro, but differs from it in important ways.See Varro, R.R. 1.1.4‚Äì6 Numerous technical passages fill out the initial half of the first book; of particular interest are lines 160‚Äì175, where Virgil describes the plow. In the succession of ages, whose model is ultimately Hesiod, the age of Jupiter and its relation to the golden age and the current age of man are crafted with deliberate tension.Compare Hesiod, Works and Days 1‚Äì201, 383‚Äì659 Of chief importance is the contribution of labor to the success or failure of mankind's endeavors, agricultural or otherwise. The book comes to one climax with the description of a great storm in lines 311‚Äì350, which brings all of man's efforts to nothing. After detailing various weather-signs, Virgil ends with an enumeration of the portents associated with Caesar‚Äôs assassination and civil war; only Octavian offers any hope of salvation. One of four Polish frieze paintings in the King's palace at Wilan√≥w illustrating the Georgics, 1683 Book Two Prominent themes of the second book include agriculture as man's struggle against a hostile natural world, often described in violent terms, and the ages of Saturn and Jupiter. Like the first book, it begins with a poem addressing the divinities associated with the matters about to be discussed: viticulture, trees, and the olive. In the next hundred lines, Virgil treats forest and fruit trees. Their propagation and growth are described in detail, with a contrast drawn between methods that are natural and those that require human intervention. Three sections on grafting are of particular interest: presented as marvels of man's alteration of nature, many of the examples Virgil gives are unlikely or impossible. Also included is a catalogue of the world's trees, set forth in rapid succession, and other products of various lands. Perhaps the most famous passage of the poem, the Laudes Italiae or Praises of Italy, is introduced by way of a comparison with foreign marvels: despite all of those, no land is as praiseworthy as Italy. A point of cultural interest is a reference to Ascra in line 176, which an ancient reader would have known as the hometown of Hesiod. Next comes the care of vines, culminating in a vivid scene of their destruction by fire; then advice on when to plant vines, and therein the other famous passage of the second book, the Praises of Spring. These depict the growth and beauty that accompany spring's arrival. The poet then returns to didactic narrative with yet more on vines, emphasizing their fragility and laboriousness. A warning about animal damage provides occasion for an explanation of why goats are sacrificed to Bacchus. The olive tree is then presented in contrast to the vine: it requires little effort on the part of the farmer. The next subject, at last turning away from the vine, is other kinds of trees: those that produce fruit and those that have useful wood. Then Virgil again returns to grapevines, recalling the myth of the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs in a passage known as the Vituperation of Vines. The remainder of the book is devoted to extolling the simple country life over the corruptness of the city. Book Three The third book is chiefly and ostensibly concerned with animal husbandry. It consists of two principal parts, the first half is devoted to the selection of breed stock and the breeding of horses and cattle. It concludes with a description of the furor induced in all animals by sexual desire. The second half of the book is devoted to the care and protection of sheep and goats and their byproducts. It concludes with a description of the havoc and devastation caused by a plague in Noricum. Both halves begin with a short prologue called a proem. The poems invoke Greek and Italian gods and address such issues as Virgil's intention to honor both Caesar and his patron Maecenas, as well as his lofty poetic aspirations and the difficulty of the material to follow. Many have observed the parallels between the dramatic endings of each half of this book and the irresistible power of their respective themes of love and death. Book Four Book four, a tonal counterpart to book two, is divided approximately in half; the first half (1‚Äì280) is didactic and deals with the life and habits of bees, supposedly a model for human society. Bees resemble man in that their labor is devoted to a king and they give their lives for the sake of the community, but they lack the arts and love. In spite of their labor, the bees perish and the entire colony dies. The restoration of the bees is accomplished by bugonia, spontaneous rebirth from the carcass of an ox. This process is described twice in the second half (281‚Äì568) and frames the Aristaeus epyllion beginning at line 315. The tone of the book changes from didactic to epic and elegiac in this epyllion, which contains within it the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Aristaeus, after losing his bees, descends to the home of his mother, the nymph Cyrene, where he is given instructions on how to restore his colonies. He must capture the seer, Proteus, and force him to reveal which divine spirit he angered and how to restore his bee colonies. After binding Proteus (who changes into many forms to no avail), Aristaeus is told by the seer that he angered the nymphs by causing the death of the nymph Eurydice, wife of Orpheus. Proteus describes the descent of Orpheus into the underworld to retrieve Eurydice, the backward look that caused her return to Tartarus, and at last Orpheus' death at the hands of the Ciconian women. Book four concludes with an eight-line sphragis or seal in which Virgil contrasts his life of poetry with that of Octavian the general.  Sources =Greek Cristoforo Majorana - Leaf from Eclogues, Georgics and Aeneid - Walters W40016V - Open Reverse Virgil's model for composing a didactic poem in hexameters is the archaic Greek poet Hesiod, whose poem Works and Days shares with the Georgics the themes of man's relationship to the land and the importance of hard work. The Hellenistic poet Nicander's lost Georgics may also be an important influence. Virgil used other Greek writers as models and sources, some for technical information, including the Hellenistic poet Aratus for astronomy and meteorology, Nicander for information about snakes, the philosopher Aristotle for zoology, and Aristotle's student Theophrastus for botany, and others, such as the Hellenistic poet Callimachus for poetic and stylistic considerations. The Greek literary tradition from Homer on also serves as an important source for Virgil's use of mythological detail and digression. Roman Lucretius' De Rerum Natura serves as Virgil's primary Latin model in terms of genre and meter. Many passages from Virgil's poetry are indebted to Lucretius: the plague section of the third book takes as its model the plague of Athens that closes the De Rerum Natura. Virgil is also indebted to Ennius, who, along with Lucretius, naturalized hexameter verse in Latin. Virgil often uses language characteristic of Ennius to give his poetry an archaic quality. The intriguing idea has been put forth by one scholar that Virgil also drew on the rustic songs and speech patterns of Italy at certain points in his poem, to give portions of the work a distinct, Italian character.Richard F. Thomas, \\"Vestigia Ruris: Urbane Rusticity in Virgil's Georgics,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 97 (1995): 201‚Äì202 Virgil draws on the neoteric poets at times, and Catullus' Carmen 64 very likely had a large impact on the epyllion of Aristaeus that ends the Georgics 4. Virgil's extensive knowledge and skillful integration of his models is central to the success of different portions of the work and the poem as a whole. Cultural contexts= Philosophical context  The two predominant philosophical schools in Rome during Virgil's lifetime were Stoicism and Epicureanism.Smiley, Charles, N. (1931). \\"Vergil. His Philosophic Background and His Relation to Christianity\\", Classical Journal 26: 660‚Äì675. p. 663 Of these two, the Epicurean strain is predominant not only in the Georgics but also in Virgil's social and intellectual milieu. Varius Rufus, a close friend of Virgil and the man who published the Aeneid after Virgil's death, had Epicurean tastes, as did Horace and his patron Maecenas.Conte, G. B. (1994). Latin Literature: A History. Baltimore. p. 258 The philosophical text with the greatest influence on the Georgics as a whole was Lucretius' Epicurean epic De Rerum Natura. G. B. Conte notes, citing the programmatic statement \\"Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas\\" in Georgics 2.490‚Äì502, which draws from De Rerum Natura 1.78‚Äì9, \\"the basic impulse for the Georgics came from a dialogue with Lucretius.\\"Conte, G. B. (1994). Latin Literature: A History. Baltimore. pp. 271‚Äì2 Likewise, David West remarks in his discussion of the plague in the third book, Virgil is \\"saturated with the poetry of Lucretius, and its words, phrases, thought and rhythms have merged in his mind, and become transmuted into an original work of poetic art.\\" (1979). \\"Two plagues: Virgil, Georgics 3.478‚Äì566 and Lucretius 6.1090‚Äì1286\\", in D. West and T. Woodman, edd., Creative Imitation and Latin Literature. Cambridge. p. 77  Political context  Virgil teaching, a miniature from a 15th-century French manuscript of the Georgics Beginning with Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE and ending with Octavian's victory over Anthony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 BCE, Rome had been engaged in a series of almost constant civil wars. After almost 15 years of political and social upheaval, Octavian, the sole surviving member of the Second Triumvirate,The other members were Marcus Antonius (Anthony) and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. became firmly established as the new leader of the Roman world. Under Octavian,Octavian received the name \\"Augustus\\" in 27 BCE. Rome enjoyed a long period of relative peace and prosperity. However, Octavian's victory at Actium also sounded the death knell of the Republic. With Octavian as the sole ruler of the Roman world, the Roman Empire was born. It was during this period, and against this backdrop of civil war, that Virgil composed the Georgics. While not containing any overtly political passages, politics are not absent from the Georgics. Not only is Octavian addressed in the poem both directly and indirectly, but the poem also contains several passages that include references and images that could be interpreted as political, such as the description of the plague in Book 3 and Virgil's famous description of bee society in Book 4. It is impossible to know whether or not these references and images were intended to be seen as political in nature, but it would not be inconceivable that Virgil was in some way influenced by the years of civil war. Whether they were intentional or not, if we believe Suetonius,Suetonius, Vita Vergili, ch. 27. these references did not seem to trouble Octavian, to whom Virgil is said to have recited the Georgics in 29 BCE.  Laudes Galli  A comment by the Virgilian commentator Servius, that the middle to the end of the fourth book contained a large series of praises for Cornelius Gallus (laudes Galli means \\"praises of Gallus\\" in Latin), has spurred much scholarly debate.Thomas, Richard F. Georgics Vol. I. Cambridge, 1988. pp 13‚Äì16. Servius tells us that after Gallus had fallen out of favor, Virgil replaced the praises of Gallus with the Orpheus episode. Those supporting Servius see the Orpheus episode as an unpolished, weak episode, and point out that it is unlike anything else in the Georgics in that it radically departs from the didactic mode that we see throughout, rendering it an illogical, awkward insertion. Indeed, the features of the episode are unique; it is an epyllion that engages mythological material. The episode does not further the narrative and has no immediately apparent relevance to Virgil's topic. The difficult, open-ended conclusion seems to confirm this interpretation. In a highly influential article Anderson debunked this view,\\"Servius in G. 1.1, 317‚Äì86; W. B. Anderson (1933) \\"Gallus and the Fourth Georgic\\" CQ 27: 36‚Äì45 and it is now generally believed that there were not Laudes Galli and that the Orpheus episode is original. Generally, arguments against the view above question Servius' reliability, citing the possibility that he confused the end of the Georgics with the end of the Eclogues, which does make mention of Gallus. Further, they question its validity based on chronological evidence: the Georgics would have been finished a number of years before the disgrace and suicide of Gallus, and so one would expect more evidence of an alternative version of the end of the poem‚Äîor at least more sources mentioning it. Instead, the Orpheus episode is here understood as an integral part of the poem that articulates or encapsulates its ethos by reinforcing many ideas or reintroducing and problematizing tensions voiced throughout the text. The range of scholarship and interpretations offered is vast, and the arguments range from optimistic or pessimistic readings of the poem to notions of labor, Epicureanism, and the relationship between man and nature. Repetitions in the Aeneid Within Virgil's later epic work the Aeneid, there are some 51 lines that are recycled, either whole or in part, from the Georgics. There is some debate whether these repetitions are (1) intrusions within the text of later scribes and editors, (2) indications pointing toward the level of incompleteness of the Aeneid, or (3) deliberate repetitions made by the poet, pointing toward meaningful areas of contact between the two poems. As a careful study by Ward Briggs goes a long way to show, the repetition of lines in the Georgics and the Aeneid is probably an intentional move made by Virgil, a poet given to a highly allusive style, not, evidently, to the exclusion of his own previous writings. Indeed, Virgil incorporates full lines in the Georgics of his earliest work, the Eclogues, although the number of repetitions is much smaller (only eight) and it does not appear that any one line was reduplicated in all three of his works. The repetitions of material from the Georgics in the Aeneid vary in their length and degree of alteration. Some of the less exact, single-line reduplications may very well show a nodding Virgil or scribal interpolation. The extended repetitions, however, show some interesting patterns. In about half the cases, technical, agrarian descriptions are adapted into epic similes. This is fitting, as the stuff of many epic similes is rooted in the natural and domestic worlds from which epic heroes are cut off. Virgil shows his technical expertise by recontextualizing identical lines to produce meanings that are different, or inverted from their initial meaning in the Georgics. Additionally, some of these reproduced lines are themselves adapted from works by Virgil's earlier literary models, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica, Ennius' Annals, and Lucretius' On the Nature of Things. With a single line or two, Virgil links (or distances), expands (or collapses) themes of various texts treating various subjects to create an Aeneid that is a richly intertextual.For a full listing of all the repetitions found within the Aeneid and corresponding line numbers in the Georgics, see Briggs, W. Ward, \\"Lines Repeated from the Georgics in the Aeneid\\", Classical Journal 77: 130‚Äì147, 1982; also Briggs, W. Ward, Narrative and Simile from the Georgics in the Aeneid (Leiden: Brill, 1980) Reception and influence Author portrait of Virgil, Vergilius Romanus Folio 14 Reception in antiquity The work on Georgics was launched when agriculture had become a science and Varro had already published his Res rusticae, on which Virgil relied as a source‚Äîa fact already recognized by the commentator Servius. Virgil's scholarship on his predecessors produced an extensive literary reaction by the following generations of authors. Seneca's account that \\"Virgil ... aimed, not to teach the farmer, but to please the reader,\\" underlines that Virgil's poetic and philosophic themes were abounding in his hexameters (Sen., Moral Letter 86.15). Reception in the 18th century John Dryden‚Äôs 1697 poetic translation of Virgil's Georgics sparked a renewed interest in agricultural poetry and country life amongst the more educated classes during the 18th century. In the same year, the young Joseph Addison published his ‚ÄúEssay on Virgil‚Äôs Georgics‚Äù. In his eyes Virgil's poem seemed the principal model for this genre, which he defined as ‚Äúsome part of the science of husbandry, put into a pleasing dress and set off with all the beauties and embellishments of poetry‚Äù. The Works of the Right Honourable Joseph Addison, London 1854, vol.1, p.155 In the context of the 18th century, however, interest in the georgic, or the choice of it as a model for independent works, was ‚Äúprofoundly political‚Äù, recognising an affinity with Virgil's treatment of rural subjects after the social and political disruptions through which he had lived. The tone of Virgil's work represented a longing for the ‚Äúcreation of order out of disorder‚Äù to which the Roman Augustan age succeeded, much as the British Augustan Age emerged from the social ferment and civil strife of the 17th century.Michael Morris, ‚ÄúArchipelagic Poetics‚Äù, ch.2 in Scotland and the Caribbean, C.1740-1833: Atlantic Archipelagos, Routledge 2015, p.71 The cultured of a later age were quick to see the parallel, but there was also an altered emphasis. Whereas for Virgil there was an antithesis between town life and country simplicity, in the view of the gentry of the 18th century, city and country were interdependent. Those who created specialised georgics of their own considered the commodities about which they wrote as items of trade that contributed to both local and national prosperity. For Roman citizens, farming was carried out in the service of the capital; for Britons the empire was consolidated as the result of mercantile enterprise and such commodities contributed to the general benefit.John Gilmore, The Poetics of Empire: A Study of James Grainger's The Sugar Cane, The Athlone Press 2000, p.28 A critic has pointed out that \\"the British Library holds no fewer than twenty translations of the Georgics from [the 18th century] period; of these, eight are separately published translations of the Georgics alone. Several of these translations, such as Dryden's, were reprinted regularly throughout the century. Also noteworthy is the fact that the brisk rate of new translations continued into the early decades of the nineteenth century, with 1808 as a kind of annus mirabilis, when three new versions appeared.\\"De Bruyn 2005, p.152 Some among these, like Dryden's and the Earl of Lauderdale's (1709), had primarily poetic aims. Other translators were clergymen amateurs (Thomas Nevile, Cambridge 1767)Wikisource or, translating into prose, had school use in mind (Joseph Davidson, London 1743).Internet Archive William Sotheby went on to place his acclaimed literary version of 1800 in the context of others across Europe when he reissued it in the sumptuous folio edition Georgica Publii Virgilii Maronis Hexaglotta (London, 1827).An extensive review appeared in The Quarterly Review vol.38, pp.358-77 There it was accompanied by versions in Italian by Gian-Francesco Soave (1765),La Buccolica e le Georgiche di P. Virgilio Marone in Spanish by Juan de Guzm√°n (1768),Las Georgicas de Virgilio in French by Jacques Delille (1769),Les G√©orgiques and in German by Johann Heinrich Voss (1789).L√§ndliche Gedichte Dutch influence on English farming also paved a way for the poem's rebirth, since Roman farming practices still prevailed in the Netherlands and were sustained there by Joost van den Vondel‚Äôs prose translation of the Georgics into Dutch (1646).Lantgedichten English farmers too attempted to imitate what they thought were genuine Virgilian agricultural techniques. In 1724 the poet William Benson wrote, \\"There is more of Virgil‚Äôs husbandry in England at this instant than in Italy itself.\\"The quote and the argument in general are taken from L.P. Wilkinson's The Georgics of Virgil (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1969). For argument see pages 299‚Äì309 and for quote see page 307. Among those translators who aimed to establish Virgil's up-to-date farming credentials was James Hamilton, whose prose translation of Virgil's work was ‚Äúpublished with such notes and reflexions as make him appear to have wrote like an excellent Farmer‚Äù (Edinburgh, 1742). This aspiration was supported by the assertion that, to make a proper translation, agricultural experience was a prerequisite‚Äîand for the lack of which, in the view of William Benson, Dryden's version was disqualified.De Bruyn 2005, pp.154-5) That Robert Hoblyn had practical experience as a farmer was a qualification he considered the guarantee of his 1825 blank verse translation of the first book of the Georgics;London 1825, pp.vi-vii and even in modern times it was made a commendation of Peter Fallon's 2004 version that he is ‚Äúboth a poet and a farmer, uniquely suited to translating this poem‚Äù.Oxford University Press However, Hoblyn could only support his stance at this date by interpolation and special pleading.De Bruyn 2005, pp.255-9 Throughout Europe, Virgilian-style farming manuals were giving way to the agricultural revolution and their use was supplanted by scientific data, technical graphs and statistics.Frans De Bruyn, \\"From Georgic Poetry to Statistics and Graphs: Eighteenth-Century Representations and the 'State' of British Society,\\" The Yale Journal of Criticism, 17, 1, Spring 2004, 107‚Äì139. Contemporary readings The overtly political element in Virgil's poem attracted some translators, who applied it to their own local circumstances. The translation of the Georgics into Ancient Greek by Eugenios Voulgaris was published from St Petersburg in 1786 and had as one aim the support of Russia‚Äôs assimilation of the newly annexed Crimea by encouraging Greek settlement there. Virgil‚Äôs theme of taming the wilderness was further underlined in an introductory poem praising Grigory Potemkin as a philhellene Maecenas and the Empress Catherine the Great as the wise ruler directing the new territory's welfare. The inference is also there that Voulgaris himself (now archbishop of Novorossiya and Azov) has become thus the imperial Virgil.Sophia Papaioannou, \\"Eugenios Voulgaris' translation of the Georgics\\", Vergilius Vol. 54 (2008), pp. 97-123 In Britain there was a tendency to grant Virgil honorary citizenship. In the introduction to his turn of the century translation for the Everyman edition, T. F. Royds argued that \\"just as the Latin poet had his pedigree, Virgil is here an adopted English poet, and his many translators have made for him an English pedigree too\\".Eclogues and Georgics, J. M. Dent & Sons, London 1907, p. xiv So too, living in Devon as World War II progressed, C. Day Lewis saw his own translation as making a patriotic statement. As he commented later: \\"More and more I was buoyed up by a feeling that England was speaking to me through Virgil, and that the Virgil of the Georgics was speaking to me through the English farmers and labourers with whom I consorted.\\"Albert Gelpi, Living in Time: The Poetry of C. Day Lewis, OUP 1998, pp.82 ‚Äì 90 Among a multiplicity of earlier translations, his new version would be justified by avoiding \\"that peculiar kind of Latin- derived pidgin-English which infects the style of so many classical scholars\\" and making its appeal instead through an approachable, down-to-earth idiom.C. Day Lewis, The Georgics of Virgil, Jonathan Cape 1940, pp.7-8 In the 21st century, Fr√©d√©ric Boyer's French version of the Georgics is retitled Le Souci de la terre (Care for the earth) and makes its appeal to current ecological concerns. \\"For me as a translator\\", he explains in his preface, \\"I find today‚Äôs tragic paradigm in relation to the earth being addressed to the future through the ancient work. In other words, the past is entering into dialogue with the future right now.\\" And in part, as in Virgil's time, this ecological crisis has come as a result of a loss of focus, preoccupation in the past with foreign wars and civil conflict.Virgile (trad.

What has been described as \\"the earliest English georgic on any subject\\"Marie Loretto Lilly, The Georgic: A Contribution to the Study of the Vergilian Type of Didactic Poetry, Johns Hopkins Press, 1919, p.77 limited itself to practical advice on gardening. Attributed to an unidentified Master John, \\"The Feate of Gardeninge\\" dates from the first half of the 15th century and provides instructions for sowing, planting and growing fruits, herbs and flowers through the course of the year. The poem‚Äôs 98 couplets are of irregular line-length and are occasionally imperfectly rhymed; the work was never printed, although annotated manuscript copies give evidence of its being studied and put to use.Hon. Alicia M. Tyssen Amherst, \\"A Fifteenth Century Treatise on Gardening\\" Master John's poem heads the line of later gardening manuals in verse over the centuries. Included among them were poems in Latin like Giuseppe Milio's De Hortorum Cura (Brescia 1574) and Ren√© Rapin's popular Hortorum Libri IV (Of Gdns, 1665). The latter was a four-canto work in Latin hexameters, dealing respectively with flowers, disposition of trees, water and orchards, and was followed by two English versions shortly afterwards, translated by John Evelyn the Younger in 1673 and James Gardiner in 1706.The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, CUP 1971, Volume 2, p.1528 Where those versions were written in rhyming couplets, however, William Mason later chose Miltonic blank verse for his The English Garden: A Poem in Four Books (1772‚Äì81), an original work that took the Georgics as its model.Mason discusses his choice in the preface to his final corrected version of 1783 His French contemporary Jacques Delille, having already translated the Latin Georgics, now published his own four-canto poem on the subject of Les Jardins, ou l'Art d‚Äôembellir les paysages (Gardens, or the art of beautifying landscape, 1782). Like Mason, he gave his preference for landscaped over formal garden design and his work was several times translated into English verse over the following two decades.Pater Hayden, Garden History 18.2 (1990), pp.195-7 Rural pursuits In the case of many of these didactic manuals, the approach of the Georgics served as a model but the information in them is updated or supplements Virgil‚Äôs account. Thus Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai's Le Api (Bees, 1542) restricts itself to the subject of the fourth book of the Georgics and is an early example of Italian blank verse. A Latin treatment of the subject figured as the fourteenth book of the original Paris edition of :fr:Jacques Vani√®re's Praedium Rusticum (The Rural Estate) in 1696,Yasmin Haskell, 2003, p.42) but was to have a separate English existence in a verse translation by Arthur Murphy published from London in 1799,Google Books and later reprinted in the United States in 1808.Library List, National Agricultural Library (U.S.), p.82 But an earlier partial adaptation, Joshua Dinsdale's The Modern Art of Breeding Bees, had already appeared in London in 1740, prefaced with an apology to Virgil for trespassing on his ancient territory while bringing \\"some new Discov'ries to impart\\".Google Books For his part, Marco Girolamo Vida struck out in a new entomological direction with his poem on the breeding and care of the silkworm, the two-canto De Bombycum cura ac usu (1527) written in Latin hexameters, which had been preceded by two poems in Italian on the same subject.L. P. Wilkinson, Virgil in the Renaissance, CUP 2010, p.85 Vida's work was followed in England by Thomas Muffet's The Silkwormes and their Flies (1599), a subject that he had studied in Italy. The poem was written in Ottava rima, contained a wealth of Classical stories and has been mentioned as \\"one of the earliest of English georgic poems\\".L. P. Wilkinson, The Georgics of Virgil: A Critical Survey, CUP 1969, p.292Text online Vida's poem was just one among several contemporary Latin works on exotic subjects that have been defined by Yasmin Haskell as 'recreational georgics', a group which \\"usually comprises one or two short books, treats self-consciously small-scale subjects, is informed by an almost pastoral mood\\" and deals with products for the aristocratic luxury market.Yasmin Haskell, \\"Latin Georgic Poetry of the Italian Renaissance\\", Humanistica Lovaniensia XLVIII (1999), p.140 Others included Giovanni Pontano's De Hortis Hesdperidum sive de cultu citriorum on the cultivation of citrus fruits (Venice 1505)Claudia Schindler, \\"Persian Apples, Chinese Leaves, Arab Beans: encounters with the East in Neo-Latin didactic poetry\\", in Early Encounters between East Asia and Europe, Taylor & Francis, 2017, pp.125-9 and Pier Franceso Giustolo's De Croci Cultu Cultu on the cultivation of saffron (Rome 1510). There were also works on hunting like Natale Conti's De venatione (1551) and the Cynegeticon (Hunting with dogs) of Pietro degli Angeli (1517‚Äì96) which were the ultimate Italian ancestors of William Somervile's The Chace (London, 1735). The preface to the last of these notes with disapproval that one \\"might indeed have expected to have seen it treated more at large by Virgil in his third Georgick, since it is expressly Part of his Subject. But he has favoured us only with ten Verses.\\"Google Books The most encyclopaedic of the authors on country subjects was Jacques Vani√®re whose Praedium Rusticum reached its completest version in 1730. Integrated into its sixteen sections were several once issued as separate works. They included Stagna (Fishing, 1683), ultimately section 15, in which the author informs the reader (in the words of his English translator): > Of fish I sing, and to the rural cares Now add the labours of my younger > years‚Ä¶ Now more improved since first they gave me fame; From hence to tend > the doves and vine I taught, And whate‚Äôer else my riper years have > wrought.Fishing, a translation from the Latin of Vanier, Book XV. Upon Fish, > London 1809, p.5 That was followed by Columbae (Doves, 1684), mentioned in the lines above and ultimately section 13; by Vites (Vines, 1689), section 10; and by Olus (Vegetables, 1698), section 9. Two English clergymen poets later wrote poems more or less reliant on one or other of these sections. Joshua Dinsdale's The Dove Cote, or the art of breeding pigeons appeared in 1740;Google Books and John Duncombe‚Äôs Fishing (quoted above), which was an adaptation written in the 1750s but unpublished until 1809. English Georgics John Dyer's specialised georgic Besides the 18th century examples already mentioned, English poets wrote other Virgilian styled georgics and country themed pieces manifesting an appreciation of the rustic arts and the happiness of life on the country estate. Among them were poems directed to such specialised subjects as John Philips's Cyder (1708)Google Books and John Gay's Rural Sports: A Georgic (1713).Poems on Several Occasions, London 1745, pp. 3-24 Gay then went on to compose in Trivia, or the art of walking the streets of London (1716) \\"a full-scale mock Georgic\\".Marcus Walsh's introduction to John Gay: selected poems, Carcanet 1979 The poem is dependent on the method and episodes in Virgil's poem and may be compared with the contemporary renewal of classical genres in the mock epic and the introduction of urban themes into the eclogue by other Augustan poets at that periodJohn Gay, Poems on Several Occasions, London 1745, pp.133-195 Later examples of didactic georgics include Christopher Smart's The Hop-Garden (1752)University of Michigan Robert Dodsley‚Äôs Agriculture (1753) and John Dyer‚Äôs The Fleece (1757).Google Books Shortly afterwards, James Grainger went on to create in his The Sugar Cane (1764) a \\"West-India georgic\\",Google Books spreading the scope of this form into the Caribbean with the British colonial enterprise. Unlike most translations of Virgil at the time, many of these practical manuals preferred Miltonic blank verse and the later examples stretched to four cantos, as in the Virgilian model. Later still there were poems with a broader scope, such as James Grahame's The British Georgics (Edinburgh, 1806)]. His work was on a different plan, however, proceeding month by month through the agricultural year and concentrating on conditions in Scotland, considering that \\"the British Isles differ in so many respects from the countries to which Virgil‚Äôs Georgics alluded\\".Google Books Jacques Delille had already preceded him in France with a similar work, L'Homme des champs, ou les G√©orgiques fran√ßaises (Strasbourg, 1800), a translation of which by John Maunde had been published in London the following year as The Rural Philosopher: or French Georgics, a didactic poem, and in the USA in 1804.Internet Archive Both works, however, though they bear the name of georgics, have more of a celebratory than a didactic function. They are a different sort of work that, while paying homage and alluding to Virgil's poem, have another end in view. This descriptive genre of writing had an equally Renaissance pedigree in Politian's poem Rusticus (1483), which he composed to be recited as an introduction to his lectures on the didactic poems of Hesiod and the Georgica. Its intention was to praise country living in the course of describing its seasonal occupations.William Parr Greswell, Memoirs of Angelus Politianus etc (1805), pp.37-43 A similar approach to the beauties of the countryside in all weathers was taken by James Thompson in the four sections of his The Seasons (1730). The poem has been described as \\"the supreme British achievement in the georgic genre, even though it has little to do with agriculture per se,\\" and is more descriptive than didactic.Bruce Graver, \\"Pastoral and Georgic\\", in The Encyclopedia of Romantic Literature, Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, p.987 Nevertheless, the Classical inspiration behind the work was so obvious that Thompson was pictured as writing it with \\"the page of Vergil literally open before him\\".Quoted in M. L. Lilly, The Georgic: A contribution to the study of the Vergilian type of didactic poetry (Baltimore, 1919), p.174 Other works in this vein moved further from the Virgilian didactic mode. William Cowper‚Äôs discursive and subjective The Task (1785) has sometimes been included,Ted Underwood, \\"Cowper‚Äôs Spontaneous Task\\", in The Work of the Sun, Palgrave Macmillan 2005 as has Robert Bloomfield‚Äôs The Farmer‚Äôs Boy (1800).The Farmer‚Äôs Boy: a rural poem at Gutenberg] The latter proceeds through the farming year season by season and a partial translation into Latin was described by William Clubbe as being rendered 'in the manner of the Georgics' (in morem Latini Georgice redditum).\\"William Clubbe\\", The Dictionary of National Biography, Wikisource It was followed in the 20th century by Vita Sackville-West's The Land (1926), Gutenberg which also pursued the course of the seasons through its four books and balanced rural know-how with celebratory description in the mode of Georgian Poetry.

Since independence voter turnout has been generally high in national elections, with a low of 87.9% in 1987 and a high of 98.5% in 1997. The current Prime Minister is the Hon Hubert Minnis. Electoral system The country's electoral law was passed on 31 December 1979 and was last amended in 1992. Elections are run by the Parliamentary Registration Department, headed by a Parliamentary Commissioner. Appointed by the Governor-General, the Commissioner is responsible for voter registration. There is also an Electoral Broadcasting Council, which is responsible for ensuring that media reports are fair and not biased towards any party.Nohlen, D.

Referendums There have been two national referendums and one opinion poll held within the last twenty years. The first, held in 2002, it asked voters five questions ranging from changes to the constitution to the setting up of a national commission on teaching. The first opinion poll, held in January 2013, asked individuals whether they wanted to legalize online gambling. The second national referendum took place on June 7, 2016, and asked voters four questions pertaining to equal rights within the Bahamas. All three (3) referendum's/opinion polls were rejected. History Prior to the introduction of universal suffrage in 1961, elections in the Bahamas were dominated by the white oligarchy known as the Bay Street Boys.Nohlen, p. 73. They were represented by the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which by gerrymandering the constituency boundaries, won the 1962 elections despite receiving fewer votes than the black Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). In the next elections in 1967 the UBP received more votes than the PLP, but they won the same number of seats. With the support of the sole Labour Party MP the PLP was able to form the country's first black-led government. The PLP dominated national politics until the 1990s, winning every election until 1992 when they were defeated by the Free National Movement (FNM) formed after a split within the PLP in 1971. The FNM won the next elections in 1997 in which voter turnout hit a record 98.5%,Nohlen, p. 78. but power was ceded back to the PLP in 2002.Nohlen, p. 82. The FNM returned to power again in 2007.

A hydrocele testis is the accumulation of fluids around a testicle. It is often caused by peritoneum wrapped around the testicle, called the tunica vaginalis. Provided there is no hernia present, hydroceles below the age of 1 year usually resolve spontaneously. Primary hydroceles may develop in adulthood, particularly in the elderly and in hot countries, by slow accumulation of serous fluid. This is presumably caused by impaired reabsorption, which appears to be the explanation for most primary hydroceles, although the reason remains obscure. A hydrocele can also be the result of a plugged inguinal lymphatic system caused by repeated, chronic infection of Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi, two mosquito-borne parasites of Africa and Southeast Asia, respectively. As such, the condition would be a part of more diffuse sequelae commonly referred to as elephantiasis, which also affects the lymphatic system in other parts of the body. Presentation=Complications * Rupture usually occurs as a result of trauma but may be spontaneous. On rare occasions cure results after the fluid has been absorbed. * Transformation into a haematocele occurs if there is spontaneous bleeding into the sac or as a result of trauma. Acute haemorrhage into the tunica vaginalis sometimes results from testicular trauma and it may be difficult without exploration to decide whether the testis has been ruptured. If the haematocele is not drained, a clotted haematocele usually results. * The sac may calcify. Clotted hydrocele may result from a slow spontaneous ooze of blood into the tunica vaginalis. It is usually painless and by the time the patient seeks help, it may be difficult to be sure that the swelling is not due to a testicular tumour. Indeed, a tumour may present as a haematocele. * Occasionally, severe infection can be introduced by aspiration. Simple aspiration, however, often may be used as a temporary measure in those cases where surgery is contraindicated or must be postponed. * Postherniorrhaphy hydrocele is a relatively rare complication of inguinal hernia repair. It is possibly due to interruption to the lymphatics draining the scrotal contents. * Infection which may lead to pyocele. * Atrophy of testis in long standing cases. Complications are often diagnosed post-operatively, which can be differentiated through duplex ultrasound scanning and are bit observed until 24 to 48 hours for early complications such as drainage, infection, formation of haematocele, rupture, etc., but also for 1 to 6 weeks during follow-up on out-patient basis. Cause A hydrocele can be produced in four ways: * by excessive production of fluid within the sac, e.g. secondary hydrocele * through defective absorption of fluid * by interference with lymphatic drainage of scrotal structures as in case of elephantiasis * by connection with a hernia of the peritoneal cavity in the congenital variety, which presents as hydrocele of the cord  Primary hydroceles  The swelling is soft and non-tender, large in size on examination, and the testis cannot usually be felt. The presence of fluid is demonstrated by transillumination. These hydroceles can reach a huge size, containing large amount of fluid, as these are painless and are often ignored. They are otherwise asymptomatic, other than size and weight, causing inconvenience. However the long continued presence of large hydroceles causes atrophy of testis due to compression or by obstructing blood supply. In most cases, the hydrocele, when diagnosed early during complete physical examination, are small and the testis can easily be palpated within a lax hydrocele. However Ultrasound imaging is necessary to visualize the testis if the hydrocele sac is dense to reveal the primary abnormality. But these can become large in cases when left unattended. Hydroceles are usually painless, as are testicular tumors. A common method of diagnosing a hydrocele is by attempting to shine a strong light (transillumination) through the enlarged scrotum. A hydrocele will usually pass light, while a tumor will not (except in the case of a malignancy with reactive hydrocele).  Secondary hydroceles  Secondary hydroceles due to testicular diseases can be the result of cancer, trauma (such as a hernia), or orchitis (inflammation of testis), and can also occur in infants undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A hydrocele is not a cancer but it should be excluded clinically if a presence of a testicular tumor is suspected, however, there are no publications in the world literature that report a hydrocele in association with testicular cancer. Secondary hydrocele is most frequently associated with acute or chronic epididymo-orchitis. It is also seen with torsion of the testis and with some testicular tumors. A secondary hydrocele is usually lax and of moderate size: the underlying testis is palpable. A secondary hydrocele subsides when the primary lesion resolves. * Acute/chronic epididymo-orchitis * Torsion of testis * Testicular tumor * Hematocele * Filarial hydrocele * Post herniorrhaphy * Hydrocele of an hernial sacBailey & Love's/24th/1407-1409  Infantile hydroceles  It does not occur only in infants but it occurs in adults also, a hydrocele is usually an expression of a patent processus vaginalis (PPV). The tunica and the processus vaginalis are distended to the inguinal ring but there is no connection with the peritoneal cavity.  Congenital hydroceles  Communicating hydrocele, caused by the failure of the processus vaginalis closure. The processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the general peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Digital pressure on the hydrocele does not usually empty it, but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down. Ascites or even ascitic tuberculous peritonitis should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.  Encysted hydrocele of the cord  There is a smooth oval swelling near the spermatic cord which is liable to be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. The swelling moves downwards and becomes less mobile if the testis is pulled gently downwards. Rarely, a hydrocele develops in a remnant of the processus vaginalis somewhere along the course of the spermatic cord. This hydrocele also transilluminates, and is known as an encysted hydrocele of the cord. In females, a related region in females, a multicystic hydrocele of the canal of Nuck sometimes presents as a swelling in the groin. It probably results from cystic degeneration of the round ligament. Unlike a hydrocele of the cord, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is always at least partially within the inguinal canal. The accuracy of the diagnosis must be ascertained. Great care must be taken to differentiate a hydrocele from a scrotal hernia or tumor of the testicle. Ultrasound imaging can be very useful in these cases. A hernia usually can be reduced, transmits a cough impulse, and is not translucent. A hydrocele cannot be reduced into the inguinal canal and gives no impulse on coughing unless a hernia is also present. In young children a hydrocele is often associated with a complete congenital type of hernial sac.  Diagnosis  A primary hydrocele is described as having the following characteristics: *Transillumination positive *Fluctuation positive *Impulse on coughing negative (positive in congenital hydrocele) *Reducibility absent *Testis cannot be palpated separately. (exception - funicular hydrocele, encysted hydrocele) Treatment Most hydroceles appearing in the first year of life seldom require treatment as they resolve without treatment. Hydroceles that persist after the first year or occur later in life require treatment only in selected cases, such as patients who are symptomatic with pain or a pressure sensation, or when the scrotal skin integrity is compromised from chronic irritation; the treatment of choice is surgery and the operation is conducted via an open access technique aiming to excise the hydrocele sac.Zollinger's Atlas of Surgeries Anesthesia is required for the operation and general anesthesia is of choice in children, while spinal anesthesia is usually sufficient in adults. Local infiltration anesthesia is not satisfactory because it cannot abolish abdominal pain due to traction on the spermatic cord.Manual of Anesthesia for Out Patient Surgical Procedures In long standing cases, hydrocele fluid may be opalescent with cholesterol and may contain crystals of tyrosine.Bailey and Love-Short Practice of Surgery After aspiration of a primary hydrocele, fluid reaccumulates over the following months and periodic aspiration or operation is needed. For younger patients, operation is usually preferred. Sclerotherapy is an alternative; after aspiration, 6% aqueous phenol (10-20 ml) together with 1% lidocaine for analgesia can be injected, and this often inhibits reaccumulation. These alternative treatments are generally regarded as unsatisfactory treatment because of the high incidence of recurrences and the frequent necessity for repetition of the procedure.

It lasted until the ascension of King Li's son, King Xuan of Zhou. (The Cambridge History of Ancient China gives the starting date as 842 BC.) History King Li of Zhou was a corrupt and decadent ruler. To pay for his pleasures and vices, King Li raised taxes and caused misery among his subjects. It is said that he barred the commoners from profiting from communal forests and lakes, and instated a new law which allowed him to punish anyone, by death, who dared to speak against him. King Li's tyrannical rule soon forced many peasants and soldiers all around the China into revolt. Li was sent into exile at a place called Zhi near Linfen (842 BC), his son was taken by one of his ministers and hidden.Sources of Western Zhou History: Inscribed Bronze Vessels by Edward L. Shaughnessy According to the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian (who interpreted Gonghe as 'joint harmony' in his Records of the Grand Historian), during the Gonghe Regency, the Zhou dynasty was ruled jointly by two dukes (coregency)‚Äîthe Duke of Zhou (not to be confused with the first and most well-known Duke of Zhou, who must have been his ancestor) and the Duke of Shao (Âè¨ÂÖ¨‚Äîsimilarly, not to be confused with the first and most well-known Duke of Shao). But according to the Bamboo Annals, the Gonghe regency was ruled by a single person‚Äîthe Count of Gong (ÂÖ±‰ºØ), whose name was He (Âíå). This reading has almost certainly been confirmed by a bronze inscription. The first year of the Gonghe Regency, 841 BC, is highly significant in ancient Chinese history, in that Sima Qian was able to construct a year-by-year chronology back to that point, but he and subsequent historians were unable to confidently date any earlier events in Chinese history. Sima himself found the information about earlier dates in his sources to be unreliable and contradictory and so chose not to adopt them in his work. The government of the People's Republic of China sponsored the Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project, a multidisciplinary project that sought to give better estimates for dates prior to 841 BC, but the project's draft report, published in 2000, has been criticized by various scholars. When Li died in exile in 828 BC, power was passed to his son. When encountering the western term 'republic', the modern Chinese (as well as the Japanese), borrowed the word gonghe to have this meaning. Historically, however, the Gonghe period during the Zhou dynasty does not confer any republican connotations - the people of the time having had no opposition to monarchy as such, but only to one specific king.

The Battle of Cockpit Point, the Battle of Freestone Point, or the Battle of Shipping Point, took place on January 3, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the blockade of the Potomac River during the American Civil War. After victory at First Battle of Bull Run, the Confederate States Army (CSA) established a defensive line from Centreville along the Occoquan River to the Potomac River. The Confederates used the Potomac‚Äôs banks as gun positions to halt Union traffic on the river, protecting Manassas Junction to the west and Fredericksburg to the south and to close the Potomac River to shipping and isolate Washington.Seminole, from the field batteries, Evansport, Shipping Point, Potomac River, 15 October In October 1861, the Confederates constructed batteries at Evansport (now downtown Quantico, consisted of two batteries on the river bank, and another inland), a CSA field battery located at the mouth of Chopawamsic Creek where it empties to the Potomac (now the Marine Corps Air Facility), Shipping Point (now Hospital Point on Quantico, number of guns unknown), Freestone Point (a CSA four-gun battery on the shore of the Potomac River, now within Leesylvania State Park), and Cockpit Point (near the current asphalt plant, consisted of six guns (one heavy gun) in four batteries, a powder magazine, and rear rifle pits, on top of a high cliff known as Possum Nose).

Elected in 498 at the Basilica Saint Mariae (presumably Saint Maria Maggiore) with the support of a dissenting faction with Byzantine sympathies, who were supported by Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, in opposition to Pope Symmachus, the division between the two opposing factions split not only the church, but the senate and the people of Rome. However, Laurentius remained in Rome as pope until 506.  Biography  Archpriest of Santa Prassede, Laurentius was elected pope on 22 November 498, in opposition to Pope Symmachus, by a dissenting faction. If Theodore Lector can be trusted, he was picked by the former consul Rufius Postumius Festus as a candidate; Festus had secretly promised the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius that Pope Anastasius II would approve the Henotikon, but upon returning from Constantinople he found the Pope had died.Historia ecclesiastiae 2.16.17, quoted in The groups supporting Laurentius and Symmachus split the clergy, Senate and common people, leading to violent clashes between rival groups of supporters. It was clear that some form of arbitration was needed, and both groups proceeded to Ravenna to present their arguments to king Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths. Jeffrey Richards observes that \\"it is a remarkable state of affairs when an Arian king has, for whatever reason, to choose a Catholic pope.\\" Theodoric reviewed the facts, and found that Symmachus fulfilled his criteria for being duly consecrated pope. The \\"Laurentian Fragment\\", a document written by partisans of Laurentius, asserts that Symmachus obtained the decision by paying bribes,Davies (trans.), Book of Pontiffs, p. 97 while deacon Magnus Felix Ennodius of Milan later wrote that 400 solidi were distributed amongst influential personages, whom it would be indiscreet to name.Richards, Popes and the papacy, pp. 70f Finding himself victorious, Symmachus proceeded to call a synod held at Rome on 1 March 499, which was attended by 72 bishops and all of the Roman clergy, with the aim of confirming that his congregation accepted the king's judgment, as well as ensuring in the future there would be no rioting or illegal canvassing at election time. He also tried to appease his opposition by offering Laurentius the Diocese of Nuceria, in Campania.Richards, Popes and the papacy, pp. 70 According to the account in the Liber Pontificalis, Symmachus bestowed the see on Laurentius \\"guided by sympathy\\", but the \\"Laurentian Fragment\\" states that Laurentius \\"was severely threatened and cajoled, and forcibly despatched\\" to Nuceria.The Book of Pontiffs (Liber Pontificalis), translated with introduction by Raymond Davies (Liverpool: University Press, 1989), pp. 44, 97 In either case, the subscription of Aprilis, bishop of Nuceria, to the acta of the synod of 502 suggests Laurentius either never took up the see, or was deposed from it soon after.Richards, Popes and the papacy, p. 327 However, Laurentius' supporters sustained the schism. Led by Festus, a group of clerics and senators laid charges against Symmachus in an attempt to secure his deposition. Theodoric summoned Symmachus to Ariminum to answer these charges, but after arriving, Symmachus fled the city in the middle of the night, returning to Rome, where he took refuge in St. Peter's. His flight proved to be a major mistake, for it was widely seen as an admission of guilt. Many of the clergy withdrew from communion with Symmachus, and entered into communion with Laurentius.Richards, Popes and the papacy, p. 71 A contentious synod held in 502 failed to resolve the schism. Laurentius returned to Rome later that year, and for the following four years, according to the \\"Laurentian Fragment\\", he held its churches and ruled as pope, with the support of Festus.Davies (trans.), Book of Pontiffs, p. 98 Laurentius was only forced from his position when a diplomatic effort to convince Theodoric to intervene succeeded. Conducted chiefly by two non-Roman supporters, the Milanese deacon Ennodius and the exiled deacon Dioscorus, they convinced the king's personal physician, the deacon Helpidius, and then convinced Theodoric to instruct Festus to hand over the Roman churches to Symmachus.Richards, Popes and the papacy, p. 76 Once news of Theodoric's decision reached Rome, Laurentius retired from the city to one of Festus's estates, according to the \\"Laurentian Fragment\\", because \\"he did not want the city to be troubled by daily strife\\", where he fasted constantly until his death.Davies (trans.), Book of Pontiffs, p. 99  See also  * Papal selection before 1059  References External links *Laurentian Schism  Church History Timelines Year of birth unknown 506 deaths 5th-century antipopes 6th- century antipopes 5th-century Italo-Roman people 6th-century Italo-Roman people Ancient Christians involved in controversies Caelii ","title":"Antipope Laurentius"},{"id":"1351168","text":"Western Pennsylvania refers to the western third of the state of Pennsylvania in the United States. Pittsburgh is the region's principal city, with a metropolitan area population of about 2.4 million people, and serves as its economic and cultural center. Erie, Altoona, and Johnstown are its other metropolitan centers. As of the 2010 census, Western Pennsylvania's total population is nearly 4 million.County Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016 - Census Bureau Although the Commonwealth does not designate Western Pennsylvania as an official region, since colonial times it has retained a distinct identity not only because of its geographical distance from Philadelphia, the beginning of Pennsylvania settlement, but especially because of its topographical separation from the east by virtue of the Appalachian Mountains, which characterize much of the western region. In the 18th century, this separateness caused some to rally for the formation of a 14th state in this region named Westsylvania.Cranmer, History of the Upper Ohio, 1:59‚Äì63. The strong cultural identity of Western Pennsylvania is reinforced by the state supreme court holding sessions in Pittsburgh, in addition to Harrisburg and Philadelphia.  Counties  Since at least the early twentieth century, scholarly books such as Guidebook to Historic Western Pennsylvania, published by the University of Pittsburgh Press (1938), formally define the region as the twenty-six counties west of the Appalachian divide, a meridian from the north at McKean County down and along its eastern border and ending in the south at Bedford County. In alphabetical order those counties are: * Allegheny * Armstrong * Beaver * Bedford * Blair * Butler * Cambria * Cameron * Clarion * Clearfield * Crawford * Elk * Erie * Fayette * Forest * Greene * Indiana * Jefferson * Lawrence * McKean * Mercer * Somerset * Venango * Warren * Washington * Westmoreland  Description  Long recognized as a powerhouse of American industry, Western Pennsylvania is a large geophysical and socio- economic entity. It encompasses that portion of the state to the west of the Appalachian divide and included within the Mississippi drainage system of rivers. The largest rivers in this area are the Allegheny River, which flows southward from the New York border, and the Monongahela River, which flows northward from West Virginia. These two rivers meet in Downtown Pittsburgh and join to form the Ohio River, which from that point flows an additional southwest to the Mississippi River. The juncture of the Allegheny and Monongahela was historically regarded as strategic and the gateway to the interior of the continent from the east. At various times this juncture has been called the Forks of the Ohio, Fort Duquesne, Fort Pitt, the Golden Triangle, and today, at its apex, Point State Park. Incredibly, after several decades of border war and 150 years of high-rent city-center urbanization, the original 1764 blockhouse from Fort Pitt still stands here and is one of the oldest buildings in the region. Other notable rivers are the Youghiogheny River, flowing north from West Virginia and western Maryland to join the Monongahela just upriver of Pittsburgh, and which was the early route of penetration into Western Pennsylvania, the Kiskiminetas River, French Creek, a major passageway between Lake Erie and the Allegheny River for the Indians and early French explorers and traders, and the small Oil Creek in Crawford and Venango counties, where slicks gave an indication of petroleum reserves and in whose watershed the first oil well in the United States was drilled. The highest point in Pennsylvania, Mount Davis, reaches , and is located near the southern border of the state in Somerset County, approximately east of the southwestern corner, where the Appalachian Mountains enter Pennsylvania from the south. To the west and north of this point lies the Allegheny Plateau, a dissected plateau so eroded that it appears to be an interminable series of high hills and steep valleys. The peaks in the area are among the lowest in the East Coast highlands, but what they lack in height they make up in wide extent of land covered, which forms a vast formidable barrier for mile upon mile to overland travel from the coast.  Education  Western Pennsylvania is home to more than two dozen institutions of higher learning, including those listed below. (Seminaries are not listed) *Allegheny College *The Art Institute of Pittsburgh *Community College of Allegheny County (several campuses) *Community College of Beaver County *Butler County Community College (several campuses) *California University of Pennsylvania *Carlow University *Carnegie Mellon University *Chatham University *Clarion University of Pennsylvania *Duquesne University *Edinboro University of Pennsylvania *Gannon University *Geneva College *Grove City College *Indiana University of Pennsylvania (several branch campuses) *LaRoche College *Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine *Mercyhurst University *Mount Aloysius College *Penn Highlands Community College *Pennsylvania State University (several branch campuses) *Point Park University *Robert Morris University *Saint Francis University *Saint Vincent College *Seton Hill University *Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania *Thiel College *University of Pittsburgh (several campuses) *Vincentian Academy *Washington and Jefferson College *Waynesburg University *Westminster College *Westmoreland County Community College  Distinctiveness  Western Pennsylvania is distinctive from the rest of the state due to several important and complex factors: * The initial difficulty of transportation access from the east involved many miles of seemingly endless parallel ridges of the Appalachian Mountains, and then the broken hills and valleys of the Allegheny Plateau, all of which were covered in thick forests. The initial method of access from areas east of the Appalachians, was to travel southbound outside of Pennsylvania, then follow the Potomac River northwest through Maryland and Virginia, and then re-enter the state in its southwest corner. Various methods of more direct transport were later tried, including a canal system westbound over the mountains and then, later, the Pennsylvania Railroad which extended the railroad systems of the East Coast west to Pittsburgh and the Ohio Valley. Perhaps the best known transportation innovation to simplify access to this area is the famous Pennsylvania Turnpike, the first modern limited access highway in North America. * The initial problem was economic marketing of a limited number of goods that could stand such high freight costs. The insensitivity of the new U.S. Federal Government to the marketing problems in the west led to the Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania, an event which seriously challenged the political viability of the new American nation. Later marketing arrangements turned to access via the Ohio River, with Pittsburgh a barge and steamboat center of the mid-continent. Today, Pittsburgh is still strongly oriented to the rivers; the port of Pittsburgh ranks No. 13 by tonnage in the USA and even surpasses the Port of Philadelphia in tonnage, due to the heavy shipping of bulk coal by barge inland on the rivers.US Corps of Engineers, Waterborne Commerce by Tonnage, 2002 Locally, a system of agriculture arose suitable to Western Pennsylvania's rugged terrain, emphasizing animal husbandry and dairying but with few exportable vegetable crops. The search for some sort of exportable agricultural specialty perhaps also encouraged the rise of the sauce industry and its first location at Sharpsburg in what was later to become the large H.J. Heinz Company. * The search for exploitable resources first resulted with the development of huge bituminous coal or \\"soft\\" coal deposits in the area for use in a growing iron foundry sector. However, it was not until the realization by Andrew Carnegie, that Western Pennsylvania possessed an optimum location for a very large scale American steel sector, that this area, especially Pittsburgh, became known for the industrial specialty that characterizes it today. The region also had large glass, pottery, brickmaking, and ceramic industries, which took advantage of the coal and the sand and clay in local soils. The local glass industry produced 45 percent of the nation's output in glass by the 1860s and more than 80 percent of the output by the 1920s. The rise and subsequent decline of the American steel industry at Pittsburgh introduces a host of complex economic concepts necessary to understand why that particular activity centered in this particular place, including the notions of classical Weberian location analysis for more than one input, the Pittsburgh Plus system for maintaining advantageous freight costs to ship to the market, vertical integration and supply innovations such as the development of the Mesabi Range, the ore freighter as a transport vehicle, and the construction of the Soo Locks. Other necessary economic concepts for description could well include economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, monopoly (or cartel) price equilibrium, and \\"dumping\\". Labor relations problems historically were frequent in the earlier steel sector, and mention should be made of the United Steel Workers of America, as well as the contemporary issue of \\"legacy costs\\" arising from heavy entitlements to a large retired labor force after sharply downsizing to today's level of employment. * Other exploitable resources in Western Pennsylvania were also distinct. One was the drilling of the first oil well in the world at Titusville and the rise of the US petroleum industry. Another was widespread deforestation of the outlying areas and their subsequent reforestation under Gifford Pinchot, who instituted the first large scale government sponsored timber management effort in the USA. During this time of intensive exploitation of forests a whole new sector, the wood chemistry industry, appeared and then later vanished. Finally, mention should also be made of management in the forested areas of a large animal population which supports the famous \\"Pennsylvania deer-hunting\\" cultural ethos. The first day of deer- hunting season is a de facto unofficial holiday in much of the central and northern regions of the state, when absence from work or school is generally tolerated with no explanation necessary. * Since the early 1950s, a renaissance occurred in the development of cultural institutions and abatement of pollution in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area. The effects of this increase in livability are particularly apparent in the Golden Triangle district of Downtown Pittsburgh, which at one point had been plagued with so much industrial haze that drivers used their headlights in mid-day. However, this social improvement has not always been accompanied by a serious plan of regional economic development to assess what, precisely, should fill the income void after the departure of steel. In addition, the city of Pittsburgh continues to become de-populated and has recently been put under state supervision of its finances. * Culturally, the distinctiveness of Western Pennsylvania is underlined by the existence of a unique local dialect called \\"Pittsburghese\\" or Pittsburgh English, sometimes affectionately termed the \\"yinzer\\" dialect, due to its use of the term \\"yins\\" (also spelled \\"yunz, \\"yinz\\", \\"youns\\", etc.) as the plural form of \\"you\\". This is probably a legacy of Ulster-Scots settlement in the area. Western Pennsylvanians also refer to soft drinks as \\"pop\\" while in the eastern half of the state it is referred to as \\"soda.\\"Generic Names for Soft Drinks, by county * The Erie Triangle and the city of Erie give Pennsylvania a port along the Great Lakes. This region in unique within western Pennsylvania in that it maintains stronger geographic and cultural connections with western New York than it does with western Pennsylvania, due in large part to its identification with the eastern Great Lakes region, rather than Appalachia. This is reflected in the city and county of Erie sharing far more similarities with Buffalo and southwestern New York than it does with Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania. The Erie region is also known for its distinct agriculture, centered on grapes and other fruit, due to the moderating climatic influence, in both summer and fall, of Lake Erie. (In winter, the area is often inundated with \\"lake-effect\\" snow.) There are also small commercial fresh-water fisheries and many streams and smaller lakes with a variety of fish to catch, including yellow perch and walleye. * In Stonycreek Township is the memorial and crash site of United Airlines Flight 93, the \\"Let's Roll\\" flight which occurred on 9/11 in 2001 after passengers attempted to overpower the plane's hijackers. The site is an informal patriotic shrine with many hand-made mementos voluntarily gracing the area. There is a movement to add the site to the National Park System. It is a startling coincidence that the Stoneycreek site is comparatively close to the other centuries-earlier locations of military engagements in Western Pennsylvania, such as Fort Duquesne and the area of the Whiskey Rebellion. This can in part be explained by the fact that all these locations were on a strategic route from eastern settlements in Pennsylvania and Virginia (and, later, Washington, D.C.) to the West. Sports Pittsburgh boasts three major league sports teams: the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball, and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Panthers is an NCAA Division I college team. Erie and Johnstown both have junior ice hockey teams as well. The Erie Otters play in the Ontario Hockey League and the Johnstown Tomahawks play in the North American Hockey League.

According to Sayyid Qutb's exegesis, the first verses of this surah as well as those of Surah 73 represent Muhammad‚Äôs earliest revelations and those which prepare him for the ordeal of revelation. Structure Surat al-Muddaththir is structured thematically and chronologically. Containing 56 total verses, this surah was most likely revealed on at least two occasions and compiled retroactively. Verses 1-30 and 32-56 are composed of short, poetic lines which maintain rhyme structure and the Arabic rhetorical device of parallel construction. This is consistent with the verses of the early Meccan period. Verse 31 is unique in its prose-like syntax and length; it is easily the longest verse of this surah and is a glaring break with the rhyme structure that precedes and follows it. This type of verse is most common in the later Medinan revelations. Major themes There are several distinct thematic sections of this surah. The first is an injunction for self-preparedness. If verse 1 refers to the Prophet Muhammed (al-Muddaththir, or cloaked one): You, wrapped in your cloak, then the second verse serves to alert the Prophet to a changing environment from which he is charged with saving mankind: Arise, and give warning (74:2). Verses 3-7 are injunctions, then, for the Prophet (or whoever follows the righteous path of God) to maintain cleanliness, monotheism, humility, and patience in his own life. These are all preparations for the revelation of the rest of the message. The next thematic section of Surat al-Muddaththir is a warning for the unbelievers. Verses 8-30 describe the rejection of God's word and the excruciating consequences that result. For he that has not been grateful for the bounty of God's blessing and demands more, disregarding the signs and revelations of God, will be cast into the Saqar, which here refers to the scorching fire of Hell. This image of an unbeliever emphasizes the individuality of the responsibility of obeying God's message: the onus falls upon the individual man to save himself from Hell. Verse 30 refers to nineteen angels who guard the pit of hell; this curious detail is expounded upon in the following verse, which is believed to be a Medinan addition. Some scholars, such as Sayyid Qutb, have stated that verse 31 serves as an explanation of verse 30 that was added after early Muslims and unbelievers alike questioned the specificity of the nineteen angels: \\"We have appointed none other than angels to guard the fire, and We have made their number a test for the unbelievers. Thus those who have been granted revelations in the past may be convinced and the believers may grow more firm in their faith; and so those who have been granted revelations and the believers will entertain no doubt; but the sick at heart and the unbelievers will ask, \\"What could God mean by this image?\\" Thus God lets go astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills. No one knows your Lord's forces except Him. This is all but a reminder for mankind.\\" (74:31) Thus verse 31 explains the mystery of the nineteen angels by portraying the number as a marker of faith. True believers will not question it, as it is the word of God, and those who God has \\"led astray\\" will be troubled by doubts. The next section of Surat al-Muddaththir uses the tangible, accessible physical world as proof that the devastation which awaits the unbelievers will be equally real (74:32-36). It then transitions back to the theme of individual responsibility. Verses 37-47 describe the trial of the soul in Saqar, and the decisions of the individuals who found themselves there. There will be no intercession for them; once they rejected God's word, their eternal souls were doomed (74:48). Finally, the surah returns to the realm of the living to give its final injunction. Verses 49-56 emphasize the vital need for mankind to fear and glorify God. Having given the believers an image of what happens to those who do not heed the message, the surah ends with a reminder that ultimately, God controls the destiny of all mankind and that nobody will remember what God does not let him. This ultimate authority of God is the final image of Surat al-Muddaththir. The ·∏•umur and qaswarah Verses 50 and 51 refer to a scene of ·∏•umur (, 'asses' or 'donkeys') fleeing from a qaswarah (, 'lion', 'beast of prey' or 'hunter'). The wild ass that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula was of the Syrian subspecies. The lion that inhabited this region, at least the sandy deserts north of the southern region, would have been the Arabian population of the Asiatic lion. A reference to the lion in the region of Pilgrimage is in a hadith.Muwatta‚Äô Imam Malik, Book 20 (Hajj), Hadith 794 See also * Animals in Islam References External links  * The Holy Qur'an, translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali Quran 74 Sahih International translation Muddathir ","title":"Al-Muddaththir"},{"id":"1351174","text":"Theodore was a rival with Paschal for the papacy following the death of Pope Conon (21 September 687), and thus is considered an antipope of the Roman Catholic church.

Revelation  According to most scholars of the Islamic tradition, the chapter is a Medinan surah, i.e. it was revealed during the Medinan phase of Muhammad's prophethood. Some commentators say that verse 24 was an exception and was revealed in Mecca, and others say that verses 23‚Äì31 were revealed in Mecca. Yet others, a minority, say that the entire chapter was revealed in Mecca, thus classifying it as a Meccan surah. Most Shia sources and some Sunni ones linked the revelation of the verses 5‚Äì22‚Äîwhich discuss \\"the pious\\" (al-abrar) and the rewards that await them‚Äîto an experience of the family of Ali (Muhammad's son-in-law) and his wife Fatimah. According to this account, the family fasted for three days to fulfill a vow they had made. In each evening, when the family was about to break their fast, a needy person knocked on their door asking for food. The family gave food to each of them. The family had so little food that this charity meant that they had no food left and had only water for the evening. On the fourth day, Muhammad met with the family and saw them in dire hunger. According to the account, at this point Gabriel revealed the verses and congratulated Muhammad for having such a family. This account appears in several Quranic exegesis (tafsir), including Al-Qurtubi's Tafsir, Shaykh Tabarsi's Majma' al-Bayan and Mahmud al-Alusi's Ruh al-Ma'ani.

It has a population of about 41,564. History The historical city centre is on a hill between the Chienti and Potenza rivers. It first consisted of the Picenes city named Ricina (Helvia Recina), then, after its romanization, Recina and Helvia Recina. After the destruction of Helvia Recina by the barbarians, the inhabitants took shelter in the hills and eventually began to rebuild the city, first on the top of the hills, before descending again later and expanding. The newly rebuilt town was Macerata. It became a municipality (or comune in Italian) in August 1138. 20th century The comune of Urbisaglia was the location of an internment camp for Jews and refugees, and a prisoner- of-war camp (PG53, at Sforzacosta) during World War II. 21st century migration and hate crime According to Jason Horowitz of The New York Times previously Macerata was welcoming to migrants coming from Africa; in 2013 Macerata, according to Horowitz, \\"won national recognition for its integration efforts\\". Horowitz stated that by 2018 Macerata residents had a more negative view of migrants. In February 2018, an Italian woman, Pamela Mastropietro, was found dead in a suitcase in Macerata, with her body in pieces; a Nigerian was arrested and accused of causing the death. This caused an increase in anti- migrant sentiment; later that month an Italian far-right extremist, Luca Traini, shot six black people in Macerata and wrapped himself in the Italian flag. Geography=Subdivisions The town counts several hamlets (frazioni) and localities: Acquesalate, Acquevive, Botonto San Giacomo, Botonto Sant'Isidoro, Cervare, Cimarella, Cincinelli, Consalvi, Corneto, Helvia Recina, Isola, Madonna del Monte, Montanello, Piediripa, Sforzacosta, Valle, Vallebona, Valteia, Villa Potenza.  Climate  Typically hilly, the climate is both Mediterranean and continental. The Adriatic Sea, which is approximately away, and particularly the Apennine Mountains influence the weather. The elevation of Macerata is approximately above sea level, so winter is particularly rainy and the snow is not so frequent and plentiful. Balkanic and northwestern perturbations may cause snow. Middle seasons are variable, and late snowfall and frost may occur during April. October is neither warm nor very cold. Summer is rather sunny, and sometimes the thermometer reaches . Garbino is the cause, a hot wind from the hinterland. Summer thunderstorms are frequent in August during the evening, when the weather becomes quite unstable.  Government  Main sights  The great hall of the University of Macerata. Madonna with Child by Carlo Crivelli (1470), Pinacoteca di Macerata In the central Piazza della Libert√† is the Loggia dei Mercanti with two-tier arcades dating from the Renaissance. There are a number of striking palazzi, mostly along Corso Matteotti, including Palazzo dei Diamanti. Next to the Loggia dei Mercanti, Corso della Repubblica leads to Piazza Vittorio Veneto where, in the Palazzo Ricci, houses the city's modern art gallery. The nearby Palazzo Buonaccorsi houses the main civic art museum, as well as a Carriage Museum. The palace was built in 1700‚Äì1720 for Count Raimondo Buonaccorsi and his son Cardinal Simone Buonaccorsi using designs by Giovanni Battista Contini. The piano nobile is known for the Sala dell'Eneide (Hall of the Aeneid), decorated with frescoes depicting episodes of the Aeneid depicted by Rambaldi, Dardani, Solimena, and canvases by Garzi and Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. Among the museum's masterpieces is the Renaissance work of the Madonna and Child by Carlo Crivelli. The Biblioteca Comunale Mozzi Borgetti, the main civic library of Macerata, founded in the 18th century, is housed in the former Jesuit seminary, located on Piazza Vittorio Veneto. The University of Macerata was founded in 1290 and has about 13,000 students; Macerata also has an art school, two publishing houses (Liberilibri and Quodlibet), jazz clubs and the like. Just north of the town, at the Villa Potenza, lie the remains of ancient Helvia Recina, a Roman settlement destroyed by the Visigoths. Among the churches in the town are: *Macerata Cathedral: built in Neoclassical style in 1771‚Äì1790; it has the remains of a 15th-century Gothic bell tower. The interior was designed by Cosimo Morelli. *San Claudio al Chienti: Romanesque church south of the Town. Its unusual shape is due to one church being built on the remains of another. It was built during the 14th century as war reparation to Montolmo (today's Corridonia), which defeated Macerata in a bloody and long war. San Claudio al Chienti is very close to Macerata, but it has been a frazione of Corridonia since that time. *San Filippo Neri *San Giorgio *Santa Maria della Misericordia *The Roman settlement of Helvia RecinaSanto Stefano  Macerata Opera Festival  Macerata principal tower. Sferisterio open-air theatre. In July and August the Sferisterio Opera Festival is held in the 2,500 seat Arena Sferisterio. It is a huge neoclassical arena erected in the 1820s as a stadium for a form of handball by the architect Ireneo Aleandri. The orchestra pit is so wide that musicians at each end cannot hear each other. The first opera performed here was Giuseppe Verdi's Aida in 1921. It was promoted by the association \\"Societ√† Cittadina\\" led by Count Pieralberto Conti. The arena was transformed into a real outdoor theatre with an enormous parabolic stage. The orchestra was placed immediately behind it and the seats were located around it. In the middle of the front sidewall a large door was built that allowed the entrance of the Egyptian conqueror. Posters were created by Verona's official Aida employee Plino Codognato and the painter Emilio Lazzari. The opera and its Triumphal March employed many people (in addition to about one thousand props and also different animals such as horses and camels). Francisca Solari interpreted Aida and Alessandro Dolci sang the great tenor role in the robes of Radames. The hospitality of Macerata grew quickly and new ways were developed to induce people to stay longer in the town, so the opera was repeated 17 times with more than seventy thousand attendees. The next year the opera La Gioconda was sung. Until 1927 no more shows were performed, at which time the famous tenor Beniamino Gigli sang a unique concert for the invalids of World War I. From World War II until the 1960s, it was rare to have operas in the local \\"Bel Canto\\". In 1967, Carlo Perucci, a native of San Benedetto del Tronto (Marche), established the first stable local band with the song Circuito lirico delle Marche, so when he was in Macerata he asked the city hall to offer new performances. With enthusiasm the local administrators allowed him to offer new extraordinary contracts: Giuseppe Verdi's Otello (with Del Monaco and Protti), and Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly (with Antonietta Stella and Nicola Ruggeri). Finally, on 3 August, the musical season began, and continues to today. Overall the Sferisterio is very relevant, compared sometimes to Italy's famous Arena di Verona and Caracalla operas. During this period, about 28 years, when Carlo Perucci was artistic director, the \\"Sferisterio\\" Arena, because of its perfect acoustics, housed the most important international voices of bel canto. Ballets with Fracci and Nureyev were performed. The presentations of Boh√®me by Ken Russell in 1984 and Enrico Job's Don Giovanni were particularly memorable. Other outstanding shows were La traviata and Lucia di Lammermoor, with stage design by Czech scenographer Josef Svoboda, Hugo De Ana's Turandot and De Fl√≤'s Faust and Tosca. In the late nineties, led by Orazi as artistic director, the most important singers of the world performed in the Macerata Opera, performing in both the Sferisterio and the Lauro Rossi theaters: Luciano Pavarotti, Pl√°cido Domingo, Montserrat Caball√©, Marilyn Horne, Fiorenza Cossotto, Ruggero Raimondi, Mariella Devia, Jos√© Carreras, Katia Ricciarelli, Renato Bruson, and Raina Kabaivanska. Since 1990, some operas have been performed in the 550-seat Teatro Lauro Rossi following extensive renovation, which was completed in 1989. Originally named the Teatro dei Condomini and built by Cosimo Morelli on a project by Antonio Bibiena in 1767, it opened in 1774 with Pasquale Anfossi's Olimpiade. In 1872, it was renamed after the musician Lauro Rossi who was born in the town. This positive situation made the Sferisterio Opera a success. By 1992 the organization had won the \\"Franco Abbiati award of Italian musical Critics\\" three times. Other prestigious Italian lyric events reproduce the Sferisterio's events: Opera di Roma, Teatro Comunale di Bologna and La Scala di Milano. 2006 was the year of transformation led by the new artistic director Pier Luigi Pizzi. The summer event became a \\"Festival\\". He gave all of his 50 years of experience. Pizzi's career as the opera's director, designer, and dresser earned many awards. The season started with a dominant theme that marks all the shows and their sets. The parabolic stage was recovered, reviving the old atmosphere of the Handball Stadium. In that year, Mozart's 250th anniversary, the theme of \\"initiatory journey\\" opened with the Magic Flute by the Austrian musician. From that moment in every season the choice of operas was marked by a fil rouge theme, demonstrating the great intellectual vitality of opera: il Gioco dei Potenti in 2007 with Macbeth, Maria Stuarda, Norma and the gala dance with Roberto Bolle and Alessandra Ferri; \\"La seduzione\\" in 2008 when the two-time Oscar-winning citizen of Macerata, Dante Ferretti, was hired as director; L'inganno in 2009 with Don Giovanni and Madama Butterfly. Chiesa di San Filippo Neri  Macerata‚ÄìLoreto pilgrimage  From 1978, every first Saturday of June after school ending a 27 km pilgrimage from Macerata to Loreto takes place. It gathers believers from all over the world, but particularly from the near cities and regions. The main purpose is to revive an old tradition of gratitude to Mary, by students for their school ending. It has grown constantly in participants every edition, from just three hundred to sixty thousand pilgrims. Participants are led overnight through the hills along the road that is an old tradition Marian path. Pilgrims are preceded by a rood donated by Pope John Paul II who chaired at the Mass in 1993. The night march is constantly guided and is occupied by the recitation of the Rosary, songs, testimonies, meditation on the Word of God and the teachings of the Pope.  Cuisine  Macerata has a good array of restaurants, trattorias and pizzerias. Local specialities include vincisgrassi alla maceratese, a regional version of lasagna that differs from the usual in that the rag√π contains a mix of pork, beef and lamb.

An amateur, he captained Yorkshire from 1948 to 1955 and England on fourteen occasions between 1947 and 1950, winning four Tests, losing seven and drawing three. Yardley was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948 and in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was described as Yorkshire's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson. Yardley played schoolboy cricket at St Peter's, York. A highly talented all-round sportsman, he went to St John's College, Cambridge, and won Blues at cricket, squash, rugby fives and field hockey. In the university matches, he scored 90 in his second year, 101 in his third and was captain for his final year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county until 1955, when he retired as a player. He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the Second World War was chosen as vice-captain to Wally Hammond on the 1946‚Äî47 tour of Australia where he captained England in the fifth Test. He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947, and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed. In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when Brian Sellers resigned. Yardley remained in the position until 1955, during a time when Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room. Under Yardley, Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 but subsequently on a number of occasions, too often for the liking of supporters, finished second to Surrey in the County Championship. He served as a Test match selector between 1951 and 1954, acting as chairman of selectors in 1952. He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1983, when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release Geoffrey Boycott in 1983. He died after a stroke in 1989. Early life Yardley was born in Royston, near Barnsley, on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real background in cricket. He was sent to St Peter's, York, where he made a good impression as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years.Hodgson, p. 148. In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs at an average of 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the bowling averages, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket. His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord's Cricket Ground, in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team-mate Denis Compton. In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions. While still at school, he came to the attention of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst. He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934. First-class cricketer=University Cricketer Yardley at an unofficial Test match against India in Lahore on 13 November 1937. Leaving St Peter's School, Yardley went to St John's College, Cambridge University, where he immediately began to show all-round ability at sports. He won the North of England Squash Championships every year between 1934 and 1939, and won his Blue in hockey, squash, and Rugby Fives. However, his main distinction came from cricket, where he was a Blue in each his four years at Cambridge. He played for the University team in his first year, the 1935 season, making ten first-class appearances without much success. His Wisden obituary noted that \\"class rather than performance guaranteed his place.\\" He made his first-class debut against Sussex, scoring a duck in his first innings and 24 runs in the second. He passed fifty on just one occasion that season, scoring 319 runs at an average of 16.78, and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket. Nevertheless, he played in the University Match, scoring just 19 and 36. In the following season, Yardley improved considerably, becoming a dominant force in University Cricket according to Wisden. His maiden first- class century came in a narrow Cambridge victory over the Army, and he scored a second against Surrey, remaining not out for 116 in a total of 359. Bowling much more regularly, his maiden wickets in first-class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against Yorkshire, including the wicket of Len Hutton. Yardley topped the Cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in the University Match. This display impressed Stanley Jackson, an influential former Yorkshire amateur cricketer, and he urged the Yorkshire selectors to include Yardley in the first team. Yardley was still appearing in the county second team at this stage, but at the end of August, he made his debut for the Yorkshire first eleven, appearing in the County Championship match against Derbyshire. He scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket. He played in a further seven matches for Yorkshire, scoring 309 runs in ten innings with a highest score of 89 against Hampshire, with further fifties against Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). In all first-class cricket that season, Yardley scored 1,017 runs at an average of 37.66 and took 12 wickets at an average of 26.08. Yardley continued to make progress in his batting in 1937. For Cambridge, he scored fifties against the Army and Surrey. Against Hampshire he took four for 47 and five for 41, and when Cambridge collapsed to 35 for six chasing a victory target of 141, he scored 64 not out to take the side to a win. Playing Sussex, he scored a century and took four for 36, while in the University match, he scored 101 in two and a half hours. Yardley's form saw him selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, although he scored only 7 and 4, and when he joined Yorkshire after the Cambridge season, he made his first century for the county against Surrey, as well as three other fifties. His overall first-class figures were 1,472 runs at an average of 33.45 and 31 wickets at an average of 21.87. He was picked for the winter MCC tour of India, under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson, where he scored 519 runs at an average 25.95 but only took one wicket. No official Tests were played on the tour, but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place, scoring 96 in the first game, but his highest score in four other innings was 31. Honours continued to come Yardley's way in the 1938 season. He was chosen to captain Cambridge in his final season in the team; although his side did not win a match, Yardley enjoyed some personal success. Among his fifties were innings of 67 against the touring Australian team and 61 in the University Match. He was included in different representative sides; he was selected in a Test trial, playing for the Rest, and played a second game against the Australians for the Gentlemen of England, although he did not pass fifty in either match. For the Gentlemen against the Players, Yardley scored 88. He did not make the full England side but was twelfth man in two Tests against Australia. His highest innings of the season was 97 for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire, and in all first-class matches, Yardley accumulated 1,217 runs at an average of 31.20 and took 22 wickets at 35.45. Test debut and war service batting average in his last 10 innings. The blue dots indicate innings in which he finished not out. By this stage, Yorkshire regarded Yardley as the heir to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At the end of the 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond.Gibson, p. 175. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border. Having built up a reputation as one of the best amateur cricketers in England, Yardley played three early season matches for the MCC, but he was selected for neither the Gentlemen nor for England that year. He played his first full season for Yorkshire, scoring centuries against Cambridge, Warwickshire and Sussex; in total, he scored 1,086 runs at an average of 27.84 and took 17 wickets. War brought first-class cricket to an end in 1939, and Yardley joined the first battalion of the Green Howards, along with his Yorkshire team-mate Hedley Verity. After training in Omagh, Northern Ireland, where he played several cricket matches with Verity, he served in India, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Sicily, Italy and Iraq. In January 1944, he was wounded in Italy, rejoining the First Battalion in Iraq on his recovery to become an instructor, before being demobilised at the end of the war. Career after the war=Tour to Australia in 1946‚Äì47 When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Yardley scored 788 runs at an average of 23.17, with just one century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less frequently than before the war and took only nine wickets. He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs. Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice-captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter, continuing his pre-war role. It was intended that Yardley would appear lower down in the batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings. Bill Bowes, the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting that he did not back away from the fast bowlers, who frequently bowled bouncers at him: \\"In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university.\\"Bowes, p. 186. He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed Arthur Morris who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed Donald Bradman in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries. Bowes believed the natural length of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches‚Äîhe was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective. The Australian reporter Clif Cary wrote \\"It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team- mate slapped him on the back and shouted \\"Well, bowled, Spofforth\\". In the Tests, Yardley's only scores over fifty, his first in Test cricket, came in the third Test, where he scored 61 and 53 not out. In England's first innings, he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse, surviving for two hours. His second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped England to avoid defeat for the first time in the series. In the same match, Yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on the whole tour, following injuries to Bill Voce and Bill Edrich, two of England's main bowlers. Bowling leg theory with a fielders concentrated on the leg side, Yardley managed to move the ball off the seam. He dismissed Bradman twice in the match, having figures of three for 67 in the second innings and taking five wickets in the match. This was the first time that an England player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a Test.Swanton, pp. 158‚Äì59. Yardley also had substantial bowling workload in the fourth Test, delivering 31 overs in Australia's first innings to take three for 101. When Hammond did not play in the final Test, Yardley became captain, doing so courageously according to Wisden, which also pointed out that Yardley used field placing more effectively than Hammond. In the series, Yardley scored 252 runs at an average of 32.50, His ten wickets at an average of 37.20 placed him first in the series bowling averages. He played in the drawn Test on the short tour to New Zealand which followed, opening the batting scoring 22 and taking a wicket. England captain Yardley receiving massage in 1947 before a match against South Africa Yardley enjoyed his most successful season with the bat in the 1947 season, scoring 1,906 runs at an average of 44.32 with five centuries; his bowling took eleven wickets. Following Hammond's retirement immediately after the 1946‚Äì47 tour, Yardley captained England against South Africa throughout the season. In the first Test, he made his highest Test score. England were unexpectedly made to follow on in the face of a large South African total; when Yardley came to the crease in the second innings, England looked likely to be defeated at 170 for four, still 155 runs behind the tourists. Yardley scored 99, being caught in the slips just before reaching his century, but his batting had helped to save the game and earned praise from Wisden for \\"batting soundly\\".He eventually became the first test captain to be dismissed for 99 in a test innings Yardley and Denis Compton added 237, which was a record partnership for the fifth wicket in England and remains, in August 2010, England's best fifth wicket stand against South Africa. Yardley's only other score over fifty in the series came in the drawn fifth Test when he scored 59. However, he scored 41 in just over an hour in helpful conditions for fast bowlers in the third Test and 36 on a difficult pitch in the fourth Test. Yardley scored 273 runs at an average of 39.00 in the series. In contrast to his efforts in Australia, he bowled just six overs in the series without taking a wicket. England won the second, third and fourth Tests to win the series, helped by a negative approach from the tourists. Yardley captained the Gentlemen against the Players for the first time, at Lord's and Scarborough, and captained The Rest against Middlesex, the County Champions. His batting and captaincy in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. Playing the Invincibles Following Brian Sellers resignation, Yardley was appointed Yorkshire captain at the start of the 1948 season.Woodhouse, p. 377. With his England commitments and other absences, he only played in 12 County Championship matches. He had not toured the West Indies with MCC in 1947‚Äì48, when Gubby Allen captained the side. However, Yardley resumed his leadership of England when Australia, captained by Bradman, toured the country without losing a match. Yardley led the MCC in an early match against the tourists, and captained England in a Test trial, but only played three other games, all for Yorkshire, before the first Test, with a top score of 46. In the first Test, England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in difficult conditions. Wisden did not blame Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well. He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia's scoring rate, taking a wicket himself with his fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32. The Australian batsmen found it difficult to score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344. Yardley batted an hour in the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win. Before the second Test, Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians, and although unsuccessful with the bat, took two for nine with the ball, his first wickets of the season for his county. England adopted an aggressive strategy in the second Test, but could not avoid a second defeat. Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings, and took two for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage.Bowes, p. 189. However, the lower order batsmen mounted a recovery, Yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl Doug Wright. The England captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with Denis Compton, scoring 44 himself, but Australia led by 135 on first innings. Yardley took two wickets in two balls in Australia's second innings, narrowly missing a hat-trick when Keith Miller only just got his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled, and had figures of two for 36, but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186. In between Tests, Yardley scored his only century of the season, but his contributions to the third Test were minimal. He scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs. However, the home side fought back in the match, for which Len Hutton was dropped. England scored 363 and bowled out Australia for 221. They scored 174 for three before declaring, but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win. England maintained their newly confident approach, being on top for most of the fourth Test.Bowes, pp. 190‚Äì91. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner.Bowes, p. 191. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball.Gibson, pp. 188‚Äì89. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long.Bowes, pp. 191‚Äì92. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match. Around this time, and particularly after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test.Gibson, p. 139. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4‚Äì0. Yardley managed 150 runs at an average of 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.Bowes, p. 194. Yardley's only other representative appearance in 1948 was as captain of the Gentlemen against the Players at Lords, where he scored 61. In the whole season, he scored 1,061 runs at an average of 29.47 and 14 wickets at an average of 35.14‚Äîhe took just five wickets outside of the Tests. Captain of Yorkshire Yardley was unavailable to captain the MCC tour of South Africa in the winter of 1948‚Äì49, which was led by George Mann. Mann did well enough to retain the position for two Tests in the 1949 season; Freddie Brown captained the other two and Yardley did not play for England that year.Gibson, pp. 166, 175. In all first- class matches that season, he scored 1,612 runs at an average of 37.48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33.86. He did not score a century in the County Championship, but passed three figures for Yorkshire against the New Zealand touring team and for the North against the South in a festival match. His only representative game outside of festival matches was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's; Mann was appointed captain for the game. That season, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, the only time Yorkshire won the competition during Yardley's leadership. Yardley's batting form dipped in the 1950 season. He scored 1,082 runs at an average of 24.59, the final time he reached four figures in a season. With the ball he took 19 wickets at an average of 32.10. Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind joint winners Lancashire and Surrey. It took seven matches for Yardley to reach fifty runs in an innings, but he hit centuries against Surrey, Somerset and Scotland in the second half of the season. The West Indies toured England and Yardley resumed the England captaincy; he also captained MCC against the tourists and England against The Rest in a Test trial. However, neither Yardley nor Mann, the two likeliest candidates, were able to accept the captaincy of the MCC side in Australia that winter. The selectors spent much of the season assessing other players. Although Yardley represented the Gentlemen against the Players, the side was led by Brown, who scored a century and was appointed captain of the touring side. Brown also assumed the captaincy of England for the final Test against West Indies and Yardley was left out of the team.Gibson, pp. 180‚Äì81. In the three Tests he played, Yardley scored 108 runs at an average of 18.00 with a top score of 41. He won the first Test but lost the next two, West Indies' first Test wins in England; the final Test was also lost by Brown. Following this series, Yardley did not play any more Tests, although his name was mentioned as a potential captain in 1953 before Hutton was appointed as England's first professional captain of the twentieth century. At the time, Yardley was still considered the best amateur candidate.Gibson, pp. 175‚Äì76. In 20 Tests, Yardley scored 812 runs at an average of 25.37 and four fifties. With the ball, he took 21 wickets at an average of 33.66. On the fourteen occasions he was captain, he won four times, lost seven and drew three. Yorkshire finished second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the 1951 season and second to Surrey in the 1952 season. However, in following season, Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth, their worst ever finish at that time. In the following two seasons, the team were again runners up, Surrey winning on both occasions. Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season, but only managed two more centuries. These were 183 not out against Hampshire in 1951, the highest innings of his career, and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season. His batting average was generally between 24 and 31, except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36.53. Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952, delivering more overs than any other time in his career in the latter year. He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season, his highest two season totals, and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions, having only done so twice before. However, he bowled less often during his final three seasons, with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets. His only representative cricket, apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce's XI, was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1954. Judgements were mixed on Yardley's performance as Yorkshire's captain. His record would have been considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. Trevor Bailey, who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him \\"an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under.\\"Bailey, p. 141. Alan Gibson believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players. Jim Kilburn noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control. Yardley disliked confrontation, and Ray Illingworth, who played under him, described him as too nice to stand up to his players. But Bob Appleyard, another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a spinner, and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians.Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 33, 127. Generally, he was popular with his players. Between 1951 and 1954, Yardley served as a Test selector, serving as chairman in 1952 at the time when Hutton was chosen as England captain.Gibson, p. 184. Following the 1955 season, aged 40 and increasingly bothered by lumbago, Yardley retired from the team. He ended his first-class career with 18,173 runs at an average of 31.17, and 279 wickets at an average of 30.48. Wisden later described him as \\"the finest Yorkshire amateur since F. S. Jackson\\". Style and technique Yardley had a good technique for batting.Swanton, p. 159. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation.Chalke and Hodgson, p. 127 He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen. Career after cricket Yardley worked as a wine merchant outside cricket. After his retirement from playing he worked as a cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on Test Match Special from 1956 until 1969, as well as in 1973. According to David Frith, the only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when Brian Close was dismissed after a poor shot in the Fourth Test in 1961 at Old Trafford; this was part of a final-day England collapse that handed Australia the match and a 2‚Äì1 series win after the hosts had been on course for victory and the series lead. Trevor Bailey, who was a colleague in the commentary box for the later part of Yardley's time with Test Match Special, wrote: \\"I always considered Norman Yardley to be an ideal summariser: accurate, informative and very sensible, and able to explain not only what happened but also the reasons why. His knowledge about pitches, tactics and the technicalities of the game was exceptional... Articulate, expert, and possessing considerable charge [sic], I thought his interpretation of events on the field and his post-session summaries were sound, balanced and never less than fair.\\"Bailey, pp. 223‚Äì224. He served on the Yorkshire Cricket Committee,Woodhouse, p. 378. and from 1981, he was Yorkshire President. However, he became involved in the controversy surrounding Geoffrey Boycott, to whom the committee had decided not to give a new contract. Yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence, dismayed by the attitude of Boycott's supporters. Anthony Woodhouse wrote in his history of Yorkshire: \\"he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner. Alas, he should never have been burdened with the politics of Yorkshire cricket in the 1980s.\\" He died at Lodge Moor, Sheffield on 3 October 1989 following a stroke.

E. M. Wherry, M.A. A Complete Index to Sale's Text, Preliminary Discourse, and Notes Theme The Surah takes its name from the word wal-mursalat in the first verse. Period of Revelation Its subject matter bears full evidence that it was revealed in the earliest period at Makkah. If this Surah is read together with the two Surahs preceding it, namely Al-Qiyamah and Ad-Dahr, and the two Surahs following it, namely An-Naba and An-Naziat, it becomes obvious that all these Surahs are the Revelations of the same period, and they deal with one and the same theme, which has been impressed on the people of Makkah in different ways. Theme and Subject Matter Its theme is to affirm the Resurrection and Hereafter and to warn the people of the consequences which will ultimately follow the denial and the affirmation of these truths. In the first seven verses, the system of winds has been presented as an evidence of the truth that the Resurrection which is being foretold by the Qur'an and Muhammad must come to pass. The reasoning is that the power of All-Mighty Allah Who established this wonderful system on the earth, cannot be helpless in bringing about the Resurrection, and the express wisdom which underlies this system bears full evidence that the Hereafter must appear, for no act of an All-Wise Creator can be vain and purposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean that the whole of one's life was useless and absurd. The people of Makkah repeatedly asked, \\"Bring about the Resurrection with which you threaten us; only then shall we believe in it.\\" In verses 8-l5, their demand has been answered, saying: \\"Resurrection is no sport or fun so that whenever a jester should ask for it, it should be brought forth immediately. It is indeed the Day of Judgment to settle the account of all mankind and of all its individuals. For it Allah has fixed a specific time it will take place at its own time, and when it takes place with all its dreads and horrors, it will confound those who are demanding it for fun today. Then their cases will be decided only on the evidence of those Messengers whom these deniers of the truth are repudiating with impunity. Then they will themselves realize how they themselves are responsible for their dooms In verses 16-28 arguments have been given continuously for the occurrence and necessity of the Resurrection and Hereafter. In these it has been stated that man's own history, his own birth, and the structure of the earth on which he lives, bears the testimony that the coming of Resurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter are possible as well as the demand of Allah Almighty's wisdom. History tells us that the nations which denied the Hereafter ultimately became corrupted and met with destruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth which, if denied and contradicted by a nation by its conduct and attitude, will cause it to meet the same doom, which is met by a blind man who rushes headlong into an approaching train. And it also means that in the kingdom of the universe only physical laws are not at work but a moral law also is working in it, under which in this very world the process of retribution is operating. But since in the present life of the world retribution is not taking place in its complete and perfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily demands that there should come a time when it should take its full course and all those good works and evil deeds, which could not be rewarded here, or which escaped their due punishment should be fully rewarded and punished. For this it is inevitable that there should be a second life after death. If man only considers how he takes his birth in the world, his intellect, provided it is sound intellect, cannot deny that for the God Who began his creation from an insignificant sperm drop and developed him into a perfect man, it certainly is possible to create the same man once again. After death the particles of man's body do not disappear but continue to exist on the same earth on which he lived his whole life. It is from the resources and treasures of this very earth that he is made and nourished and then into the same treasures of the earth he is deposited. The God who caused him to emerge from the treasures of the earth, in the first instance, can also cause him to re-emerge from the same treasures after he has been restored to them at death. If one only considers the powers of Allah, one cannot deny that He can do this; and if one considers the wisdom of Allah, one also cannot deny that it is certainly the very demand of His wisdom to call man to account for the right and wrong use of the powers that He has granted him on the earth; it would rather be against wisdom to let him off without rendering an account. Then, in verses 28-40, the fate of the deniers of the Hereafter has been depicted, and in verses 41-45 those who affirm their faith in it in their worldly life, endeavored to improve their Hereafter, and abstained from the evils of disbelief and thought, morality and deed, conduct and character which might be helpful in man's worldly life, but are certainly ruinous for his life hereafter. Conclusion In the end, the deniers of the Hereafter and those who turn away from God-worship, have been warned as if to say: \\"Enjoy your short-lived worldly pleasure as you may, but your end will ultimately be disastrous.\\" The discourse concludes with the assertion that the one who fails to obtain guidance from a Book like the Qur'an, can have no other source in the world to afford him Guidance.

According to Abdullah bin Abbas, this Surah was sent down before Surah An-Naba, whilst Mu·∏•ammad Kha·π≠ƒ´b has opined that surah 79 was revealed around five years before the Hegira, although other commentators have dated the surah‚Äôs revelation at eight years before the Hegira.Kha·π≠ƒ´b, Mu·∏•ammad; The Bounteous Koran: A Translation of Meaning and Commentary Western Qur‚Äôan scholar Richard Bell has argued that parts of surah 79, notably the opening verses, may date from a later Meccan period,Bell, Richard (translator); The Qur‚Äôan (volume 2; p. 633. Published 1937 (reprint 1960) by T. & T. Clark though this is not generally accepted by other scholars. Theme and subject matter Its theme is affirmation of the Resurrection and the life hereafter. It also warns of the consequences of belying the Messenger of God. The Surah opens with oaths sworn by the angels who take the soul at death and those who hasten to carry out Allah‚Äôs Commands, and those who conduct the affairs of the universe according to Divine Will, to assure that the Resurrection will certainly come to pass and the second life after death will certainly take place. For the angels who are employed to pluck out the soul today can also be employed to restore the soul tomorrow, and the angels who promptly execute Allah's Commands and conduct the affairs of the universe today can also upset the order of the universe tomorrow by orders of the same God and can also bring about a new order. After this the people have been told, so as to say: ‚ÄúThis work which you regard as absolutely impossible, is not any difficulty for Allah, for which He may have to make lengthy preparations. Just a single jolt will upset this system of the world and a second jolt will be enough to cause you to appear as living beings in the new world. At that time the same people who were wont to deny it, would be trembling with fear and seeing with awestruck eyes all that they thought was impossible. Then, relating the story of the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh briefly (it is the chronologically earliest sura to do this),Starkovsky, Nicolas; The Koran Handbook: An Annotated Translation the people have been warned to the effect: ‚ÄúYou know full well what fate the Pharaoh met in consequence of belying the Messenger and rejecting the guidance brought by him and endeavoring to defeat his mission by trickery and deceit. If you do not learn any lesson from it and do not change your ways and attitude accordingly, you also will have to meet the same fate. Then, in vv. 27-33, arguments have been given for the Hereafter and life after death. In this regard, the deniers have been asked the question: \\"Is your resurrection a more difficult task or the creation of the huge Universe which spreads around you to infinite distances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your recreation cannot be difficult for the God for Whom this was an easy task. Thus, after presenting in a single sentence, a decisive argument for the possibility of the Hereafter, attention has been drawn to the earth and its provisions that have been arranged in it for the sustenance of man and animal and of which everything testifies that it has been created with great wisdom for fulfilling some special purpose. Pointing to this the question has been left for the intellect of man to ponder for itself and form the opinion whether calling man to account after having delegated authority and responsibilities to a creature like him in this wise system would be more in keeping with the demands of wisdom, or that he should die after committing all sorts of misdeeds in the world and should perish and mix in the dust forever and should never be called to account as to how he employed the authority and fulfilled the responsibilities entrusted to him. Instead of discussing this question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said: \\"When the Hereafter is established, men's eternal future will be determined on the criterion as to which of them rebelled against his God transgressing the bounds of service and made the material benefits and pleasures his objective of life and which of them feared standing before his Lord and refrained from fulfilling the unlawful desires of the self.\\" This by itself provides the right answer to the above question to every such person who considers it honestly, free from stubbornness. For the only rational, logical and moral demand of giving authority and entrusting responsibilities to man in the world is that he should be called to account on this very basis ultimately and rewarded or punished accordingly. In conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah as to when the Resurrection will take place has been answered. They asked the Prophet this question over and over again. In reply it has been said that the knowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah alone. The Messenger is there only to give the warning that it will certainly come. Now whoever wishes may mend his ways, fearing its coming, and whoever wishes may behave and conduct himself as he likes, fearless of its coming. When the appointed time comes, those very people who loved the life of this world and regarded its pleasures as the only object of life, would feel that they had stayed in the world only for an hour or so. Then they will realize how utterly they had ruined their future forever for the sake of the short lived pleasures of the world.

Biography He was born at La Chaux-de-Fonds (Neuch√¢tel) in Switzerland, but left his native place with the engraver Jean Girardet at the age of sixteen for Paris. He was on the eve of obtaining the grand prix for engraving when the events of 1815 blasted his hopes, for Neuch√¢tel was restored to Prussia, and Robert was struck off the list of competitors as a foreigner. Whilst continuing his studies under Girardet he had never ceased to frequent the studio of David, and he now determined to become a painter, and only returned to his native country when his master himself was exiled. At Neuch√¢tel he attracted the notice of Roullet de Mezerac, who enabled him by a timely loan to proceed to Rome. In depicting the customs and life of the people, of southern Italy especially, he showed peculiar feeling for the historical characteristics of their race. Portrait of a young woman of Retuna by Louis L√©opold Robert After executing many detached studies of Italian life Robert conceived the idea of painting four great works which should represent at one and the same time the four seasons in Italy and the four leading races of its people. In the Return from the F√™te of the Madonna dell'Arco (Louvre) he depicted the Neapolitans and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon of 1827, achieved undoubted success and was bought for the Luxembourg by Charles X; but the work which appeared in 1831, the Summer Reapers arriving in the Pontine Marshe (Louvre), which became the property of Louis Phillippe, established the artist's reputation. Florence and her autumn vineyards should now have furnished him with his third subject. He attempted to begin it, but, unable to conquer his passion for Princess Charlotte Napoleon (then mourning the violent death of her husband, Robert's devoted friend), he threw up his work and went to Venice, where he began and carried through the fourth of the series, the Fishers of the Adriatic. This work was not equal to the Reapers. Worn by the vicissitudes of painful feeling, and bitterly discouraged, Robert committed suicide before his easel on 20 March 1835, on the tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a brother to whom he had been much attached. There are a number of references to Robert's paintings in the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, one being specifically to The Reapers.

The Battle of Hancock, also called the Romney Campaign, was a battle fought during the Romney Expedition, occurred January 5-6, 1862, in Washington County, Maryland, and Morgan County, West Virginia, as part of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's operations against the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O;) Railroad during the American Civil War. On January 1, 1862, Confederate general Stonewall Jackson led his men from Winchester to Bath in an attempt to disturb traffic on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Jackson's men reached the Potomac River opposite the garrisoned town of Hancock, Maryland on January 5, after a skirmish with Union soldiers. Jackson's artillery opened fire on the town from Orrick's Hill but it resulted in only minor damage. Union garrison commander Brig. Gen. Frederick W. Lander refused to surrender to Jackson, who continued the bombardment for two days while unsuccessfully searching for a safe river crossing. On January 7, the Confederate soldiers withdrew and set out for Romney, West Virginia.

Name of the surah Jalaluddin Al-Suyuti co-author of the classical Sunni tafsƒ´r known as Tafsir al-Jalalayn suggests that some of the s≈´rahs have been named using incipits (i.e. the first few words of the surah). Hamiduddin Farahi a celebrated Islamic scholar of Indian subcontinent is known for his groundbreaking work on the concept of Nazm, or Coherence, in the Quran. He writes that Some s≈´rahs have been given names after some conspicuous words used in them. The Surah takes its name from its second word al- Mutaffifin -Abul A'la Maududi.Compiled from a First Edition, multi-volume paperback English translation of the Quran by Abul A'la Maududi- Tafhim-ul- Quran. Placement & Coherence with other surahs The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as nazm and munasabah in non-English literature and coherence, text relations, intertextuality, and unity in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. This surah belongs to the last(7th) group of surahs which starts from Surah Al-Mulk (67) and runs till the end of the Quran. This surah forms a pair with the next one (Al-Inshiqaq) about their subject-matter.Dr. Israr Ahmed - Bayan ul Quran Connection with previous surah Tadabbur-i-Quran is a tafsir (exegeses) of the Qur'an by Amin Ahsan Islahi based on the concept of thematic and structural coherence, which was originally inspired by Allama Hamiduddin Farahi. The tafsir is extended over nine volumes of six thousand pages. It describes Al-Mutaffifin as a supplement to the previous surah al-Infitar concerning the central theme and that this surah elaborates the division righteous and the deviants mentioned in last passage of the previous surah.Amin Ahsan Islahi - Tadabbur-i-Quran - Chapter 83 This surah further continues and elaborates the concept of Islamic eschatology alluded towards the end of previous surah.http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp?chapter=82&verse;=18#(82:18:1) Connection with next surah According to Javed Ahmad Ghamidi a Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar, Islamic modernist, exegete and educationist; the central theme of both surahs is to warn the Quraysh of any misconception they may have about the Day of Judgement. Most surely, they are going to be raised on that day to appear before their Lord and shall definitely meet different fates according to their deeds.Javed Ahmad Ghamidihttps://www.javedahmedghamidi.org/#!/quran/full?chapter=83&type;=Ghamidi‚ü®=en  Theme and Subject Matter  The primary theme of this surah is Hereafter and the rhetoric addresses the following subjects is the discourse. The surah opens with a declaration of war and denunciation of those who use false weights and measures; in 1st 6 ayaat.George Sale - Mohammed, The Quran, vol. 4 [1896] The surah warns the audience that the acts of the wicked are recorded in the book Sajj√≠n in 7th to 9th ayaat. The surah makes explicit the relation between morality and the doctrine of the Hereafter effectively and impressively with woes to those who reject Muhammad and deny the judgment-day in ayaat up to 17th. Further up to 21st ayat, the surah describes that the acts of the righteous are registered in Illiy√∫n. The rewards of the righteous in Paradise are explained in ayaat 22nd up to 28th. In conclusion, from 29th to 36th ayat, the believers have been consoled, and the disbelievers warned as if to say: Unbelievers mock at Muslims now but shall be laughed at in turn on the Resurrection Day. Special traits of S≈´rat Al-Mutaffifin The Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a s≈´rah. Many of the surahs contain overlapping subjects yet many of them hold special traits. In this surah for example; the word al-Mutaffifin is unique in its frequency of occurrence as it is mentioned only once in the whole of the Quran. Al- Mutaffifin means the stinters who use unfair means & measures to take more than they should and give less than they should. As the principal subject of the discourse is the stinters/al-Mutaffifin, the surah further elaborates the actions of either; using malpractice or carefully being honest; are recorded in Sajj√≠n and Illiy√∫n respectively. Both of these words Sajj√≠n and Illiy√∫n also occur only in this surah and nowhere else in the whole Quran just like their trigger word Al- Mutaffifin.http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3Asij%7Eiyn+pos%3Anhttp://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEil%7Eiy%7Eiyn+pos%3An Hadith The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

It mentions details of the Day of Judgment when, according to the chapter, everyone will receive reckoning over their deeds in this world.Quran Surah Al-Inshiqaaq  Revelation  According to the Islamic tradition, Al-Inshiqaq was most likely revealed after the 82nd chapter Al-Infitar, and was chronologically one of the last of the Meccan surahs‚Äîchapters revealed before Muhammad's migration to Medina.  Content  The name of the chapter, Al-Inshiqaq, is a noun variously translated as \\"The Sundering\\", \\"The Bursting Asunder\\", \\"The Splitting Open\\", among others. This name comes from the first verse of the chapter which reads When the sky is rent asunder. The verse does not contain the word al-inshiqaq verbatim, but rather it contains a word of the same root. It is a reference to the destruction of the world at the end of days, which the chapter portend. Thematically, the chapter follows a day-of-judgement theme that is present in the preceding chapters, including Al-Infitar (the 82nd chapter) and Al- Mutaffifin (83rd). The chapter begins (verses 1 to 5) by mentioning events that will happen on the Day of Judgment, including the sundering of the sky and the flattening of all that is on earth. Verses 6 to 15 talk about the disparity between those who in that day will be \\"given [their] book in [their] right hand\\" and have a joyful reckoning, and those who will not. A series of oaths (verses 16‚Äî18) followed, and then another contrast between the fate of the believers and the unbelievers in the day of judgment.  Prostration  According to the hadith, Muhammed had prostrated when reciting this chapter, particularly after the verse 21 which reads ... and that when the Quran is recited unto them, they do not prostrate? Therefore, most Islamic scholars consider this verse one of the 15 verses in the Quran where one prostrates after reciting it.

Its name was changed to Po-2 in 1944, after Polikarpov's death, according to the then-new Soviet naming system, usually using the first two letters of the designer's family name, or the Soviet government-established design bureau that created it. Production in the Soviet Union ended in 1953, but license-built CSS-13s were still produced in Poland until 1959. Polikarpov Po-2 replica Operational history A damaged and abandoned Po-2 forced to land in Ukraine, and subsequently captured by German troops, 1941. From the beginning, the U-2 became the basic Soviet civil and military trainer aircraft, mass-produced in a \\"Red Flyer\\" factory near Moscow. It was also used for transport, and as a military liaison aircraft, due to its STOL capabilities. Also from the beginning it was produced as an agricultural aircraft variant, which earned it its nickname Kukuruznik. Although entirely outclassed by contemporary aircraft, the Kukuruznik served extensively on the Eastern Front in World War II, primarily as a liaison, medevac and general- supply aircraft. It was especially useful for supplying Soviet partisans behind the German front line. Manufacturing of the Po-2 in the USSR ceased in 1949, but until 1959 a number were assembled in Aeroflot repair workshops. The first trials of arming the aircraft with bombs took place in 1941. During the defence of Odessa, in September 1941, the U-2 was used as a reconnaissance aircraft and as a light, short-range, bomber. The bombs, dropped from a civil aircraft piloted by Pyotr Bevz, were the first to fall on enemy artillery positions.Gordon 2008, p. 285. From 1942 it was adapted as a light night ground attack aircraft. Nikolay Polikarpov supported the project, and under his leadership, the U-2VS (voyskovaya seriya - Military series) was created. This was a light night bomber, fitted with bomb carriers beneath the lower wing, to carry 50 or 100 kg (110 or 220 lbs) bombs up to a total weight of 350 kg (771 lb) and armed with ShKAS or DA machine guns in the observer's cockpit. The U-2's 5-cylinder engine had an unusual exhaust manifold arrangement that gave the engine a peculiar rattling or popping sound and led to a number of nicknames. Wehrmacht troops nicknamed it N√§hmaschine (sewing machine), and Finnish troops called it Hermosaha (Nerve saw). The Germans also called it Kaffeemuhle, which literally means \\"coffee grinder\\" and is also slang meaning \\"whirlybird,\\" probably for the engine which could sound like the rotating blades of a helicopter in flight. The fabric and wood construction of the airplane made it extremely vulnerable to catching fire, resulting in a Russian nickname of Kerosinka, or kerosene lantern.Grossman 2007, p. 133. The material effects of these missions may be regarded as minor, but the psychological effect on German troops was noticeable. They typically attacked by surprise in the middle of the night, denying German troops sleep and keeping them on their guard, contributing to the already high stress of combat on the Eastern front. The usual tactic involved flying only a few meters above the ground, climbing for the final approach, throttling back the engine and making a gliding bombing run, leaving the targeted troops with only the eerie whistling of the wind in the wings' bracing-wires as an indication of the impending attack.Handler, M. S., United Press, \\"Russia's New 'Secret' Weapon Revealed to Be Old-Type Training Ship: Crates Glide Through Skies, Blast Nazis; Veteran Planes Helping Write History on Eastern Front Despite Slow Speed\\", The San Bernardino Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 10 October 1942, Volume 49, page 4. Luftwaffe fighters found it extremely hard to shoot down the Kukuruznik because of two main factors: the pilots flew at treetop level where they were hard to see or engage and the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was similar to the U-2s maximum speed, making it difficult for the fighters to keep a Po-2 in weapons range for an adequate period of time.Myles 1997 The success of the Soviet night harassment units inspired the Luftwaffe to set up similar St√∂rkampfstaffel \\"harassment combat squadrons\\" on the Eastern Front using their own obsolete 1930s-era, open cockpit biplanes (most often the Gotha Go 145 and Arado Ar 66 biplanes) and parasol monoplane aircraft, eventually building up to larger Nachtschlachtgruppe (night attack group) units of a few squadrons each. The U-2 became known as the aircraft used by the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, composed of an all-woman pilot and ground crew complement. The unit was notorious for daring low-altitude night raids on German rear-area positions. Veteran pilots Yekaterina Ryabova and Nadezhda Popova on one occasion flew eighteen missions in a single night. The women pilots observed that the enemy suffered a further degree of demoralization simply due to their antagonists being female. As such, the pilots earned the nickname \\"Night Witches\\" (German Nachthexen, Russian –ù–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –í–µ–¥—å–º—ã/Noƒçnye Ved‚Äômy). The unit earned numerous Hero of the Soviet Union citations and dozens of Order of the Red Banner medals; most surviving pilots had flown nearly 1,000 combat missions by the end of the war and took part in the Battle of Berlin. The Polish Air Force used these slow and manoeuvrable aircraft for air reconnaissance and COIN operations against UPA bands in mountainous area of Bieszczady. Pilots and navigators were dispatched to look for concentrations of UPA forces and if needed, engage them with machine guns and grenades. On several occasions, the UPA managed to bring down some of the Po-2s, but never captured or operated them.Kurs bojowy Bieszczady, 1971. North Korean forces used the Po-2 in a similar role during the Korean War. A significant number of Po-2s were fielded by the Korean People's Air Force, inflicting serious damage during night raids on United Nations bases.Dorr 2003, p. 50. During one such attack, a lone Po-2 attacked Pyongyang airfield in northwestern Korea. Concentrating on the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group's parking ramp, the Po-2 dropped a string of fragmentation bombs squarely across the group's lineup of P-51 Mustangs. Eleven Mustangs were damaged, three so badly that they were destroyed when Pyongyang was abandoned several days later. On 17 June 1951, at 01:30 hours, Suwon Air Base was bombed by two Po-2s. Each biplane dropped a pair of fragmentation bombs. One scored a hit on the 802nd Engineer Aviation Battalion's motor pool, damaging some equipment. Two bombs burst on the flightline of the 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. One F-86A Sabre (FU-334 / 49-1334) was struck on the wing and began burning. The fire took hold, gutting the aircraft. Prompt action by personnel who moved aircraft away from the burning Sabre prevented further loss. Eight other Sabres were damaged in the brief attack, four seriously. One F-86 pilot was among the wounded. The North Koreans subsequently credited Lt. La Woon Yung with this damaging attack.American Aviation Historical Society, Vol. 30, 1985. UN forces named the Po-2's nighttime appearance Bedcheck Charlie and had great difficulty in shooting it down - even though night fighters had radar as standard equipment in the 1950s. The wood-and-fabric material of the Po-2 had only a small radar cross-section, making it hard for an opposing fighter pilot to acquire his target. As Korean war U.S. veteran Leo Fournier remarked about \\"Bedcheck Charlie\\" in his memoirs: \\"... no one could get at him. He just flew too low and too slow.\\" On 16 June 1953, a USMC AD-4 from VMC-1 piloted by Major George H. Linnemeier and CWO Vernon S. Kramer shot down a Soviet-built Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, the only documented Skyraider air victory of the war. The Po-2 is also the only biplane credited with a documented jet-kill, as one Lockheed F-94 Starfire was lost while slowing down to ‚Äì below its stall speed ‚Äì during an intercept in order to engage the low flying Po-2.Grier, Peter. \\"April 15, 1953\\".

Content The surah opens with an oath by a heaven full of stars: by the sky containing great stars. The Arabic word Al-Burooj is interpreted in several ways. The word Al- Burooj is the plural of Burj which means fort or tower; something that can be seen from a distance. Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhaj, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi said Burj means stars. Ibn Jareer chose the view that it means the positions of the sun and the moon, which are twelve Burooj. The sun travels through each one of these Burj in one month. The moon travels through each one of these Burj in two-and-a-third days, which makes a total of twenty-eight positions, and it is hidden for two nights [making a month of 30 approximately]. Exegesis=Q85:4-8 People of the Ditch Interpreters give several different versions of the story to be referred to in verses 4‚Äì8: persecution of Christians by Dhu Nuwas in Yemen, persecutions by Nebuchadnezzar, and people of the trench. It has been documented that Dun Nuwas burned 20,000 Christians alive in a burning trench because they refused to convert to Judaism.http://www.islam- universe.com/tafsir_ibn_kathir/85.57762.html Q85:22 'preserved tablet'  Quranic exegetes produced different interpretations of the term 'preserved tablet' in verse 22. In this surah the relationship of Quran to the 'Preserved Tablet' is correlated with the relation of the stars 'Al-Buruj' to the heavens 'Al-Sama'. Mu'tazilites argued that revelations were created initially in the preserved tablet. This seems to be close to another term, 'Mother of all books' (umm al-kitab), mentioned in Ar-Ra'd 13:39 and Az-Zukhruf 43:4. Theme and subject matter Its theme is to warn the disbelievers of the evil consequences of the persecution and tyranny that they were perpetrating on the converts to Islam, and to console the believers, so as to say: \\"If you remain firm and steadfast against tyranny and coercion, you will be rewarded richly for it, and Allah will certainly avenge Himself on your persecutors on your behalf.\\" In this connection, the story of the People of the Ditch (ashab al- ukhdud) had been related, who were a group of people who had burnt believers to death by casting them into pits full of fire. By means of this story the believers and the disbelievers have been taught a few lessons. Firstly, that just as the People of the Ditch became worthy of Allah's curse and punishment due to their oppression and tyranny, the chiefs of Makkah are also becoming worthy of it. Secondly, that just as the believers at that time had willingly accepted to sacrifice their lives by being burnt to death in the pits of fire instead of turning away from the faith, so also the believers now should endure every persecution but should never give up their faith. Thirdly, that God's acknowledging Whom displeases the disbelievers and is urged on by the believers, is Dominant and Master of the Kingdom of the earth and heavens; He is self-praiseworthy and is watching what the two groups are striving for. Therefore, it is certain that the disbelievers will be punished in Hell for their oppression, tyranny, and cruelties, unless they have asked for sincere repentance. Likewise, it is also certain that those who believe and do good deeds will go to Paradise, and this indeed is the supreme success. Then the disbelievers have been warned, so as to say: \\"God's grip is very severe. If you are proud of the strength of your leaders, then you should know that the leaders in the time of the Pharaoh and Thamud were even stronger and more numerous. Therefore, you should learn a lesson from the fate they met. God's power has so encompassed you that you cannot escape His encirclement, and the Qur'an that you are bent upon belying, is unchangeable: it is inscribed in the Preserved Tablet, which cannot be corrupted in any way.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Part 1 of 2 by Nouman Ali Khan * Part 2 of 2 by Nouman Ali Khan Burooj Islamic eschatology Islamic belief and doctrine Islamic ethics Afterlife ","title":"Al-Burooj"},{"id":"1351243","text":"a·π≠-·π¨ƒÅriq (, ‚ÄúThe Piercing Star‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Nightcomer‚Äù, literally ‚ÄúThe Knocker‚Äù) is the eighty-sixth sura of the Quran with 17 ayat.

Q86:5-7 Between the backbone and the ribs Allah then asks the human beings to think about how they were created. He then goes on to say that he has created human beings from the gushing water flowing between the backbone and the ribs. The Enlightening Commentary into the Light of the Holy Qur'an vol. 5 says, \\"there may be greater facts hidden in the verse that modern science has not found yet, however, scientists may uncover them in the future\\". Q86:8-10 Judgment Day Allah then reminds the human beings about the Judgment Day, the day when all the secrets would be revealed. On that day, human beings would have no power and no one would help them.

Mankind often hides things from each other and from themselves as well. The sura reminds us that Allah knows the things that are declared and things that lie hidden.

For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order....\\".Approaches to the Asian Classics, Irene Bloom, Wm Theodore de Bary, Columbia University Press, 1990, p. 65 , 9780231070058 Surat Al-Fajr is a Meccan suraQuran Verses in Chronological Order and meccan suras are chronologically earlier suras that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short ayat, and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an's 114 surahs. Most of the surahs containing muqatta'at are Meccan. Henceforth apart from traditions, this surah qualifies to be Meccan typically. According to Yusuf Ali, Al-Fajr may be placed in the dating period close to Surat Al-Lail and Ad-Dhuha. AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l (occasions or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. According to of the mufassir≈´n this surah was revealed at Mecca, at a stage when opposition to Muhammad had grown to the stage of persecution of new Muslim converts .Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (d. 1979) Tafhim al-Qur'an According to an interpretation expounded on in the tafsƒ´r (commentary) written by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (d. 1979) entitled Tafhim al-Qur'an,  Surah Al-Fajr in hadith  Hadƒ´·πØ (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\"; recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with sira these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. Hadith has been called \\"the backbone\\" of Islamic civilization,J.A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad, 2014: p.6 and within that religion, the authority of hadith as a source for religious law and moral guidance ranks second only to that of the Qur'an. This surah appears in a hadith that recommend its recitation in Salah. * It was narrated that Jabir said:\\"Muadh stood up and prayed Isha', and made it lengthy.

Suite 500 Irving, TX 75062Tadabbur-i-Quran#Contents The last of these seven sections goes from surah Al-Mulk [surah number 67] to surah Al-Nas [surah number 114].

This surah Al-Fajr forms a pair with the next one Al- Balad. The central theme of both the surahs is to reprimand the leaders of the Quraysh for the rebellious attitude and arrogant behavior they have adopted with regard to Allah and their fellow human beings after being bestowed with favors and riches.Javed Ahmad Ghamidi Subject Matter The surah opens with various oaths that extend up to the 4th ayah. Unbelievers are warned by the fate of √Åd, Tham√∫d, and Pharaoh in ayaat 5th up to 13th.Muhammad Farooq-i-Azam Malik (translator), Al-Qur'an, the Guidance for Mankind - English with Arabic Text (Hardcover) Then the surah discusses that Man praises God in prosperity, but reproaches him in adversity in ayaat 14th to 17th. The discourse then denounces the oppression of the poor in ayaat 18th to 22nd. And approaching the end ayaat 23rd to 25th give the verdict that the wicked will vainly regret their evil deeds on the judgment-day, while ayaat 26th to the 30th gives the good news to the believing soul invited to the joys of Paradise.Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896) References Fajr People of the Quran Quran Prophets in Islam Islamic eschatology Tribes of Arabia Ramesses II Pharaohs ","title":"Al-Fajr (surah)"},{"id":"1351256","text":"Aziz Democratic Workers Congress is a political party and trade union in Sri Lanka.

Theme and subject matter According to an interpretation expounded on in the tafsƒ´r (commentary) written by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (d. 1979) entitled Tafhim al-Qur'an,Maududi, S., Tafhim al-Qur'an Its theme is to explain the true position of man in the world and of the world in relation to man and to tell that God has shown to man both the highways of good and evil, has also provided for him the means to judge and see and follow them, and now it rests upon mans own effort and judgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and reaches felicity or adopts the path of vice and meets with doom. First, the city of Makkah and the hardships being faced therein by Muhammad and the state of the children of Adam have been cited as a witness to the truth that this world is not a place of rest and ease for man, where he might have been born to enjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and struggle. If this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah An-Najm (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa: there is nothing for man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain that in this world the future of man depends on his toil and struggle, effort and striving. After this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all in this world and that there is no superior power to watch what he does and to call him to account, has been refuted. Then, taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance held by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what wrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for himself in the world. The person who for ostentation and display squanders heaps of wealth, not only himself prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire him for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is watching over his deeds, sees by what methods he obtained the wealth and in what ways and with what motives and intention he spent it. Then Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge and the faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before him both the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is man's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the abyss to scaling the cliff. Then, Allah has explained what the steep road is by following which man can ascend to the heights. It is that he should give up spending for ostentation, display and pride and should spend his wealth to help the orphans and the needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion and joining the company of believers should participate in the construction of a society which should fulfill the demands of virtue and righteousness patiently and should be compassionate to the people. The end of those who follow this way is that they would become worthy of Allah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those who follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which there is no escape. Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist, and leading intellectual of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, surmised the overall theme of Surat Al-Lail in the introduction to his extensive Quranic commentary, Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the shades of the Qur'an) by saying: > This short s≈´rah touches on a great many facts which are of central > importance to human life. Its style is characterized by powerful allusions. > Numerous facts of this nature are not easily combined in any form of concise > writing except that of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, with its unique ability to hit the right > chords with such swift and penetrating strokes. ‚ÄîSayid Qutb, Fi Zilal al- > Qur'an ReferencesExternal links Afterlife Islamic eschatology Balad Mecca ","title":"Al-Balad"},{"id":"1351271","text":"ash-Shams (, \\"The Sun\\") is the 91st sura of the Qur'an with 15 ayat. It opens with a series of solemn oaths sworn on various astronomical phenomena, the first of which, \\"by the sun\\", gives the sura its name, then on the human soul itself. It then describes the fate of Thamud, a formerly prosperous extinct Arab tribe. The prophet Saleh urged them to worship God alone, and commanded them in God's name to preserve a certain she-camel; they disobeyed and continued to reject his message, and God destroyed them all except those who had followed Salih. Name of the surah Jalaluddin Al-Suyuti co-author of the classical Sunni tafsƒ´r known as Tafsir al-Jalalayn suggests that some of the s≈´rahs have been named using incipits (i.e. the first few words of the surah). The Surah has been so designated after the word ash-shams with which it opens. Hamiduddin Farahi a celebrated Islamic scholar of Indian subcontinent is known for his groundbreaking work on the concept of Nazm, or Coherence, in the Quran. He writes that Some s≈´rahs have been given names after some conspicuous words used in them. Touched by an Angel: Tafseer Juz ‚ÄòAmma is an AlMaghrib Institute Tafsir course which further investigates that the sun (ash-shams) is mentioned in several surahs; the reason why is this one called Surah Shams is because, in it, the sun is mentioned four times..

Period of revelation S≈´rat ash-Shams is a Meccan surah.List of surahs in the Quran Meccan suras are chronologically earlier surahs that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short ayat, and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an‚Äôs 114 surahs. Most of the surahs containing muqatta øat are Meccan. In his book The Cor√¢n, William Muir classifies ash-Shams in a Quranic sub-category known as the Soliloquies - a literary form of discourse in which Muhammad talks to himself or reveals his thoughts without addressing a listener. However, Sale argues that this s≈´rah seems to be ruled out of that category by the change in style of ƒÅyƒÅt.Muir, W., The Cor√¢n (1920) Tham√∫d. See notes on chaps. vii. 74-80, and liv. 19 seq.The uretch. Kid√°r Ibn Sal√≠f. See chaps. vii. 78, and liv. 29, notes. Theme and subject matter The archaeological vestiges of Mada'in Saleh are often compared with those of Petra, the Nabatean capital situated northwest of Mada'in Saleh.\\"ICOMOS Evaluation of Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Mad√¢in S√¢lih) World Heritage Nomination\\". World Heritage Center. Retrieved 2009-09-16. In view of the subject matter this Surah consists of two parts. The first part consists of vv. 1-10, and the second of vv. 11-15. According to an account from the book A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, translated by George Sale, Principal Subjects of verses 1-10 is \\"Oaths that man‚Äôs happiness and misery depends on the purity or corruption he hath wrought in it\\" and \\"Tham√∫d destroyed for rejecting their prophet\\" in verses 11-15.Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896) Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and was seen as a controversial intellectual due to his justification of violence against civilians, surmised the overall theme of Surat Al-Lail in the introduction to his extensive Quranic commentary, Fi Zilal al-Quran by saying: Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (b. 1951), a well-known Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar and exegete, and educationist, surmised the overall theme of Surah Shams as The leaders of the Quraysh have been warned, on the basis of the law of retribution, about their rebellious and arrogant attitude towards the Prophetic mission. And his analysis of subject says: The Theme of Surah ash- Shams presented in Malik Al-Qur'an Translation coincides with Javed Ahmad Ghamidi's theme and overlaps with thematic analysis of Sayyid Maududi which says: And that its theme is to distinguish the good from the evil and to warn the people, who were refusing to understand this distinction and insisting on following the evil way, of the evil end. However Malik argues that Major Issue, Divine Law and Guidance in this surah is that \\"Success depends on keeping the soul pure and failure depends on corrupting it, people of Thamud were leveled to the ground for that very reason.\\"http://www.alim.org/library/quran/surah/introduction/91/MAL Q91:1-10 Good and evil The first part deals with three things:-: 1-That just as the sun and the moon, the day and the night, the earth and the sky, are different from each other and contradictory in their effects and results, so are the good and the evil different front each other and contradictory in their effects and results; they are neither alike in their outward appearance nor can they be alike in their results. 2-That God after giving the human self powers of the body, sense and mind has not left it uninformed in the world, but has instilled into his unconscious by means of a natural inspiration the distinction between good and evil, right and wrong, and the sense of the good to be good and of the evil to be evil. 3-That the future of man depends on how by using the powers of discrimination, will and judgement that Allah has endowed him with, he develops the good and suppresses the evil tendencies of the self. If he develops the good inclination and frees his self of the evil inclinations, he will attain to eternal success, and if, on the contrary, he suppresses the good and promotes the evil, he will meet with disappointment and failure. Sahl al-Tustari (d. 896), a Sufi and scholar of the Qur'an, mentions, \\"By the day when it reveals her [the sun],He said:This means: the light of faith removes the darkness of ignorance and extinguishes the flames of the Fire.Al-Tustari, Tafsir. (2010), [date accessed 20/02/2013]. Q91:11-15 Historical precedent of the people of Thamud  In the second part citing the historical precedent of the people of Thamud the significance of prophethood has been brought out. A messenger is raised in the world, because the inspirational knowledge of good and evil that Allah has placed in human nature, is by itself not enough for the guidance of man, but on account of his failure to understand it fully man has been proposing wrong criteria and theories of good and evil and thus going astray. That is why Allah sent down clear and definite revelation to the prophets to augment man's natural inspiration so that they may expound to the people as to what is good and what is evil. Likewise, the prophet Saleh was sent to the people of Thamud, but the people overwhelmed by the evil of their self, had become so rebellious that they rejected him. And when he presented before them the miracle of the She- Camel of God, as demanded by themselves, the most wretched one of them, in spite of his warning, hamstrung it, in accordance with the will and desire of the people. Consequently, the entire tribe was overtaken by a disaster. AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l (occasions or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. Most of the mufassir≈´n say that this surah was revealed at Mecca, at a stage when opposition to Muhammad had grown very strong and intense. Special traits of S≈´rat ash-Shams Muhammad is reported to have said that the reward of reciting this surah is compared to the things upon which the sun and the moon shine. The Shi'i Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 748) said that the person who recites the suwar ash-Shams, al-Lail, adh-Dhuha and al- Inshirah will, on the Day of Judgement, find all creatures of the earth testifying on his behalf and Allah will accept their testimony and give him a place in Jannah (Paradise).Fawaid-e-Quran, Chapter on Benefits of Recitation of the Chapters of the Holy Qur‚Äôan Ahadith about Surah ash-Shams \`Abd Allah ibn \`Umar (c. 614 ‚Äì 693) narrated that while Muhammad was passing by Thamud's houses on his way to the Battle of Tabouk, he stopped together with the people there. The people fetched water from the wells from which the people of Thamud used to drink. They prepared their dough (for baking) and filled their water skins from it (the water from the wells). Muhammad ordered them to empty the water skins and give the prepared dough to the camels. Then he went away with them until they stopped at the well from which the she-camel (of Salih) used to drink.Stories of The Prophets, Ibn Kathir, page. 110 He warned them against entering upon the people that had been punished, saying \\"Do not enter the house of those who were unjust to themselves, unless (you enter) weeping, lest you should suffer the same punishment as was inflicted upon them.\\" Narrated Jabir ibn Abd-Allah: Muadh ibn Jabal used to pray with the Prophet and then go to lead his people in prayer. Once he led the people in prayer and recited Al-Baqara. A man left (the row of the praying people) and offered (light) prayer (separately) and went away. When Mu'adh came to kNow about it, he said. \\"He (that man) is a hypocrite.\\" Later that man heard what Mu'adh said about him, so he came to the Prophet and said, \\"O Allah's Apostle! We are people who work with our own hands and irrigate (our farms) with our camels. Last night Mu'adh led us in the (night) prayer and he recited Sura-al-Baqara, so I offered my prayer separately, and because of that, he accused me of being a hypocrite.\\" The Prophet called Mu'adh and said thrice, \\"O Mu'adh! You are putting the people to trials? Recite 'Wash-shamsi wad- uhaha' (91) or'Sabbih isma Rabbi ka-l-A'la' (87) or the like.\\" (Book #73, Hadith #127)Sahih al-Bukhari, http://www.quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/008.073.127.html Narrated Jabir ibn Abd-Allah: Once a man was driving two Nadihas (camels used for agricultural purposes) and night had fallen. He found Mu'adh praying so he made his camel kneel and joined Mu'adh in the prayer. the latter recited Surat 'AlBaqara\\" or Surat \\"An-Nisa\\", (so) the man left the prayer and went away. When he came to know that Mu'adh had criticized him, he went to the Prophet, and complained against Mu'adh. the Prophet said thrice, \\"O Mu'adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?\\" It would have been better if you had recited \\"Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-a-la (87)\\", Wash-Shamsi wadu-haha (91)\\", or \\"Wal-laili Idha yaghsha (92)\\", for the old, the weak and the needy pray behind you.\\" Jabir said that Mu'adh recited Sura Al-Baqara in the 'Isha' prayer.

This s≈´rah is one of the first ten to be revealed in Mecca. It contrasts two types of people, the charitable and the miserly, and describes each of their characteristics. Date of the revelations Masjid al-Haram, Mecca at night S≈´rah Al-Lail is a Meccan sura, and was among the first ten surahs to be revealed. Meccan surahs are chronologically earlier surahs that were revealed to the prophet Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short ayat, and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an‚Äôs 114 s≈´war. Most of the surahs containing muqatta'at are Meccan. According to Yusuf Ali, Al-Lail may be placed in the dating period close to Surat Al-Fajr and Ad-Dhuha (93). It is similar in subject matter to the chapter preceding it, Ash-Shams (91). Theme and subject matter The mufassir≈´n (Quranic commentators) note a similarity that in all of the aforementioned three suras the wonder and contrast between night and day are appealed to for the consolation of man in his spiritual yearning. According to an interpretation expounded on in the tafsƒ´r (commentary) written by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (d. 1979) entitled Tafhim al-Qur'an, the primary theme of Surat al-Lail is distinguishing between two different ways of life and explaining the contrast between their ultimate ends and results.Maududi, S., Tafhim al-Qur'an Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist, and leading intellectual of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, surmised the overall theme of Surat Al-Lail in the introduction to his extensive Quranic commentary, Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the shades of the Qur'an) by saying: > Within a framework of scenes taken from the universe and the realm of human > nature, this surah states emphatically the basic facts of action and reward. > This issue had diverse aspects‚Ä¶ The end in the hereafter is also varied, > according to the type of action and the direction taken in this life‚Ä¶ The > subject matter of the surah, i.e., action and reward, is by nature double > directional, so the framework chosen for it at the beginning of the surah is > of dual coloring. It is based on contrasting aspects in the creation of man > and the universe. ‚ÄîSayid Qutb, Fi Zilal al-Qur'an According to an account from the book A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, translated by George Sale, Jalal ad-Din as-Suy≈´ti ‚Äì co-author of the classical Sunni tafsƒ´r known as Tafsir al-Jalalayn - had speculated that this whole description belongs peculiarly to Abu Bakr; for when he had purchased Bilal ibn Rabah, the Ethiopian (afterwards Muhammad‚Äôs muadhdhin, or crier to prayers), who had been put to the rack on account of his faith, the infidels said he did it only out of a view of interest; upon which this passage was revealed. However, the style and language of this chapter are against this explanation. It is best, therefore, to regard the whole as addressed to Muhammad‚Äôs hearers generally. In his book The Cor√¢n, William Muir classifies Al-Lail in a Quranic sub-category known as the Soliloquies - a literary form of discourse in which Muhammad talks to himself or reveals his thoughts without addressing a listener.Muir, W., The Cor√¢n (1920) However, Sale argues that this s≈´rah seems to be ruled out of that category by the statements of ƒÅyƒÅt 14 where Muhammad appears as a warner, and therefore is entered upon his public ministry. Regarding subject matter, Sayyid Maududi suggests this surah can generally be divided into two parts, the first consisting of ƒÅyƒÅt 1 through 11, and the second of ƒÅyƒÅt 12 through 21. Q92:1‚Äì11 By night and Day Allah begins this chapter by swearing a series of oaths: by the night when it envelops the world, by the day when it illuminates and, finally by Himself who has created the male and female (92:1-3). Evidence of these three things are invoked (night, day and gender) to illustrate how the aims and activities engaged in by both individuals and nations, are, in respect to their moral nature, widely divergent. Verse 92:3 literally means, \\"Consider that which has created [or \\"creates\\"] the male and the female\\", i.e., the elements which are responsible for the differentiation between male and female. This, together with the symbolism of night and day, darkness and light, is an allusion - similar to the first ten verses of the preceding surah (Ash-Shams) - to the polarity evident in all nature and, hence, to the dichotomy (spoken of in the next verse) which characterizes man‚Äôs aims and motives. Following a style common to the brief chapters, three opposing moral characteristics are presented as illustrations, providing a means from which mankind may judge which of the two lifestyles is being represented. 92:1 ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸëŸäŸíŸÑŸê ÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ŸäŸéÿ∫Ÿíÿ¥ŸéŸâ : Wa-(a)l-laili 'idhƒÅ yaghshƒÅ : By the night as it envelops 92:2 ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëŸáŸéÿßÿ±Ÿê ÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿ™Ÿéÿ¨ŸéŸÑŸéŸëŸâ : Wa-(a)n-nahƒÅri 'idhƒÅ tajallƒÅ : By the day as it appears 92:3 ŸàŸéŸÖŸéÿß ÿÆŸéŸÑŸéŸÇŸé ÿßŸÑÿ∞ŸéŸëŸÉŸéÿ±Ÿé ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸíÿ£ŸèŸÜÿ´ŸéŸâ : Wa mƒÅ khalaqa-(a)dh-dhakara wa-(a)l-‚ÄòunthƒÅ : And (by)he who created the male and female Traits characterizing the first type of individuals are distinguished here by three signs: (1) sacrificing their wealth: (2) adopting taqwa (God-consciousness): and (3) recognizing and supporting all that is morally correct (wa ≈üaddaqa bi-(a)l-ƒ•usnƒÅ). The second character type ‚Äì described in verses 8 through 10 - are also distinguished by three signs: they are miserly and do not give of their wealth; they are arrogant and think themselves independent of Allah‚Äôs Will (92:8); and (3) knowingly dishonoring Truth out of spite, or seeing ugliness where there is beauty. Then, it is stated that these two modes of action, which are clearly divergent, cannot be equal and alike in respect to results, i.e., just as they are divergent in their nature, so they are divergent in their results. > Narrated ‚ÄôAlƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib: We were in the company of the Prophet in a > funeral procession at Baqi Al-Gharqad. He said, \\"There is none of you but > has his place written for him in Paradise or in the Hell-Fire.\\" They said, > \\"O Allah's Apostle! Shall we depend (on this fact and give up work)?\\" He > said, \\"Carry on doing (good deeds), for every body will find it easy to do > (what will lead him to his destined place).\\" Then he recited: 'As for him > who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah, and believes in the Best > reward from Allah (i.e. Allah will compensate him for what he will spend in > Allah's way). So, We will make smooth for him the path of ease. But he who > is a greedy miser... for him, the path for evil.' (92.5-10)Bukhari, In verse 7, humans are told if they strive their utmost towards Allah, that He will provide every help and satisfaction to a ‚Äústate of ease‚Äù (li-l-yusrƒÅ). People adopting the first mode of action are promised by AllƒÅh that He will make correct behavior easy for them, to such an extent that doing good becomes easy and doing evil difficult. On the contrary, those adopting the second mode of life, AllƒÅh will make their path difficult in this world and in the Hereafter. Consequently, performing evil actions will become easy, while doing good becomes increasingly difficult. Ibn Kathir further extrapalated on this concept: > It is a frequently repeated subject of the Quran that every good deed is > recompensed, and that one who intends to do good deeds is given the > opportunity to do it, and anyone who intends to do evil deeds is led to it. > There are many a·∏•adith that support this assertion. Once Abu Bakr asked the > Prophet, ‚ÄúAre our deeds foreordained or originated by us?‚Äù The Prophet said, > ‚ÄúThey are rather foreordained.‚Äù Abu Bakr said, ‚ÄúThen what is the use of our > efforts.‚Äù The Prophet then said, ‚ÄúEach proceeds easily towards that for > which he was created.‚Äù ‚ÄîIbn Kathir, Tafsƒ´r Ibn Kathir Thus, the first part of the surah ends having made clear that there are only two ways for all mankind in all times and places. All humanity is in two parties under two headings however numerous are their colors and forms. Q92:12‚Äì21 Three truths stated In the next part of this s≈´rah, another three truths are stated. First, verse 12 says that AllƒÅh has not left man uninformed in the world, but has assumed responsibility for clearly showing humanity the halal (lawful) and haram (unlawful). Another interpretation given to verse 12 is that ‚Äì ‚ÄòWhoever takes the path of guidance will reach Us.‚ÄôIsmail Ibn Kathir, Tafsir Ibn Kathir, p.97 92:12 ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸë ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸÜŸéÿß ŸÑŸéŸÑŸíŸáŸèÿØŸéŸâ : Inna ‚ÄòalainƒÅ la-(a)l-hudƒÅ : Lo! Ours it is (to give) the guidance Regarding this same verse, Qatada ibn al-Nu'man said - Truly, on Us is (to give) guidance - 'This means, We will explain what is lawful and what is prohibited.'At-Tabari 24:477 Others have said that it means, \\"Whoever traverses upon the path of guidance, then he will reach Allah (i.e., in the Hereafter). They consider this ayat like Allah‚Äôs saying: \\"And upon Allah is the responsibility to explain the Straight path.\\" This has been mentioned by Ibn Jarir.At-Tabari 24:477 92:13 ŸàŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸë ŸÑŸéŸÜŸéÿß ŸÑŸéŸÑŸíÿ¢ÿÆŸêÿ±Ÿéÿ©Ÿé ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸíÿ£ŸèŸàŸÑŸéŸâ : Wa ‚Äòinna lanƒÅ la-l-‚ÄòƒÅkhirata wa-l-‚Äò≈´lƒÅ : And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world) Second, verse 13 contends that AllƒÅh alone is the master of both this world and the Hereafter. If an individual seeks worldly goods, only AllƒÅh controls whether or not it will be received. Likewise, for those seeking the Hereafter, once again it is AllƒÅh who will provide. Now, it is up to the individual to decide what should be sought. The third truth is that the wretched ones (‚Äòilla-l-‚ÄòashqƒÅ) who rejected the truth when Muhammad invited them to Islam, have a blazing fire awaiting them (nƒÅran tala≈∫≈∫a, or ‚Äúa flaming fire‚Äù). The term used for them in verse 15 is ‚ÄòashqƒÅ (superlative degree). Ibn Kathir includes a hadith related to this type of person: Ahmad ibn Hanbal reported Muhammad as saying ‚ÄúOnly wretched people will go to Hell.‚Äù When asked, ‚ÄúWho is the wretched,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúOne who disobeys and does not refrain from evil out of fear of Allah.‚Äù Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that Muhammad said: ‚ÄúAll of my followers will enter Paradise on the Day of Judgement except for whoever refuses.‚Äù They (the Companions) said, ‚ÄúWho would refuse, O Messenger of Allah,‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhoever obeyes me, he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me, then he has refused.‚ÄùAhmad 2:361Fath Al- Bari 13:263 92:18 ÿßŸÑŸéŸëÿ∞ŸêŸâ ŸäŸèÿ§Ÿíÿ™ŸêŸâ ŸÖŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸáŸè ŸäŸéÿ™Ÿéÿ≤ŸéŸÉŸéŸëŸâ : Alladhƒ´ yu‚Äôtƒ´ mƒÅla-h≈´ yatazakkƒÅ : Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification The spending may be for charity, or for good works, such as advancing the cause of knowledge or science, or supporting ideals. ‚ÄúWealth‚Äù (mƒÅl) must be understood not only for money or material goods, but also any advantage or opportunity which a man happens to enjoy, and which he can place at the service of others. The Arabic root word zakƒÅ implies both increase and purification, and both meanings may be understood to be implied here. The word tazkiyah is the transitive verbal noun (masdar) of zakƒÅ. Islahi defines it as, purification of something from adulterants, its growth and development to bring it to the height of its perfection. The word zakƒÅt (the obligatory alms) also comes from this same root. Al-AsfahƒÅni states that it is called zakƒÅt because the person who gives it hopes for blessings or he hopes to purify his soul or for both of these aspects.Al-RƒÅghib Al-AsfahƒÅni, MufradƒÅt AlfƒÅdh al-Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, Damascus, DƒÅr al-Qalam (1977) p.381 Yusuf Ali adds that wealth (understood both literally and metaphorically) is not for selfish enjoyment or idle show. It is held on trust and may be a trial in itself.Yusuf Ali, The Holy Quran The root sidq has several derivatives. The verb saddaqa with respect to statements means to accept and realize. The verb tasaddaqa with respect to funds means gave away, realizing his faith by action. And the verb asdaqa means to give dowry in marriage to women. The meaning of sadaqah is derived from the root sidq because sadaqah implies giving away goods and funds for the sake of Allah in expression of faithfulness and in realization of the belief in resurrection and afterlife.Ahkam al-Qur‚Äôan part 2, p.946, with commentary by al-Bijawi It is for that reason that Qur'an associated giving with affirmation of faith and withholding with rejection of faith; Allah says; ‚ÄúSo he who gives in charity and fears Allah and in all sincerity testifies to the best, we will indeed make smooth for him the path to bliss, but who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient and gives lies to the best we will indeed make smooth for him the path to misery.‚Äù Sadaqah is thus an indication of truthfullness in faith and sincere belief in the day of Judgement. Accordingly, the Messenger of Allah said sadaqah is a proof (or evidence). (Reported by Muslim) 92:20 ÿ•ŸêŸÑÿßŸéŸë ÿßÿ®Ÿíÿ™Ÿêÿ∫Ÿéÿ¢ÿ°Ÿé ŸàŸéÿ¨ŸíŸáŸê ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸëŸáŸê ÿßŸÑÿßŸåŸëÿπŸíŸÑŸéŸâ : Illa-btighƒÅ‚Äôa wajhi Rabbi- hi-l-‚ÄòA‚ÄôlƒÅ : But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord, Most High 92:21 ŸàŸéŸÑŸéÿ≥ŸéŸàŸíŸÅŸé ŸäŸéÿ±Ÿíÿ∂ŸéŸâ : Wa-la-sawfa yarƒëƒÅ : He verily will be content As for the God-fearing person who spends their wealth in a good cause ‚Äúfor increase in self-purification‚Äù, without any selfish motive, only desiring the ‚ÄúFace of their Lord Most High‚Äù, Allah will be pleased with him and he will be satisfied (wa-la-sawfa yarƒëƒÅ). This ‚ÄúFace‚Äù or ‚ÄúCountenance‚Äù (wajh) implies good pleasure or approval; but it also implies something more. It also means the Cause, - either the ‚Äúfinal cause‚Äù or the ‚Äúefficient cause‚Äù of Aristotelian philosophy. For the atqƒÅ (righteous one with taqwa) would refer everything backwards in origin and forwards in destiny, to Allah. Allah is the source of their goodness, as well as its goal or purpose. ÿ¶€ï⁄Ø€ïÿ±€é Ÿáÿßÿ™ŸÜ€ï ÿÆŸàÿßÿ±€é  AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l ( or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbƒÅb is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. Most of the mufassir≈´n say that verses 17 through 21 were revealed about Abu Bakr Siddiq (r. 632-34). Some claim a consensus on this, although the statements are general. Ibn Kathir states that Abu Bakr had a special status among the Sahaba (companions of Muhammad). He helped all the people who sought his help and he was well known for this. On the eve of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE), when Abu Bakr showed his anger and chastised Urwa bin Masud, chief of the Thaqif tribe. Urwa told him, \\"Had I not been under an obligation to you, I would have answered you of the same king.‚ÄùIbn Kathir, p.88 Special traits of Surat Al-Lail Many ahadith have been related concerning the spiritual benefits associated with Surat Al-Lail. Muhammad is reported to have said that the reward of reciting this surah is so much that the one who recites it will be pleased when he sees it in his Book of Deeds. His inspiration of good deeds (tawfiq) will also increase. If recited 15 times before sleeping, one will dream about what pleases him most. Reciting it in the I‚Äôsha salƒÅt, carries the reward of completing a quarter of the Qur'an and is guaranteed that the prayers are accepted. The sixth Shia ImƒÅm, Ja‚Äôfar as-SƒÅdiq (d. 748) has said that the person who recites S≈´rah Ash-Shams, Al-Lail, Ad-Dhuha and Al-Inshirah will, on the Day of Judgement, find all creatures of the earth testifying on his behalf and Allah will accept their testimony and give him a place in Jannah (Paradise). Recitation of this s≈´rah also leads to an increase in sustenance, courage and popularity amongst the people.Fawaid-e-Quran, Chapter on Benefits of Recitation of the Chapters of the Holy Qur‚Äôan Surat Al-Lail and the Imamate The Shiite perspective on certain verses in Surat Al-Lail is mentioned in the book, Imamate and Leadership by Mujtaba Musavi Lari.The Online Books Page: Imamate and Leadership: by Mujtaba Musavi Lari et al. According to Shiite Muslims, the task of the Imam is guiding men and demonstrating to them the path that will lead them to happiness. That being the case, the only right path for selecting the Imam is the same as that which the Qur'an spells out for the prophets: ‚ÄúIt is indeed incumbent on Us to guide mankind, for the kingdom of this world and the hereafter is Ours.‚Äù (92:11-12) Thus, just as Muhammad is appointed from AllƒÅh, the Qur'anic verses point to the fact that appointment of the ImƒÅm also is from AllƒÅh as the ImƒÅm's appointment is primarily concerned with the covenant of AllƒÅh as well as with the function of guiding people to the right path. In this context Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAlƒ´ al- ·∏§usayn ibn ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ (d. 1037) says: NotesReferences *Ismail Ibn Kathir, , Darussalam Publishers, Riyadh (1977) *Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an.

Quran 93 takes its Arabic name from a·∏ç-du·∏•ƒÅ, the very first word. Although there is some debate amongst scholars, this sura is often considered to be the second revealed to Muhammad. After the first sura (al-Alaq) was received, there was a period of silence in which no further messages were revealed. During this time, the new Prophet wondered if he had somehow displeased Almighty Allah, who it seemed for a while was no longer sending down His message. This sura broke that silence, and reassured Muhammad that all will be understood in time. The image of the morning (ad-Dhuha) is the first word of the sura, and can be understood as symbolizing Muhammad's \\"new day\\" as the Messenger of God, as well as the \\"dawn\\" of the new way of life that would become Islam. After this sura, the visitations of Gabriel with the words of the Qur'an would come to Muhammad regularly until his death. Because of subject matter, length, style, and placement in the Qur'an, this sura is often coupled with Sura Al-Inshirah. They are generally considered to have been revealed around the same time. Period of revelation Its subject matter clearly indicates that it belongs to the earliest period at Makkah.Quran Verses in Chronological Order Traditions also show that the revelations were suspended for a time, which caused Muhammad to be deeply distressed and grieved. On this account He felt very anxious that perhaps He had committed some error because of which His Lord had become angry with Him and had forsaken Him. Thereupon He was given the consolation that revelation had not been stopped because of some displeasure but this was necessitated by the same expediency as underlies the peace and stillness of the night after the bright day, as if to say: \\"If you had continuously been exposed to the intensely bright light of Revelation (Wahy) your nerves could not have endured it. Therefore, an interval was given in order to afford you peace and tranquility.\\" This state was experienced by Muhammad in the initial stage of the Prophethood when he was not yet accustomed to hear the intensity of Revelation. On this basis, observance of a pause in between was necessary. This we have already explained in the introduction to Surah Al-Muddathir; and in E. N. 5 of Surah Al-Muzzammil also we have explained what great burden of the coming down of Revelation he had to bear. Later, when Muhammad developed the power to bear this burden, there was no longer any need for long gaps. Theme and subject matter The Surat's theme is to console Muhammad and its object to remove his anxiety and distress, which he had been caused by the suspension of Revelation. First of all, swearing an oath by the bright morning and the stillness of night, he has been reassured, so as to say: \\"Your Lord has not at all forsaken you, nor is he displeased with you.\\" Then, he has been given the good news that the hardships that he was experiencing in the initial stage of his mission, would not last long, for every later period of life for him would be better than the former period, and before long Allah would bless him so abundantly that he would be well pleased. This is one of the express prophecies of the Quran, which proved literally true, afterwards, whereas when this prophecy was made there seemed not to be the remotest chance that the helpless and powerless man who had come out to wage a war against the ignorance and paganism of the entire nation, would ever achieve such wonderful success. Then, addressing Muhammad, Allah says:\\"O My dear Prophet, what has caused you the anxiety and distress that your Lord has forsaken you, and that We are displeased with you? Whereas the fact is that We have been good to you with kindness after kindness ever since the day of your birth. You were born an orphan, We made the best arrangement for your upbringing and care: you were unaware of the Way, We showed you the Way; you were indigent, We made you rich. All this shows that you have been favored by Us from the very beginning and Our grace and bounty has been constantly focused on you.\\"Here, one should also keep in view vv. 37-42 of Surah Ta Ha, where Allah, while sending the Prophet Moses to confront a tyrant like Pharaoh, encouraged and consoled him, saying: \\"We have been looking after you with kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you should be satisfied that you will not be left alone in this dreadful mission. Our bounty will constantly be with you.\\" In conclusion, Allah has instructed Muhammad telling him how he should treat the creatures of Allah to repay for the favors He has done him and how he should render thanks for the blessings He has bestowed on him. Layout of this surah The Sura Begins with Oaths. It then asks to reflect and prepares the reader for the ultimate lesson that is about to come. And then The Ultimate lesson in this surah is; Allah gives favours to His Messenger i.e. Duha, Al-Inshirah, and Al-Kawthar. To conclude ‚Äì Allah will tell what the Messenger of Allah should do to show gratefulness for all the favours and how his followers can follow his example of gratefulness.

According to Abdullah bin Abbas, it was sent down in Makkah just after wad- Duha. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l), it is an earlier \\"Meccan surah\\", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina. It is typically assumed that this sura is referring to the early days of Muhammad's prophethood, when he would have been unsure about how his people would receive him. Because of subject matter, length, style, and placement in the Qur'an, this sura is often coupled with Surah ad-Dhuha. They are generally considered to have been revealed around the same time.  Summary  A map of Mecca, circa 1790. Sura Ash-Sharhh was revealed in Mecca, around 611 CE. The passage asks the reader, who is Muhammad specifically, if God has been a comfort and a remover of obstacles. Whatever personal sorrows this may bring to mind, \\"Surely, with each difficulty there is ease\\". This may indeed be the key phrase of this sura; it is repeated in lines 5 and 6. Conversely, the reader is asked to continue their work diligently, even when it grows simple again - for God, Himself is what you are working for. Theme and subject matter The aim and object of this Surah too are to console and encourage Muhammad. Before his call, he never had to encounter the conditions which he suddenly had to encounter after it, when he embarked on his mission of inviting the people to Islam. This was by itself a great revolution in his own life of which he had no idea in his life before prophethood. No sooner had he started preaching the message of Islam than the same society which had esteemed him with unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same relatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors, who used to treat him with the highest respect, began to shower him with abuse and invective. No one in Makkah was prepared to listen to him; he began to be ridiculed and mocked in the street and on the road, and at every step, he had to face new difficulties. Although gradually he became accustomed to the hardships, even much severer ones, yet the initial stage was very discouraging for him. That is why first Surah Ad-Duha was sent down to console him, and then this Surah. In it, at the outset, Allah says: \\"We have favored you, O Prophet, with three great blessings; therefore you have no cause to be disheartened. The first is the blessing of Sharh Sadr (opening up of the chest), the second of removing from you the heavy burden that was weighing down your back before the call, and the third of exalting your renown the like of which has never been granted to any man before.\\" Further below in the notes, we have explained what is implied by each of these blessings and how great and unique these blessings indeed are! After this, Allah has reassured Muhammad that the period of hardships which he is passing through, is not very long, but following close behind it, there is also a period of ease. This same thing has been described in Surah Ad-Duha, saying: \\"Every later period is better for you than the former period, and soon your Lord will give you so much that you will be well pleased.\\" The Surah also repeats the phrase \\"surely with hardship comes ease,\\" setting a precedent that appears throughout the Quran that any single difficulty faced by Muhammad or his followers would be rewarded twice over (or more).The Clear Quran, Mustafa Khattab 2016 In conclusion, Muhammad has been instructed, so as to say, \\"You can develop the power to bear and resist the hardships of the initial stage only by one means, and it is this: \`When you are free from your occupations, you should devote yourself to the labor and toil of worship, and turn all your attention exclusively to your Lord'.\\"This same instruction has been given to him in much greater detail in Surah Al-Muzzammil 1-9.

It was part of Union Army General Ambrose E. Burnside's North Carolina Expedition during the American Civil War. In late March, Major General Burnside‚Äôs army advanced on Fort Macon, a casemated masonry fort that commanded the channel to Beaufort, 35 miles (56 km) southeast of New Bern. The Union force invested the fort with siege works and on April 25 opened an accurate fire on the fort, soon breaching the masonry walls. Within a few hours the fort's scarp began to collapse, and in late afternoon the Confederate commander, Colonel Moses J. White, ordered the raising of a white flag. Burnside's terms of surrender were accepted, and the Federal troops took possession of the fort the next morning. Background Fort Macon was one of the Third System coastal forts that were built around the borders of the still-young United States following the War of 1812. It was built on the eastern end of Bogue Banks, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and was intended to defend the entrance to the ports of Beaufort and Morehead City. Begun in 1826, it was completed and received its first garrison in 1834. As it was intended for defense against attacking enemy naval forces, it was built of masonry. Gunfire from a rolling ship's deck was not accurate enough at that time to be able to break down brick and stone walls. Although the advent of rifled artillery would soon make its walls vulnerable, no alterations were made in the fort. It was a generation out of date when the Civil War came.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 133‚Äì134. After the first spate of enthusiasm, the fort was allowed to deteriorate. The woodwork rotted, the ironwork rusted, and gun carriages were allowed to decay. The garrison was steadily reduced in size, until by the time of the beginning of the Civil War the care of the fort was entrusted to a single sergeant.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 134. Browning, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, p. 35. When the fort was taken over by North Carolina troops under Captain Josiah Solomon Pender on April 14 (before the state had seceded from the Union), only four guns were mounted. The local military authorities immediately set about improving the armament. A total of 56 pieces (5 8-inch and 2 10-inch columbiads, 19 24-pounders, 32 32-pounders, and 6 field guns) were mounted, but they had ammunition for only three days of action.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 10, 135‚Äì136. Browning, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, p. 35, says that only 43 guns were mounted. Burnside says in his report that 54 were taken. ORA I, vol. 9, p. 275. At the time of the siege, the garrison of the fort numbered about 430 officers and men, commanded by Colonel Moses J. White. Sickness reduced this number by about a third. Despite the poor diet and other living conditions that they suffered, only one man died. Morale among the men was generally not good, as they were cut off from their families, and White was unpopular, both with his men and with the people of Beaufort. A few men deserted during the siege.ORA I, vol. 9, p. 293. Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 138. When battle came, the fort was outdated, inadequately armed, poorly supplied, and intended for a different form of combat than that it faced. These deficiencies are adequate to explain why the fort succumbed so readily at the first blow. Prelude alt=Bogue Banks is a long, narrow island extending from the left edge to past the middle of the chart. Fort Macon is at its eastern end. About two miles to the southeast is the western end of Shackleford Banks, which extends to the east southeast about seven miles. It is separated by a narrow inlet from Core Banks, which extends off the chart to the northeast. Behind these banks are the sounds, ranging in width from one to five miles. Carolina City, Morehead City, and Beaufort are sited on the sounds, all within 10 miles of Fort Macon. The Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad begins in Morehead City and runs off the map to the northwest. Shortly after the Union forces had taken possession of Hatteras Island on the Outer Banks, Brigadier General Ambrose E. Burnside developed a plan to expand Federal control of eastern North Carolina by a joint Army-Navy expedition. His plan was approved by General-in-Chief George B. McClellan and the War Department. He was given authority to recruit and organize a division, to be known as the Coast Division, which would work with the Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron to take control of the North Carolina Sounds and their adjacent cities. The expedition that came to be known by his name got under way in January 1862, and in early February had made its first conquest, Roanoke Island. Following that, the joint forces went on to other victories at Elizabeth City and New Bern (often spelled New Berne at the time). Most of the Confederate Army were forced away from the coast as far inland as Kinston by these battles. The major exception was the garrison of Fort Macon.Burnside, Battles and leaders, vol. 1, pp. 660‚Äì669. So long as Fort Macon remained in Confederate possession, Burnside (recently promoted to rank of major general) could not use the ports at Beaufort and Morehead City, so immediately following the capture of New Bern on March 14, he ordered Brigadier General John G. Parke, commander of his Third Brigade, to reduce the fort. Parke began by seizing the towns along the inner shore: Carolina City on March 21, Morehead City on March 22, Newport on March 23, and finally Beaufort on March 25. Communications between the garrison and other Confederate forces were thereby severed.Hawkins, Battles and leaders, vol. 1, pp. 652‚Äì653. Parke also had to repair a railroad bridge at Newport, burned by the retreating Confederates following the loss of New Bern; the railroad was needed for the transport of his siege artillery.ORA I, vol. 9, p. 277. Siege Map of Fort Macon Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On March 23, General Parke sent a message from his headquarters at Carolina City to Colonel White, demanding the surrender of the fort. He offered to release the men on parole if the fort was turned over intact. White replied tersely, \\"I have the honor to decline evacuating Fort Macon.\\" ORA I, v. 9, pp. 277, 278. Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 137. The siege can be regarded as starting with this exchange. The investment of the fort was not yet complete, but that was accomplished on March 29, when a company from Parke's brigade crossed the sound and landed unopposed on Bogue Banks. The Confederate infantry that would have defended against the landing, the 26th North Carolina, had been included in the retreat following the Battle of New Bern.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 135. Federal siege artillery followed, and Parke set up four batteries that would bear on the fort: four 8-inch (20.3 cm) mortars at a range of 1200 yards (1100 meters); four 10-inch (25.4 cm) mortars at a range of 1600 yards (1460 meters); three 30-pounder (13.6 kg) rifled Parrotts at a range of 1300 yards (1190 meters); and a 12-pounder (5.4 kg) boat howitzer at a range of 1200 yards (1100 meters).ORA I, vol. 9, p. 273, The batteries were moved up at night and remained hidden behind sand dunes until they were ready to open fire. The defenders were aware of these activities, but could not waste ammunition by firing at unseen targets. Patrols sent out from the fort to harass the Union soldiers were driven back, usually without loss. On April 17, General Burnside could state in his report to the War Department, \\"I hope to reduce the fort within ten days.\\"ORA I, vol. 9, p. 270. His prediction proved to be remarkably accurate. Preparations were completed by April 23, and on that day General Burnside communicated directly with Colonel White and repeated his demand for surrender, again offering to release the prisoners on parole.ORA I, vol. 9, p. 275. Colonel White once more refused, so Burnside on April 24 ordered General Parke to begin the bombardment as soon as possible. Parke waited until nightfall to open the embrasures for his guns behind the dunes. The bombardment began at dawn on April 25. At first, the gunners in the fort manned their pieces and replied vigorously, but they were unable to inflict damage on the Federal guns protected by the dunes.ORA I, v. 9, pp. 273‚Äì274. The defenders were also distracted by the appearance of four vessels from the Blockading Squadron: the steamers USS Daylight, State of Georgia, and Chippewa, and the bark Gemsbok. Until this time, the Navy had not been involved with the siege, but Commander Samuel Lockwood responded to the sound of gunfire and brought his section of the fleet into action. The weather was not good for a naval bombardment, however; a strong wind created waves that caused the vessels to rock badly enough to disrupt their aim, and after about an hour, the fleet withdrew. The Navy also supplied a pair of floating batteries to the attack, but again the waves interfered, and only one of them got into action. It is not certain whether the fort sustained any hits from the ships. The Confederate return fire was accurate enough to hit two vessels, doing little damage and slightly wounding only one man.ORN I, vol. 7, p. 279. The initial fire from the mortars on shore was inaccurate, but a Signal Corps officer in Beaufort, Lieutenant William J. Andrews, acting on his own responsibility, was able to deliver messages to the battery commanders telling them how to adjust their range. After noon, virtually all shots were on target.ORA I, vol. 9, pp. 291‚Äì292. Trotter, \`\`Ironclads and columbiads, p. 143. Nineteen guns were dismounted.ORA I, v. 9, pp. 288, 290. White in his report says that 15 were disabled, p. 294. The walls of the fort began to crumble under the continued pounding, and in mid-afternoon Colonel White began to fear that the magazine would be breached. At 4:30 p.m., he decided that the fort could no longer hold out, so he ordered that a white flag be raised. Firing on both sides then ceased.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 144‚Äì145. Colonel White met with General Parke to discuss terms, and Parke at first demanded unconditional surrender. White asked him for more favorable conditions, and referred to the terms that General Burnside had offered on March 23. Parke did not concede, but agreed not to renew the bombardment until he could consult with Burnside. Burnside reasoned that White could hold out at least one more day, and further action would only cause more casualties and greater damage to the fort. He therefore agreed to adhere to his first terms. The men in the fort were allowed to give their paroles, meaning that they would not take up arms against the United States until properly exchanged. They then were permitted to return to their homes, taking with them their personal property. Shortly after dawn on April 26, the Confederate flag was lowered, the defenders marched out, and Union soldiers of the 5th Rhode Island marched in.ORA I, vol. 9, p. 275. Hawkins, Battles and leaders, vol. 1, p. 654. Aftermath Fort Macon after the battle The battle had been relatively bloodless, at least by standards that soon would be common in the Civil War. On the Union side, only one man was killed, and two soldiers and one seaman were wounded. On the Confederate side, seven were killed outright, two died of wounds, and sixteen were wounded.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 145. Although the Burnside Expedition had gained notable success at little cost in North Carolina, little was done to exploit it. Wilmington, for example, would seem to have been vulnerable, but it was not attacked until the final days of the war. Burnside was recalled shortly after the victory at Fort Macon, to assist General George B. McClellan in the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia. No further major offensive actions took place, and North Carolina became a secondary theater until late in the war. The flag was returned to the State of North Carolina in 1906, in a Senate Chamber ceremony attended by veterans of the siege. The battle site is now Fort Macon State Park.

William Joyce won a 1999 Daytime Emmy for Best Production Design for this series.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_Daytime_Emmy_Awards The show has a vintage atmosphere, with futuristic elements. Synopsis The show focuses on the Polie Family, who live in a teapot-shaped house in a geometric world (Planet Polie) populated by robot-based characters. The stories revolve around a young robot named Olie learning life lessons and going on wacky adventures (either real or imaginative) while growing up. These often include his little sister Zowie, his inventor father, his hard-working mom, his fun-loving grandfather Pappy, and his dog Spot. Although most of the main cast is composed of circular bots, other characters are featured in other shapes, such as Olie's friend Billy Bevel and his family, who are square-shaped bots from Planet Cubey. Characters * Olie Polie - A robot boy and the show's main character. He is very friendly, inquisitive, and loves his family and friends. * Zowie Polie - Olie's younger sister, Gizmo's niece, Pappy's granddaughter and Percy and Polina's daughter.

She loves Olie and enjoys emulating him, sometimes to Olie's chagrin, too. Her name is actually pronounced like the name \\"Zoey\\" instead of like the word \\"zowie\\" (which rhymes with Howie). * Spot - Spot is Olie's faithful dog. As revealed in the episode But Why?, he was given his name because he left a \\"spot\\" on the carpet as a puppy. * Mr. Percy Polie - Olie and Zowie's father and Pappy's younger son.

It emerged as an agreement between the four carmakers in October 1978 to reduce development costs on new top-of-the-range saloons, although it would be another six to nine years before the cars were launched. It was front-wheel drive, with optional four-wheel drive, and used a 4-wheel independent MacPherson strut suspension, except on the Saab. The Saab and Lancia versions were the first cars to be launched in 1984, with the Fiat debuting a year later, and the line-up being completed in 1987 with the arrival of the Alfa Romeo. The Fiat and Lancia looked much like the Saab, but the Alfa Romeo only shared the chassis. The wheelbase is 2.67 m (105 inches) on all models. The Saab and Fiat were launched as five-door hatchbacks and the Alfa Romeo and Lancia sold as four-door saloons. Lancia added the only Type Four estate in 1986 and Saab eventually added a saloon version of the 9000 in 1988. Because they were very similar, many parts can be exchanged between the four cars regardless of brand. For example, the doors from the Fiat Croma fit directly on the 9000. However, because Saab fitted heavier side impact protection they will not fit. The windshield from the Croma can also be used on the 9000. Likewise the wing mirrors off both the 9000 and the Thema are almost identical (9000 has a pressed recess on the mirror casing, Thema is without recess) and should fit both cars with the doors being similar. Because its platform was shared closely with three other cars, the Saab 9000's ignition key was situated on the steering column instead of between the front seats. Alfa Romeo differs most from other cars, it has for example an exclusive front suspension and has some chassis modifications. The Saab has a beam axle rear suspension, rather than the independent MacPherson found in all the other models. The front of the Saab is radically different from the Italian siblings due to the much improved crash protection.GP: Sveriges modernaste bil fyller 30 The Thema was the first of the Type Four models to be replaced when it was succeeded by the Kappa in 1994 - which made use of a new Type E-platform which also spawned the 164's successor, the Alfa Romeo 166, in 1996. The Croma was axed in 1996 without an immediate replacement, while the 9000 was replaced in 1997 by the 1998 9-5, which was based on the Opel-derived GM2900 platform also shared with its 900 and 9-3 siblings. The 164 was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 166 in 1998, signalling the end of the Type Four platform after 14 years in use. On the 6th episode in the 9th season of the British motoring program Top Gear, James May welded together the front halves of a Saab 9000 and Alfa Romeo 164 to make a stretch limousine. He said the two cars should be entirely compatible because they had the same wheelbase and floor pan. It was nicknamed the \\"Alfaab\\".

Learning that the Confederates were building ironclads at Norfolk, Burnside planned an expedition to destroy the Dismal Swamp Canal locks to prevent transfer of the ships to Albemarle Sound. He entrusted the operation to Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno's command, which embarked on transports from Roanoke Island on April 18. By midnight, the convoy reached Elizabeth City and began disembarking troops. On the morning of April 19, Reno marched north on the road to South Mills. At the crossroads a few miles below South Mills, elements of Col. Ambrose R. Wright's command delayed the Federals until dark. Reno abandoned the expedition and withdrew during the night to the transports at Elizabeth City. The transports carried Reno's troops to New Bern where they arrived on April 22.

In 1995/96 he was resident DJ at the Rex Club in Paris. He was influenced by trance music that he played during parties and wanted to create his own. In 1996 he met the other co-founders Steve Eli and Xavier de Galloy, house music producers with their own music studio. Together they decided to cooperate on a trance project and founded Talamasca. Dassulle currently operates it as a solo project. His stage name is inspired by the Rice character Lestat. Dassulle has worked with other psytrance artists, including Nomad, Oforia, Space Cat, and Xerox. In 1998, Talamasca also participated in founding the psytrance Label 3D Vision together with Christof Drouillet, DJ Mael and Javier Galloy. In 2004 Dassulle started his own label, Mind Control Records (also referencing Rice). Talamasca's album Zodiac was released in 2003.

(TMMC) is a Canada-based automotive manufacturer. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation under its Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America subsidiary division. TMMC currently operates two plants in Cambridge, Ontario, and another in Woodstock, Ontario. The current President of TMMC is Canadian Frank Voss, replacing previous President Fred Volf. The plant currently produces the Lexus RX, and Toyota RAV4 vehicles. History TMMC has been in operation since 1988. TMMC is composed of three different plants ‚Äî North, West and South, each building a different vehicle. The plants adhere to the Toyota manufacturing process known as the Toyota Production System or TPS. In the first year TMMC opened, 153 vehicles were built. Today, the three plants that make up TMMC have the ability to build over 600,000 vehicles annually. That puts Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in the number 2 position of all global Toyota manufacturing plants. TMMC employs over 9,000 people. The Cambridge plant opened in 1988, and has been expanded twice since. This was Toyota's second car-assembly plant in North America, after the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky plant in Georgetown, Kentucky which opened in 1987, and the first Toyota assembly plant in Canada. The Cambridge plant in its current configuration covers in space on and the Woodstock plant covers in space on . The Woodstock plant opened in 2008, and is now in full production of Toyota's RAV4. The location was picked due to its educated workforce, proximity to the Cambridge plant, and being adjacent to the major transportation corridors, Highway 401 and Highway 403. TMMC is the first plant outside Japan to produce a Lexus brand vehicle. It is also the first Toyota plant in North America and the only automotive manufacturer in Canada to assemble both advanced technology hybrid (Lexus RX 450h) and electric (Toyota RAV4 EV) vehicles. On March 28, 2012, TMMC announced that would be invested in the Woodstock plant to increase production by 50,000 vehicles a year to a new total of 200,000 vehicles per year. This created 400 new jobs at the plant. On July 24, 2012, Toyota also created 400 new jobs at the Cambridge plant to handle increased production of Lexus RX line in two years to 104,000 vehicles. In April 2015, Toyota announced it would be moving production of the Corolla to a new plant in Mexico, and will expand RAV4 production to the Cambridge plant after 2019. Unionization efforts The CAW (now known as Unifor) has attempted several times to organize TMMC.CAW aims for Toyota - Autonet.ca TMMC Assistant General Manager and spokesman Greig Mordue stated \\"Our team members will decide whether or not a union best reflects their interest... At this point in time, we don't think they have anything to gain from a union\\", and described the defeat of the CAW drive saying \\"Our team members have recognized that a third party represents a complication they don't need.\\" Despite this, however, the CAW supported Mordue as the (unsuccessful) Liberal candidate in the 2006 federal election instead of endorsing the NDP's Zoe Kunschner.Toyota angle didn't help Oxford's Mordue  The Record.com Team Members have cited poor health and safety conditions as a major reason for seeking union representation.http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2013/12/12/toyota-workers-may-be- on-verge-of-joining-unifor/ In August 2014, Unifor announced it was withdrawing an application with the Ontario Labour Relations Board to become the bargaining agent for Toyota employees, and called off a vote to unionize the Woodstock and Cambridge plants. Awards Since 2005, TMMC has been named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers for 11 consecutive years by Mediacorp Canada Inc. and has been featured in Maclean's news magazine.

Another rabbit warns them to evacuate by saying \\"Jiggers, fellers!\\". Soon, Porky and his dog meet this rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long, long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won the battle. However Porky finds the rabbit and he doesn't have any brainstorms to protect him. The rabbit shows Porky a photo of himself and of how many children he has with his wife. However, when Porky's about to shoot him, the gun fails. After Porky attempts to shoot down and procure the rabbit, he asks Porky: \\"Do you have a hunting license?\\" As Porky reaches for his pocket to obtain the document, the hyper-hare suddenly snatches it out of Porky's grasp, rips it in two, remarks, \\"Well you haven't got one now!\\" and makes a getaway by twisting his ears as though they were a helicopter propeller, flying away. But Porky suddenly throws a rock at the hovering hare which sends him crashing into a haystack. He emerges from the stack, appearing injured, but fakes it and then goes marching like one of the spirits of '76. Ultimately the rabbit wins when Porky throws dynamite into the cave in which the rabbit is hiding and he throws the dynamite back at him. Later, Porky is in the hospital and the rabbit comes to him with some flowers. Porky tells the rabbit that he'll be out in a few days. \\"That's what YOU think!\\", the rabbit declares, then pulls on the anvil in Porky's bed, adding to his injuries and runs off into the forest laughing. Production The rabbit's hyperactive personality and laugh provided by Mel Blanc predated the 1940 Walter Lantz/Universal Pictures release Knock Knock which starred Andy Panda and introduced cartoon audiences to Woody Woodpecker, who was created for the Lantz studio by Hardaway after his departure from the Leon Schlesinger/Warner Bros. studio. Music The incidental music heard throughout the piece are scored arrangements of \\"Bei Mir Bistu Shein\\", a popular song which was a hit for The Andrews Sisters around this time, and \\"Hooray for Hollywood,\\" from the contemporary motion picture Hollywood Hotel.

He was also a prominent art teacher, with many famous artists among his students. Biography He was born just outside Paris, and studied under his father Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury and under Paul Delaroche and L√©on Cogniet at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts) in Paris. His first painting at the Salon de Paris, in 1866, was a large historical canvas, titled Varsovie, Scene de l'Insurrection Polonaise, recalling the events of April 8, 1861 in Warsaw, when Russian troops quenched riots by force. In the following year, his \\"Old Women in the Place Navone, Rome\\" was purchased by the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. Robert-Fleury in his studio, from the Frick Collection In 1870, he painted a canvas of Le Dernier Jour de Corinthe (Last Day of Corinth), which depicted the last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the ancient Greek city, according to Livy. This painting was also purchased by the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, and is now on display at the Mus√©e d'Orsay. In 1880, he painted a ceiling for the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, representing \\"The Glorification of French Sculpture.\\" Robert-Fleury painted Pinel a la Salp√™tri√®re (1876), which depicts the famed Father of Modern Psychiatry among the inmates of the asylum. Philippe Pinel had been named chief doctor at the asylum in 1795, and had instituted more charitable and rational treatments. In 1875, Robert-Fleury painted Charlotte Corday at Caen, which shows the woman coming to the conclusion that Marat needed to be murdered. In 1882 he painted Vauban donnant le plan des fortifications de Belfort where the celebrated engineer is represented in Louis XIV costume reviewing maps and designs, while in the background laborers are building. Robert-Fleury taught as a professor for many years at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Robert-Fleury became president of the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais in succession to Bouguereau. He was honoured with Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1907. In 1908 he was elected president of the Taylor Foundation, a position he held until the end of his life. He acquired a great reputation and is renowned for his historical compositions, portraits and genre scenes; at his atelier he taught several well-known painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries from various countries, including Lovis Corinth, √âdouard Vuillard, Louise-C√©cile Descamps-Sabouret and Sir George Clausen.

History Seating area of the Arena Sferisterio An ancient Italian national sport or pallone col bracciale was the most popular sport in Italy for almost five centuries. This game dated back to the 15th century. The people of Macerata decided that they needed somewhere large to play and watch it; a place that could also be used for public spectacles such as circuses and even bull fights. One hundred citizens raised the money themselves, and got Ireneo Aleandri to design and build it. The design involved the destruction and rebuilding of some of the historic city walls next to the Porta Mercato gate. The strait side of the arena is a wall 18 metres high and 88 metres long, along which is a line of arches separated by 56 columns carrying a double row of boxes, and a stone gallery, all in Neoclassical style. Over the years the popularity of pallone decreased and that of football replaced it. In 1919 the surface was levelled to allow for this, and also for tennis courts. The arena had been used for the occasional theatrical event from 1871, but from about 1914 opera began to be put on there. Present day use In 1921, as the first presentation of what would become the Sferisterio Opera Festival, Pieralberto Conti staged Verdi's Aida paid for by the soprano, Francisca Solari. This was followed by all parts of the arena, both front- and back- stage, being renovated and electricity introduced. Today it holds an audience of over 3,000. The stage is 14.5 meters deep and 40 meters wide, with 10 meter wings each side of that. It is rather unusual shape for musical performances (musicians at each end of the pit cannot hear each other) but the acoustics are surprisingly good (at least near the middle). The present day opera festival, beginning in the late 1980s and under the auspices of the Macerata Opera, takes place in this location See also * Macerata Opera and the Sferisterio Opera Festival * Pallone References *Zeitz, Karyl Lynn, Italian Opera Houses and Festivals, Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2005.

Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Attempting to tie down the Union forces in the Valley, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, Jackson received incorrect intelligence that a small detachment under Col. Nathan Kimball was vulnerable, but it was in fact a full infantry division more than twice the size of Jackson's force. His initial cavalry attack was forced back and he immediately reinforced it with a small infantry brigade. With his other two brigades, Jackson sought to envelop the Union right by way of Sandy Ridge. But Col. Erastus B. Tyler's brigade countered this movement, and, when Kimball's brigade moved to his assistance, the Confederates were driven from the field. There was no effective Union pursuit. Although the battle was a Confederate tactical defeat, it represented a strategic victory for the South by preventing the Union from transferring forces from the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce the Peninsula Campaign against the Confederate capital, Richmond. Following the earlier Battle of Hoke's Run, the First Battle of Kernstown may be considered the second among Jackson's rare defeats. Background thumbupright=1.5Valley Campaign: Kernstown to McDowell. Jackson's division had been withdrawing \\"up\\" the Valley (to the higher elevations at the southwest end of the Valley) to cover the flank of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army, withdrawing from the Centreville‚ÄìManassas area to protect Richmond. Without this protective movement, the Federal army under Banks might strike at Johnston through passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. By March 12, 1862, Banks occupied Winchester just after Jackson had withdrawn from the town, marching at a leisurely pace 42 miles up the Valley Pike to Mount Jackson. On March 21, Jackson received word that Banks was splitting his force, with two divisions (under Brig. Gens. John Sedgwick and Alpheus S. Williams) returning to the immediate vicinity of Washington, D.C., freeing up other Union troops to participate in Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign against Richmond. The remaining division, under Brig. Gen. James Shields, was stationed at Strasburg to guard the lower (northeastern) Valley, and intelligence indicated that it was withdrawing toward Winchester. Banks made preparations to leave the Valley personally on March 23.Clark, pp. 65‚Äì66; Eicher, pp. 208‚Äì10; Salmon, pp. 28‚Äì30, 33; Cozzens, pp. 140‚Äì52; Tanner, p. 103. Jackson's orders from Johnston were to prevent Banks's force from leaving the Valley, which it appeared they were now doing. Jackson turned his men around and, in one of the more grueling forced marches of the war, moved northeast 25 miles on March 22 and another 15 to Kernstown on the morning of March 23. His cavalry, under Col. Turner Ashby, skirmished with the Federals on March 22, during which engagement Shields was wounded with a broken arm from an artillery shell fragment. Despite his injury, Shields sent part of his division south of Winchester and one brigade marching to the north, seemingly abandoning the area, but in fact halting nearby to remain in reserve. He then turned over tactical command of his division to Col. Nathan Kimball, although throughout the battle to come, he sent numerous messages and orders to Kimball. Confederate loyalists in Winchester mistakenly informed Turner Ashby that Shields had left only four regiments and a few guns (about 3,000 men) and that these remaining troops had orders to march for Harpers Ferry in the morning. Ashby, who normally had a reputation as a reliable cavalry scout, inexplicably did not verify the civilian reports and passed them on to Jackson. Jackson marched aggressively north with his 3,000-man division, reduced from its peak as stragglers fell out of the column, unaware that he was soon to be attacking almost 9,000 men.Salmon, p. 33; Clark, p. 66; Eicher, p. 210; Cozzens, pp. 155‚Äì57; Robertson, pp. 338‚Äì39.

Preston Chew Battle Actions at the First Battle of Kernstown, 11 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Jackson moved north from Woodstock and arrived before the Union position at Kernstown around 11 a.m., Sunday, March 23. The devoutly religious Jackson preferred to avoid battles on the Sabbath, but throughout his Civil War career he did not hesitate when military advantage could be gained.Tanner, p. 119. He later wrote to his wife: Jackson performed no personal reconnaissance before he sent Turner Ashby on a feint against Kimball's position on the Valley Turnpike while his main force‚Äîthe brigades of Col. Samuel Fulkerson and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett (the Stonewall Brigade, Jackson's own first command)‚Äîattacked the Union artillery position on Pritchard Hill. The lead brigade under Fulkerson was repulsed, so Jackson decided to move around the Union right flank, about 2 miles west on Sandy Ridge, which appeared to be unoccupied. If this were successful, his men could move down the spine of the ridge and get into the Union rear, blocking their escape route to Winchester. Kimball countered the maneuver by moving his brigade under Col. Erastus B. Tyler to the west, but Fulkerson's men reached a stone wall facing a clearing on the ridge before the Union men could. Jackson's aide, Sandie Pendleton, obtained a clear view from the ridge of the Union forces arrayed against them and he estimated that there were 10,000. He reported this to Jackson, who replied, \\"Say nothing about it. We are in for it.\\"Cozzens, pp. 168‚Äì75; Clark, pp. 67‚Äì70; Robertson, pp. 340‚Äì42. Pritchard Hill, July 2009 Around 4 p.m, Tyler attacked Fulkerson and Garnett by using an unorthodox approach with his brigade in \\"close column of divisions\\"‚Äîa brigade front of two companies with 48 companies lined up behind them in 24 lines, in all about 75 yards wide, and 400 yards long, a formation difficult to control and lacking offensive power at the front. The Confederates were temporarily able to counter this attack with their inferior numbers by firing fierce volleys from behind the stone wall. Jackson, finally realizing the strength of the force opposing him, sent out Col. Jesse Burks's brigade, which had been held in reserve, but by the time they arrived around 6 p.m., Garnett's Stonewall Brigade had run out of ammunition and he pulled them back, leaving Fulkerson's right flank exposed. Panic set in among the Confederates, and as Burks's brigade arrived, it was caught in the fleeing mob and forced to retreat. Jackson tried in vain to rally his troops. He called out to a soldier \\"Where are you going, man?\\" The soldier replied that he was out of ammunition. \\"Then go back and give them the bayonet!\\" Jackson said. However, the soldier ignored him and kept running. Kimball organized no effective pursuit. That night, a cavalryman sat with Jackson by a campfire alongside the Valley Pike and jokingly said \\"It was reported that they were retreating, General, but I guess they were retreating after us.\\" Jackson, not known for his sense of humor, replied, \\"I think I am satisfied, sir.\\"Cozzens, pp. 168‚Äì209; Clark, 70; Eicher, 210‚Äì11; Salmon, 34‚Äì35; Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 313‚Äì14; Walsh, p. 89; Cozzens, p. 207; Robertson, p. 345. Aftermath Union casualties were 590 (118 killed, 450 wounded, 22 captured or missing), Confederate 718 (80 killed, 375 wounded, 263 captured or missing). Despite the Union victory, President Abraham Lincoln was disturbed by Jackson's audacity and his potential threat to Washington. He sent Banks back to the Valley along with Alpheus Williams's division. He also was concerned that Jackson might move into western Virginia against Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont, so he ordered that the division of Brig. Gen. Louis Blenker be detached from McClellan's Army of the Potomac and sent to reinforce Fr√©mont. Lincoln also took this opportunity to re-examine Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's plans for the defenses of Washington while the Peninsula Campaign was underway and decided that the forces were insufficient. He eventually ordered that the corps of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, which was moving south against Richmond in support of McClellan, remain in the vicinity of the capital. McClellan claimed that the loss of these forces prevented him from taking Richmond during his campaign. The strategic realignment of Union forces caused by Jackson's battle at Kernstown‚Äîthe only battle he lost in his military career‚Äîturned out to be a strategic victory for the Confederacy. The remainder of Jackson's Valley Campaign consisted of lightning movements and five victories against superior forces organized into three Union armies, which elevated him to the position of the most famous general in the Confederacy (until this reputation was later supplanted by his superior, Gen. Robert E. Lee).Clark, p. 71; Eicher, p. 211; Cozzens, pp. 215, 227‚Äì30; Salmon, p. 35; Tanner, p. 131. Jackson refused to accept any responsibility for the defeat and subsequently arrested the commander of his old Stonewall Brigade, Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett, for retreating from the battlefield before permission was received. The Stonewall Brigade's withdrawal, which came after it received the bulk of the Union fire and suffered the majority of Confederate casualties, uncovered the right of Fulkerson's Brigade, forcing it to also withdraw and starting a panic. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder. During the invasion of Maryland in September, Robert E. Lee ordered the charges against him dropped, but Garnett suffered from the humiliation of his court-martial for over a year, until he was killed at Gettysburg during Pickett's Charge.Cozzens, pp. 221‚Äì22; Robertson, pp. 349‚Äì50.

After suffering a tactical defeat at the First Battle of Kernstown, Jackson withdrew to the southern Shenandoah Valley. Union forces commanded by Brigadier Generals Robert Milroy and Robert C. Schenck were advancing from what is now West Virginia towards the Shenandoah Valley. After being reinforced by troops commanded by Brigadier General Edward Johnson, Jackson advanced towards Milroy and Schenck's encampment at McDowell. Jackson quickly took the prominent heights of Sitlington's Hill, and Union attempts to recapture the hill failed. The Union forces retreated that night, and Jackson pursued, only to return to McDowell on 13 May. After McDowell, Jackson defeated Union forces at several other battles during his Valley campaign. Background In March 1862, Union forces commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks moved into the Shenandoah Valley with the goal of supporting Major General George B. McClellan's advance up the Virginia Peninsula. Confederate resistance to Banks' advance consisted of a small army commanded by Major General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. On March 21, the Union high command ordered the majority of Banks' command out of the Shenandoah Valley, leaving only a division commanded by Brigadier General James Shields to deal with Jackson. Shields left his camp at Strasburg and began moving north towards Winchester. On March 23, Jackson caught up with Shields' division near Kernstown. Faulty intelligence led Jackson to believe that only a small portion of Shields' force was at Kernstown, so he ordered an assault. Instead, Shields was in the area with his entire force, and a sharp battle was opened. The Confederates took a position behind a stone wall, but after Confederate Brigadier General Richard B. Garnett's brigade retreated after running low on ammunition, the flank of the Confederate position was exposed, forcing Jackson to withdraw from the field. Despite having defeated Jackson at Kernstown, Union high command was concerned by the aggressive behavior the Confederate army had shown, and began to send more troops to the Shenandoah Valley area, including the two divisions of Banks' army that had been moved out earlier. After the retreat from Kernstown, Jackson's force remained in the southern Shenandoah Valley awaiting orders and preparing for battle. In April, Jackson received orders to keep the Union forces in the Valley occupied with the goal of preventing them from joining McClellan's army near Richmond. Also coming to Jackson's camp were reinforcements commanded by Major General Richard Ewell. Meanwhile, another Union force was moving against Jackson's army. Major General John C. Fr√©mont's Mountain Department was moving towards Jackson from the west, across the Allegheny Mountains. Fr√©mont's advance force consisted of 3,500 men commanded by Brigadier General Robert Milroy. Milroy reached the town of McDowell in early May, and was reinforced by another 2,500 men under Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck on 8 May. Jackson's columns departed their camps in the area of West View and Staunton, on the morning of 7 May. Jackson had been further reinforced by elements of Brigadier General Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson's brigade. The area around McDowell contained several points of high ground; a peak known as Jackson's Mountain was located west of the town, and Bull Pasture Mountain was east of McDowell. A road known as the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike ran roughly east to west through the area. A hill known as Sitlington's Hill was located south of the road, and Hull's Hill was north of the road. The Bull Pasture River ran between the town of McDowell and Sitlington's Hill and Hull's Hill. Expecting an attack, the Union commanders sent out small forces to serve as skirmishers. A portion of an artillery battery was also sent to the southern portion of Hull's Hill, where it kept up a regular fire despite not having a clear view of any Confederates. Union skirmishers from the 32nd Ohio Infantry, 73rd Ohio Infantry, and 3rd West Virginia Infantry made contact with the Confederate forces. Opposing forces=Union Schenck had overall command of the Union force, although he still retained nominal command of his brigade. Milroy's brigade contained six regiments of infantry, two artillery batteries, and a regiment of cavalry. All of the units in Milroy's brigade were from the states of Ohio and West Virginia. Schenck's brigade consisted of three regiments of infantry, one battery of artillery, and a battalion of cavalry. Units from Ohio, West Virginia, and Connecticut were represented in Schenck's brigade. Confederate The Confederate army consisted of the three brigades of Jackson's original force and the two brigades of Johnson's attached force. Jackson's original force contained a brigade of five regiments of infantry and two artillery batteries commanded by Brigadier General Charles S. Winder, a brigade of three infantry regiments, an infantry battalion, and two artillery batteries commanded by Colonel John A. Campbell, and a brigade of three infantry regiments and one artillery battery commanded by Brigadier General William B. Taliaferro. Johnson's force was composed of a brigade of three infantry regiments commanded by Colonel Zephaniah T. Conner and a second brigade of three infantry regiments commanded by Colonel William C. Scott. All of the units in the Confederate army were from Virginia, except for one Georgia regiment in Conner's brigade. Battle Plaque marking battle, placed in front of the Presbyterian Church A map of the battle by Jedediah Hotchkiss Jackson then sent troops to take the lightly-defended crest of Sitlington's Hill. Scott's brigade led the way. The 52nd Virginia Infantry aligned in skirmishing formation on the Confederate left, and the 44th Virginia Infantry and 58th Virginia Infantry aligned between the 52nd Virginia and the road at the other end of Sitlington's Hill. The 12th Georgia Infantry of Conner's brigade supported the Virginians. Jackson and Johnson moved to the top of the hill to have a point from which they could observe the Union position with the hopes of finding a path suitable for a flanking attack. However, Milroy ordered his Union troops to attack the Confederate position on Sitlington's Hill, disrupting the Confederate plans. The rough terrain had led Jackson to decide against supporting his line on Sitlington's Hill with artillery. Milroy and Schenck decided to send five regiments against the Confederate line. The 25th Ohio Infantry and 75th Ohio Infantry (both from Milroy's brigade) aimed for where the Union commanders thought the center of the Confederate line was located. The 82nd Ohio Infantry of Schenck's brigade and 32nd Ohio Infantry of Milroy's brigade aligned to the right of the 25th and 75th Ohio, and the 3rd West Virginia Infantry advanced along the road on the Union left. The fact that the Confederates held the high ground would prove to be a disadvantage for them: the sun was setting behind the Confederate line, silhouetting the soldiers against the sky. The hill also cast shadows that helped conceal the Union troops. The 12th Georgia had been posted in an exposed position in front of the main Confederate line, and made first contact with the Union assault. The Georgians' position and outdated muskets gave them a decided disadvantage in the fighting. Further down the line, the 32nd and 82nd Ohio hit the main Confederate line, which had been reinforced by the 25th Virginia Infantry and the 31st Virginia Infantry of Conner's brigade. The fighting became very heavy, with reports describing the battle as \\"fierce and sanguinary\\" and \\"very terrific\\". At one point, Confederates fighting against the 82nd Ohio attempted to use the bodies of dead soldiers as breastworks. The fifth Union regiment in the charge, the 3rd West Virginia, encountered skirmishers from the 52nd and 31st Virginia who were guarding the Confederate right flank. The Confederates then received further reinforcements from Campbell's and Taliaferro's brigades. The 10th Virginia Infantry of Taliaferro's brigade moved to the Confederate left, and Taliaferro's 23rd Virginia Infantry and 37th Virginia Infantry relieved the 25th Virginia in the main Confederate line. Towards the center of the Confederate line, the 12th Georgia, bloodied and out of ammunition, was forced to withdraw and was replaced by Campbell's 48th Virginia Infantry. Milroy shifted some of his regiments around, moving the 32nd Ohio to support the 75th Ohio near where the Georgians had been driven off, and bringing the 3rd West Virginia from the flank to the position formerly occupied by the 32nd Ohio. While the added weight of the 32nd Ohio forced the 48th Virginia to vacate its advanced position quickly, the outnumbered Union assailants broke off the assault. The fighting ended around 9:00 pm. Aftermath Plaque in cemetery in McDowell Milroy and Schenck ordered a general retreat the night after the battle, after burning supplies they were unable to take on the retreat and disposing of extra ammunition by dumping it into the Bull Pasture River. Jackson began a pursuit of the Union column on 9 May, and the Union troops reached Franklin, West Virginia on 11 May. Jackson's pursuit reached as far as the vicinity of Franklin, but the Confederates broke off the retreat and fell back to McDowell on 13 May. Estimates of casualties vary between sources. One source places Confederate losses as 146 killed, 382 wounded, and four captured, for a total of 532; the same source gives Union losses as 26 killed, 230 wounded, and 3 missing, for a total of 259. Others place losses as 256 for the Union and about 500 for the Confederates. Of the Confederate losses, approximately 180 were suffered by the 12th Georgia alone. Additionally, Confederate losses included Johnson, who had been shot in the ankle and severely wounded. Despite retreating from the field, some sources have argued that the Union forces achieved a draw by fighting Jackson to essentially a standstill. However, the defeat of the Union force and Milroy and Schenck's withdrawal from the Shenandoah Valley provided the Confederates with a strategic victory. Jackson would later summarize the battle in the single sentence \\"God blessed our arms with victory at McDowell yesterday.\\" Jackson continued his Valley campaign after McDowell. His next battle was against an outpost of Banks' army on 23 May, and the Confederates then defeated Banks' main force on 25 May. Further victories at the battles of Cross Keys on June 8 and Port Republic on June 9 restored Confederate control of the Shenandoah Valley. Battlefield preservation The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield as of 2019. The battlefield is in a good state of preservation, with some of the wartime buildings still standing. A trail leads to the site of some of the fighting on Sitlington's Hill, and the site of the battle is commemorated with markers. Some of the soldiers killed during the battle are buried in a cemetery in McDowell.

Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and artistic. For rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools, businesses and markets. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructed in such areas using only local materials and labor. An enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a skyway. Bridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as greenbridges and form an important part of a sustainable transport system. Footbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads. They are also located across roads to let pedestrians cross safely without slowing traffic. The latter is a type of pedestrian separation structure, examples of which are particularly found near schools. Early history Stepping stones, across the River Rothay, in the Lake District, England The simplest type of a bridge is stepping stones, so this may have been one of the earliest types of footbridge. Neolithic people also built a form of a boardwalk across marshes, of which the Sweet Track, and the Post Track are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old. Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used log bridges; that is a timber bridge that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees. Among the oldest timber bridges is the Holzbr√ºcke Rapperswil-Hurden crossing upper Lake Z√ºrich in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the Seedamm date back to 1523 B.C. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Z√ºrich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the Roman Empire built a wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 ‚Äì measuring approximately in length and wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. A clapper bridge is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of Devon (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including Snowdonia and Anglesey, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Lancashire. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often granite or schist, supported on stone piers (across rivers), or resting on the banks of streams. Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in medieval times, and some in later centuries. A famous example is found in the village of Postbridge. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been originally built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river. Nowadays clapper bridges are only used as footbridges. The Kapellbr√ºcke is a footbridge crossing the River Reuss in the city of Lucerne in Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, and one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions. The bridge was originally built 1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications. An early example of a skyway is the Vasari Corridor, an elevated, enclosed passageway in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. It was built in five months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, to the design of Giorgio Vasari. Bank Bridge is a famous 25 metre long pedestrian bridge crossing the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like other bridges across the canal, the existing structure dates from 1826. The special popularity of the bridge was gained through angular sculptures of four winged lions crowning the abutments. They were designed by sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835), who also contributed lions for Bridge of Lions.  Design  Design of footbridges normally follows the same principles as for other bridges. However, because they are normally significantly lighter than vehicular bridges, they are more vulnerable to vibration and therefore dynamics effects are often given more attention in design. International attention has been drawn to this issue in recent years by problems on the Pont de Solf√©rino in Paris and the Millennium Bridge in London. To ensure footbridges are accessible to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is nowadays also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, as required by relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK).Schlaich, Mike, et al., Guidelines for the Design of Footbridges, International Federation for Structural Concrete, 2005, Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a stairlift so that residents with a disability can cross them. Types A simple French footbridge Types of footbridges include: * Beam Bridge * Boardwalk * Clapper bridge * Duckboards, Timber trackway, Plank road, and Corduroy road * Moon bridge * Simple suspension bridge * Simple truss * Stepping stones * Zig-zag bridge The residential-scale footbridges all span a short distance and can be used for a broad range of applications. Complicated engineering is not needed and the footbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.Jeswald, P. (2005). How to build paths, steps & Footbridges. North Adams, Massachusetts: Storey Publishing. Different types of design footbridges include: * Timber footbridges * Steel footbridges * Concrete footbridge Footbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges; particularly suspension bridges and beam bridges. Some former road bridges have had their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian bridges; examples in the UK include The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, Shropshire, the Old Bridge at Pontypridd and Windsor Bridge at Windsor, Berkshire. Most footbridges are equipped with guard rails to reduce the risk of pedestrians falling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a fence or other such barrier to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing projectiles onto the traffic below.  Railways  Tilak Nagar Station in Mumbai It was originally usual for passengers to cross from one railway platform to another by stepping over the tracks, but from the mid-19th century onwards safety demanded the provision of a footbridge (or underpass) at busier places. However, in some quieter areas, crossing the line by walking over the tracks is possible.  Catwalk  Narrow footbridges or walkways to allow workers access to parts of a structure otherwise difficult to reach are referred as catwalks or cat walks. Such catwalks are located above a stage (theater catwalk) in a theater, between parts of a building, along the side of a bridge, on the inside of a tunnel, on the outside of any large storage tank in a refinery or elsewhere, etc. The walkway on the outside (top) of a railroad cars such as boxcars, before air brakes came into use, or on top of some covered hopper cars is also called a catwalk. With the exception of those on top of railroad cars, catwalks are equipped with railings or handrails.  In developing countries  Helvetas-type footbridge in Rubaksa, Ethiopia Since the early 1980s, several charities have developed standardized footbridge designs that are sustainable for use in developing countries. The first charity to develop such designs was Helvetas, located in Zurich, Switzerland. Designs that can be sustainably and efficiently used in developing countries are typically made available to the public gratis.  Long footbridges  A section of the Poughkeepsie Bridge, New York State, USA. The record for the longest footbridge in the world was claimed by then New York State Governor David Paterson in an Oct. 3, 2009 Poughkeepsie Journal article about The Walkway Poughkeepsie Bridge across the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York. On July 22, 2017, the Champlain Bridge Ice Structure (, a bridge built for bicycles and foot traffic only to parallel the Champlain Bridge from Brossard, Quebec west to Nun's Island (L'ile Des Soeurs) & the Island of Montreal, was measured by a calibrated device as being 7,512 feet (2,292 meters) long or 1.4227 miles or 2.292km, starting and ending where the treadway rises above the ground and a pedestrian could access the bridge as close as possible to the St Lawrence River. The Walkway Over The Hudson footbridge was originally built for trains, it was recently restored as a pedestrian walkway. The footbridge has a total length of 2,063 meters (6,768 feet). Before it was demolished in 2011, the Hornibrook Bridge which crossed Bramble Bay in Queensland, Australia was longer than the Poughkeepsie Bridge at 2.8 km (1.7 mi).

These provide essential access to water, firewood, farm plots and the classified road network. Communities and/or local government are generally responsible for this infrastructure.Dennis, R. (2004). \\"Foot Bridges\\". Retrieved June 25, 2010  Disadvantages  Pedestrian overpasses over highways or railroads are expensive, especially when elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps will not be able to use the structure. People may prefer to walk across a busy road rather than climb a bridge, and this may be attributed to being in a hurry , perceiving the safety and security of the footbridge to be low , or simply because of feeling tiredness when climbing the stairs . It is recommended that overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.. The operational concept of the footbridge is based on the notion that pedestrians need to walk a longer distance and exert more physical effort so that the traffic flow is not interrupted. This is not in line with the sustainability goals of the transport system promoting active travel such as walking and cycling. A change of policy to increase safety and walkability could involve transferring that effort of crossing the road to drivers who will need to wait longer so pedestrians can cross the road safely at street level . Narrow, enclosed structures can result in perceptions of low personal security among users. Wider structures and good lighting can help reduce this.

Momos are native to Southwest Chinese region of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, North Indian region of Ladakh, Northeast Indian regions of Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh, and East Indian region of Darjeeling. It is similar to Chinese baozi, jiaozi, and mantou, Mongolian buuz, Japanese gyoza, Korean mandu and Turkic manti, but heavily influenced by cuisine of the Indian subcontinent with Indian spices and herbs. Momos are extremely popular among the natives of the Indian subcontinent, and can be found in every kind of shop from restaurants to street vendors.  Names  In Shanxi, where Jin Chinese is spoken, unfilled buns are often called momo (È•ÉÈ•É), which is simply the character for \\"steamed bun\\". The name momo spread to Tibet, India and Nepal and usually now refers to filled buns or dumplings. Momo is the colloquial form of the Tibetan word \\"mog mog\\". The different names for the dumpling include Assamese: ‡¶Æ‡¶Æ; Bengali: ‡¶Æ‡ßã‡¶Æ‡ßã; Nepali: ‡§Æ‡§Æ; Nepal Bhasa: ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ, ‡§Æ‡§Æ:; ; .Jƒ´n P√©ng ÈáëÈπè (ed.): Z√†ngy«î ji«énzh√¨ ËóèËØ≠ÁÆÄÂøó. M√≠nz√∫ ch≈´b«énsh√® Ê∞ëÊóèÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, Beijing 1983, p. 31. This is not the same as dumpling. History The exact origins are unclear, but the name's etymology points to northern China (È•ÉÈ•É). The food is thought to have been spread by caravan routes connecting the Central Asian steppe to both East and West. Momo-like filled dumplings, called by a closely associated group of words, exist in Mongolian, Turkish, Persian, Uzbek, and many other Central and East Asian cuisines. (For more, see entries on Mantou, Manti, and Buuz.) As for the Himalayan momo, the dish is believed to have spread from Tibet along with the influx of the Tibetan diaspora. Since this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling Newar merchants brought the recipe and the name momo from Tibet where the Newar Merchants used to go to trade. Originally, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak, due to the scarcity of vegetables in Tibet. However, after arriving in North Indian plains, the momo was made vegetarian in the modern era to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus. Description Momo is a type of steamed dumpling with some form of filling. Momo has become a traditional delicacy in Nepal, Tibet, as well as among Nepalese and Tibetan communities in Bhutan, as well as people of Ladakh, Northeast India and Darjeeling regions of India. Production A plate of momos from Nepal. A Tibetan woman making momos in Washington, D.C., United States. A simple white-flour-and-water dough is generally preferred to make the outer momo covering. Sometimes, a little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more doughy texture to the finished product. Traditionally, momo is prepared with ground/minced meat filling, but in the modern era, this has changed and the fillings have become more elaborate. These days, momo is prepared with virtually any combination of ground meat, vegetables, tofu, paneer cheese, soft chhurpi (local hard cheese) and vegetable and meat combinations.http://tasteofnepal.blogspot.com/2013/07/momos-or-dumplings.html * Meat: Different types of meat fillings are popular in different regions. In Nepal, Tibet, Darjeeling district, Sikkim and Bhutan, pork, chicken, goat meat and buffalo meat are commonly used. In the Himalayan region of Nepal, India, lamb and yak meat are more common. Minced meat is combined with any or all of the following: onions/shallots, garlic, ginger and cilantro/coriander. Some people also add finely pur√©ed tomatoes and soy sauce. * Vegetables: Finely chopped cabbage, carrot, soy granules, potato, flat bean (Lilva Kachori) or chayote (iskush) are used as fillings in India and Nepal. * Cheese: Usually fresh cheese (Paneer) or the traditional soft chhurpi is used. This variety is common in India and Eastern Nepal. * Khoa: Momo filled with milk solids mixed with sugar are popular as dessert in the Kathmandu valley. The dough is rolled into small circular flat pieces. The filling is then enclosed in the circular dough cover either in a round pocket or in a half-moon or crescent shape. People prefer meat that has a lot of fat because it produces flavorful juicy momos. A little oil is sometimes added to the lean ground/minced meat to keep the filling moist and juicy. The dumplings are then cooked by steaming over a soup (either a stock based on bones or vegetables) in a momo-making utensil called mucktoo. The dumplings may also be pan-fried or deep-fried after being steamed. Varieties There are typically two types of momo, steamed and fried. Momo is usually served with a dipping sauce (locally called chutney/achhar), normally made with tomato as the base ingredient. Soup momo is a dish with steamed momo immersed in a meat or vegetable broth. Pan-fried momo is also known as kothey momo. Steamed momo served in hot sauce is called C-momo. There are also a variety of dumplings of Nepal found in the Indian state of Sikkim and Darjeeling district, including tingmo and thaipo. Gallery File:Momomucktoo.jpgMomo in a mucktoo.

Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's Campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Front Royal demonstrated Jackson's use of Valley topography and mobility to unite his own forces while dividing those of his enemies. At a minimal cost, he forced the withdrawal of a large Union army by striking at its flank and threatening its rear. This caused President Abe Lincoln to react by sending General Irvin McDowell's forces that were intended for General George B. McClellan's advance on Richmond, and caused it to come to a halt. https://www.historynet.com/americas-civil-war-front-royal-was-the- key-to-the-shenandoah-valley.htm Background thumb400pxJackson's Valley Campaign: Front Royal to Port Republic. On May 21, 1862, the Union army under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, numbering about 9,000 men, was concentrated in the vicinity of Strasburg, Virginia, with two companies of infantry at Buckton Depot. Col. John R. Kenly commanded 1,063 men and two guns at Front Royal. Confederate cavalry under Col. Turner Ashby confronted Banks near Strasburg, but then withdrew to join the main army, which crossed Massanutten Mountain via New Market Gap to reach Luray, Virginia. On May 22, Jackson's Army of the Valley (about 16,500 men) advanced along the muddy Luray Road to within ten miles of Front Royal. Jackson's headquarters were at Cedar Point. Colonel Thomas T. Munford's cavalry regiment was sent east to close off Manassas Gap and cut communication between Front Royal and Washington, D.C.NPS report on battlefield condition Opposing forces=Union Department of the ShenandoahMartin, p. 107 Maj.

Turner Ashby Battle \\"Action at Front Royal, Va.\\" On the morning of May 23, the vanguard of Jackson's army reached Spangler's Crossroads (present day Limeton, Virginia). Here the Confederate cavalry under colonels Ashby and Thomas Flournoy diverged west to cross the South Fork of the Shenandoah River at McCoy's Ford. The infantry continued to Asbury Chapel and right onto a cross road to reach Gooney Manor Road. Following this road, they approached Front Royal from the south, bypassing Federal pickets stationed near the river on the Luray Road one mile south of the courthouse. After minor skirmishing the Federals withdrew. Jackson's leading brigade, under the leadership of Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor, deployed on Prospect Hill and along the ridge to the east. The 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA, and Major Roberdeau Wheat's Louisiana \\"Tigers\\" battalion were thrown out in advance, entering the town and clearing it of Union skirmishers. The battle is notable in that the 1st Maryland CSA was thrown into battle with their fellow Marylanders, the Union 1st Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry.,Maryland Civil War units at www.2ndmdinfantryus.org/csunits.html Retrieved May 10, 2010 the only time in United States military history that two regiments of the same numerical designation and from the same state have engaged each other in battle. On the day of the battle Captain William Goldsborough of the 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA, captured his brother Charles Goldsborough of the 1st Maryland Infantry, USA, and took him prisoner.[Goldsborough, W.W., Introduction, The Maryland Line in the Confederate Army, Butternut Press, Maryland (1983) Col. John Reese Kenly, in command of the Union forces, established his headquarters in the Vanoort House. He withdrew his force to Camp (Richards') Hill, supported by a section of artillery. The Union line extended in an arc from the South Fork to Happy Creek, defending the South Fork bridge. Kenly's artillery opened fire and slowed the Confederate advance. The Confederate infantry advanced through town, deploying into line of battle under an accurate artillery fire. A Confederate flanking column moved to the east, crossing Happy Creek in an attempt to force Union withdrawal without a frontal assault. After a long delay because of the muddy roads, a battery of rifled artillery was deployed on or near Prospect Hill to counter the Union guns on Camp Hill. In the meantime, after crossing the South Fork at McCoy's Ford, Ashby's and Lt. Col. Flournoy's 6th Virginia Cavalry rode via Bell's Mill and Waterlick Station to reach the Union outpost at Buckton Depot. Ashby made a mounted assault, which cost him several of his best officers before the Union defenders surrendered. Ashby cut the telegraph lines, severing communication between the main Union army at Strasburg and the detached force at Front Royal. He then divided the cavalry, sending Flournoy's regiment east toward Riverton to threaten Kenly's rear. Ashby remained at Buckton Depot astride the railroad to prevent reinforcements from being sent to Front Royal. On discovering that Confederate cavalry was approaching from the west, Col. Kenly abandoned his position on Camp Hill, retreated across the South and North Fork bridges, and attempted to burn them. Sgt. William Taylor received the Medal of Honor for his gallantry in this action. Kenly positioned part of his command at Guard Hill, while the Confederates ran forward to douse the flames, saving the bridges. While Confederate infantry repaired the bridges for a crossing, Flournoy's cavalry arrived at Riverton and forded the river, pressing Kenly's forces closely. As soon as the Confederate infantry crossed, the Union position could be flanked by a column moving along the river. Kenly chose to continue his withdrawal, his outmatched cavalry fighting a rear guard action against Flournoy's 6th Virginia Cavalry. Kenly withdrew along the Winchester turnpike beyond Cedarville, Virginia, with Flournoy's cavalry in close pursuit. Jackson rode ahead with the cavalry, as Confederate infantry began to cross the rivers. At the Thomas McKay House, one mile north of Cedarville, Kenly turned to make a stand, deploying on the heights on both sides of the pike. Flournoy's cavalry swept around the Union flanks, causing panic. Kenly fell wounded, and the Union defense collapsed. More than 700 Union soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered. Aftermath Actions from Front Royal to First Winchester, May 24-25, 1862. The results of the battle were lopsided. Union casualties were 773, of which 691 were captured. Confederate losses were 36 killed and wounded. Jackson's victory over the small Union force at Front Royal forced the main Union Army at Strasburg under Banks into abrupt retreat. Jackson deceived Banks into believing that the Confederate army was in the main Valley near Harrisonburg; instead he had marched swiftly north to New Market and crossed Massanutten via New Market Gap to Luray. The advance to Front Royal placed Jackson in position to move directly on Winchester, Virginia, in the rear of the Union army. On May 24, Banks retreated down the Valley Pike to Winchester, harassed by Confederate cavalry and artillery at Middletown and Newtown (Stephens City), setting the stage for the First Battle of Winchester the following day. The confusion engendered by Jackson's appearance at Front Royal and the hasty Union retreat from Strasburg to Winchester contributed materially to the defeat of Banks's army at First Winchester on May 25. Jackson used his cavalry to good advantage at Front Royal, to sever Union communications east and west, and to strike the final blow at Cedarville. After the battle, the victorious First Maryland CSA took charge of prisoners from the beaten Union First Maryland regiment. Many men recognized among them former friends and family. According to W.

A right-handed and aggressive fast bowler with a notably long run-up, Willis spearheaded several England bowling attacks between 1971 and 1984, across 90 Test matches in which he took 325 wickets at 25.20 runs per wicket, at the time second only to Dennis Lillee. He is England's fourth leading wicket taker as of 2019, behind James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ian Botham. Willis took 899 first-class wickets overall, although from 1975 onwards he bowled with constant pain, having had surgery on both knees. He nevertheless continued to find success, taking a Test career- best eight wickets for 43 runs in the 1981 Ashes series against Australia, one of the all-time best Test bowling performances. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1978. In addition to the Test arena, Willis played 64 One Day International matches for his country, taking 80 wickets, and was a prolific List-A (one-day) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20.18. As a tail-ender, Willis made little impression with the bat, with a top Test score of 28 not- out (*); however, he managed two half-centuries at first-class level, and for a time held a record number of Test not-outs. Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984. Under Willis's captaincy England won seven, lost five and drew six Tests, and won 16 of the ODIs. Botham recalled Willis as \\"a tremendous trier.. a great team-man and an inspiration\\",Botham, p. 370. as well as the \\"only world-class fast bowler in my time as an England player\\".Botham, p. 376. The editor of Wisden wrote of him in similar terms: \\"His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets. Although often beset with aches and pains, he never spared himself when bowling for his country.\\" Retiring in 1984 during a Test series against the West Indies, Willis found later work as a commentator with Sky Sports. He formed a noted commentary partnership with Botham; however, Willis' relatively low-key style, in contrast to Botham's ebullience, meant that from 2006 onwards Willis tended to be used as a second-string commentator. He remained an often-heard broadcaster, a published writer and an occasional critic of the modern game. On the occasion of England's 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country's greatest Test XI by the ECB. The 2020 County Championship will be played for the Bob Willis Trophy. Early life Willis was born in Sunderland, County Durham on 30 May 1949, and grew up in the Surrey village of Stoke d'Abernon near Cobham, having moved there at the age of six. His father was an employee of the BBC; Willis had an elder brother named David, with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister. In 1965, Willis added his third name \\"Dylan\\" by deed poll in honour of American musician Bob Dylan, of whom he was a fan.All Across The Telegraph: A Bob Dylan Handbook, ed. Michael Gray and John Bauldie, 1987, p.x Willis was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, playing his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became vice president and a Life Member, and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians. He was also an avid schoolboy footballer, but was not a natural athlete and loathed rugby, which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years \\"in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, I used to play football with the school old boys. This taught me how to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons.\\" His bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts, under the directorship of Watcyn Evans, who would become a close friend. Playing career=County debut In 1968, Willis accepted an invitation to join Middlesex and Surrey Young Cricketers on tour in Pakistan, and used this opportunity to further hone his skills. Upon his return he made early appearances for Surrey's Second XI, his first being on 26 August against Worcestershire's Seconds. Willis, 19 years of age, took one wicket for 48 runs in the first innings, and bowled four wicketless overs in the second. He was not called on to bat at all. Two days later, he faced Glamorgan and took three wickets. He played several further Second XI matches during May and June 1969, before his first-class debut on 6 August. Scotland was touring England that season and had already beaten Warwickshire. Willis took three wickets for 13 runs from 13 overs in his first innings, and two for 37 in his second, to help Surrey to victory by an innings and 97 runs. Willis went on to take 22 first-class wickets that season at 17.22 from six matches, placing him 15th in the national averages for that season's County Championship. Surrey came third in the competition that year. Willis also played two List-A games, but took only one wicket at 52.00. Willis had thus earned a second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 first-class wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came fifth in the Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 for the loss of five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240‚Äì3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272‚Äì9. Willis took 6‚Äì49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call-up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate. International beginnings Willis joined England's 1970‚Äì71 tour of Australia as a replacement for the injured Alan Ward, and played several warm-up matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in December. Wisden records that his \\"infectious enthusiasm and team spirit played no small part in Australia's downfall\\" as England won the Ashes in the subsequent Test series. Willis' first Test, on 9 January 1971 ‚Äì the fourth Test of the series, played when the series stood level after two draws and an abandonment ‚Äì saw him score 15 not out as England batted first and reached 332. In the Australian first innings he bowled an economical nine overs for 26 runs, while Derek Underwood took four wickets to reduce Australia to 236. Subsequently, an unbeaten 142 from Geoffrey Boycott set Australia 416 to win. With John Snow routing Australia with 7/40, Willis was only given three overs to bowl on a pitch \\"without pace\\", but he managed to take his first Test wicket ‚Äì Ashley Mallett, caught by Alan Knott for six. Willis remained in the team for the fifth Test at Melbourne, and rewarded the selectors with 3/73 in the first innings and 1/42 in the second as the match was drawn. Of the final two matches, Willis took three wickets in the drawn Adelaide Test, and four more in the final match of the series, a victory at Sydney Cricket Ground which gave England a 2‚Äì0 series victory. Willis finished his first Test series with 12 wickets at 27.41, and had also taken several \\"crucial catches\\". He was retained for the second match of the two-Test series against New Zealand in Auckland in March, in which he took two wickets. Surrey to Warwickshire Willis returned in early 1971 to help Surrey win the County Championship title that year. However, friction was developing between him and the club. During the season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28.83, but found himself unable to accept the contract offered to him by the club. Though the county was reluctant to lose him, Willis sought another club. He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against Hampshire on 11 September 1971. After turning down Leicestershire and Lancashire he signed for Warwickshire, for whom he had immediate success, with 25 wickets at 29.28, including one five-wicket haul (taking five wickets in one innings). Willis, who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July, helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship, thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties. In his final match of the season, he took 8/44 to demolish Derbyshire. His new team won nine of their 20 matches, drew 11 and lost none. He was not selected for the 1972 Ashes series in England, and travelled to South Africa as part of Derrick Robins' invitation XI in January. On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches. Willis spent part of the 1973 season injured with one of what would become several recurring complaints. He nevertheless managed 43 wickets in the Championship at 18.95, though his injury barred him from all but one Test against the West Indies cricket team. The West Indies amassed 652‚Äì8 declared. Willis took four wickets for 118 runs ‚Äì career-best Test figures thus far ‚Äì and was the last batsman standing as Vanburn Holder and Keith Boyce routed England for 233 and 193. He then made his ODI debut with two games against the touring side in September, taking 2/29 and scoring five not out as England took a one-wicket victory in the West Indies' first ever ODI match. He went wicketless and conceded 5.5 runs per over in the second, which the West Indies won by eight wickets. West Indies, Indian subcontinent and Australia Willis then travelled to the Caribbean as part of England's winter tour, in what Wisden described as an \\"automatic selection\\"; however, he was to struggle against the top Test side. In the first Test, on 2 February 1974, he took only one wicket, followed by three in the second, and one for a hundred runs in the final match. He was to struggle against the West Indies throughout his career. His bowling average against them ended at 36.34, whereas against no other team was it above 26.14. Willis then returned to England, to face India and Pakistan, playing in one Test against each. Against India he took 4/64 ‚Äì a career best against that team ‚Äì and made a Test best 24 with the bat. Pakistan toured in early August, and Willis featured in one Test. He took one wicket for 133 runs. He also played one ODI where he took one wicket caught and bowled as Pakistan achieved a seven wicket victory. At this point, Willis was suffering from a recurring back injury. He played 13 Championship games for Warwickshire during the 1974 season, taking 44 wickets at 21.56 including one five-wicket haul. In November, Willis touring Australia during the 1974/75 Ashes series, playing in five Test matches. He took 17 Test wickets at 30.70, including a best of 5/42, out of 26 first-class wickets at 31.19 overall. He was, however, playing with growing injury concerns which required several painkilling injections. Injury and operation Willis returned to England in January 1975 with a recurring knee injury which had caused him to collapse at a county game early that season, and underwent several operations to correct it. He had surgery on both knees, and suffered a post-operative blood clot. He was forced to use crutches for most of the season, and reflected in 1978 that it was \\"similar to a 50,000-mile service\\". His recovery was particularly tortuous, requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson, an advocate of slow running therapy to build stamina. He played no part in the international arena in 1975, and managed only four first-class appearances, though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18.77. He was not to return to the Test game until 1976, where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August. That year, he had made a comfortable return to the county game from injury ‚Äì taking 16 Championship wickets at 26.12. He had also scored a career best 43 with the bat. After coming fit from injury, Willis was brought into the squad for the fourth Test against the West Indies on 22 July as part of wholesale bowling changes that saw Brian Close, Edrich, Mike Hendrick, Mike Selvey and Pat Pocock replaced with John Snow, Ward, Bob Woolmer, David Steele and Willis. He took three wickets for 71 runs and then a five-wicket haul in the second innings. This both gave him career best figures and took him past 50 Test wickets. His last four wickets fell in 24 balls at the cost of three runs, described by Wisden as a \\"fine piece of fast bowling\\". Tony Greig's England, however, struggled to make any impression on the West Indies through the series, Viv Richards dominating with 829 runs across the series. Willis could only take one further wicket in the fifth and final Test, which the tourists won easily. By this time Willis, whose injury troubles were continuing, turned down a coaching opportunity in South Africa in order to not risk his fitness, and went on the dole. Revival in India and the 1977 Ashes Bob Willis bowling vs New Zealand national cricket team at the Basin Reserve (February 1978) Bob Willis batting vs New Zealand national cricket team at the Basin Reserve (February 1978) Over the winter of 1976/77, England toured India in a five Test series through December to February, and it proved to be a revival for Willis. Wisden recorded the India tour to be the time when he \\"put to flight any who doubted his right to be acclaimed as one of the world's foremost fast bowlers\\". Willis took 32 wickets for 15.09 across the entire tour, 20 of those in the Test matches for 16.75. He took five for 27 in the second Test, and then six for 53 in the fourth ‚Äì earning him career best Test figures thus far, and taking him past 400 first-class wickets. Four of his wickets came in four overs with the second new ball, \\"although he received no help from the pitch\\". Wisden record that \\"His 20 wickets in the series stamped Willis as a bowler of genuine pace and in-disputable class.\\" The 1977 Ashes took place across five Tests between June and August that year, in all of which Willis featured. Preceding them were three ODI fixtures, across which Willis took a total of five wickets at 15.80. The first Test took place on 16 June, at Lord's. Australia, batting second and looking to take a lead over England's 216 all out, were dismantled by Willis who returned a career-best 7/78. After a century from Woolmer, Australia fell to 114/6 with two more wickets to Willis before the match ended as a draw. Willis' \\"hostile speed\\" gained praise in giving \\"Australia a real fright\\". Wills took four more wickets in the second Test to aid Underwood in restricting Australia's totals and giving England a nine wicket victory, and was \\"fast and accurate\\" in the third Test for his five-wicket haul, the match in which Botham made his debut. Willis went wicketless in England's innings victory in the fourth Test, however he took another five-for in the final match, including both Australian openers. His 27 wickets across the series was a record for an England fast bowler facing Australia in England, and his final wicket of the series was his 100th. Around these Test matches, Willis also made 10 County Championship appearances, netting 29 wickets at 19.41. This included a haul of 8/32 against Gloucestershire on 20 August, which would remain his best first-class figures for his career. The year ended with Willis on winter tour to Pakistan and New Zealand. Willis dismissed seven Pakistani batsmen for 27.14 runs each, though did not appear in any of the ODI matches. In New Zealand he took a further 14 wickets at 18.21, including 5/32 in the first Test. Wisden Cricketer of the Year ‚Äì 1978 Willis made 10 Championship appearances in the 1978 season, taking 37 wickets at 18.27. He was also third in the national averages for the Benson and Hedges Cup that year, with 16 wickets at 6.75, including four wickets for four runs in one innings. That year also saw Pakistan and New Zealand return to tour England between June and August. Though Botham took Man of the Series for his 13 wickets, Willis also netted 13 Pakistani batsmen for 17.92, including a five-wicket haul in the second Test. He also earned a Man of the Match award for his 4/15 in the first ODI. Against New Zealand, Willis took 12 Test wickets at 19.08, and passed 150 career Test wickets with his 4/16 in the third Test. Wisden noted Willis' achievements against Australia in 1977, stating that \\"the new-ball fire power of Bob Willis, which yielded 27 wickets, was of special significance in England's high summer of success. No England bowler of authentic speed can boast a comparable record in a home series against Australia\\". In continued: \\"It was singularly appropriate that team and personal triumph should go hand in hand, for few players have given such loyal and unstinted service to England as the wholehearted Willis... Happily determination is one virtue Willis does not lack, and his re-emergence as a top ranking fast bowler was well and truly deserved.\\" Across all first- class matches that year, Willis had taken 65 wickets at 18.41, the most of any season of his career. His 35 List-A wickets was also the second highest he would achieve for a season behind the 45 of 1983. Wisden also praised him for refusing to partake in Kerry Packer's World Series cricket, and proclaimed him a Wisden Cricketer of the Year along with Botham, Hendrick, Alan Jones and Ken McEwan. 1978‚Äì79 Ashes In the winter of 1978/79, Willis travelled to Australia for that season's Ashes series, which England won 5‚Äì1 against an Australian team depleted by the rebel Packer tour. The tour commenced with four first-class fixtures against South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Willis then bowled 1,123 deliveries during the Test series, taking 20 wickets at 23.05. In the first Test on 1 December 1978, he took 4/44 and 3/69 in a seven-wicket England win. He then took 5/44 in the second match on 15 December, as England secured a 2:0 lead with a 166 run victory, and following an abandoned ODI match on Boxing Day failed to take a wicket as Australia won the third Test to bring the series to 2:1. The fourth Test followed on 6 January, and England took a 93-run victory with two wickets to Willis, before a repeat of the first ODI was attempted and again abandoned after 7.2 overs. England then played three first-class matches before a second ODI on 24 January. Australia, batting first, were routed for 101 all out by Hendrick and Botham, Willis bowling a wicketless but economic spell of eight overs for 15 runs and four maidens. England reached the target with seven wickets to spare. In the fifth Test that followed, Willis picked up 3/41 in Australia's second innings, however with the bat he made 24 from 20 balls, with three fours and a six. With this cameo knock, he both surpassed his previous best Test score, and passed 1,500 first-class runs. In the sixth and final Test, England took a nine wicket victory to seal the series convincingly 5‚àí1. Willis took 1/48 and managed to hit 10 runs with the bat. Willis \\"struck early and decisive blows\\" through the series, although struggled for rhythm between the second and fifth Tests, whereupon he \\"suddenly regained his fire and rhythm\\". In all first-class fixtures of the tour, Willis had taken 34 wickets at 20.47, though this was the third highest average of the England bowlers. His tail-end batting had netted him 115 runs at 12.77. 1979 World Cup In 1979, England hosted the Cricket World Cup. The host nation played a 13-man squad: captain Mike Brearley, Botham, Geoffrey Boycott, Phil Edmonds, Graham Gooch, David Gower, Hendrick, Wayne Larkins, Geoff Miller, Chris Old, Derek Randall, Bob Taylor (wk) and Willis. England, who had no warm-up games, played their first match against Australia on 9 June at Lord's, whom they \\"breezed\\" past. Willis took one wicket for 20 runs from his 11 overs, surpassed by Boycott ‚Äì who would be an unlikely bowling hero during the tournament ‚Äì who took 2/15. Reduced to chasing 159, England proceeded slowly, with Brearley's 44 coming from 147 balls, and they reached the target at 47.1 overs. Their next game, against Canada, saw the visiting team routed for 45 with Willis taking 4/11 and Man of the Match Old taking 4/8. Boycott and Gooch finished the game within 13.5 overs. England's final Group A match on 16 June saw them defeat Pakistan by 14 runs. Willis hit three fours in his 24 from 37 balls to help England to 165/9, and his one wicket for 37 runs, along with Boycott's 2/14, helped England keep Pakistan from the target. England thus qualified for the semi-finals against New Zealand. Willis managed to chip one run from his two balls as England reached 221/8, and then took a single wicket to keep New Zealand to 212. During the match, however, Willis fell to injury. He had left the field before the end of the match with a recurrence of his knee injury and was ruled out of the final, which England lost to the West Indies. Though he missed the final, Willis took seven wickets across the whole competition at 15.57 runs each ‚Äì placing him fifth in bowling average across all the teams, and his economy rate of 2.44 runs an over was the fourth best. Willis followed his recuperation from injury by playing the first, third and fourth Test matches against India, taking 10 wickets at 29.80. Between his international appearances, he struggled with nine Championship wickets at 42.00, as Warwickshire came fifteenth in the country. 1980, Australia and the West Indies The winter of 1979/80 and the followed summer saw difficult tours for Willis: the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup and a Test tour in Australia followed by a home series against the West Indies. Willis partook in all seven of England's matches for the World Series Cup, however he struggled with six wickets at 41.00. England did secure the highest number of points however they were beaten in both finals by the West Indies. In the midst of these matches, England and Australia played three Test matches in which Willis took only 3 wickets at 74.66, going wicketless in third Test. In the county front, however, his position at Warwickshire was reaffirmed as he was appointed county captain. Two ODI matches back in England commenced the West Indies tour, with Willis being included only in the team for the second match, here he took two wickets and two catches in a three-wicket England victory. Wills then faced the West Indies Test team across four matches, the first on 5 June. He took four wickets for 82 runs in the first innings, and five in the second ‚Äì passing 650 first-class wickets in the process though the Man of the Match award was given to Andy Roberts' 5/72 and 3/57, the West Indies winning by two wickets. The second Test was a draw, though Willis collected three wickets. He only managed 1/99 in the third match, however, and equalled his Test best score of 24 with the bat in the fourth Test, passing 500 Test runs in the process. The West Indies secured a 1:0 series victory. Willis had marked his improved form with 14 wickets at 29.07, and had fared better in the County Championship that year, taking 27 wickets at 31.70. He had also taken 23 one day wickets that season at 25.95. 1981 Ashes Australia arrived in England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981. Willis, who was selected to play in all six Test matches, came into the series on a run of good county form. He had played four county matches, commencing with 5/61 against Yorkshire on 6 May, and 3/58 against Lancashire on 10 June. The first Test took place at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, on 18 June. England, batting first, were cut down for 185 all out thanks to four wickets for Terry Alderman and three a-piece for Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg. Only Mike Gatting passed fifty, and Willis was dismissed for a first-ball duck. Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out, with three wickets for Willis. England could not take advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched Graeme Wood for eight to reach 200 Test wickets, however the tourists won the match with four wickets to spare. Between the first and second Tests, Willis went back to Warwickshire to face Gloucestershire in a County Championship match, grabbing three wickets. He returned to face Australia on 2 July for the second Test, and England batting first. Thanks to 82 from Peter Willey, and a second half- century from Gatting, together with five runs from Willis, England reached 311 ‚Äì though Geoff Lawson took seven wickets. Australia surpassed this and were dismissed for 345, with three wickets for Willis and three for Dilley. The England bowlers suffered from no balls, Willis alone bowling 28. England declared late in the game on 265/8, and Willis picked up another wicket as Australia reached 90/4 at the close of play. Botham, who had captained the side until then, was sacked and replaced by Brearley. Willis, who was struggling for fitness and had a chest infection, was dropped from the side. He sat out a Warwickshire county match and after speaking to Alec Bedser was given back his place in the team on the condition that he played in a 40-over match, played a Second XI game, and bowled 12 overs in the nets. He succeeded in these tasks, and was tentatively let back into the squad over a spinner. The third Test ‚Äì Willis' 60th ‚Äì came on 16 July, and England were able to level the series 1:1 thanks to Botham's Man of the Match performance (seven wickets, century and half century) and Willis's hostile bowling in the second innings. Willis bowled 30 wicketless overs in Australia's first innings, and made one and two with the bat, before returning to bowl with Australia requiring 130 runs. At this point, England had been quoted at 500‚Äì1 to win the match. Willis began an \\"inspired\\" bowling performance, having requested to bowl downhill from the Kirkstall Lane end once Australia were 56/1. Trevor Chappell, Kim Hughes and Graham Yallop were caught by close fielders, while Rod Marsh and John Dyson were caught at fine leg and behind the wicket respectively trying to play the hook shot. Dennis Lillee was caught from the only ball Willis pitched up. Then when Willis uprooted Ray Bright's middle stump Australia were bowled out for 111, losing by 18 runs. Willis took 8/43, his career best Test figures. Two of his victims had been out for zero, and three others for single figure scores. John Dyson had top-scored with 34 before Willis removed him. Willey recalled it as an \\"amazing spell\\" while Wisden called it \\"the most staggering bowling of his life when his place again seemed threatened\\". Willis in the early 1980s England then moved into the fourth Test 1:1 in the series. Again batting first, Alderman's five-for took England to 189 all out, with Willis making 13 runs. He then bowled a wicketless but \\"stormy\\" 19 overs \\"as if the devil were at his heels\\" and, after England had set Australia a final target of 151 runs, took two wickets which along with Botham's five-wicket haul dismissed the Australians for 121 and handed England a 29-run victory and a series lead. Willis played for his county against Middlesex between the fourth and fifth Tests, taking one wicket. He then rejoined his team for the fifth Test at Old Trafford. England reached 231 thanks to partly to a \\"priceless\\" 56-run late partnership between Paul Allott (52) and Willis (11) before Willis then led the bowling attack with four wickets to restrict Australia to 130 all out. Another century from Botham took England to 404, setting the tourists 506 runs to win. Yallop and Allan Border both scored centuries, however three wickets for Willis and two for Paul Allott, Botham and John Emburey dismissed them for 402, 103 runs short of victory. Willis continued to enjoy some form with the bat with 33* against Nottinghamshire in the interval between the fifth and final Tests, though he went wicketless. On 27 August, Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval. The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border, while Willis took four wickets and Botham six. A century from Boycott then defied Lillee's seven wicket haul to take England to 314, and in reply Hendrick and Botham took four wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis went without a wicket in the second innings. With half-centuries from Gatting and Brearley, England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw. England were victorious in the series 3:1, and Botham's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as 'Botham's Ashes'. Willis meanwhile, travelled to India with England in November 1981 for a six Test series against India and one against Sri Lanka. He took 12 wickets at 31.75 against India, and three more Test and two wickets ODI against Sri Lanka. Between these international fixtures, Willis had secured 13 County Championship wickets at 28.55, though Warwickshire came bottom of the table. England captaincy Willis began the 1982 county season with five County Championship fixtures, featuring his first half-century with the bat, a career-best 72, while leading Warwickshire against the touring Indian side on 9 May. He also took two wickets. He also reached his 750th first-class wickets with his 2/71 against Yorkshire on 19 May. India were scheduled to play three Tests and two ODI matches that tour; however, before the matches began, the England selectors dropped Fletcher, the captain. Willis, though seen as an unlikely candidate and ambivalent towards the role, was awarded the captaincy. On 2 June, the new captain faced India as part of the England ODI squad, taking two wickets and effecting a run-out with the help of Botham, who also took four wickets. England restricted India to 193 and achieved victory by nine wickets. The second ODI match followed two days later, and England also won ‚Äì this time by 114 runs with Willis taking 1/10 from seven overs. With two victories under his belt, Willis led his team to the first Test on 10 June. Batting first, he hit a career-best 28 runs in a last-wicket partnership with Allott (41) worth 70 ‚Äì an England record against India ‚Äì which took the hosts to 433 all out. Willis then set about taking apart the Indian batting line-up with 3/41 and 6/101 to leave England 65 runs to chase, which they reached for the loss of three wickets. Wisden described Willis as \\"bowling near his fastest\\" and he took his 250th Test wicket during the match. Willis took two further wickets in the second Test; however, centuries from Botham and Sandeep Patil, who hit Willis for 24 runs in an over, ensured large innings scores that pushed the match to a draw. Botham followed with his career-best 208 in the third match to take England to 594 all out, and Willis then took 3/78 to keep India to 410. He then declared England's second innings at 191 to leave India 376 to win, and collected the wicket of Ravi Shastri before India closed out the final day with 111/3. Willis thus completed his first Test series in victorious fashion, with 15 Test wickets of his own at 22.00. Willis was available for only three more first-class games that season, and finished it with a total of 24 wickets at 35.08. He promptly travelled to Australia to lead England in the 1982-83 Ashes. Over the winter of 1982/83, England's winning Ashes team travelled to Australia under Willis' captaincy. Willis took two three-wicket hauls in two warm-up first-class matches; however, he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy. By now, continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler's body. He took 3/95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England's first innings 411, of which Willis had made 26. Derek Randall's century in England's second innings took them to 358, and Australia reached 73 at the close of play on the final day for the loss of two wickets, both of which were taken by Willis, leaving the match drawn. Willis picked up 5/66 in the second Test; however, Australia easily reached a low fourth innings target to go 1‚Äì0 up. The third Test followed a similar pattern, with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia's first innings 438, and Australia taking an eight-wicket win to take a 2‚Äì0 lead in the series, despite Willis' three wickets. England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test at Melbourne, with Willis taking three wickets. Willis commentated on the game that \\"You never give up and you never think it has gone.\\" The fifth match ended in a draw, so Australia won the series 2‚Äì1. Across the entire tour, Willis took 28 first-class wickets. In the following World Series Cup between England, Australia and New Zealand, England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21.14. Willis returned to Warwickshire for the 1983 season, struggling in the county season with 21 wickets at 36.76 in the County Championship, though finding more success in the one day arena with a career-best 45 wickets at 16.24. He also led England in a four Test series against New Zealand, finding greater success with 20 wickets at 13.65 including a five-wicket haul. This, coming in the second Test, took Willis past 850 first-class wickets and 300 Test wickets. England won the series convincingly 3:1, and returned to New Zealand over the winter. In the drawn first Test, Willis overtook Fred Trueman's record England tally of 307 Test wickets when he dismissed Lance Cairns in the first innings. England lost the second Test by an innings despite 4/51 from Willis. With the third Test ending as a draw, England lost the series. Willis, with increasing physical and mental weariness and now using hypnotherapy to reduce stress and focus his game, took three wickets in the following ODI series, in which England beat New Zealand 2:1. England played a three-Test series against Pakistan in early 1984, however Willis was unable to contribute more than two wickets in the first match due to injury. He made only five County Championship appearances, taking only nine wickets at 42.22. Willis, with pressure mounting due to injury and poor performances by the England team, was sacked as captain before the upcoming Test series against the West Indies, and replaced by Gower. As a captain, Willis subsequently received a mixed assessment. Botham retained fond memories of Willis the player,Botham, p. 162-196, 223‚Äì225. but remarked that Willis found it difficult to captain him because the men were of similar age.Botham p. 141. Willis, often noted for his enthusiasm, became an \\"effective motivator\\" as a captain; however, he was \\"no outstanding tactical genius\\" and \\"towards the end his feelings bordered on disgust at the conviction that some of England's cricketers accepted failure too readily. Nor was he able to close himself off against media comment.\\" He was also characterised as a loner in the game, and a reluctant captain grateful to be placed back within the ranks after repeated defeats while he was at the reins. His 18 Tests as England captain saw 7 victories, 5 defeats, and 6 draws, while he led England in 29 ODI matches, winning 16 and losing 13. Willis played in the next Test series against the West Indies, taking two wickets in the first two matches. and before the last match played against Derbyshire for his county, taking three wickets. Willis took to the field on 12 July for the third Test and took only two wickets for 123 runs as the West Indies, particularly Michael Holding, \\"hammered\\" his bowling ‚Äì Holding hit 59 from 55 deliveries. Willis conceded 40 more runs from eight overs in the second innings, which Wisden referred to as \\"the death throes\\" of his career. He announced his retirement from all cricket immediately after England's defeat. He finished his career with 325 Test wickets, at the time second only to Dennis Lillee,Playfair Cricket Annual. Queen Anne Press. 1985. p. 228. . and 899 wickets in all first-class matches.CricketArchive career summary Only James Anderson, Ian Botham, and Stuart Broad have since surpassed his number of Test wickets for England.Playfair Cricket Annual. Headline. 2015. p. 69. . Willis also retains the world record for most Test wickets without a single 10-wicket haul in a match. Commentary Willis (centre) with fellow commentators Botham and Gower, politicians Alastair Campbell and James Erskine After retiring from playing cricket, Willis established himself as a television commentator on Sky. He began in 1985, and was initially in partnership with Botham in the commentary box, \\"his laconic style did not suit all\\" and he was dropped from the \\"front-line commentary duties\\". Willis appeared on BBC TV Cricket between 1989 and 1990 as a summariser before joining Sky Sports in 1991. He also appeared on David Tomlinson's This is Your Life in 1991, A Question of Sport in 2004 and 20 to 1 in 2005. Willis worked for Sky Sports, largely commentating in the county game, where he has been vocal on the need for changes in English cricket, particularly through a group of former players known as the Cricket Reform Group. He was critical of Mike Atherton during the England tour of Zimbabwe in 1997. In 2006, he criticised the then England coach Duncan Fletcher's practices, England's performance in the 2006-07 Ashes, and was vocal in calling for the retirement of out-of-form national captain Michael Vaughan in 2008. Willis has attracted detractors due to his somewhat melancholic style. The Independent commentated on the 1995 Texaco Trophy that Willis had \\"trenchant content, dismal delivery. As a player Willis had trouble getting to sleep. As a commentator he struggles to stay awake. His voice remains on one note ‚Äì the drone of your neighbour's mower.\\" CricInfo's launching of two polls on cricket commentary both returned negative views of Willis' \\"hyper-critical\\" commentary. Willis received only 15% of the vote, above only Dermot Reeve and Allott. Personal life Willis married his first wife, Juliet Smail in 1980. They had a daughter born in 1984. He married his second wife, Lauren Clark, in 2014. Although born in Sunderland, Willis lived in Manchester as a youngster, and was a keen supporter of Manchester City F.C., having first attended a match at Maine Road in 1954, as well as seeing the 1955 FA Cup Final against Newcastle United. Willis died on 4 December 2019, aged 70, \\"after a long illness\\". He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer three years previously.

As a community, the population of Dolwyddelan was recorded in the 2001 Census as 427, and 55.8% of those residents could speak Welsh. The population increased to 474 in the 2011 census with the proportion of Welsh speakers falling to 50.8%.  Name  The spelling of the village's name has varied over the years, though there appear to be two primary spellings with two primary meanings. The common modern spelling \\"Dolwyddelan\\" is translated as \\"Gwyddelan's meadow\\", referring to Saint Gwyddelan after whom the parish church is named. However, Saint Gwyddelan is believed to have lived about two hundred years after Dolwyddelan Castle was built, so may not be the origin of the town's name. A variant of this spelling is Dolwyddelen, which was particularly used by the railway between 1880 and 1980.Bala to Llandudno, Mitchell & Smith, Middleton Press 2010 Before the First World War the alternate spelling \\"Dolyddelen\\" was in common use; it is translated as \\"Elen's meadow\\", named after Elen Luyddog. Elen's Castle Hotel, which is on the east of the village, is also named after Elen Llyddog.  Gwydir Estate  For many years, Dolwyddelan was part of the Gwydir Estate. The estate was founded in the 16th century and was owned by the Wynn family. The estate was centered on Gwydir Castle and it dominated north Wales. More than of the country, stretching almost from Blaenau Ffestiniog in the south to the edge of Conwy in the north was part of the estate. In 1678 it passed to the Barons Willoughby de Eresby, based in Lincolnshire, and in 1892 it became the property of Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster. By the early 19th century the estate largely comprised the parishes of Dolwyddelan (where the Wynns also had an ancestral home), Llanrhychwyn, Trefriw, and Gwydir, totalling some . Much of the estate was under mortgage, and in 1894 Dolwyddelan was sold off. Buildings of note Gwydir Arms Hotel, Dolwyddelan, taken around 1875 The village is particularly noted for Dolwyddelan Castle, the reputed birthplace of Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great), although doubt has been cast on this as the stone keep was not built until around 1220. It has better transport links than most villages, with the small Dolwyddelan railway station on the Conwy Valley Line still in operation. There are two historic hotels in the village: * Elen's Castle Hotel dates back over three hundred years and at one time belonged to Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster. In the 1870s he sold it to his game-keeper, who opened it as a coaching inn which specialised in hunting parties. * Gwydir Arms Hotel (now called Y Gwydir) named for the estate that contained the village. Geography Nearby mountains include Moel Siabod to the north, Moel Penamnen and Y Ro Wen to the south and, further afield, Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa) lies approximately 10 miles to the west. Carreg Alltrem, a crag used by many rock climbers, can be found about a mile south of the village.  Industry  During the Victorian period Dolwyddelan was surrounded by slate quarries. These quarries worked the Nod Glas Formation, which extended across Mid and North Wales. It was primarily a bed of soft, black shale, but in the area of the Dolwyddelan syncline it was partially metamorphisised into slate. The principle quarries were: * Prince Llewellyn quarry and Chwarel Fedw * Chwarel Ddu * Ty'n-y-bryn quarry and Penllyn * Rhiw- goch quarry and Ty'n-y-fallen Governance Dolwyddelan is included in the Betws-y-Coed electoral ward which is represented by a county councillor on Conwy County Borough Council.

Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. Background The hamlet of Port Republic, Virginia, lies on a neck of land between the North and South Rivers, which conjoin to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. On June 6-7, 1862, Jackson's army, numbering about 16,000, bivouacked north of Port Republic, Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division along the banks of Mill Creek near Goods Mill, and Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's division on the north bank of North River near the bridge. The 15th Alabama Infantry regiment was left to block the roads at Union Church. Jackson's headquarters were in Madison Hall at Port Republic. The army trains were parked nearby.NPS report on battlefield condition ; Krick, pp. 33-35. Two Union columns converged on Jackson's position. The army of Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont, about 15,000 strong, moved south on the Valley Pike and reached the vicinity of Harrisonburg on June 6. The division of Brig. Gen. James Shields, about 10,000, advanced south from Front Royal in the Luray (Page) Valley, but was badly strung out because of the muddy Luray Road. At Port Republic, Jackson possessed the last intact bridge on the North River and the fords on the South River by which Fr√©mont and Shields could unite. Jackson determined to check Fr√©mont's advance at Mill Creek, while meeting Shields on the east bank of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. A Confederate signal station on Massanutten monitored Union progress.Krick, p. 34-36. Early in the morning on June 8, Fr√©mont's men encountered the Confederate advanced guard near Cross Keys Tavern. A few shots were fired and the Union cavalry fell back onto their main body, which was approaching. Darkness prevented further developments.Tanner, p. 293. thumbright400pxJackson's Valley Campaign: Front Royal to Port Republic Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Colonel Samuel S. Carroll, at the head of a regiment of Union cavalry, supported by an artillery battery and a brigade of infantry, was sent ahead by Shields to secure the North River Bridge at Port Republic. Shortly after dawn (June 8), Carroll scattered the Confederate pickets, forded the South River, and dashed into Port Republic. Jackson and his staff raced down the main street from headquarters and across the bridge, narrowly eluding capture (three members of his staff were captured: Col. Stapleton Crutchfield, Lt. Edward Willis, and Dr. Hunter McGuire).Krick, p. 72, states the three men were prisoners \\"for varying periods of time\\"; Robertson, p. 432, lists only Crutchfield and Willis as captured, based on Willis's account in the Southern Historical Society Papers; the NPS report on battlefield condition cites only two staff members captured. Carroll deployed one gun aimed at the bridge and brought up another. Jackson directed the defense, ordering Captain William T. Poague's battery to unlimber on the north bank. Captain James McD. Carrington brought up a gun from the vicinity of Madison Hall to rake the Main Street. Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson led his 37th Virginia Infantry in a charge across the bridge, where the gun at the opposite end was firing on them with grape shot, to drive the Union cavalry out of the town. Carroll retreated in confusion, losing his two guns, before his infantry could come within range. Three Confederate batteries unlimbered on the bluffs east of Port Republic on the north bank of the South Fork and fired on the retreating Federals. Carroll retired several miles north on the Luray Road. Jackson stationed Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro's brigade in Port Republic and positioned the Stonewall Brigade near Bogota with the artillery to prevent any further surprises.Tanner, pp. 288-93. Meanwhile, Fr√©mont, with Col. Gustave P. Cluseret's brigade in the lead, renewed his advance from the vicinity of Harrisonburg. After driving away the Confederate skirmishers, Cluseret reached and deployed his right flank along the Keezletown Road near Union Church. One by one, the Union brigades came into line: Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck on Cluseret's right, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy on his left, and Brig. Gen. Julius H. Stahel on the far left, his left flank near Congers Creek. Brig. Gen. William H. C. Bohlen's and Col. John A. Koltes's brigades were held in reserve near the center of the line. A regiment of Union cavalry moved south on the road to secure the right flank. Batteries were brought to the front.Cozzens, pp. 460-61. Ewell deployed his infantry division behind Mill Creek, Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade on the right across the Port Republic Road, Brig. Gen. Arnold Elzey's in the center along the high bluffs. Ewell concentrated his artillery (4 batteries) at the center of the line. As Union troops deployed along Keezletown Road, Trimble advanced his brigade a quarter of a mile to Victory Hill and deployed Courtenay's (Latimer's) battery on a hill to his left supported by the 21st North Carolina Infantry. The 15th Alabama, which had been skirmishing near Union Church, rejoined the brigade. Trimble held his regiments out of sight behind the crest of the hill.Cozzens, pp. 457-59. Sketch of the battle-field of Cross Keys, Va. Fr√©mont determined to advance his battle line with the evident intention of enveloping the Confederate position, assumed to be behind Mill Creek. This maneuver required an elaborate right wheel. Stahel's brigade on the far left had the farthest distance to cover and advanced first. Milroy moved forward on Stahel's right and rear. Union batteries were advanced with infantry lines south of Keezletown Road and engaged Confederate batteries. Stahel appeared oblivious to Trimble's advanced position. His battle line passed down into the valley, crossed the run, and began climbing Victory Hill. Suddenly, Trimble's men leaped up and fired all at once into Stahel's brigade. The Confederates were mostly armed with smoothbore muskets, which they loaded with buck and ball shot, and the effect at such close range was completely devastating; Stahel lost 300 men in a matter of moments and the remainder of the green, untested soldiers fled in panic. The Union brigade regrouped on the height opposite Victory Hill but made no effort to renew their assault. Different accounts of the battle place various estimates at how close Trimble was to Stahel when his men opened fire, but 40 yards seems to be a probable distance. The entire episode lasted no more than a minute as the amount of smoke from 1,300 muskets firing quickly made it impossible to see anything and most of the Confederates got off no more than one shot before Stahel's brigade broke and ran.Cozzens, pp. 461; Krick pp. 173, 180. Stahel did not renew his attack but brought up a battery (Buell's) to support his position. Trimble moved the 15th Alabama by the right flank and up a ravine to get on the battery's left. In the meantime, Ewell sent two regiments (13th and 25th Virginia) along the ridge to Trimble's right, attracting a severe fire from the Union battery. With a shout, the 15th Alabama emerged from their ravine and began to climb the hill toward the battery, precipitating a melee. Trimble advanced his other two regiments (16th Mississippi Infantry on the left and 21st Georgia Infantry on the right) from their position on Victory Hill, forcing back the Union line. The Union battery limbered hastily and withdrew, saving its guns. A Union regiment counterattacked briefly, striking the left flank of the 16th Mississippi, but was forced back in desperate fighting.Cozzens, pp. 495-67. Trimble continued advancing up the ravine on the Confederate right, outflanking successive Union positions. In the meantime, Milroy advanced on Stahel's right, supported by artillery. Milroy's line came within rifle-musket range of the Confederate center behind Mill Creek and opened fire. Union batteries continued to engage Confederate batteries in an artillery duel. Bohlen advanced on the far Union left to stiffen Stahel's crumbling defense. Milroy's left flank was endangered by Stahel's retreat, and Fr√©mont ordered him to withdraw. Jackson brought Taylor's brigade forward to support Ewell if needed, but Taylor remained in reserve on the Port Republic Road near the Dunker Church.Krick, p. 219-22, 232. Seemingly paralyzed by the decimation of Stahel's brigade on his left, Fr√©mont was unable to mount a coordinated attack. He ordered Schenck's brigade forward to find the Confederate left flank south of Union Church. Ewell reinforced his left with elements of Elzey's brigade. Severe firing erupted along the line but quickly died down. Confederate Brig. Gen. Elzey and Brig. Gen. George H. Steuart were wounded in this exchange. Fr√©mont withdrew his force to Keezletown Road, placing his artillery on the heights to his rear (Oak Ridge). Artillery firing continued.Krick, pp. 260, 264-65. Aftermath Union casualties totaled 557 killed and wounded and 100 captured, while the Confederates lost fewer than 300 men.Tanner, p. 295. At dusk, Trimble pushed his battle line forward to within a quarter mile of the Union position, anticipating a night assault. Confederate accounts describe the Union soldiers going into camp, lighting fires, and making coffee. Schenck sent out a company to probe the Confederate positions after dark, but after a brief skirmish the company withdrew and no other engagements took place. During the night, Ewell ordered Trimble to withdraw without making the attack.Krick, p. 271-72 Battlefield preservation The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 25, 2018. A key purchase was the 51-acre Widow Pence Farm in the heart of the battlefield. The Trust joined with a local retired surgeon, Irvin Hess, and his wife to purchase the property at auction. The couple has since fully restored the circa 1840 farmhouse. The land is protected through a conservation easement.The New York Times, \\"Living Here ‚Äì Civil War Battlefields\\" September 30, 2005. Accessed May 25, 2018.

Life  Karr was born in Paris, and after being educated at the Coll√®ge Bourbon, became a teacher there. Some of his novels, including his first, Sous les Tilleuls (1832), were autobiographical romances. A second novel, Une heure trop tard, followed next year, and was succeeded by many other popular works. His Vendredi soir (1835) and Le Chemin le plus court (1836) continued the vein of autobiographical romance with which he had made his first success. Genevi√®ve (1838) is one of his best stories, and his Voyage autour de mon jardin (1845) was deservedly popular. Others were Feu Bressier (1848), and Fort en th√®me (1853), which had some influence in stimulating educational reform. In 1839, Karr became editor of Le Figaro, to which he had been a constant contributor; and he also started a monthly journal, Les Gu√™pes, of a keenly satirical tone, a publication which brought him the reputation of a somewhat bitter wit. His epigrams are frequently quoted, for example \\"plus √ßa change, plus c'est la m√™me chose\\", or \\"the more things change, the more they continue to be the same thing, usually translated as \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same\\" (Les Gu√™pes, July 1848). On the proposal to abolish capital punishment, \\"je veux bien que messieurs les assassins commencent\\", i.e. \\"let the gentlemen who do the murders take the first step\\". In 1848, he founded Le Journal. In 1855 he went to live in Nice, where he indulged his predilections for floriculture, and gave his name to more than one new variety, notably the dahlia (New International Encyclopedia). Indeed, he practically founded the trade in cut flowers on the French Riviera. He was also devoted to fishing, and in Les Soir√©es de Sainte-Adresse (1853) and Au bord de la mer (1860) he made use of his experiences. His reminiscences, Livre de bord, were published in 1879‚Äì1880. He died at Saint-Rapha√´l (Var).  Family  Karr's brother Eug√®ne was a talented engineer, and his niece Carme Karr was a writer, journalist and suffragist in La Roche-Mabile.

The bishop's seat is located in the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Chad in the city of Lichfield. The diocese covers of several counties: almost all of Staffordshire, northern Shropshire, a significant portion of the West Midlands, and very small portions of Warwickshire and Powys (Wales). Coat of Arms of the Diocese of Lichfield History The Diocese of Mercia was created by Diuma in around 656 and the see was settled in Lichfield in 669 by the then bishop, Ceadda (later Saint Chad), who built a monastery there. At the Council of Chelsea in 787, Bishop Higbert was raised to the rank of archbishop and given authority over the dioceses of Worcester, Leicester, Lindsey, Hereford, Elmham and Dunwich. This was due to the persuasion of King Offa of Mercia, who wanted an archbishop to rival Canterbury. On Offa's death in 796, however, the Pope removed the archiepiscopal rank and restored the dioceses to the authority of Canterbury. In 803 the Council of Clovesho accepted this decision. During the 9th century, the diocese was devastated by the Vikings. Lichfield itself was unwalled and had become rather poor, so Bishop Peter moved the see to the fortified and wealthier Chester in 1075. His successor, Robert de Limesey, transferred it to Coventry and the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. At this stage it also covered Derbyshire and most of Warwickshire. In 1539 the see was transferred back to Lichfield and the name was reversed to become the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry. A map of the English dioceses during the reign of Henry VIII, from Phillips' new historical atlas (1920) The diocese was one of the largest in medieval England and was divided into five archdeaconries roughly coinciding with the constituent counties or parts of counties: Chester (covering Cheshire and south Lancashire), Coventry, Derby, Salop and Stafford. In 1541 the Diocese of Chester was created and parishes in south Lancashire, Cheshire, Denbighshire and Flintshire were transferred to the new diocese. On 24 January 1837, the archdeaconry of Coventry was transferred to the Diocese of Worcester and the Bishop, see and diocese of Lichfield and Coventry all accordingly renamed Lichfield. In 1884 the archdeaconry of Derby was transferred to the new Diocese of Southwell.From Parson to Professional: The Changing Ministry Of the Anglican Clergy In Staffordshire, 1830‚Äì1960. A thesis written by the Rev. Dr. John W. B. Tomlinson (2008 Birmingham University) In 1877 part of the archdeaconry of Stafford became the archdeaconry of Stoke-upon-Trent (now generally called merely Stoke) and in 1981 the remainder was renamed the archdeaconry of Lichfield. In 1997 another part of the archdeaconry (of Lichfield) was removed to form the new archdeaconry of Walsall, covering Trysull, Walsall, Wednesbury, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton. Bishops The bishop diocesan is assisted by the area bishops of Shrewsbury (responsible for the Salop archdeaconry), Stafford (responsible for the Stoke archdeaconry), and Wolverhampton (responsible for the Lichfield and Walsall archdeaconries). The See of Shrewsbury was in existence from 1888 to 1905, then re-created in 1940; the See of Stafford was created in 1909, and the See of Wolverhampton in 1979. The diocesan area scheme was instituted in 1992. The provincial episcopal visitor (for traditional Anglo-Catholic parishes in this diocese, who have petitioned for alternative episcopal oversight) is Jonathan Goodall, Bishop suffragan of Ebbsfleet, who is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese to facilitate his work there.

It had over 20,000 employees and revenues in excess of 10 billion US dollars. It had over 250 subsidiaries specializing in mining, specialty chemicals (Chemetall), commodity trading, financial services, and engineering (Lurgi). Henry Merton & Company, Ltd was previously a branch of the Metallgesellschaft.Ernest Scott, Australia During the War 1914-18 History Metallgesellschaft AG was incorporated in Frankfurt am Main in 1881 by Wilhelm Ralph Merton, his father Ralph Merton, and Leo Ellinger. Merton was responsible for business strategy, Ellinger for operations, and a cousin of Merton, Zachary Hochschild, for marketing and international activities. Their main competition were the two other large metal trading companies of Germany: Aron Hirsch & Sohn in Halberstadt, and Beer, Sondheimer & Co in Frankfurt am Main. Although Metallgesellschaft was a joint stock company, it was operated like a family business with key positions allocated to long-time loyal employees who were gradually rewarded with stock in the company. In 1889, on the recommendation of chemist Clemens Winkler, chemist Curt Netto accepted a post as head of the technical department. Metallgesellschaft was more diversified than its two main competitors who traded solely in copper, lead, and zinc while Metallgesellschaft also traded aluminum, nickel, and pyrite. The company became more involved internationally as Europe became more reliant on imported metals. In 1884, Metallgesellschaft sent Berthold Hochschild, brother of Zachary Hochschild, to the United States to establish an operation.Stack, Elizabeth.

Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Port Republic was a fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign. Together, the battles of Cross Keys (fought the previous day) and Port Republic were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. Background thumb400pxJackson's Valley Campaign: Front Royal to Port Republic. During the night of June 8-9, 1862, Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's Stonewall Brigade was withdrawn from its forward position near Bogota (a large house owned by Gabriel Jones) and rejoined Jackson's division at Port Republic. Confederate pioneers built a bridge of wagons across the South Fork of the Shenandoah River at Port Republic. Winder's brigade was assigned the task of spearheading the assault against Union forces east of the river. Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade and elements of Col. John M. Patton, Jr.'s, were left to delay Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont's forces at Cross Keys, while the rest of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division marched to Port Republic to be in position to support Winder's attack.NPS report on battlefield condition Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler's brigade joined Col. Samuel Carroll's brigade north of Lewiston on the Luray Road. The rest of Brig. Gen. James Shields's division was strung out along the muddy roads back to Luray. General Tyler, in command on the field, advanced at dawn of June 9 to the vicinity of Lewiston. He anchored the left of his line on a battery positioned on the Lewiston Coaling,Cozzens, p. 481: The name Coaling originated because the Lewis family made charcoal there for their blacksmith shop. extending his infantry west along Lewiston Lane to the South Fork near the site of Lewis's Mill. The right and center were supported by artillery, 16 guns in all.Krick, pp. 309-10. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle Battle of Port Republic. Winder's brigade crossed the river by 5 a.m. and deployed to attack east across the bottomland. Winder sent two regiments (2nd Virginia and 4th Virginia) into the woods to flank the Union line and assault the Coaling. When the main Confederate battle line advanced, it came under heavy fire from the Union artillery and was soon pinned down. Confederate batteries were brought forward onto the plain but were outgunned and forced to seek safer positions. Ewell's brigades were hurried forward to cross the river. Seeing the strength of the Union artillery at the Coaling, Jackson sent Richard Taylor's brigade (including the famed Louisiana Tigers) to the right into the woods to support the flanking column that was attempting to advance through the thick underbrush.Tanner, pp. 300, 302. Winder's brigade renewed its assault on the Union right and center, taking heavy casualties. General Tyler moved two regiments from the Coaling to his right and launched a counterattack, driving Confederate forces back nearly half a mile. While this was occurring, the first Confederate regiments probed the defenses of the Coaling, but were repulsed.Tanner, p. 303. Finding resistance fiercer than anticipated, Jackson ordered the last of Ewell's forces still north of Port Republic to cross the rivers and burn the North Fork bridge. These reinforcements began to reach Winder, strengthening his line and stopping the Union counterattack. Taylor's brigade reached a position in the woods across from the Coaling and launched a fierce attack, which carried the hill, capturing five guns. Tyler immediately responded with a counterattack, using his reserves. These regiments, in hand- to-hand fighting, retook the position. Taylor shifted a regiment to the far right to outflank the Union battle line. The Confederate attack again surged forward to capture the Coaling. Five captured guns were turned against the rest of the Union line. With the loss of the Coaling, the Union position along Lewiston Lane became untenable, and Tyler ordered a withdrawal about 10:30 a.m. Jackson ordered a general advance.Cozzens, pp. 489-90, 494. William B. Taliaferro's fresh Confederate brigade arrived from Port Republic and pressed the retreating Federals for several miles north along the Luray Road, taking several hundred prisoners. The Confederate army was left in possession of the field. Shortly after noon, Fr√©mont's army began to deploy on the west bank of the South Fork, too late to aid Tyler's defeated command, and watched helplessly from across the rain-swollen river. Fr√©mont deployed artillery on the high bluffs to harass the Confederate forces. Jackson gradually withdrew along a narrow road through the woods and concentrated his army in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon Furnace. Jackson expected Fr√©mont to cross the river and attack him on the following day, but during the night Fr√©mont withdrew toward Harrisonburg.Krick, pp. 449, 460; Tanner, p. 306. Aftermath After the dual defeats at Cross Keys and Port Republic, the Union armies retreated, leaving Jackson in control of the upper and middle Shenandoah Valley and freeing his army to reinforce Robert E. Lee before Richmond in the Seven Days Battles.Cozzens, p. 513.

Monastic origins  Between 1216 and 1228, Beatrice, the granddaughter of Wimar, Steward of the Count of Brittany, founded the Priory of St Mary and the Holy Cross in the spinney a mile (1.6 km) from Wicken. The priory accommodated three canons of the Augustinian order. It was endowed with the advowson of the parish church, 55 acres (223,000 m¬≤) of land, a marsh called Frithfen and the fishery of Gormere. Frithfen is likely to have included at least part of the area now known as Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve, although its exact location is unclear. As such this is the earliest record concerning that area, as well as Spinney Priory. For centuries the monastery was associated with the fen, and this continues even now with water being pumped from the farm fields into the Nature Reserve. In 1301 Mary de Bassingbourne expanded the establishment with 90 acres (364,000 m¬≤) more and four more canons. The bad news was that her endowment depended upon the canons feeding three thousand poor people per year ‚Äì a task which they soon enough complained was 'grievous and insupportable'. In 1403 the Prior, William de Lode, was murdered by three of his own canons who stabbed him in the priory church. What happened to the murderers is unrecorded. This grisly tale has given rise to many ghost stories about the Abbey.'Houses of Augustinian canons: Priory of Spinney', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 2 (1948), pp. 249-254. Decline and dissolution of the Priory Fortunes at Spinney declined with the Black Death and the social upheavals of the fourteenth century, and in 1449 Spinney Priory was absorbed into the cathedral priory of Ely, which in due course became Ely Cathedral, once the monastery had been suppressed. From the time of its union with Ely, Spinney Priory ceased to be an Augustinian monastery, and became Benedictine. The priory continued in existence and the almshouses it supported were not immediately abolished. In 1536 Henry VIII began the Dissolution of the Monasteries and Spinney Priory was dissolved. History since the Dissolution Spinney became a private property and was owned by various persons, including Sir Edward Peyton who had been a prominent leader of the puritan party during the reign of Charles I.George E. Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Vol. 1 (1900) Isaac Barrow As a child in 1634, Isaac Barrow, the theologian and mathematician, lived for two years at Spinney Priory, now becoming locally called 'Abbey' which was at that time owned by his grandfather, also named Isaac Barrow. Henry Cromwell Perhaps the most celebrated former owner of Spinney Abbey, and one who actually dwelt there, is Henry Cromwell, the fourth son of Oliver Cromwell. Henry lived in Spinney Abbey after his retirement from his office as Lord Deputy of Ireland at the Restoration. He was a well-respected and capable man, and having petitioned the King was allowed to continue living in peace there despite his father's fate. He owned Spinney from 1659 to his death in 1673, and tradition has it that King Charles II visited him there in September 1671. Henry Cromwell is buried with his wife at Wicken parish church. The New House The new house ‚Äì the current building ‚Äì was built in 1775. The cellar of the original priory still survives below and in it the great stones of the mediaeval masons are seen, along with some iron fittings which have perhaps inevitably gained the reputation of being the remains of mediaeval prisoners' restraints ‚Äì although there is no evidence to support such a tale. Other older parts are incorporated into the building ‚Äì some of the old priory doors, for example. The farm had problems with flooding, and until the installation of the diesel pumps which still drain it today, this has always been a difficulty. A number of tenants came and went with little success. By 1883 the owner and occupier was Robert Chambers Golding, known as 'Old Golding'. He built the large barn known as Old Golding's Barn, which is still in use. It bears his initials 'RG'. His son, Chambers Waddelow Golding, known as 'Young Golding', was an eccentric who drank himself to an early death. He once took a horse upstairs, and the imprint of a hoof can be discerned upon the stairs still. The Fuller family Since at least 1695 in adjacent Padney, the Fuller family had been farming alongside Spinney Abbey. In 1892 Thomas Fuller brought his family to farm at Spinney Abbey, and by 1918 the freehold was in the family, and has remained there with various changes to the farm boundaries. In 1900 the farm was a mixed, mainly arable farm. it is still a working farm now farming traditional slow-growing breeds, English Longhorn cattle and Gloucester Old Spots pigs. In 2012 Spinney Abbey Farm launched their first cider: \\"Monk & Disorderly\\" which won champion cider at Norwich Beer Festival 2013, 2015, 2016 & 2018 and St Ives 2014 & 2016\\\\. New ciders followed: \\"Virgin on the Ridiculous\\", \\"Fruity Friar\\", \\"Dirty Habit\\" and most recently \\"Rhubarb\\". Local folklore & legends Local tales tell how monks can still be heard chanting at night, and that their ghosts have been seen. The bank at the southern edge of the farm is called Spinney Bank, and is a location notorious for sightings of the mythical 'Old Shuck'. Other associations Spinney Abbey is the name of the setting for the 1984 detective novel The Jerusalem Inn by Martha Grimes in her 'Inspector Jury' series.

Stone row at Beaghmore. Stone circle and cairn at Beaghmore. Beaghmore is a complex of early Bronze Age megalithic features, stone circles and cairns, 8.5 miles north west of Cookstown, County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, on the south-east edge of the Sperrin Mountains. Mackay's Dictionary of Ulster Place-names says that it is from an Bheitheach Mh√≥r, meaning \\"big place of birch trees\\", a name that reflects the fact that the area was a woodland before being cleared by Neolithic farmers. Some documents suggest that Beaghmore translates into English as \\"the moor of the birches\\" but this is plainly wrong, as there is no Irish word for moor that sounds like the English word moor (the usual word is caor√°n). Beaghmore stone circles, alignments and cairns are State Care Historic Monuments in the townland of Beaghmore, in the Cookstown District Council area, grid ref: Area of H684 842. At Beaghmore a cairn (grid ref: H6872 8470), a cairn (grid ref: H6856 8472), stone circles, alignments and cairns (grid ref: area of H684 842), round cairn with standing stones: Bradley's Cairn (grid ref: H6830 8401) and cairn and alignment (grid ref: H6863 8431), are all Scheduled Historic Monuments. Excavation The site was discovered by George Barnett in the late 1930s during peat cutting when 1,269 stones were uncovered, and partially excavated in 1945‚Äì1949 when it was taken into state care. It was also excavated again in 1965. Investigation of the site and the surrounding bog indicate that the area was occupied from Neolithic times through the Bronze Age. The stone circles and cairn are attributed to the earlier part of the Bronze Age c. 2,000‚Äì1,200 BC. It is possible that the full extent of the complex has not yet been revealed and further stones and cairns may still lie hidden in the adjacent peat. Hearths and deposits of flint tools were discovered and have been carbon dated to 2900-2600BC. Several of the stone rows run over the tumbled walls of field structures which also date from the Neolithic period. Excavation of one of the cairns revealed a polished porcellanite axe, which may have originated from the Tievebulliagh axe factory, some 70 miles away in County Antrim. The largest cairn featured a central pit containing an oak branch. Features There are seven low stone circles of different sizes, six of which are paired, twelve cairns and ten stone rows. The circles are between 10 and 20m in diameter, and are associated with earlier burial cairns and alignments of stone rows lead towards them. The stones are small with few more than 0.5m in height and the circles are distorted, suggesting they are related to kerbs surrounding some megalithic tombs. The singular circle is distinguished from the paired circles by its slightly larger stones. It is also unique in that the interior of the circle is filled with more than 800 small stones which have been placed upright within the circle and are known as \\"the dragon's teeth\\". Most of these circles have small stone alignments touching them at a tangent. The site also includes a dozen small stone cairns, frequently covering a cremation burial. Each of the three pairs of stone circles have a small cairn placed in between. A typical feature of the stone rows is a high and low arrangement where short rows of tall stones run beside much longer rows of small stones. The stone rows radiate from the circles in a roughly north-east direction. The site also consists of low banks of small stones running below, and possibly pre-dating, the other structures which may have been field walls in the Neolithic period. Excavation has revealed that the site overlays a Neolithic cultivation site, and it is thought that the stones may have been erected in response to deteriorating soil fertility and the encroachment of peat. Following excavation a system of drainage channels had to be laid to prevent the stones from being reclaimed once again by the bog. Function Possibly the site could mark a focal point for religious and/or social gatherings. Some archaeologists believe that the circles have been constructed in relation to the rising of the sun at the solstice, or to record the movements of the sun and moon acting as observatories for particular lunar, solar or stellar events. Three of the stone rows point to the sunrise at the time of the solstice and another is aligned towards moonrise at the same period. However, most of the remains at Beaghmore do not indicate very accurate alignments upon specific astronomical features. Because of the number of stone cairns on the site it is possible that at least part of the function of the site was burial. Some cairns have been found to hold cremated human remains, occasionally contained in a small cist. But not all the cairns have burial remains and they could have had other purposes, or perhaps are simply accumulations of surplus stones.

When the building was replaced in 1795, it was painted red and white and called \\"The Old Red School House.\\" Postal service Flagtown has its own post office (ZIP code 08821) but no house-to-house mailbox delivery, therefore residents have no other option than to have a P.O. box address. Some residents (on the main streets, not the side streets) have the option to have home delivery if they accept Hillsborough as their postal address. Prior to the Hillsborough post office's existence, Neshanic previously had covered partial Flagtown home delivery. The Flagtown post office is especially small (despite some expansion work done within the last 10 years), and usually manned by one or two workers at any given time, who take care of all jobs themselves. It can be uncomfortably crowded in the p.o. box foyer/window area if a mere 4-5 customers are in line, or retrieving mail from their boxes. There's very limited parking, as the post office is part of an apartment/storefront, sharing the building with a small local deli and two residential apartments. A gas station/car repair shop, a separate building, shares the parking lot. During the 4th of July and Flag Day, the Flagtown post office has an inordinate amount of extra mail than normal because there is no \\"Flagtown\\" in any other states, therefore people come from afar to drop off their outgoing postcards and letters to be hand-canceled by Flagtown on days relating to the flag, making the cancellation name and date a unique souvenir. Fire Department Despite the small size of Flagtown, they have their own volunteer fire department, the Hillsborough Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1. They have been known for years for having green fire trucks rather than the typical red, often referred to as \\"Mean and Green.\\" They were originally pine green, but the more modern trucks are a fluorescent lime green, almost yellow, making them instantly stand out and recognizable. The Flagtown Fire Department was the first fire company formed in the township of Hillsborough, the largest township in the county of Somerset, state of New Jersey. In 1937, seven members of the Township Board of Trade decided that Hillsborough needed its own fire company, and on May 27, 1938, the Hillsborough Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 received its charter. They purchased its first fire truck that same year, a used chemical engine; nine years later they bought a surplus army fire truck. The trucks had originally been housed in a garage at the Clawson Machine Shop for eight years, but in 1946 they built a firehouse for the trucks. Lumber for the building was donated by Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress (who lived in the area), and the building has been added to and restructured over the years to house more trucks and meet the needs of the department. It's been a tradition for many years for Santa to ride around Flagtown atop one of the fire trucks near Christmas time, \\"Ho ho ho-ing\\" over the PA system and making personal pit-stops to kids on the block, distributing toys and candy.

He won 65 caps at centre for Scotland from 1986 to 1997. Scott is the younger brother of Scottish great Gavin Hastings. They both earned their first cap on 17 January 1986 against France. When he retired, he was Scotland's most-capped player ever. Twice a member of the British Lions in 1989 (Australia) and 1993 (New Zealand) where he suffered a shattered cheekbone and did not play against the All Blacks. Rugby Although sometimes overshadowed by his brother Gavin, Scott Hastings is himself one of the greatest players in Scottish rugby history.Bath, p139-140 :\\"He first entered the Scottish squad set-up in 1986 as one of the most cocksure personalities they had ever met. And while that wild joie de vivre and natural ebullience has sometimes since overspilled off the pitch, they have been a positive boon. In his early days, Scott was most notable for his searing pace, straight-running and ability to break the gain line virtually every time he received the ball. It was not long, however, before his bullocking runs from the centre were complemented by the stonewall defensive qualities which were to remain the salient quality in his game as his pace faded later on.\\" Bath also reminds us of Scott Hastings' proudest moment: :\\"If there is one moment for which he will long be remembered, it was during the 1990 Grand Slam decider, the proudest day in Scottish rugby history. English winger Rory Underwood had scythed through the Scottish defence when Hastings managed to drag him down short of the line when a try seemed inevitable.\\" After retirement Scott was invited to open Dunstane City Hotel, near Murrayfield, in 2008. Scott has appeared as a guest presenter on STV's daily lifestyle show The Hour on a few occasions ‚Äì his first show being in November 2009, alongside main anchor Michelle McManus. The Scottish magazine programme airs weekdays at 5pm. He was a co-commentator for ITV's coverage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. On 10 July 2014, he made his d√©but on the BBC's political discussion show Question Time. Scott was part of the ITV team covering the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He is the regular host of \\"Just a sports quiz\\" an annual event held in Murrayfield to raise money for research into Motor Neuron Disease at the Euan MacDonald Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Family His older brother Gavin was also a Lions and Scotland international rugby union player. His daughter, Kerry-Anne represents Scotland at Hockey. References * Bath, Richard (ed.)

Most recently, he has been a Writing Fellow for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, as well as a Phelps Stokes Fund Senior Fellow. Since 1993, Powell has published 11 books, including Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays. Powell's childhood memoir, My Own Private Ghetto, and The Kevin Powell Reader were published in 2011 and 2012 respectively.About Kevin Powell Kevin Powell for Congress, 2010 Media appearances and lectures Powell has hosted and produced programming for HBO and BET; written a screenplay; hosted and written an award-winning MTV documentary about post- riot Los Angeles; and, in 2001, was the Guest Curator of the Brooklyn Museum's \\"Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes, and Rage\\" ‚Äî which originated at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. He has lectured in 48 states at colleges, universities, community centers, prisons, religious institutions, conferences, and festivals, as well as in corporate settings (including Harvard University and the United Nations). Powell is a frequent guest commentator on VH1, MTV, BET, and other media platforms about popular culture, political and social justice issues. Activism Beginning with his days as a teenager at Rutgers University, he participated in the student-led anti- apartheid movement ‚Äì the drive to end white supremacy in South Africa. Powell has worked on issues of police brutality and racial bias cases and he has worked for years around voting rights. As a result of his own past struggles, Powell has committed his life to personal healing and professional therapeutic counseling. He is an outspoken critic of violence against women and girls, of violence in general, and he has been at the forefront of the movement to redefine American manhood away from sexism and violence. Powell produced the 10-city \\"State of Black Men National Townhall Meetings\\" tour (2004), numerous Black male think tank sessions, and \\"Black and Male in America, a 3-Day National Conference\\" (2007) (www.blackandmaleinamerica.org). He holds an annual holiday party and clothing drive every December in New York City to benefit the homeless teenagers of the SafeHorizon non-profit organization. He co-founded the grassroots community townhall series Hiphop Speaks! (with social entrepreneur, activist, and writer April Silver), which he describes as \\"a series of forums and MC battles geared toward using hip hop as a tool for social change.\\" Powell participated in Gulf Coast disaster relief efforts, facilitating the delivery of goods and services to the affected regions, and being a co-founder (with social commentator Jeff Johnson) of \\"Katrina on the Ground,\\" an initiative that sent over 700 college students to work in the devastated region. African-American social networking tool BlackPlanet featured Powell as \\"Riser of the Month\\" in February 2011 for his support of the African-American community. Politics In 2006, Powell launched his first bid to unseat Edolphus Towns in New York's 10th congressional district, located in Brooklyn, discontinuing his campaign in July of that year. In 2008, Powell ran for Congress again, in a campaign that was backed by celebrities such as Chris Rock and what ABC News described as \\"big names from Brooklyn's 10th district\\". During the campaign, Towns made frequent reference to Powell's self-professed early history of violence against women, issues Powell has discussed in his early writings and has indicated he has overcome through therapy. These references were addressed by Powell in an open letter to Ed Towns, where he also appealed to Mr. Towns to focus on issues. In a June 2008 interview with Theodore Hamm in The Brooklyn Rail, Powell addressed media coverage focusing on his past: \\"My issue of violence against women happened between 1987‚Äì1991, which is now seventeen years ago. I've written about it very prominently [...] I think if you're going to be a public servant, regardless if you're an elected official ... you have a responsibility to be transparent and accountable for everything you do.\\" On July 9, 2008, comedian David Chapelle failed to appear at a Powell fundraiser, despite promises to the paying guests. This was followed by Powell hosting an event at Brooklyn favorite haunt Junior's, where he invited the media to witness him respond to what The Brooklyn Paper described as a \\"mean spirited column\\" in the Daily News focusing on his history of violence. As reported by \\"Page Six,\\" at a dinner on July 28, 2008, Powell \\"slipped up\\" when he told an audience of some \\"40 representatives of Williamsburg's ultra-Orthodox Satmar [Hasidic Jewish] community\\" that if elected, he would \\"bring home the bacon.\\" Bacon is not permitted as part of a kosher diet. On September 3, media reported that the Powell campaign had received a notice from the Federal Election Commission informing them that Powell was not officially registered as a candidate for Congress. As he was not a candidate, his continued fundraising efforts constituted a violation of FEC regulations, and the Powell campaign was asked to disavow such activities within 30 days. As of September 4, the Kevin Powell for Congress campaign had not filed its mandatory Pre-Primary report of all campaign contributions to the FEC, though the report was due August 28. The same day these stories broke, local periodical The Brooklyn Paper announced its endorsement of Powell over 13-time incumbent and sitting congressman, Edolphus \\"Ed\\" Towns. But in light of these revelations, a Paper reporter broke news of the FEC letter and missed deadline and contacted the Powell camp for comment. This paper noted, \\"Powell did not return repeated requests from The Brooklyn Paper for comment about the FEC letter and his missed filing.\\" Powell lost this race 67%‚Äì32%, receiving 11,046 votes compared to 22,586 for Edolphus Towns. Powell announced that he would run again in 2010. Powell lost again in 2010 and later ruled out running in 2012. Litigation In 2017, Powell sued the creators of Tupac Shakur biopic All Eyez On Me for copyright infringement claiming it derived from Powell's interviews with Shakur. In his complaint, Powell admitted that, \\"While some of the content [in the articles Powell wrote in Vibe Magazine] was factual, some portions of the article were changed or embellished by Plaintiff.\\" The suit was later dropped. In 2018, Powell and his wife were sued by Minneapolis choreographer April Sellers because the couple had issued an open letter slandering her and ruining her career due to an email his wife received from somebody also named April Sellers. This resulted in a verdict against Powell for $210,000.

Simon was appointed interim president of the university in 2003, then served as president from 2005 until her resignation in 2018. Since December 2017, Simon has been John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor in the College of Education at MSU. From 2012 to 2014, Simon served as chair of the executive committee of National Collegiate Athletic Association. She also served as chair of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch. Education Simon received her Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1969. She earned a Master of Science in student personnel and counseling from Indiana State University in 1970. In 1974 Simon earned a Ph.D. in higher education from MSU. She is married and lives in East Lansing. Career= Michigan State University  Simon was hired by MSU to be a faculty member. Over the following years, she served in a sequence of increasingly-senior administrative positions: Assistant Director of the Office of Institutional Research, Assistant Provost for General Academic Administration, Associate Provost, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs from 1993-2004, and interim president from April 25, 2003 to September 30, 2003 while then-President M. Peter McPherson served as a representative of President George W. Bush in the reconstruction of Iraq. On June 8, 2004, the MSU Board of Trustees voted unanimously to appoint Simon as President with a three-year, US$340,000-a-year, contract effective January 1, 2005. In January 2006, the Board of Trustees increased Simon's salary to US$425,000 although President Simon and her husband Roy Simon donated that year's increase back to the university's capital campaign. In 2006, Simon decided to add Michigan State University to the list of institutions opposing the passage of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, an initiative that ended affirmative action in the state of Michigan. In 2017, Michigan State's role in the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case led to a large outcry from students, faculty, state legislators, alumni and others, including calls for President Simon to step down. Nassar, a sports physician at MSU from 1997 to 2016, pleaded guilty in a Michigan court to seven charges of sexual assault and faces accusations of sexual assault from more than 150 young girls and women. The Detroit News reported that 14 MSU representatives, including Simon, had been told of sexual misconduct by Nassar across two decades. While the MSU trustees initially voiced support for Simon, public pressure continued to grow until January 24, 2018, when the Michigan House of Representatives approved a resolution calling on the Michigan State University Board of Trustees to fire Simon. On January 24, 2018, Simon announced her resignation from the presidency. Simon drew further criticism for her resignation letter, which critics felt did not take adequate responsibility for her role, instead characterizing the \\"blame\\" directed at her as a result of the case being \\"politicized.\\" Simon signed her resignation letter with her title \\"John A. Hannah Distinguished Professor,\\" a prestigious professorship most were unaware she had been awarded the previous December. The appointment then received criticism from numerous faculty members across the University, due to Simon's career being strictly in administrative roles with virtually no faculty experience, and on the basis of it having been a direct appointment by the trustees bypassing usual academic procedure. Following her resignation, Simon's contract allowed for a 12-month research leave at her full presidential salary, after which she could officially assume her faculty position in the department of educational administration. On November 20, 2018, Simon was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanor counts for lying to the police about her knowledge of sexual abuse committed by Nassar. MSU interim President John Engler announced that Simon would be taking an immediate leave of absence from the university, without pay.  NCAA  In August 2012, while president of MSU, Simon began a two-year term as chair of the NCAA's executive committee. Elected to the position one week after the committee's sanctions of Penn State for the university's part in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse case, Simon said her goal was to \\"build trust and confidence back in the system.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Michigan State University biography of Simon (archived from 2017) * MSU summary of Simon's tenure Indiana State University alumni Presidents of Michigan State University Michigan State University alumni Living people Year of birth missing (living people) Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lou Anna Simon"},{"id":"1351406","text":"John Carl Schoenherr (July 5, 1935 ‚Äì April 8, 2010) was an American illustrator. He won the 1988 Caldecott Medal for U.S. children's book illustration, recognizing Owl Moon by Jane Yolen, which recounts the story of the first time a father takes his youngest child on a traditional outing to spot an owl. He was posthumously inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015. Life Schoenherr was born in New York City (Manhattan) and raised in Queens, \\"in a German-speaking household in a polyglot community\\", where he used drawings to communicate with speakers of other languages. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, and studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Will Barnet and at Pratt Institute. Schoenherr was a resident of Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey. He died on April 8, 2010, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Easton, Pennsylvania. Career Schoenherr may be known best as the original illustrator of the dust jacket art of Dune, a 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert that inaugurated a book series and media franchise. He had previously illustrated the serializations of the novel in Analog, an endeavor which secured him a 1965 Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist. He later did the art for the Analog serialization of Herbert's Children of Dune. In 1978 Berkley Books published The Illustrated Dune, an edition of Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by Schoenherr. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar. Schoenherr was also very well known as a wildlife artist and children's book illustrator, with over forty books to his credit. Most of his black-and-white illustration work used the scratchboard technique, and he was long known as the only commercial artist who specialized in it. His paintings were often egg tempera, another unusual medium. Schoenherr also completed paintings for NASA. Schoenherr's knowledge of zoology was very useful in creating alien creatures. He was a member of the American Society of Mammalogists, the Society of Animal Artists, and the Society of Illustrators. Beginning in the 1960s, Schoenherr created numerous science fiction illustrations, in addition to artwork in other genres. Among the books he illustrated are The Wolfling and Rascal by Sterling North, the latter a Newbery Honor Book. Under John W. Campbell, Jr. and Ben Bova at Analog, he also illustrated the first Dragonriders of Pern stories by Anne McCaffrey, the 1967/1968 novellas \\"Weyr Search\\" and \\"Dragonrider\\" (each featured on one Analog cover as well) that were subsequently developed as the novel Dragonflight. Schoenherr's July 1975 cover for Analog has been cited as influential in the designs for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. He also worked for paperback and hardcover science fiction publishers like Ace Books and Doubleday.

His nicknames were \\"The Great White Shark\\" and \\"JJ\\", the former widely thought to be because of his blonde hair, though in a 1990 book called 'The Grudge' by Tom English, it is a nickname that was given to him because of his very white skin.Bath, p141 Journalist, Richard Bath, described him as \\"one of the most galvanising sights in Five Nations rugby throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.\\" Jeffrey was educated at St. Mary's School, Melrose and Merchiston Castle School. He won forty caps for Scotland between 1984 and 1991, making him, at the time, Scotland's most capped flanker. He was also a British and Irish Lion with Scotland team mate Finlay Calder in 1989. Jeffrey's \\"day job\\" was his Borders farm, of which he had only one regret: \\"If I stand on a hill I can see England.\\" Player Often known to be first to the breakdown point, first with the tackle, or first with an inspired counter, Jeffrey had the ability to score important tries, of which he scored 11, another Scottish record at the time, shared with back-row colleague Derek White. He was also a member of the British Lions (known as British and Irish Lions since 2001) on the tour to Australia in 1989. In 1988, after playing football with the Calcutta Cup along Princes Street in Edinburgh with England's Dean Richards, Jeffrey received a six-month ban from the Scottish Rugby Union. Richards received a one match sentence from the English Rugby Football Union. The trophy was severely dented, and cost hundreds of pounds to repair. Jeffrey later admitted to having been drunk at the time of the incident: \\"There was no doubt it was us. It was a mix of alcohol and high jinks. I think I had sobered up a bit by the time I got back to the hotel. I remember looking at the cup and thinking, ‚Äòhmmm, we could be in a spot of bother here‚Äô.\\" During the 1990 Hong Kong Sevens, Jeffrey played for the Scottish side, but when they were knocked out, he went on to play for Wales as they were suffering from too many injuries. Scottish Grand Slam (1990) He was an outstanding performer in the Grand Slam season of 1990, Jeffrey had been a British Lion on the 1989 Tour of Australia, ironically being kept out of the Test side by his national team- mates Finlay Calder and Derek White, and Englishmen Mike Teague who would be on the losing side against Jeffrey in the Calcutta Cup match the following year.

The products traded on this exchange vary from German and Swiss debt instruments to European stocks and various stock indexes. All transactions executed on Eurex Exchange are cleared through Eurex Clearing, which functions as a central counterparty (CCP) for multi-asset class clearing of the above- mentioned exchange-traded product range as well as over-the-counter traded products. According to the 2015 Futures Industry Association‚Äôs annual survey, Eurex Exchange is ranked as the world's third-largest derivatives exchange by contract volume. The Exchange is headquartered in Eschborn, Germany, near Frankfurt am Main and it is operated by Eurex Frankfurt AG and Eurex Z√ºrich AG, which are public companies wholly owned by the German stock exchange operator Deutsche B√∂rse AG.  History  In the 1990s, Europe went through a power shift in its financial sector. London (LIFFE, London Financial Futures Exchange) began to lose dominance in trading German government bonds futures (The Bund) to the Frankfurt-based, Deutsche Terminb√∂rse (DTB). This event has come to be known as the ‚ÄòBattle of the Bund‚Äô. The DTB was one of the world's first electronic exchanges, and by 1997 had distributed its screens across Europe and into the United States. As the DTB was in the midst of a battle to wrench liquidity in the Bund contract away from its chief cross-continental rival, the open outcry operated LIFFE, it began the merger proceedings with SOFFEX (the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange). The shift started gradually but then followed a ‚Äútipping point‚Äù dynamic that began in early 1998. All of these dynamic changes led in 1998 to the creation of Eurex. Its creation took almost a decade of close cooperation between the DTB and SOFFEX and their parent companies, Deutsche B√∂rse AG and SIX Swiss Exchange to be completed. Eurex was jointly operated by Deutsche B√∂rse and the SIX Swiss Exchange with the German group holding 50 percent of the voting rights and 85 percent of the share capital. This joint leadership lasted until January 2012, when Deutsche B√∂rse acquired the remaining shares in Eurex Zurich AG from SIX Group AG, making Deutsche B√∂rse the sole owner of the pan-European derivatives exchange. Eurex has nine worldwide representative offices. Trading technology The open outcry style of trading was still the norm in the US and the UK in 1998. Eurex Exchange was one of the first to offer a fully electronic trading platform as opposed to the traditional forms, such as open outcry or pit trading, available at the time. That means buyers and sellers transact from remote locations and are brought together through an electronic trading platform and network. The platform used today, was launched in 2013 and it is known as the T7 trading architecture. T7 was originally developed by Deutsche B√∂rse Group and it advanced electronic derivatives trading. This robust and reliable trading system connects more than 7,700 traders in over 35 countries, trading more than 7.0 million contracts daily.

In a career lasting from 1948 to 1972, he became the 15th player to score one hundred first-class centuries; he was the first batsman beginning his career after the Second World War to reach this milestone. He played for Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, and helped Worcestershire win the county championship for the first time in their history. His achievements for England after being recalled in 1966 have been described as \\"the stuff of legend.\\" Graveney was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1953, captained England on one occasion and was awarded the OBE while still playing. His international career ended at the age of 42 when he played in a benefit match on the rest day of a Test match. He was banned for three matches, and was never selected for England again. In later life he worked as a cricket commentator for BBC Television and was the first former professional to be President of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He was one of the first 55 players inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. Early life Graveney was born on 16 June 1927 in the village of Riding Mill, near Hexham, Northumberland, one of five children born to Jack and Mary Graveney. One of his two brothers was the cricketer Ken Graveney. His father worked for the armaments manufacturer Vickers Armstrong in Newcastle-upon-Tyne as an engineer. After Jack's death in 1933, Mary married another engineer. The family moved to Lancashire and, in 1938, to Bristol so that Graveney's step-father could take up a position at Avonmouth Docks. Graveney attended Bristol Grammar School, playing cricket, hockey, rugby and golf all to a very high standard. He started work as an accountant, leaving after a few days to join the Army in 1946, as his older brother Ken had done. He served in Suez with the Gloucestershire Regiment as a second lieutenant in 1946, and was later promoted to the rank of captain in the sports depot. At school he had been primarily a bowler, but when playing cricket on concrete pitches in Egypt with the army, he specialised more in batting, using his height and technique. On home leave in August 1947, he was asked to play in some benefit matches for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club ‚Äì an invitation made at the suggestion of Ken, who was already playing as a bowler for the club. On the basis of Graveney's performances, he was offered a contract to play for the county for ¬£200 annually and although he enjoyed life in the army, he accepted. Cricketing career=Gloucestershire and England He played his first first-class match for Gloucestershire against Oxford University Cricket Club in April 1948 but failed to score, and did not become a regular member of the side until later in the season. He was the 12th man when the county played the touring Australian team of 1948 ‚Äì known as \\"the Invincibles\\" ‚Äì who scored 783 runs for 6 wickets. In the 1949 season, he scored 1,784 runs and started to be mentioned as a potential England player. At that time, selectors were having difficulty finding new batsmen to play alongside Len Hutton and Denis Compton, and tried many possibilities. After Compton had sustained an injury, Graveney was selected for the Old Trafford Test match against South Africa in 1951, scoring 15 runs. Graveney was not selected for the following Test match, but joined the 1951‚Äì52 tour of India and Pakistan after scoring 2,291 runs for Gloucestershire during the season. He scored his first Test century on this tour, taking eight hours to score 175 runs in the second Test in Bombay (after missing the first because of dysentery). By the end of the tour, he had established his place in the national team, and (in the words of The Times) was regarded as \\"England's outstanding young batsman\\", along with Peter May. Graveney's attacking style as a batsman did not find favour with Hutton, the captain, who (in the words of one commentator) \\"did not want flowery batsmen but fighters\\" in the attempt to regain the Ashes from Australia. In the late afternoon of the Test match at Lord's in 1953, when Hutton and Graveney were in control with the score at 143 for 1 and Graveney was looking to score a century, Hutton told Graveney to stop attacking for the rest of the day and only 34 runs were scored in the last hour. Early the next morning, Graveney was dismissed by the refreshed Australian bowling attack without adding to his overnight score of 78. Nevertheless, England won the series and took the Ashes, which Australia had held since 1934. Graveney was named one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year for 1953. Hutton again curbed Graveney's attacking instincts during the 1953‚Äì54 tour of the West Indies after Graveney had started by hitting successive boundaries, telling him to \\"grind this one out\\". Hutton later described Graveney as \\"not quite the chap for the big occasion\\" when Graveney's largest contribution to the 1954‚Äì55 tour of Australia was a century in the final Test match, by which point England had already won the series. He had been dropped for two matches earlier in the series after being dismissed for 0 when playing an aggressive shot when the match situation called for caution. After a poor series against South Africa in 1955 ‚Äì where he suffered a permanent injury to the little finger of his left hand when acting as substitute wicket-keeper ‚Äì he was dropped midway through the 1956 tour by the Australians and was not selected for the winter tour to South Africa. Perhaps jokingly, he later put his failure to be selected for the South Africa tour to the fact that he had beaten the chairman of selectors, Gubby Allen, at a round of golf. His form in county cricket in 1957, where he was the leading run- scorer for the second successive season, prompted his recall to play the West Indies. Although he was dismissed for 0 at Lords, he scored 258 at Trent Bridge (his highest score in first-class cricket) and a further century later in the series. Poor performances in the following year and the 1958‚Äì59 tour to Australia again led to his being dropped. One Australian journalist, the former cricket Jack Fingleton, said afterwards that he did not think that Graveney's \\"smiling nature fits in with the seriousness of Test cricket\\". Move to Worcestershire Graveney was appointed captain of Gloucestershire in 1959, but was not suited to the job. The team finished in second place in the county championship that year, but dropped to eighth place in 1960. Discontent with his captaincy led the county to replace him after the end of the 1960 season with Tom Pugh, a less talented batsmen who (according to The Times) was \\"a young and inexperienced amateur who was barely worth his place in the side\\". Graveney left Gloucestershire on discovering that it had been decided when giving the captaincy to Graveney that Pugh would be his successor. This meant that Graveney did not play first-class cricket in 1961, as Gloucestershire required him to meet the residence qualification for his new club, Worcestershire, for before being allowed to play for them. His performances for Worcestershire in 1962 led to his recall to the England team, where he scored two centuries and averaged 100 in the series against Pakistan, but he failed again on the winter tour of Australia and was dropped. He helped Worcestershire win the county championship in 1964 and 1965, the first time that they had done so, and reached the landmark of one hundred first-class centuries in 1964 (the 15th person, and the first player starting his career after the Second World War, to do so). Final matches for England and retirement Recalled by England in 1966 against the West Indies, he scored heavily, included 165 at the Oval, aged 39, described as \\"arguably the best innings of his life\\" by one report. He later said that his England recall \\"came totally out of the blue\\" and that a West Indian supporter in the crowd shouted \\"Heh, Graveney, haven't they got a pension scheme in this country?\\" He remained in the team in the following seasons, performing well at home and on tour, and captaining England against Australia for one match in 1968 when Colin Cowdrey was unavailable. He was vice-captain for three years. He was awarded the OBE in 1968, described by one writer as a \\"rare distinction\\" for someone still playing. His final Test match was against the West Indies in 1969. It was also his benefit season with Worcestershire. In those days, the Sunday of the Test match was a rest day, and he had arranged to play in an exhibition match in Luton (\\"Tom Graveney's XI v Bobby Simpson's XI\\"), a match that earned him ¬£1,000. For comparison, his salary from Worcestershire in 1966 was ¬£850. He was banned for three matches as a result, as the chairman of the selectors Alec Bedser stated that he had told Graveney before the Test match not to play in the Sunday game. Graveney said that he had told Bedser before being chosen for the Test match that he was committed to the Luton game, but to no avail. He continued to play for Worcestershire, captaining the side from 1968 to 1970, and had the second-highest batting average in the 1970 season. Finding fielding increasingly tiring, although still enjoying batting, he left Worcestershire in 1970 and took up a position as player-coach for Queensland, returning after an unsuccessful period in Australia in 1972. Records and appreciation In all, he played 79 Test matches for England between 1951 and 1969, scoring 4,882 runs at an average of 44.38 with a high score of 258 and 11 centuries. He scored 47,793 first-class runs (a figure bettered by only eight players), making 122 centuries. He is the only player to have scored more than 10,000 runs for two counties. He was described by The Daily Telegraph as \\"the greatest, as well as the most elegant and graceful, professional batsman to emerge in Britain in the years after the Second World War\\", and as \\"a throwback to cricket's golden age\\" with his attacking power and technique. The cricket writer Scyld Berry called him \\"a glorious stroke- maker condemned to play in a dour age.\\" The Independent said that although he \\"never entirely won the trust\\" of the England selectors, \\"the exquisiteness of his touch never faded\\" and his achievements for England after his recall in 1966 \\"were the stuff of legend.\\" The Times described him as \\"one of the finest English batsmen of the 1950s and 1960s, and arguably the most elegant of them all.\\" Post-cricket career Tom Graveney's career performance graph After retiring from cricket, he worked in various roles, including a squash club manager in Essex and a pub landlord in Prestbury, Gloucestershire. His wife, Jackie, said that being a publican was the first proper job Graveney had had in his life. For many years 3D Cricket in Cheltenham ran indoor cricket coaching courses advertised as 'Tom Graveney cricket courses' for young and adult cricketers. In 1979, he joined the BBC as a television cricket commentator and became the first former professional cricketer to be elected president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2004. He served as president of Worcestershire from 1994 to 1998. He was one of the first 55 people to be enrolled in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. His final cricket match was in 1995, when he played for the Lord's Taverners against the MCC President's XI: he scored 1 run before being caught by David Frost off the bowling of the actor Robert Powell. He continued to play golf, playing off a single-figure handicap, and building up a large collection of stamps, a hobby that he had begun when touring overseas. Jackie, whom he married in 1952, developed Alzheimer's in later life and Graveney moved into a care home to be with her until her death in 2013. He died on 3 November 2015, aged 88, in the week after his brother Ken's death. He and Jackie had two children, Tim and Rebecca. His nephew, David (the son of his brother Ken), played for Gloucestershire and was later chairman of the England selectors.

It appears that the captain of the ship which brought him to Jamaica there sold him to John Wedderburn of Ballendean, Scotland. Wedderburn had Knight serve in his household, and took him along when he returned to Scotland in 1769. On Knight leaving his service, Wedderburn had him arrested and brought before the local justices of the peace. Inspired by Somersett's Case (1772) in England, in which the English courts had held that slavery did not exist under English common law, Knight resisted his claim. Knight won his claim after two appeals, in a case that established the principle that Scots law would not uphold the institution of slavery (except in the case of enslaved colliers and salters who had to wait until the end of the century for emancipation). Early life Joseph Knight was born in Guinea, according to the pleadings submitted on his behalf in the Court of Session; it is not known to which people, or what his original name was. He was transported to Jamaica as a child, where he was sold as a slave to John Wedderburn of Ballendean. Wedderburn employed him as a domestic servant. In 1769 Wedderburn returned to Scotland, taking Knight with him. Three years later a 1772 decision in England known as Somersett's Case cast doubt on the legality of slavery under the common law of England. Knight v. Wedderburn While in Scotland, Knight was baptised and married Ann Thompson, a servant of the Wedderburn family, with whom he had at least one child. He sought, and was refused permission by Wedderburn, to live with his wife in family. On Wedderburn refusing, Knight then left his service. Wedderburn appears to have been indignant, feeling that he had bestowed considerable gifts on Knight by educating him and taking care of him, and had him arrested. In 1774 Knight brought a claim before the justices of the peace court in Perth, a case that would be known as Knight v Wedderburn.\\"Slavery, freedom or perpetual servitude? - the Joseph Knight case\\", National Archives of Scotland website feature, Retrieved May 2012 Appeal to the sheriff When the justices of the peace found in favour of Wedderburn, Knight appealed to the Sheriff of Perth, John Swinton. He found that \\"the state of slavery is not recognised by the laws of this kingdom, and is inconsistent with the principles thereof: That the regulations in Jamaica, concerning slaves, do not extend to this kingdom.\\" The defence of Knight in the Court of Session was mounted in general terms as a denunciation of slavery:National Archives, https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/transcripts/somerset_case.htm Appeal to the Court of Session In 1777 Wedderburn appealed to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's supreme civil court, arguing that Knight still owed him perpetual service and might be taken and sent back to Jamaica by force. The case came before the whole court of twelve judges (as was usual at that time) including Lord Kames, a prominent legal and social historian. Knight's principal counsel were Allan Maconochie (later himself a judge as Lord Meadowbank), John Maclaurin (later himself a judge as Lord Dreghorn), and Andrew Crosbie. Henry Dundas, then Lord Advocate, also acted as one of Knight's counsel, albeit in his private capacity as an advocate. They may have been assisted in their preparation for the case by James Boswell. \\"I cannot too highly praise the speech which Mr. Henry Dundas generously contributed to the cause of the sooty stranger\\", Boswell recalled, \\"I do declare that upon this memorable question he impressed me.\\" Their argument was that 'no man is by nature the property of another' and that, albeit under Jamaican law slavery was recognised, that could not extend to Scotland. Conversely, Wedderburn's counsel argued that commercial interests, which underpinned Scotland's prosperity, should prevail. Dundas concluded his remarks by stating: ‚Äú‚Ä™Human nature, my Lords, spurns at the thought of slavery among any part of our species.‚Äù‚Ä¨ The Court of Session, by eight votes to four, sustained the sheriff's decision, which had held \\"That the state of slavery is not recognised by the laws of this kingdom, and is inconsistent with the principles thereof: and found that the regulations in Jamaica, concerning slaves, do not extend to this kingdom; and repelled the defender's claim to perpetual service\\". It thus rejected Wedderburn's appeal. Lord Kames stated that 'we sit here to enforce right not to enforce wrong'. Lord Auchinleck, Bowell's father, said \\"Although, in the plantations, they have laid hold of the poor blacks, and made slaves of them, yet I do not think that that is agreeable to humanity, not to say to the Christian religion. Is a man a slave because he is black? No. He is our brother; and he is a man, although not our colour; he is in a land of liberty, with his wife and his child: let him remain there.\\" . The Court thus held that > ‚Äòthe dominion assumed over this Negro, under the law of Jamaica, being > unjust, could not be supported in this country to any extent: That, > therefore, the defender had no right to the Negro‚Äôs service for any space of > time, nor to send him out of the country against his consent: That the Negro > was likewise protected under the act 1701, c.6. from being sent out of the > country against his consent.‚Äô In effect, slavery was not recognised by Scots law. Fugitive slaves (or 'perpetual servants') could be protected by the courts, if they wished to leave domestic service or were resisting attempts to return them to slavery in the colonies.Court of Session, unextracted processes, National Archives of Scotland (reference CS235/K/2/2). Later life Knight was recognised as a free man. His wife had been in Wedderburn's service as a servant, but had been sacked by him following their marriage. At this point Knight and his family disappear from the record; nothing further is known of their lives or deaths.

All three played for the British Lions and captained their National side.  International career  Laidlaw came to prominence in the late 1970s due to a string of good performances for Scotland B, then managed by Jim Telfer. He was an international reserve for three seasons, before getting capped again in 1980. At the time, Dougie Morgan was holding down the scrum half position in the Scotland team, having displaced Alan Lawson. As Lawson refused to act as replacement, Laidlaw gained a place on the bench. When Morgan retired in 1979, the selectors brought back Lawson, with Laidlaw staying on the bench. Laidlaw continued his good form for Scotland B, and finally gained a place in the Scotland team in the 1980 season, having sat on the bench for 10 games without coming on as a replacement.David Ferguson, Laidlaw hopes mirror image of '86 produces Six Nations result. The Scotsman, 11 March 2006. Writing during Laidlaw's international career in the mid-1980s, Allan Massie said that: :\\"Laidlaw's first quality is his courage. Only about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 11 ¬Ω stone, he never hesitates to absorb bad ball or to take on the enemy back row. I have never seen him shirk a tackle; he covers admirably and tirelessly... his game is not technically perfect. Though he often kicks admirably over his forwards' heads into the box, his kicking is not quite reliable and he can't really kick with his left foot. His pass, which has never been long, is faster than it was, but he is still inclined to skite the ball along the ground under pressure, and to take an indecisive step before passing. He depends a great deal on Rutherford to cover up these deficiencies; it was noticeable how his game went off in 1983 when Rutherford missed the first three championships.\\" In 1983, he became captain of , and his style was described as being like \\"Gareth Edwards rather than Jacques Fouroux.\\"Massie, pp 164, 165 Massie added: :\\"With the possible exception of Jerome Gallion, Laidlaw is the most dangerous breaker from the scrum in contemporary Rugby. He doesn't have the strength of Terry Holmes, but he is faster and less predictable.\\" Jim Telfer, who was Scotland coach by that point, considered that Laidlaw's ability to break was Scotland's sharpest attacking weapon in the 1984 Grand Slam, settling the match in the first twenty minutes.  1983 Lions Tour  Laidlaw gained a place in the test team on the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand, after the loss of first Terry Holmes and then Nigel Melville to injury, playing in all four tests. In total he played in a notably high number of games; 13 of the 18. He scored two tries on the tour and captained the Lions team twice, in the victories over West Coast and Wairarapa Bush.  Partnership with John Rutherford  Laidlaw partnered stand off John Rutherford a record 35 times for Scotland.

Richard Bath comments: :\\"every country has, at some stage, a double-act which sees two players through sheer longevity, become mentioned in the same breath... One of the most enduring partnerships was that of Jed-Forest's Roy Laidlaw and Selkirk's John Rutherford. For nigh on a decade, the two were immovable at half-back for Scotland. Unlike most of the other famous pairings, however, it was Laidlaw and Rutherford's differences rather than their similarities, that melded them into an outstanding partnership. On the one hand, there was the peerless Rutherford, all grace and poise, who could glide through tackles and drill a ball onto a sixpence in the opposition's 22. On the other, there was Laidlaw, a gutsy fighter in the classic Borders mould. The pair played together on 35 occasions, a world record for a half-back partnership.\\" References * Bath, Richard (ed.)

Career Lenny Kuhr at the Nationaal Songfestival in 1969 1969 Eurovision Song Contest dress In 1967, she started a singing career in the Netherlands, performing songs in the French chanson tradition. In 1969, she represented the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest with her composition \\"De troubadour\\" (lyrics by David Hartsema; orchestra conducted by Franz de Kok). She was one of the four winners that year. In the early seventies, Kuhr was more successful in France than in her home country. She topped the French charts in 1972 with the song \\"Jesus Christo\\" and performed in the shows of Georges Brassens. In 1980, she had her biggest hit in the Netherlands: \\"Visite\\", a song she performed together with the French group Les Poppys. She has been releasing records ever since, though without major chart success. In 1982, Kuhr hosted the Nationaal Songfestival, the Dutch national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Kuhr was one of the artists who recorded the song \\"Shalom from Holland\\" (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the Gulf War in 1991. Personal life Kuhr's first marriage was in 1974 with to an Israeli Doctor. Kuhr had been attacked in May of 1973 in Haarlem, which has caused damage to her nose. Her new husband repaired her nose. Kuhr converted to Judaism. She had two daughters during this marriage, one in 1975 and the second in 1980. For a while, she lived in Israel. . After he divorce, she was partners with Herman Pieter de Boer, a song writer, from 1981 to 1993. She was married for a second time in 2003.

It is synthesized in the liver in some species, and was first identified in bear bile, which is the derivation of its name Ursus. In purified form, it has been used to treat or prevent several diseases of the liver or bile ducts. Medical uses UDCA has been used as medical therapy in gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) and for biliary sludge. UDCA helps reduce the cholesterol saturation of bile and leads to gradual dissolution of cholesterol-rich gallstones. UDCA may be given after bariatric surgery to prevent cholelithiasis, which commonly occurs due to the rapid weight loss producing biliary cholesterol oversaturation and also biliary dyskinesia secondary hormonal changes. Primary biliary cholangitis UDCA is used as therapy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) where it can produce an improvement in biomarkers. Meta- analyses have borne out conflicting results on the mortality benefit. However analyses that exclude trials of short duration (i.e. < 2 years) have demonstrated a survival benefit and are generally considered more clinically relevant. A Cochrane systematic review in 2012 found no significant benefit in reducing mortality, the rate of liver transplantation, pruritus or fatigue. Ursodiol is the only FDA approved drug to treat PBC but many patients do not respond; other treatments are under study. Primary sclerosing cholangitis UDCA use is associated with improved serum liver tests that do not always correlate with improved liver disease status. WHO Drug Information advises against its use in primary sclerosing cholangitis in unapproved doses beyond 13‚Äì15 mg/kg/day. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy UDCA has been used for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. UDCA lessens itching in the mother and may reduce the number of preterm births. Effects on fetal distress and other adverse outcomes are unlikely to be great. Cholestasis UDCA use is not licensed in children, as its safety and effectiveness have not been established. Evidence is accumulating that ursodeoxycholic acid is ineffective and unsafe in neonatal hepatitis and neonatal cholestasis. Other conditions UDCA has been suggested to be an adequate treatment of bile reflux gastritis. In cystic fibrosis there is insufficient evidence to justify routine use of UDCA, especially as there is a lack of available data for long-term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation. UDCA has also been used in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in liver bile duct-paucity syndromes such as biliary atresia, liver allograft rejection, and in Graft-versus-host disease involving the liver. Adverse effects Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event seen in trial of UDCA in gallstone dissolution, occurring in 2 to 9%, which is less frequent than with chenodeoxycholic acid therapy. Bacterial conversion of UDCA to chenodeoxycholic acid may be the mechanism for this side effect. Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and exacerbation of pruritus was occasionally reported in trials in patients with PBC. Mechanisms of action=Choleretic effects Primary bile acids are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats. Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol. The drug reduces cholesterol absorption and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) gallstones in patients who want an alternative to surgery. There are multiple mechanisms involved in cholestatic liver diseases. Immunomodulating effects Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been shown experimentally to suppress immune response such as immune cell phagocytosis. Prolonged exposure and/or increased quantities of systemic (throughout the body, not just in the digestive system) ursodeoxycholic acid can be toxic.Material Safety Data Sheet on Ursodiol MSDS. https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/70916.htm Anti- inflammatory effects Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to exert anti- inflammatory and protective effects in human epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been linked to regulation of immunoregulatory responses by regulation of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides defensins, and take an active part in increased restitution of wound in the colon. Moreover, UDCA's effects has been shown to have exert actions outside the epithelial cells. While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (e.g. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are thought to be chemopreventive, perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells. Names The term is from the Latin noun ursus meaning bear, as bear bile contains the substance. Ursodeoxycholic acid can be chemically synthesized and is marketed under multiple trade names, including Ursetor, Udikast, Actibile, Actigall, Biliver, Deursil, Egyurso, Udcasid, Udiliv, Udinorm, Udoxyl, Urso, Urso Forte, Ursocol, Ursoliv, Ursofalk, Ursosan, Ursoserinox, Udimarin, Ursonova, and Stener.

The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Rossi‚ÄìForel intensity of VI (Strong tremor) and was centered in the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Newfoundland in the Laurentian Slope Seismic Zone. Earthquake The earthquake was centred on the edge of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, about south of the island. It was felt as far away as New York City and Montreal. The quake, along two faults south of the Burin Peninsula, triggered a large submarine landslide displacing (). It snapped 12 submarine transatlantic telegraph cables and led to a tsunami that arrived in three waves. Newfoundland, Canada and Saint Pierre and Miquelon had the largest impact, both from the snapped 12 submarine cables, and the tsunami. This was Canada's largest submarine landslide ever recorded, up to 500 times the size of 1894 Saint-Alban subaerial slide. In 2002 Natural Resources Canada and the United States Geological Survey, created an intensity map by using the Revised Modified Mercalli scale. Tsunami The tsunami waves had an amplitude of , and a runup of along the Burin Peninsula. It destroyed many south coastal communities on the Peninsula, killing 27 or 28 people and leaving 1,000 or more homeless. All means of communication were cut off by the destruction, and relief efforts were further hampered by a blizzard that struck the day after. It was recorded as far away as Lagos, Portugal away, 06:47 after the earthquake. It took 2 hours and 23 minutes to strike Burin, Newfoundland, from the epicenter, and only two hours to be observed in Bermuda . Prince Edward Island Prince Edward Island had felt the earthquake; the intensity was rated at the time at IV (Slight tremor) ‚Äì VI (Strong tremor) on the Rossi-Forel scale. In PEI it ranged from an intensity of III (Weak) ‚Äì V (Moderate). Saint Pierre and Miquelon In the then named French Republic Overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, about west of the Burin Peninsula, people were awakened around 16:30h by the earthquake that lasted approximately one minute. At 17:20, the tsunami reached the island of Saint-Pierre, submerging the docks. The worst damage was reported on the island then named √éle-aux-Chiens (meaning Island of the Dogs; till 1931), now known as L'√éle-aux-Marins (The Island of the Sailors). The tsunami hit from the south, rising above the height of the south bank that protects the south coast, flooding the lower part of the island. It damaged and moved some of the houses; there were no reported injuries or casualties from the islands. The quake's intensity on the island was V (Moderate tremor) ‚Äì VI (Strong tremor), and on the revised Modified Mercalli Intensity scale IV (Light) ‚Äì V (Moderate)  Aftermath  It took more than three days before the SS Meigle responded to an SOS signal with doctors, nurses, blankets, and food. Donations from across Newfoundland, Canada, the United States and United Kingdom totaled $250,000. There was never an accurate official list of the victims produced by any branch of the Newfoundland government. In the report entitled \\"Loss of Life,\\" the Honourable Dr. Harris Munden Mosdell, Chairman of the Board of Health Burin West, reported: \\"The loss of life through the tidal wave totals twenty-seven. Twenty-five deaths were due directly to the upheaval. Two other deaths occurred subsequently and were due to shock and exposure.\\" Later research attributed an additional death to the earthquake. In 1952, American scientists from Columbia University put together the pieces of the sequentially broken cables that led to the discovery of the landslide and the first documentation of a turbidity current. Scientists have examined other layers of sand believed to be deposited by other tsunamis in an effort to determine the occurrence rates of large earthquakes. One sand layer, thought to be deposited by the 1929 tsunami, at Taylor's Bay was found below the turf line. The occurrences of large tsunamis, such as the one in 1929, are dependent upon deposition of sediments offshore because it was the landslide that made the tsunami so powerful. The deposition of such a large volume of sediments will take a while before there is enough to form an underwater landslide the same size as that in 1929.

The word derives, via French, from the Latin advocare, from vocare \\"to call\\" plus ad, \\"to, towards\\", thus a \\"summoning\\".. It is the right to nominate a person to be parish priest (subject to episcopal, that is, specifically, one bishop's, approval), and each such right in each parish was mainly first held by the lord of the manor of the principal manor. Many small parishes only had one manor of the same name. Origin The creation of an advowson was a secondary development arising from the process of creating parishes across England in the 11th and 12th centuries, with their associated parish churches. A major impetus to this development was the legal exaction of agricultural tithes specific to the support of churches and their clergy; landowners needed to establish parish churches on their lands in order to retain tithe income within their estates, and to this purpose sought to raise former field churches to parish church status. This was generally performed by a lord of a manor by rebuilding a church within the boundary of his manor, or within that of a newly subinfeudated manor, and then transferring proprietary rights of certain individual named fields, mills or messuages (i.e. houses on the manor which earned rents) to establish a glebe. Where parish churches existed on manors established before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the position is less clear and records generally are scarce from which to reconstruct a history. Britain was split into dioceses, however, and many parish churches were established long before that time, and the process of their creation was likely similarly performed by Anglo-Saxon thanes as by Norman lords and feudal barons. Initially feudal lords exercised seigneural dominium over these new parish churches, exacting an introit fee on appointment, and an annual rent thereafter. The restriction of these seigneural rights to that of 'advowson', purely a right of presentation, developed with the process of Gregorian Reform; in consequence of which payments from spiritual income to lay lords were forbidden. The new process was performed in conjunction with the bishop of the diocese in which the manor was situated. The lord of the manor, having incurred a very great expense in building the church and parsonage and having suffered a loss of income due to his donation of property to the glebe, quite reasonably insisted on the right to select the individual who would act as parish priest, from which office he could not be ejected by the lord until the priest's death. The bishop, without whose consecration the new church would have no religious and spiritual stature, in turn demanded the right of confirmation of the appointment. Thus from the earliest time the advowson was \\"appurtenant to\\" the manor, that is to say it appertained to the manor and was exercisable by the lord. The advowson, being real property could be \\"alienated\\" (i.e. disposed of) by sale or gift of the patron, but with special licence from the overlord as was required for the alienation of the manor itself. Presentation by turns Where a manor was split into moieties due to inheritance by co-heiresses, the advowson was also split. Before the 13th century, this would commonly result in the rectory (and its advowson) being split into two or more portions, with the successors of each co-heiress from then on separately nominating a parish priest as their 'portioner'. Emerging Canon Law however, strongly deprecated dividing the cure of souls for a single parish in this way, and bishops ceased to allow such devices; except in the case of portionary collegiate foundations. Henceforth therefore, if a lord of a manor died without male issue but with two daughters, the manorial lands would be split into two moieties, still however within the original undivided parish, controlled by the husbands of each daughter, and the advowson would be held by each daughter's husband jure uxoris in turn. The husband of the elder daughter would have the right to the first presentation, that is to say, the right to appoint a new priest to the first vacancy, whilst the husband of the second daughter ‚Äì or more usually, given the life tenure of priests, their descendant ‚Äì would hold the right to the second presentation. Where manors were split into three or more moieties or \\"purparties\\", the turns of presentation expanded accordingly. Bishops then sought to convert existing portionary churches into presentation by turns; but portionary arrangements nevertheless survived in several parishes into the 19th century; and a few still operate (though in name only, the portions being united into a single incumbent). Patrons in need of ready cash might seek to capitalize on the value of their advowsons by selling turns of presentation; either the next turn singly, or alternate future turns as a long-term asset. Encroachment of canon law Canon law, however, by the 12th century, decreed that the right to present belonged to the saint to whom the church was dedicated and that only ecclesiastical courts could rule on cases involving advowsons. King Henry II's Constitutions of Clarendon held otherwise, and after Thomas Becket's murder, the king once more ruled that cases involving advowsons should be heard by secular courts. Effect of the Reformation In the Reformation in the 16th century, the Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of much monastic property to laymen, and with the properties passed the advowsons which the monasteries had held: thus creating a large group of lay patrons (see impropriation). In 1603, there were an estimated 3849 livings in the hands of lay impropriators out of a total of 9284.. There were also many lords of manors and patrons of appurtenant livings who were recusants, that is to say who remained Roman Catholics and refused to adopt the new Protestant religion. Such patrons were disbarred from making presentations by the Presentation of Benefices Act 1605 (3 Jac. 1 c 5), which transferred the right for the time being to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge according to the geographical location of the parish.. The university was allowed to assign this right to a third party adherent to the new religion, for consideration or otherwise.. Legal status Legally, advowsons were treated as real property that could be held or conveyed, and conversely could be taken or encumbered, in the same general manner as a parcel of land. Advowsons were among the earliest incorporeal hereditaments, and often held in fee tail. Litigation (enabled in the temporal courts after the Reformation), on the basis of an advowson was somewhat specialized, with unique forms of action inapplicable to other realty, such as the writ of quare impedit, by which a patron sued a bishop in support of his presented candidate, alleging unreasonable hindrance to succession to a benefice. Following reforms of parish administration in the late 19th century (principally the imposition of secular parishes and wider county and district authorities), the advowson had negligible commercial value. The Benefices Act 1898 (Amendment) Measure 1923 phased out advowsons so that they could not be sold or inherited after two vacancies occurred after 14 July 1924 and enabled their elimination earlier by direction of the current patron. It had the effect, however, in the words of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, in 1933, \\"that the sale of advowsons very rapidly increased. Patrons were eager to sell, and were advised to sell, while their proprietary rights had still some financial value, and there can be no doubt the opportunity was used very largely to secure advowsons for party purposes and for party trusts.\\". The purchase of advowsons to ensure that a parish became an Anglo-Catholic, or more often Evangelical, stronghold, had begun in the 19th century. It led to a number of situations where an incumbent was imposed on a parish, and had been partly dealt with by the establishment of Diocesan Boards of Patronage in 1932. The rich body of common law regarding advowsons can sometimes become relevant in modern times when dealing with disputes over modern incorporeal hereditaments, such as farming allotments, that are not handled by statute or adequately settled by other common law. An example is the 1980 case of First Victoria National Bank v. United States. Value Advowsons were valuable assets for a number of reasons, principally as a means for the patron to exert moral influence on the parishioners, who were his manorial tenants, through the teaching and sermons of the parish priest. The manor was a business enterprise, and it was important for its commercial success that all who lived there should live and work in harmony for a common purpose, and should obey the law of the land and of the manorial court. Such a law-abiding attitude could be fostered by a suitable parish priest, and clearly the appointment of a priest who preached against this would be a disaster for the interests of the lord of the manor. An appointment could also be used to provide an income for a valued servant in holy orders (such as a chaplain or secretary), or as a reward for past services rendered to the patron by the appointee. A benefice generally included use of a house, i.e. a vicarage, parsonage or rectory, as well as the income from the glebe and tithes, which would provide for the living expenses of the incumbent, and the value of the advowson would thus vary according to how richly endowed the glebe had been out of the lord of the manor's manorial lands. For example: the advowson of the parish of Paulerspury in Northamptonshire (Peterborough diocese) was bought by New College, Oxford, in 1750 for the sum of ¬£1,300. Advowsons were frequently used by lords and landowners as a means of providing a career and income for a younger son who, due to the custom of primogeniture, would not inherit any of the paternal lands. If the father did not already own a suitable advowson, he might purchase one for this purpose. Value as historical records The records of historic presentations to manors are held amongst the muniments or archives of their dioceses. Often such records exist unbroken for several centuries, and record the names of the patron and the appointee, with related information. These records are thus of great value to non-ecclesiastical historians of the manors concerned, and also to genealogists, for example by confirming the name of the lord of the manor at a certain date, confirming the dates of his life, and the name of his heir, spouse or widow. Most of the secular historical records relating to manors are contained within manorial rolls or in the archives of the ancient departments of state, for example the records of the Exchequer, royal courts etc. The existence of an entirely independent set of records within the diocesan archives, generally published in the calendars of the bishops of the see in question, is thus a valuable resource. Current position In the 20th century, it became the policy of many English sees (dioceses) to acquire the advowsons to the parish churches within their area. This gave the bishop total control over the selection of parish priests, which might give him political as well as religious influence over a parish. The distribution of the church income away from a select few means the days of the fiercely independent, often right-wing \\"fox-hunting parson\\" like Jack Russell (d. 1883), are extinct. Abolition of manorial courts in the 19th century and the gradual removal of copyhold title, ending in 1925,Law of Property Act 1925 meant the powers, not the vestigial office, of the lord of the manor, were eliminated. Inheritants of any part of these lands could be expressed to hold the right of advowson appurtenant to their lands, in many cases impliedly, but not so in registered land. In most instances, lay holders are willing to donate them without payment to the diocese, on being asked to do so in a polite letter from the bishop.For example, the advowson of the manor of Siston, Gloucestershire. Advowsons have lower value to lay holders, since the ban on sale of livings is more easily enforced and few lay holders wish to exert a proxy influence over the morals of their neighbourhood, most of which would have from medieval times to the 19th century have been their tenants in the parish, nor in such a way for their younger children to be put forward for preferred selection as parish priests, which was in the era of tithes often a source of high real-terms pay. Lay advowsons have been left by successive wills or estate successions and so it is a sign of past wealth to hold many advowsons. Debrett's Peerage of 1995 shows John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol (d. 1999), then aged 40, in a modern extreme example: he was \\"patron of thirty livings\\".Debretts Peerage 1995 edition, p.162 as his father had been, in the 1968 edition for example. Many advowsons rest with the Church Society on the Protestant wing of the church, and on the Anglo-Catholic wing by The Church Union and Oxford Movement. Donation to one of these can help to seek to see that style of worship remains constant over generations in a parish with slightly less regard to reforms in either direction introduced by the local bishops, though in all cases the ultimate decisions to appoint and promote rest with the bishops. This is tempered by the central policies of many faiths, but particularly churches, of subsidiarity (local differentiation) which is opposed to dogma from senior figures.

In the Great Depression, the superintendent of South Bend schools asked that more classes be added for those who could not afford to attend classes at the Bloomington campus. The classes were offered at Central High School in downtown South Bend and within a few years enrollment reached 500. Classes were taught by local high school teachers with master's degrees and occasionally by Bloomington faculty who traveled once a week for class. The university appointed a resident director in 1940. Lynton Keith Caldwell, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, took on the job. In 1941, Ernest Gerkin was named the first permanent full-time faculty member. Donald Carmony became the director from 1944 to 1950, followed by Jack Detzler, who remained in the job until 1964. In 1961 the first IU South Bend building was constructed on newly acquired land on the north shore of the St. Joseph River. It was first named the IU Center. In 1962 it was renamed the South Bend- Mishawaka Campus. In 1965, Lester M. Wolfson was appointed director and assistant dean of the campus. Wolfson was named chancellor in 1969, and his leadership continued until his retirement in 1987. Four-year degree programs were authorized in 1965, and the campus awarded its first degrees in 1967. Thirty-one students graduated the first year. The campus was named \\"Indiana University South Bend\\" in 1968. The first master's degrees were conferred in 1970. Enrollment exceeded 5,000 in 1971, and the addition to Northside Hall was opened in 1972. The purchase of the Associates Building (now known as the Administration Building) was completed in 1975. Groundbreaking for the Franklin D. Schurz Library was in 1986, and it opened in 1989. Chancellor Wolfson retired in 1987 and H. Daniel Cohen was named chancellor. Cohen concentrated on improving facilities, grounds, and programming. In 1994, the university purchased the former Playland Park, a 26.5 acre parcel on the south side of the St. Joseph River. Playland had been an amusement park, a golf course, and a ballpark. Cohen resigned in 1995 as a result of sexual harassment allegations against him,Appeal from the Elkhart Superior Court, the Honorable Evan S. Roberts, Judge Cause No. 20D01-0704-PL-15 (transferred from 71D04-0304-PL-128), page 2 and long-time history professor, Lester C. Lamon, assumed the position of acting chancellor for two years until Kenneth L. Perrin was named chancellor. During Perrin's tenure, two major projects were completed. Wiekamp Hall opened in 1998. The building provided much needed classroom, computer lab, and office space. The $15.7 million Student Activities Center (SAC) was constructed and completed in early 2002. right Perrin retired in 2002 and Una Mae Reck was named chancellor. Reck was formerly the vice president for academic affairs at the State University of New York at Fredonia. During Reck's administration a number of major projects were completed ‚Äì student housing, a bridge connecting the campus to student housing across the St. Joseph River, the Elkhart Center, remodeling of the administration building, and the $22 million renovation of the Education and Arts Building. Upon Reck's retirement in Spring 2014, Terry L. Allison became the fifth chancellor of IU South Bend. Previously, Allison served as provost and vice president at Governor's State University in Illinois where he was also a professor of English. Campus IU South Bend is on a pedestrian mall on the St. Joseph River. When the campus opened in the 1960s, it featured two buildings: Northside Hall and Greenlawn Hall, a former tool and die factory. Growing over 50 years, the campus now consists of 11 buildings, including River Crossing student housing, the Franklin D. Schurz Library, the Education and Arts Building, and the 100,000 square foot (9,000 m¬≤) Student Activities Center (SAC). The university also owns on the south bank of the St. Joseph River where student housing is located. The Student Activities Center is the site for athletics, student orientation, intramural sports, fitness classes, exercising, meetings, and recognition ceremonies. left A pedestrian bridge that bears the words \\"Indiana University South Bend\\" connects the main campus with the athletic fields across the river. Construction of the bridge began in December 2005 and was completed in September 2006. On September 22, 2006, the Indiana University Board of Trustees voted to approve student housing for IU South Bend, to be located across the river. The housing facilities opened in the fall of 2008, consisting of 400 beds in eight apartment-style units, along with a community building. In August 2007 construction was completed on the Indiana University South Bend Elkhart Center in downtown Elkhart, Indiana. Buildings Note: List of buildings at IU South Bend is in chronological order. Northside Hall opened in 1961 and was the first-and for a long time- and primary building on campus.

Life  Tom√°s was born to the Iriarte family, many of whose members were writers in the humanist tradition. His father was Don Bernardo de Iriarte, while his mother was Do√±a B√°rbara de las Nieves Hern√°ndez de Oropesa. His brother was Bernardo de Iriarte He received his literary education at Madrid where he went aged 14 in 1764 under the care of his uncle, Juan de Iriarte (Puerto de la Cruz, 1701 - Madrid 1771), librarian to the king of Spain. In his eighteenth year the nephew began his literary career by translating French plays for the royal theatre, and in 1770, under the anagram of Tirso Imarete, he published an original comedy entitled Hacer que hacemos. In the following year he became official translator at the foreign office, and in 1776 keeper of the records in the war department. In 1780 he authored a didactic poem in cilvas entitled La M√∫sica, which attracted some attention in Italy as well as at home. The F√°bulas literarias (1782), with which his name is most intimately associated, are composed in a great variety of metres, and was known for humorous attacks on literary men and methods, as was the case, again and again, with Juan Pablo Forner (1756‚Äì1797). During his later years, partly in consequence of the F√°bulas, Iriarte was absorbed in personal controversies, and in 1786 was reported to the Inquisition for his sympathies with the French philosophers. He died of gout at Madrid, 17 September 1791, aged only 41. He is the subject of an exhaustive monograph (1897) by Emilio Cotarelo y Mori, (Vegadeo, 1 May 1857 ‚Äì Madrid, 27 January 1936), member of the Royal Spanish Academy, just that year.

She was commissioned in 1811 and originally carried 36 gunsRecord Card for Najaden, later being upgraded to 42. She served briefly during the Gunboat War only seeing action once, when on 6 July 1812 the British ship of the line and the sank her during the Battle of Lyng√∏r. The Battle of Lyng√∏r effectively ended Denmark's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. Origin During their occupation of Copenhagen in 1807, the British destroyed a partially built ship-of-the-line by hacking away the supports so that the ship fell on its port side, which crushed most of its timbers. The starboard side was essentially intact however, and the Danes used these timbers to build a new frigate ‚Äì the Najaden.The name translates as \\"Water Nymph\\" - see mythology Naiad. Career During her entire short life, Najadens captain was the Danish naval officer Hans Peter Holm. Her maiden voyage on 29 February 1812 (a leap year) had been delayed by one day because the ship grounded whilst leaving Copenhagen harbour. She then dragged an anchor on arrival in Brekkest√∏, Norway, which led to rudder damage on rocks, which further delayed her entry on active service. Still, on this short voyage the ship had achieved a good average speed of ten knots. Then yet more early storm damage curtailed training of the crew. Battle of Lyng√∏r Najadens captain, Hans Peter Holm, also commanded the squadron that consisted of the three brigs - Kiel, Lolland (or Laaland) and Sams√∏e. Eyeing an opportunity to enforce the blockade and break the back of Dano-Norwegian seapower, the British deployed the 64-gun third-rate ship-of-the-line and three brigs, the 18-gun Cruizer-class brig- sloop , 14-gun brig-sloop and the 14-gun gun-brig . Within 45 minutes of the commencement of the action, Najaden had sunk, having suffered 133 dead and 82 wounded. Captain Holm survived, only to drown in an accident a few months later. The battle resumed as Norwegian gunboats found their way into Lyng√∏r. At 2 a.m. on July 7, Dictator, which had grounded, pulled herself off and departed from the battleifeld. The British took Lolland and Kiel as prizes but had to abandon them after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard. The action cost Dictator five killed and 24 wounded, Calypso three killed, one wounded and two missing, and Flamer one killed and one wounded. Overall, the Danish recorded their losses as 300 men killed or wounded.

The popular court in Thusis associated with the overseers also outlawed many leading men from the Spanish faction, notably Rudolf von Planta and his brother Pompeius von Planta. A subsequent popular court in the region's capital, Chur, rejected the Thusis verdicts, and the Republic of the Grisons slid towards anarchy in what became known as the B√ºndner Wirren or the Confusion of Graub√ºnden. In 1620, an uprising coordinated with the Spanish governor in Milan resulted in the massacre of a number of Protestants in the Republic's subject territory in the Valtellina, a fertile valley of considerable strategic importance (for through it the Spaniards in Milan could communicate by the Umbrail Pass and the Stelvio Pass with the Austrians in Tirol). From 1620 to 1639, control over the Valtellina became a bone of contention among Spain, Venice and France, with the Republic of the Grisons unable to reassert its control. Murders Jenatsch took part in the brutal murder (1621) of Pompeius von Planta, the head of the rival party, at his castle, Rietberg. Planta was left pinned to the floor with an axe, though the actual murderer was most likely Niklaus Carl von Hohenbalcken. Soon after, Jenatsch and many others associated with the Reformed church, Venice, or the Salis family had to flee the country. After the murder of Planta and several other violent incidents, Jenatsch also lost his position as a pastor, and henceforth acted solely as a soldier and military entrepreneur. He participated in the revolt against the Austrians in the Pr√§ttigau (1622), and in the invasion of the Valtellina by a French army (1624), but the peace made (1626) between France and Spain left the Valtellina in the hands of the pope, and so thwarted the Republic's hopes of regaining the territory. Jenatsch, however, thrived in the military life, and rose rapidly through the ranks to major, and later colonel of his own regiment. Jenatsch killed his colonel, Giacomo Ruinelli, in a duel in 1626 in Chur, but was cleared of murder charges by a city court. He turned to military recruiting, and as Spanish and Austrian influence grew in the Grisons, eventually raised a company for service with the Venetians (1629-1630). He was briefly imprisoned in Venice after an incident of insubordination, and later claimed that reading the Church Fathers while jailed had contributed to his later religious conversion. In 1631 he was recruited for the French campaign designed by Richelieu to drive the Spaniards out of the Valtellina, which after several years of delay, led to the successful campaign of Henri, duc de Rohan (1635). But Jenatsch, along with the military and political leadership of the Republic, soon saw that the French were as unwilling as the Spaniards to restore the Grisons' lordship over the Valtellina. Conversion to Catholicism In 1635, Jenatsch made public his conversion to Roman Catholicism (though his family declined to follow suit), and became one leader of a secret alliance, the Kettenbund, which included both Catholic and Protestant leaders in the Grisons, that negotiated secretly with the Spaniards and Austrians. The Kettenbund launched a strike in 1637 that resulted in the expulsion of Rohan and the French from the Grisons. During the next two years, Jenatsch pushed forward the negotiations with Spain and Austria for the return of the Valtellina under Grisons sovereignty, as well as seeking a noble title for himself. He also became one of the most powerful men in the region, taking the pivotal governorship of Chiavenna for himself, and mixing in the tangled affairs of the Planta clan. Death On 24 January 1639 Jenatsch was assassinated in Chur by a band of men whose leader was costumed as a bear, as it was Carnival. Although the murderers remained anonymous and were never captured or tried, the most likely culprit was Rudolf von Planta, son of the murdered Pompeius, or men in his employ. Later historians have proposed many other suspects, and novels and plays about Jenatsch have searched even further afield. Later in 1639, the much coveted Valtellina was restored by Spain to the Grisons, which held it until 1797. Jenatsch's career is of general historical importance as one aspect of the long conflict between France and Spain for control over the Valtellina, which forms one of the most tumultuous episodes in the Thirty Years' War. Jenatsch in Literature Although interest in Jenatsch waned rapidly after his burial in the Chur cathedral, still wearing the bloodied clothes he had been murdered in, later historians and literary figures took up his story again. In the nineteenth century, he became the subject of numerous plays and biographical studies, which tended to emphasize his fiery character as well as his allegedly deep attachment to his fatherland. One work to discuss him was the novel by Conrad Ferdinand Meyer (1876), which among other accomplishments changed his name, at least in popular perception, from Giorgio, Georg or Zoartz (the most common forms during his lifetime in Italian, German and Romansh, respectively) to the more north German 'J√ºrg.' A key feature of Meyer's novel, picked up by later literary versions, was that his murderer was 'Lucrecia' von Planta, daughter of Pompeius and Jenatsch's lover. In Meyer's adaptation of the story, Lucrecia kills Jenatsch, using the same axe he had used on her father, when his self- love and ambition overpower his desire to serve his fatherland. In fact, Meyer changed Jenatsch's birthdate in the novel to make such a relationship possible; earlier authors had already renamed the real Katherina von Planta as 'Lucrecia', a name for which there is no historical foundation. The story about the same axe, however, is found in chronicles written within weeks of Jenatsch's death in 1639. Since Meyer's novel, several other novels as well as a film (Jenatsch, 1987) have treated his story. In addition, there are two major biographies, one by Ernst Haffter (Davos, 1894), and one by Alexander Pfister, (1936, now in its fifth edition). On the significance of the Valtelline, see the article by Horatio Brown, \\"The Valtelline\\", in the Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 4 (1906), and Geoffrey Parker, The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road, 1567-1659, (1972, 2nd edn. 2004). The newest investigation of Jenatsch the historical figure is Randolph C. Head's Jenatsch's Axe: Social Boundaries, Identity and Myth in the Era of the Thirty Years' War (University of Rochester Press, 2008); Head is a significant scholar of early modern Swiss history writing in English. In 2012, Jenatsch's body was exhumed from Chur cathedral by a team seeking DNA to confirm that the body was, in fact, Jenatsch.

After graduating from a gymnasium in Radom, he was sent to a Trade Academy in Sankt Gallen in Switzerland. There he formed a unit of the ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki and started organizing military training for the Polish emigrees and students. It was then he adopted his nom de guerre of Grzmot (Polish language for thunder), which later formed a part of his surname. Upon the outbreak of the Great War he returned to Poland, to Austro- Hungarian Galicia, where he volunteered for the service in the Polish Legions. In August 1914 he became the member of The Seven Lancers of Belina under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Belina-Pra≈ºmowski, the first detachment of the Polish Cavalry to cross the border with Privislinsky Krai. Later in the war he served in the cavalry regiment of the Legions, in which he commanded a platoon and then a squadron. After the Oath Crisis of 1917 he was interned in a camp in Beniamin√≥w. After Poland regained her independence in November 1918 Stanis≈Çaw Grzmot-Skotnicki took part in re-creation of his cavalry regiment, which later adopted the name of 1st Regiment of Light Cavalry of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (1. pu≈Çk szwole≈ºer√≥w im. marsza≈Çka J√≥zefa Pi≈Çsudskiego). As one of its commanders he took part in the Polish-Ukrainian War, after which he was sent to the newly created School of Cavalry Officers in Warsaw, and then to the Application School of Cavalry in Saumur in France. Upon his return, in August 1920 he became the commanding officer of the 8th Cavalry Brigade and then the entire 2nd Cavalry Division on the fronts of the Polish-Soviet War. After the war he became the head instructor at the Centre for Cavalry Training in GrudziƒÖdz. Between 1924 and 1927 he was the commander of the prestigious Pozna≈Ñ-based 15th Uhlan Regiment. Since 1927 he commanded the 9th Independent Cavalry Brigade. After the reorganization of Polish Cavalry in 1932 he commanded the Baranowicze cavalry brigade of the Border Defence Corps and then the Nowogr√≥dek Cavalry Brigade. Since 1937 he served as the commander of the Pomeranian Cavalry Brigade. At the start of the invasion of Poland in 1939, he commanded his unit as the core of the Czersk Operational Group which was to shield the Vistula river crossings against the German offensive and to protect the flanks of the Pomorze Army. After that unit's defeat in the battle of Tuchola Forest, he withdrew with the remnants of his unit to the south. During the Battle of the Bzura River he commanded a small improvised infantry unit, with which he headed for Warsaw after the Polish defeat in the battle.

He made contributions to the fields of probability and algebra, especially semisimple Lie groups, Lie algebras, and Markov processes. The Dynkin diagram, the Dynkin system, and Dynkin's lemma are named after him. Biography  Dynkin was born into a Jewish family, living in Leningrad until 1935, when his family was exiled to Kazakhstan. Two years later, when Dynkin was 13, his father disappeared in the Gulag. Moscow University At the age of 16, in 1940, Dynkin was admitted to Moscow University. He avoided military service in World War II because of his poor eyesight, and received his M.S. in 1945 and his Ph.D. in 1948. He became an assistant professor at Moscow, but was not awarded a \\"chair\\" until 1954 because of his political undesirability. His academic progress was made difficult due to his father's fate, as well as Dynkin's Jewish origin; the special efforts of Andrey Kolmogorov, his Ph.D. supervisor, made it possible for Dynkin to progress through graduate school into a teaching position. USSR Academy of Sciences In 1968, Dynkin was forced to transfer from the Moscow University to the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He worked there on the theory of economic growth and economic equilibrium. Cornell He remained at the Institute until 1976, when he emigrated to the United States. In 1977, he became a professor at Cornell University.In , Dynkin states \\"I came to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1977\\". Death Dynkin died at the Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, New York, aged 90.Cornell Chronicle obit Dynkin was an atheist. Mathematical work Eugene Dynkin, 1976 Dynkin is considered to be a rare example of a mathematician who made fundamental contributions to two very distinct areas of mathematics: algebra and probability theory. The algebraic period of Dynkin's mathematical work was between 1944 and 1954, though even during this time a probabilistic theme was noticeable. Indeed, Dynkin's first publication was in 1945, jointly with N. A. Dmitriev, solved a problem on the eigenvalues of stochastic matrices. This problem was raised at Kolmogorov's seminar on Markov chains, while both Dynkin and Dmitriev were undergraduates. Lie Theory While Dynkin was a student at Moscow University, he attended Israel Gelfand's seminar on Lie groups. In 1944, Gelfand asked him to prepare a survey on the structure and classification of semisimple Lie groups, based on the papers by Hermann Weyl and Bartel Leendert van der Waerden. Dynkin found the papers difficult to read, and in an attempt to better understand the results, he invented the notion of a \\"simple root\\" in a root system. He represented the pairwise angles between these simple roots in the form of a Dynkin diagram. In this way he obtained a cleaner exposition of the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras. Of Dynkin's 1947 paper \\"Structure of semisimple Lie algebras\\", Bertram Kostant wrote: Dynkin's 1952 influential paper \\"Semisimple subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras\\", contained large tables and lists, and studied the subalgebras of the exceptional Lie algebras. Probability theory Dynkin is considered one of the founders of the modern theory of Markov processes. The results obtained by Dynkin and other participants of his seminar at Moscow University were summarized in two books. The first of these, \\"Theory of Markov Processes\\", was published in 1959, and laid the foundations of the theory. Dynkin's one-hour talk at the 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm, was delivered by Kolmogorov, since prior to his emigration, Dynkin was never permitted to travel to the West. This talk was titled \\"Markov processes and problems in analysis\\".

Born in Knockbrex, near Gatehouse of Fleet, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, he was a Royal Navy officer, historian, critic and inventor. He was the son of General George Thomas Colomb (1787‚Äì1874). His younger brother Sir John Colomb was also a soldier and strategist of the Royal Navy. Naval career Colomb entered the navy in 1846, and served first at sea off Portugal in 1847; afterwards, in 1848, in the Mediterranean, and from 1848 to 1851 as midshipman of the Reynard in operations against piracy in Chinese waters; as midshipman and shipmate of the Serpent during the Burmese War of 1852‚Äì53; as mate of the Phoenix in the Arctic Expedition of 1854; as lieutenant of the Hastings in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War, taking part in the attack on Sveaborg. He became what was known at that time as a gunner's lieutenant in 1857, and from 1859 to 1863 he served as flag-lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley at Devonport. Between 1858 and 1868 Colomb was employed in home waters on a variety of special services, chiefly connected with gunnery, signalling and the tactical characteristics and capacities of steam warships. From 1868 to 1870 he commanded HMS Dryad in the Persian Gulf region and was engaged in the suppression of the slave trade, particularly around Zanzibar and Oman. His book Slave-catching in the Indian Ocean: A record of naval experiences was published by Longmans in London in 1873, an interesting and informative account, one distinguished by a studied moderation. In 1874, while captain of the Audacious, he served for three years as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Ryder in China; and finally he was appointed, in 1880, to command the Thunderer in the Mediterranean. The next year he was appointed captain of the steam reserve at Portsmouth. After serving three years in that capacity, he remained at Portsmouth as flag-captain to the commander-in-chief until 1886, when he was retired by superannuation before he had attained flag rank. Subsequently, he became rear-admiral, and finally vice-admiral on the retired list. Contributions to naval warfare Colomb saw that the introduction of steam into the navy would necessitate a new system of signals, and new tactics. He set himself to devise the former as far back as 1858. Working with Francis John Bolton, he worked out a Morse code system with signal lamps about 1862. This system of signals was adopted by the navy in 1867. Colomb moved on to tactics. Having first determined by experiment‚Äîfor which he was given special facilities by the admiralty‚Äîwhat are the manoeuvring powers of ships propelled by steam under varying conditions of speed and helm, he proceeded to devise a system of tactics based on these data. In the sequel he prepared a new evolutionary signal-book, which was adopted by the Royal Navy, and still remains in substance the foundation of the existing system of tactical evolutions at sea. The same series of experimental studies led him to conclusions concerning the chief causes of collisions at sea; and these conclusions, though stoutly combated in many quarters at the outset, have since been generally accepted, and were ultimately embodied in the international code of regulations adopted by the leading maritime nations on the recommendation of a conference at Washington in 1889. After his retirement Colomb devoted himself rather to the history of naval warfare, and to the large principles disclosed by its intelligent study, than to experimental inquiries having an immediate practical aim. As in his active career he had wrought organic changes in the ordering, direction and control of fleets, so by his historic studies, pursued after his retirement, he helped greatly to effect, if he did not exclusively initiate, an equally momentous change in the popular, and even the professional, way of regarding sea-power and its conditions. Colomb did not invent the term \\"sea-power\\", as it is of very ancient origin, nor did he employ it until Captain Mahan of the United States Navy had made it a household word with all. But he thoroughly grasped its conditions, and in his great work on Naval Warfare (first published in 1891) he enunciated its principles with great cogency and with keen historic insight. The central idea of his teaching was that naval supremacy is the condition precedent of all vigorous military offensive across the seas, and, conversely, that no vigorous military offensive can be undertaken across the seas until the naval force of the enemy has been accounted for either destroyed or defeated and compelled to withdraw to the shelter of its own ports, or at least driven from the seas by the menace of a force it dare not encounter in the open. This broad and indefeasible principle he enunciated and defended in essay after essay, in lecture after lecture, until what at first was rejected as a paradox came in the end to be accepted as a commonplace. He worked quite independently of Captain Mahan, and his chief conclusions were published before Captain Mahan's works appeared. The admiral died quite suddenly and in the full swing of his literary activity on 13 October 1899, at Steeple Court, Botley, Hants. His latest published work was a biography of his friend Sir Astley Cooper Key, and his last article was a critical examination of the tactics adopted at Trafalgar, which showed his acumen and insight at their best.

NPA is now engaged in more than 33 countries in de-mining, humanitarian relief, promoting democratization; the rights of indigenous people, equality; and fair distribution of land and resources. NPA currently operates de-mineing activities in 16 countries and played a central role in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Convention on Cluster Munitions which was signed in Oslo in 2008. NPA manages refugee reception centres, anti-racism campaigns, volunteer rescue teams, and a volunteer ambulance service. In 2018, they settled a $2 million legal case with the US Department of Justice, following claims from the U.S. government that NPA breached the U.S. False Claims Act when signing an USAID grant agreement in South Sudan, by failing to disclose NPA's activities in support for a democratisation project for youth in Gaza from 2012-2016, and a demining project in Iran that ended in 2008, the latter an assignment for the Norwegian oil company Norsk Hydro.NPA Press release: Norwegian People‚Äôs Aid reaches a settlement with the U.S. government  History = 1930s  Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) was founded on 7 December 1939 as a natural continuation of the work of several Norwegian organizations who had been working to alleviate human suffering during the Spanish Civil War and the Winter War in Finland.  1940s and 1950s  During World War II, NPA mobilized medical services across the country until the German occupying forces seized its assets and officially disbanded it in September 1941. NPA went into exile and continued work from Sweden. After World War II, NPA took active part in the rebuilding of Norway, particularly in areas of health care. NPA built health centers and occupational health services throughout the country. International participated particularly in the humanitarian relief efforts for refugees. In collaboration with Red Cross work was expanded in 1946 to include all of Europe in terms of the European Council.  1960s and 1970s  NPA organized relief efforts globally such as the response after the earthquake in Skopje. NPA was involved in the liberation of Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia. It was also sent help to earthquake victims in Yugoslavia.  1980s and 1990s  NPA intensified efforts primarily in southern Africa and Latin America. Food relief aid for 40 million people (1,200 tons) was collected and sent to Poland during the food crisis in the country. Efforts in the Middle East and South Sudan began during this decade. NPA began working in Eastern Europe during this time, and in the new regime of South Africa, NPA was one of the first foreign organizations promoting democracy and transitional justice. Demining began on behalf of United Nations in Cambodia and Mozambique. In Norway, NPA established a guardian system for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers from countries in conflict. Criticism of NPA In March 2000, the European-Sudanese Public Affairs Council, led by David Hoile, referred to a November 1999 television documentary that alleged that NPA-controlled aeroplanes had supplied the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) with 80‚Äì100 tonnes of weapons and landmines. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence referred to allegations by unnamed groups that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had \\"used\\" the NPA for \\"terrorist activities\\". The Ministry of Defence also expressed concern about an incident in which several NPA vehicles were stolen by the LTTE.

This site should not be confused with Woodstown beach which is on the western side of Waterford Harbour near the fishing port of Dunmore East. Discovery The National Roads Authority had planned to build a road over the site which showed no evidence of a historical monument. Investigation ditch and gulley across the road route led to the discovery of the site. In 2005 the site was declared a national monument and the motorway bypassed the site. The NRA, who have no responsibility for the site in the future, published reports, based on excavations in April and August 2003. These suggest that the site found at Woodstown was a defended, riverside settlement with evidence of industrial activity, most likely dating from the period - 830 to 940 AD. With over 600 features such as house gullies, pits and fireplaces found, the archaeology points to a densely populated and affluent settlement. Apart from Woodstown, there is no evidence of a large 9th-century Viking settlement in Western Europe. Further small excavations, which took place in 2006, identified a structure which may have been associated with metal-working. Reports on these excavations have yet to be published. 9th- century Viking settlement The 2010 International Viking Conference confirmed the site as a longphort - a defensive enclosure built to protect the ships of Viking raiders and the treasure which they amassed, including silver, local captives (whom they would sell as slaves) and cattle. About 4,000 objects including silver ingots, lead weights, ships nails, Byzantine coins and Viking weaponry have been recovered through preliminary surface test trenching. Much of the metal work found at Woodstown dates back to the mid to late 9th century. Work being carried out on the grave suggests that it is one of the best equipped such graves from Ireland or Great Britain. Included were a sword (which may have come from Carolingian Francia rather than Norway itself), a spearhead showing silver inlay, a shield which seemed to have been placed over the dead man‚Äôs face, an axe and whetstone. The Viking inhabitants of Woodstown had some very small and apparently personalised weights which they would use to measure very small amounts of silver. The most common unit of measurement is Scandinavian and does not appear to be evident at other sites in Ireland. Woodstown Vikings seem to have been trading as individuals, buying and selling with locals. This pattern of commerce seems to be confined to the area of Kilkenny and Waterford which may mean a distinctive and type of Viking colonisation and settlement in the south-east of Ireland. 5th Century Iron Age settlement Initial studies suggest that the site may have been built and occupied by the local D√©ise around the time of Saint Patrick and long before the first Vikings arrived in Ireland. At that time, the D√©ise were established as an outward-looking people with a strong maritime tradition and colonies in south west Wales.

He started as a schoolmaster, but painting was his hobby, and he subsequently devoted himself to it. In 1861 he had his first picture hung at the Royal Academy. He was essentially an open-air painter, constantly going on sketching tours in the most picturesque spots of England, and all his pictures were painted out of doors. He died at Dover on 2 January 1908.Knight, 1911 The Chantrey trustees bought Knight's \\"December's Bareness Everywhere\\" for the nation in February 1908. Most of his best pictures had passed into the collection of Mr Iceton of Putney (including \\"White Walls of Old England\\" and \\"Hereford Cathedral\\"), Mr Walter Briggs of Burley in Wharfedale (especially \\"Pinner\\"), and Mr SM Phillips of Wrotham (especially two watercolours of Richmond Bridge). John William Buxton Knight was an English landscape painter who was true to nature and never weakened his conviction to become fashionable. ‚ÄúTo speak of him as the successor of Constable would not be without justification, not because he consciously or purposefully based himself upon that master, but because he had much of his predecessor‚Äôs spirit and unconventionality of method, and, as well, a full share of his artistic intelligence.‚Äù Born in Sevenoaks, Kent to William Knight (1810 ‚Äì 1878; accomplished artist and teacher of art), ‚ÄòBuxton Knight‚Äô began his art studies at an early age, although not in any formal and systematic manner, but by working in the open air and observing nature. Knole Park in Sevenoaks was popular with many notable artists, who Buxton Knight made acquaintance with, helping inform his future path that included: ‚Äúa high position amongst the great exponents of English landscape‚Ä¶. which Constable and Crome would have been the first to recognise.‚Äù At the age of 22 Buxton Knight went as a student into the Academy schools on the advice of Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, and was there for just two years. Prior to these formal studies he was already an exhibiting painter, having contributed his first canvas to the Academy at the age of 18 in 1861. He continued to exhibit at the Academy throughout his career and until the end of his life, with a total of 72 paintings. His last exhibition was in 1907 and subsequent to his death the following year, one of his two paintings exhibited in 1907, Old December Bareness Everywhere, was acquired by the Chantrey Bequest and bequeathed to the Tate for the benefit of the Nation. Despite exhibiting such a large number of paintings at the Royal Academy throughout his lifetime, Buxton Knight was never admitted as an Associate or an Academician, despite having been put forward numerous times. A year after his death, E Barrington Nash wrote: ‚ÄúI am informed that Mr Knight‚Äôs name has lately been placed upon the list of candidates for the Royal Academy Associateship, but surely, with such great masterly works as ‚ÄòDover‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhite Walls‚Äô, ‚ÄòLittlehampton‚Äô, ‚ÄòHop-picking‚Äô, ‚ÄòPoole‚Äô, ‚ÄòRichmond Park‚Äô, (White Lodge), and many others en evidence before us, it is a matter of national disgrace that he has not been admitted a full- fledged R.A. long ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are few types of landscape that he has not painted: coast subjects, river scenery, mountains, moorland, and quiet stretches of pastoral meadow-land; all have been recorded by him at some time or other. As he wishes to associate only with her [Nature], he has to be ever out and about. And for the greater part of the year he lived in the open, painting industriously through spring, summer, and autumn, returning only when the winter winds make the nomad existence impossible even to the greatest art enthusiast‚Ä¶. Few modern landscape painters can affirm the same absolute self- sacrifice, or can plead that they have to such an extent subordinated the not unnatural inclination to assert individuality at the expense of fidelity to nature. That he should have done so all his life speaks well for his consistency, and implies a rare quality of belief in the soundest principals of art.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile we have painters like John Buxton Knight to keep alive the best traditions of the English landscape school, there is certainly no fear that we shall lose our pre-eminent position among the nations which have produced the greater masters in this form of pictorial practice‚Ä¶. It is because Mr Buxton Knight has attacked and mastered the intricacies of British landscape and has made himself a typical exponent of all that is most characteristic in our insular atmosphere that it is possible to claim for him a place among the chief living leaders of our native art. For he represents more adequately than most of our present-day landscape painters what may be called legitimate school. He follows closely the old-established tradition, the sound and logical tradition, adopted by such masters as Constable, De Wint, and David Cox, which imposes upon all students of nature the obligation to observe shrewdly and to set down what they have observed with unhesitating individuality. He does not imitate his predecessors or formulate his practice in any unwise effort to reproduce their personal mannerisms and tricks of style; but he seeks, as they did, to see absolutely with his own eyes and by the frankest use of his own personality to give vitality and authority to his productions.‚Äù ‚ÄúMr Knight in his nomadic existence is a living protest against convention. The ordinary confinement of a studio would become impossible to a man so devotedly attached to his mistress ‚Äì Nature. Whatever he does is on the spot and there only. He lives and paints in the open nine months out of the twelve, in all weathers, sunshine or storm, seeing and studying Nature in every visible mood.‚Äù Within Sir Alfred Munnings‚Äô autobiography there is a story of a bet that he had with the Director of Leeds City Art Gallery (which has 31 Buxton Knight paintings), whether Buxton Knight had painted ‚ÄòIngleborough Hall, Yorkshire‚Äô in the open air, which the Director did not think could be done. It transpired with Munnings tracking down a retired postman in the neighbouring village of Clapham, Yorkshire, who confirmed that he passed Buxton Knight daily, sat off the footpath working on the big painting. One day the postman took Buxton Knight a letter, which he opened there, saying it brought him bad news as the Royal Academy had not elected him as Associate. Munnings comments that it was ‚Äúa story of the dashed hopes of one of our finest landscape-painters; a story reflecting little credit upon members of the Academy.‚Äù Within Ann Galbally's book ‚ÄúA Remarkable Friendship ‚Äì Vincent Van Gogh and John Peter Russell‚Äù, there is mention that ‚Äú‚Ä¶Buxton Knight another friend of Russell and [Tom] Roberts, and known to Edward Combes, became something of a mentor to Roberts, Russell and other visiting Australian students, including E Phillips Fox. An interpreter of the cool, tonal landscape, tranquil and slightly melancholy at times, with a preference for autumnal scenes and twilight tones.... he became a foundation member of the New English Art Club in 1888. Combes nominated him for membership of the Art Society of New South Wales, where he exhibited in 1882 and 1883, years that Combes was president. One of his March 1883 exhibits, ‚ÄòHalcyon Days by Murmuring Stream‚Äô was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, along with another, ‚ÄòDeserted‚Äô, when Combes was President of Trustees. Knight returned the compliment by painting and exhibiting at the Royal Academy ‚ÄòLa Peruse, Botany Bay. After Edward Combes‚Äô. Knight kept in touch with Russell during his Paris years and with Roberts when he returned to Melbourne, even becoming the subject of a request for an introduction from Roberts by the young Charles Conder in 1890.‚Äù An obituary in the Examiner on 15th February 1908 remarked of Buxton Knight‚Äôs passing as follows: ‚ÄúDeath of a great artist. One of the greatest modern British landscape painters passed away recently, though his death and the loss caused by it to the art of his country have remained practically unnoticed. There are many connoisseurs who hold the late Mr Buxton Knight to be the equal, if not the superior, of the very leaders of modern landscape painting in Great Britain, though his work, like that of Arthur Melville or J Charles, was not very well known to the large public while the artist himself was still among the living. Mr Buxton Knight, who first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1861, excelled chiefly in his strong virile oil paintings of the English countryside, which were always remarkable for their firmness of handling and the sense of structure, of the solidity, of all objects.\\" Within a review of an ‚ÄúArt Exhibition of English Paintings‚Äù on 2ndJanuary 1928, the quality of Buxton Knight was pronounced when describing an exhibited painting of his: ‚ÄúThe character of ‚ÄòNear Chertsey‚Äô, by the late J Buxton Knight, is best described by saying that we should like to see it hung between a Constable and a Sisley ‚Äì with a Monet to complete the sequence ‚Äì as marking a definite stage in the logical development of Impressionism.‚Äù  Galleries and Collections of J W Buxton Knight's Paintings  Art Gallery NSW, Sydney Atkinson Art Gallery Collection Bolton Museum and Art Gallery Bradford Museums & Gallery Burton Art Gallery & Museum Bury Art Museum Cartwright Hall Art Gallery Craven Museum & Gallery Gallery Oldham Hackney Museum Kirklees Museums & Galleries Laing Art Gallery Leeds Art Gallery Manchester Art Gallery Museums Sheffield National Gallery Victoria, Melbourne National Trust, Standen Southampton City Art Gallery Stockport Heritage Services Tate The Mercer Art Gallery Towner UCL Art Museum NotesReferences * .

Page tried to magnify his fame through the wearing of unusually large spectacles, as \\"Larry Page the Teenage Rage\\". The title was originally coined by Jack Bentley, the showbusiness correspondent from The Sunday Pictorial He toured the United Kingdom with Cliff Richard and appeared at top venues, including the Royal Albert Hall. He was a regular on television programmes such as Six- Five Special and Thank Your Lucky Stars. He later became a successful manager, record producer and record label owner. Much of his producer/manager success centered on his efforts with The Kinks and The Troggs, and his ownership of Page One Records and Penny Farthing Records. He produced such hits as \\"Wild Thing\\" along with all the other hits by The Troggs. Apart from The Troggs and The Kinks, the Larry Page Orchestra gave Jimmy Page (later of Led Zeppelin) some early exposure when he played on Kinky Music. In June 1967, the British music magazine NME reported that Page's bid to retain his former 10% interest in the Kinks had been dismissed by London's High Court. He was the producer on Daniel Boone's charting single \\"Beautiful Sunday\\". In 1972, Page was also involved in producing a song for Chelsea F.C.

Built by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg in 1930/31 as the freighter Kurmark, she was requisitioned by the navy at the outbreak of World War II and converted into the auxiliary cruiser Orion, commissioned on 9 December 1939. Known to the Kriegsmarine as Schiff 36, her Royal Navy designation was Raider A. She was named after the constellation Orion. Construction and conversion The Orion was built in 1930 by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg as a freighter for HAPAG, the Hamburg-America Line. To save money, the engines of the liner New York were reused. That proved a poor decision, since the Orion was plagued for her entire life by engine problems. After the war broke out the German Seekriegsleitung (Naval Operations Command) was ill-prepared for raider warfare. The operations of the German auxiliary cruisers of World War I were evaluated and considered a great success, having disrupted British merchant shipping around the world. However the overall effect on the war was evaluated as having been rather minor and so only a small program of converting merchant vessels into auxiliary cruisers was initiated on 5 September 1939. The first two ships being requisitioned were the Kurmark (Orion) and the Neumark (), and conversion started immediately. Raider voyage One of the first auxiliary cruisers operated by Germany in World War II, Orion left Germany on 6 April 1940, under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (later Fregattenkapit√§n) Kurt Weyher. She passed south through the Atlantic disguised as a neutral vessel, where she attacked and sank , a 5,207-ton freighter. In May 1940 Orion rounded Cape Horn and entered the Pacific. She entered New Zealand waters in June 1940 and laid mines off Auckland during the night of 13/14 June 1940, one of which sank the liner five days later. Two other ships were caught by mines from Orion, as well as two trawlers and an auxiliary minesweeper. This done, Orion raided across the Indian and Pacific Oceans attacking four more ships. One she sent to occupied France as a prize; the others were sunk. On 20 October 1940 she made rendezvous with the raider , and the supply ship Kulmerland; operating together they accounted for a further seven ships, including the liner and five ships off Nauru, before going their separate ways in the new year. One Nakajima E8N float plane was purchased in early 1941 by the German naval attach√© to Japan, Vice-Admiral Paul Wenneker, and dispatched on board the supply ship M√ºnsterland to rendezvous with the Orion at the Maug Islands in the Northern Marianas. The meeting occurred on 1 February 1941, and Orion thus became the only German naval vessel of World War II to employ a Japanese float plane. A further six months passed cruising in the Indian Ocean yielded nothing, though she did encounter and capture her final victim, the , in July 1941, in the South Atlantic when Orion was on her way home. Orion returned to Bordeaux in occupied France on 23 August 1941. After 510 days and at sea she had sunk ten ships with a combined tonnage of , plus two more (totalling ) in cooperation with Komet. The German freighter Anneliese Essberger, disguised as the Norwegian freighter Herstein, was supposed to meet the Orion on 30 Aug. 1941. The planned rendezvous was Point Corona at 28 degrees N, 43 degrees W. Failing to see the Orion, the freighter continued north.Giese, O., 1994, Shooting the War, Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, Later history De-commissioned as a commerce raider, the ship was renamed Hektor in 1944 and was used as artillery training ship. In January 1945 she was again renamed Orion and was used to transport refugees from Germany's eastern provinces across the Baltic Sea to ports in northern Germany and occupied Denmark. On her way to Copenhagen on 4 May 1945, after she had picked up the crew of the old battleship Schlesien, the ship was hit by two bombs dropped by aircraft of the Soviet 51st Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment off Swinem√ºnde. Although the crew managed to beach the fiercely burning ship on a sandbank, over 150 passengers and crew lost their lives. The hulk was scrapped in 1952.

Early life and education  Nicolaescu was born in T√¢rgu Jiu, Gorj County, but grew up in Timi»ôoara, where his family moved when he was 5 years old. He graduated from the Politehnica University of Bucharest as a mechanical engineer. After graduation he started to work as a camera operator. He was hard-working, well-organized, curious, intelligent and keen of learning. During these years he acquired many of the skills that have proved so useful when making his later movies. Film director, writer and actor Nicolaescu was considered during his lifetime, as he is now, the most popular, loved and prolific Romanian movie director. His overwhelming film career spanning 55 years, leaves us today his legacy of some 60 movies, for the making of which he used to act at times, simultaneously, as film director, as an actor, and the writer/screenplayer. In his native Romania he is remembered as a superstar for his patriotism, the high praise he gained as a film director, and his charismatic and strong personality. Nicolaescu's debut as a director was in 1962 with the short film Scoicile nu au vorbit niciodatƒÉ (Shells Have Never Spoken). His first feature film was the 1967 French- Romanian co-production Dacii (Les Guerriers). The film was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. Nicolaescu continued his film-making career by both directing a large number of movies and starring in many of his own films. His 1971 film Mihai Viteazul was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. As an anecdotal detail, in Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extraterrestrial (original version only), the young boy Elliott watches this movie on TV - Mihai Viteazul in the US version - the scene with the battle of Calugareni. His 1976 film The Doom was entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival. Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave) ruled the Romanian-speaking principalities (Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania), a union he accomplished under his reign for a very brief period (1600‚Äì1601). It was initially planned that Sergiu Nicolaescu would produce Mihai Viteazul with Hollywood superstars playing the lead characters. The communist authorities of the time drastically ruled for an all Romanian cast. The obstacle, eventually, was circumvented by means of casting, in the lead role of Mihai Viteazul the actor Amza Pellea, who achieved a masterful rendition of the hero. Sergiu Nicolaescu was able, throughout his career, to select the best actors available for the characters they had to portray. Most of Nicolaescu's films are built around figures and events in Romanian history, and although showing superior mastery, in the (imposed) realistic approach they somewhat follow the patterns of historical movies from the Communist governed countries. During the Communist period, some of these movies were seen as ground-breaking through either their way of publicly presenting Romanian history, or the masterful depiction of the heroical dimension of its history. For instance, the movie \\"RƒÉzboiul independen≈£ei\\" was the first picture made during the Communist-era in Romania to describe a King of Romania (namely Carol I) in a positive fashion. On the other hand, Mircea (1989, also known as Proud Heritage) was considered by some critics as being a less artistically fulfilled endeavour. Nevertheless, Mircea was officially blocked from distribution, until the Romanian Revolution of 1989 (\\"All I've done was to present a different state leader than Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. He understood and stopped the movie [from premiere]\\"). Yet, when Mircea was finally released to the public the film was very well appreciated. Sergiu Nicolaescu at the premiere of Carol I Sergiu Nicolaescu at the premiere of Last corrupt in Romania Nicolaescu produced impeccable renderings of the historical battles and costumes. For example, through his reenactments of the Battle of CƒÉlugƒÉreni in Mihai Viteazul and both the Crusade of Nicopole and the Battle of Rovine in Mircea, Nicolaescu shows a brilliant command of his craft, masterfully directing a huge acting crew (actors, extras, etc.) towards the rendering of accurate details, by these means forging widely successful movies. For instance, when making Mihai Viteazul, Nicolaescu successfully managed a 5,000-member crew, actors and extras and, despite the obvious technical limitations of the communication means in the 1970s (no mobile phones were available at that time, for instance), he imposed a strict discipline during filming of every cannon fire and every attack scene, thus helping everything to fall in place under his unique order. His movie Mihai Viteazul was considered the best of the Romanian historical movies and is one of the most appreciated world-wide of this kind (for example, considering imdb ratings) . The film was released in 1970 in Romania, and worldwide by Columbia Pictures as The Last Crusade. A TV sequence in Steven Spielberg's \\"E.T.\\" (original, uncut version) show images from \\"Mihai Viteazul\\" (scenes with the Battle of CƒÉlugƒÉreni). While creating such historical movies he was supported by the Romanian Ministry of Defence with large numbers of extras and war equipment. He documented his historical movies meticulously, to this end seeking the advice of military consultants and distinguished historians of the Romanian Academy. Regardless these films have aesthetic qualities too, and are the expression of Sergiu Nicolaescu's vision as both a film director and a writer. His 1985 film The Ring was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. For this movie, Nicolaescu performed a very intensive boxing training with a former European boxing champion. The intensity of his training for this movie was similar to what the Romania's Olympic boxing team at that moment performed. At that time Nicolaescu was 50 years old and its boxing matches and the hits during this movie are real and against strong opponents. His huge work capacity was widely admired by his colleagues and crew. Another merit of his filmmaking is considered to come from his taking huge - yet, still well-calculated - risks while filming. For instance, for the war scenes, he used real dynamite and trotyle as well as real blood. In such situations there was always a high likeliness of the actors or the camera operators being afraid to fulfill their tasks. It was a big merit of Sergiu Nicolaescu that, for all difficult or very risky tasks, he was able to show in detail to any actor or camera operator exactly what they had to do before they did it. In such circumstances, during his 50 years career as film director and actor, Nicolaescu experienced several accidents or illness: still he went on performing and finished his movie projects with courage and sometimes at great personal cost (e.g., while producing Mihai Viteazul). After Mircea, Nicolaescu expands on historical themes, directing films that shed positive light on Ion Antonescu, Romania's Axis-aligned dictator in the World War II period (his √énceputul adevƒÉrului, also known as Oglinda), or glorified the World War I heroine Ecaterina Teodoroiu (Triunghiul mor≈£ii, also known as Triangle of Death). Sergiu Nicolaescu and Prince Paul An accomplished battle scenes director, Sergiu Nicolaescu, as legend has it, would have been able to film some 70‚Äì80 meters of useful shots in the same amount of time that the average director would need in order to produce 12‚Äì15 meters. Although his last films were not as popular as his earlier productions, he continued to direct new films, such as Orient Express (2004) or Cincisprezece (2005), a love story set during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Supravietuitorul (2008), Carol I (2009) and Poker (2010). When asked to nominate three movies he made that he most liked, Nicolaescu chose Mihai Viteazul (also known as Michael the Brave), Osanda (also known as The Doom) and Atunci i-am condamnat pe toti la moarte (also known as Then I Sentenced Them All to Death). Politician Nicolaescu started his political career during the 1989 Romanian Revolution. At the time the Revolution took place he was very well known and respected for his films, in Romania. He participated actively at the Romanian Revolution and his appearance and speech during the Revolution brought about coherence and clarity to the people who listened. In December 1989 he was received with a standing ovation (his name) from the crowd of hundreds of thousands of Romanians gathered in the heart of Bucharest after Nicolae Ceau»ôescu left power on 22 December 1989. He called for calm, and asked the crowd to listen to and support Ion Iliescu. Nicolaescu went on to play an important political role during the Revolution and was elected to the Romanian Senate in 1992 as a member of the Romanian Social Democratic Party. He left the party in April 2011,\\"Sergiu Nicolaescu ≈üi-a dat demisia din PSD\\" (\\"Sergiu Nicolaescu Resigns from PSD\\") (in Romanian). AdevƒÉrul, 19 April 2011; accessed April 19, 2011 and then rejoined it after only two days. \\"Sergiu Nicolaescu s-a √Æntors √Æn PSD: 'BunƒÉ ziua, mƒÉ ierta»õi!'\\" (\\"Sergiu Nicolaescu Returns to PSD: 'Hello, Forgive Me!'\\") , Jurnalul Na»õional, 20 April 2011; accessed January 3, 2013 In 2005 Nicolaescu declared in an interview that he was not happy with his decision of going into politics. He felt that the politics took too much from his precious time and because of that he was not able to do as many films as before the Revolution. Personal life=Sports and personal life Nicolaescu said that as a young boy, he practiced many sports like athletics, equestrianism, boxing, shooting and rugby. According to the public information available, Nicolaescu was a very active person and he had a very disciplined lifestyle. Every day, even when he was 80 years old, he spent at least 1 hour doing physical activity (gimnastics, etc.). Although he was never a very passionate football fan, Nicolaescu stated in a 2011 interview for the Romanian daily sports newspaper Gazeta Sporturilor that capital-based team Steaua Bucure»ôti was the dearest to him throughout time, even though he played rugby at Dinamo Bucure»ôti. \\"Am fost rugbyst la Dinamo, dar ≈£ineam cu Steaua\\" (I was a rugby player at Dinamo, but I liked Steaua\\"), Gazeta Sporturilor, 4 October 2011; accessed January 3, 2013 He explained this by saying that he liked the former Steaua legends Gheorghe Hagi, L√°szl√≥ B√∂l√∂ni and Dan Petrescu more than Dinamo's players. Nicolaescu declared in the same interview that he also liked Ripensia Timi»ôoara and Universitatea Craiova in their glory days, but not as much as Steaua. Nicolaescu was married three times. He did not have children and this was his main regret. Failing health and death Nicolaescu had been diagnosed since 2000 with diverticulitis, a benign and chronic digestive condition that was acting up every couple of years. In January 2008 he underwent brain surgery twice due to an accident. At that time, he was 78 years old. The doctors did not give him any chance for success because at the time of his first brain operation he was completely paralyzed. He had to learn how to walk, speak and write again, and he successfully managed to do it after 3 months of intense physiotherapy and neurological exercise. Nevertheless after this brain surgeries he said he changed dramatically: he started feeling his age and he started changing his behaviour (more impatient and irritable). In his last years the health problems made his life difficult. Yet he continued directing, acting and planning new films. He maintained intact his huge passion for filmmaking until the end of his life. On 26 December 2012 he was admitted with atrial fibrillation and a traumatised thorax with pulmonary contusion to the Elias Hospital in Bucharest. He complained of pain in the lower abdomen and loss of appetite. After the clinical examination, the doctors concluded that he was suffering from an acute episode of diverticulitis, and he received treatment for this condition. During the treatment, Nicolaescu's condition improved, but the intestinal transit was not functional and the blood work was still unsatisfactory. The doctors opted for an exploratory laparoscopy, which led to the discovery of an acute perforated appendicitis complicated with peritonitis. After undergoing surgery, Nicolaescu developed respiratory complications, leading to acute respiratory failure within 48 hours. He entered into cardiac arrest on 3 January 2013, and could not be resuscitated by the hospital staff. He was pronounced dead at 8:20 AM GMT+2.http://www.rtv.net/nicolaescu-a-fost-tratat-timp-de-12-ani-pe- pentru-mai-multe-complicatii-ale-bolii-diverticulare_60263.html His body was cremated on 5 January 2013, according to his wishes.

Aminopterin is a synthetic derivative of pterin. Aminopterin works as an enzyme inhibitor by competing for the folate binding site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Its binding affinity for dihydrofolate reductase effectively blocks tetrahydrofolate synthesis. This results in the depletion of nucleotide precursors and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. Uses Discovered by Dr. Yellapragada Subbarow, the drug was first used by Sidney Farber in 1947 to induce remissions among children with leukemia. Aminopterin was later marketed by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, New York) in the United States from 1953 to 1964 for the indication of pediatric leukemia. The closely related antifolate methotrexate was simultaneously marketed by the company during the same period. Aminopterin was discontinued by Lederle Laboratories in favor of methotrexate due to manufacturing difficulties of the former. During the period Aminopterin was marketed, the agent was used off-label to safely treat over 4,000 patients with psoriasis in the United States, producing dramatic clearing of lesions. The use of aminopterin in cancer treatment was supplanted in the 1950s by methotrexate due to the latter's better therapeutic index in a rodent tumor model. Now in a more pure preparation and supported by laboratory evidence of superior tumor cell uptake in vitro, aminopterin is being investigated in clinical trials in leukemia as a potentially superior antifolate to methotrexate. The compound was explored as an abortifacient in the 1960s and earlier, but was associated with congenital malformations. Similar congenital abnormalities have been documented with methotrexate, and collectively their teratogenic effects have become known as the fetal aminopterin syndrome. When a similar cluster of abnormalies appears in the absence of exposure to antifolates it is referred to as aminopterin-like syndrome without aminopterin. The reference to the use of Aminopterin as a rodenticide (i.e. rat poison) dates back to a 1951 patent issued to the American Cyanamid Company that is commonly cited by a variety of reference textbooks including the Merck Manual, although the use of aminopterin as a rodenticide was later disputed. The preparation of the molecule is complex and expensive. It is also unstable in the environment due to degradation by light and heat. The apparently mistaken association of aminopterin with its use as a rodenticide likely dates back to a 1951 patent issued to the American Cyanamid Company (then the holding company of Lederle Laboratories) that is commonly cited by a variety of reference textbooks. Aminopterin has a single-dose LDLo of 2.5 mg/kg when orally administered to rats. Aminopterin is widely used in selection media (such as HAT medium) for cell culture, particularly in the development of hybridomas, which secrete monoclonal antibodies. Implication in 2007 Menu Foods recall On March 23, 2007, ABC News reported that aminopterin was the chemical linked to the 2007 Menu Foods pet food contamination incident. The incident resulted in a massive recall of the affected foods. The link to aminopterin was confirmed by New York State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker and Dr. Donald Smith, Dean of Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, in a statement released on the same day. On March 27, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center expressed concern that the problem may not yet be fully understood and that other contaminants may be involved, noting that \\"clinical signs reported in cats affected by the contaminated foods are not fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin\\". On March 30 it was widely reported that the United States Food and Drug Administration had found melamine in wheat gluten that was used in the pet foods in question. These same reports stated that the FDA had failed to find evidence of aminopterin in the wheat gluten. Tests at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada detected aminopterin in some pet food samples, but only in concentrations of parts per billion or parts per trillion, amounts too low to cause the symptoms seen. Exposure and treatment Symptoms of exposure in humans include: *nausea *vomiting *anorexia *weight loss *chills *fever *stomatitis ‚Äì inflammation of the oral mucosa *pharyngitis ‚Äì inflammation of the pharynx *erythematous rashes ‚Äì red rashes on the skin *hyperpigmentation ‚Äì increased pigmentation associated with cleared psoriatic lesions *gastrointestinal hemorrhage *renal failure ‚Äì in high doses necessarily involving concomitant leucovorin rescue *abortions in pregnant women Supralethal doses of aminopterin may be rescued with the antidote Leucovorin (also known as folinic acid), a reduced form of folic acid which bypasses dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme inhibited by aminopterin. Leucovorin has been used in rats, dogs and humans to rescue aminopterin toxicity. Leucovorin rescue is a therapeutic maneuver intentionally employed with antifolates to achieve tumoricidal drug concentrations that would otherwise be lethal to the patient. In humans, leucovorin rescue at overdosages lower than 10 mg aminopterin in an average 70 kg adult should comprise an initial leucovorin dose of at least 20 mg (10.0 mg/m2), given intravenously (preferably), or orally. Subsequent doses of 20 mg (which may be taken orally) should be given at 6 hour intervals until hematological abnormalities are improved. Massive aminopterin overdosage in humans (i.e. > 40 mg AMT in an average 70 kg adult), should be approached with an initial leucovorin dose of 100 mg (50 mg/m2), given intravenously and continued at 6 hour intervals until the hematological abnormalities are improved (likely 8‚Äì12 courses or more). Additionally, to prevent reversible aminopterin-mediated nephrotoxicity manifesting as increases in serum creatinine and which further delays drug elimination, urinary alkalinization with and volume expansion should be considered in cases of massive aminopterin overdosage, particularly those involving greater than 100 mg AMT in an average 70 kg adult human. Consistent with the known enterohepatic cycling of the related antifolate methotrexate, oral activated charcoal, and saline cathartic or sorbitol may promote excretion if an overdose of aminopterin is suspected. However, rescue with leucovorin should form the backbone of treatment. The vitamin folic acid is an oxidized precursor to reduced folates that is upstream of the blockade at dihydrofolate reductase, and compared to leucovrin is recognized as a very weak antidote to the toxic effects of antifolates that is inappropriate for use in cases of acute intoxication. Minnich et al. dosed mongrel dogs subcutaneously with aminopterin and folic acid simultaneously to test whether folic acid can rescue animals from the lethality and toxicity of aminopterin Dogs were given 0.020, 0.046, 0.044 escalated to 0.088, and 0.097 mg/kg aminopterin each day for 7 to 12 days. Folic acid was given in a weight ratio to aminopterin of 200:1 to 800:1. All animals survived. In contrast, animals given aminopterin in an amount of 0.041 mg/kg/day x 6 days without folic acid died. Thus, when the ratio of folic acid to aminopterin was 200:1 and greater, all of the subjects survived on regimens that would have otherwise been uniformly fatal to all subjects. Similar effects have been noted in rodent species as well, where the range for rescue by folic acid was fairly narrow and highly dependent on the timing (optimal of 1 hour prior to aminopterin) of administration in relation to aminopterin. The temporal relationship between folic acid administration and rescue has been interpreted as the necessary period of time required for the vitamin to be converted in vivo to reduced forms.

Already a cricketing prodigy during his school days, May played his entire cricket career as an amateur, and was regarded by many players and fans as England's finest batsman in the post-war era. He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1981, and was posthumously inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. Early career Born in Reading, Berkshire, he was educated at Leighton Park junior school, Charterhouse and Pembroke College, Cambridge, and at both he was regarded as a batting prodigy. Across the 1950s, he was the most consistent and prolific English batsman in both county (representing Surrey) and Test cricket. He made his Test match debut against South Africa at Headingley in 1951, scoring 138, and was then a regular England player until forced out by illness at the end of the 1950s. May was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1952. May was the natural successor to Leonard Hutton as England captain after the successful defence of the Ashes on the 1954‚Äì55 tour of Australia. Captaincy Bill Johnston in 1954‚Äì55. He was England's top scorer in both the triumphs of 1954‚Äì55 and 1956 and the debacle of 1958‚Äì59 and was seen by many as England's greatest post-war batsman May enjoyed a largely successful captaincy of both his county and country. Surrey had been County Champions for seven years running, with May the captain for the last two seasons, and until 1958 England was never defeated under his leadership. He had beaten South Africa 3‚Äì2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2‚Äì1 in 1956, the West Indies 3‚Äì0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4‚Äì0 in 1958.

In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers.p219-220, Trueman As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader.p128, Brown In 1958‚Äì59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative too readily to Richie Benaud and he concentrated on saving runs instead of trying to get batsmen out. Faced with Ian Meckiff's questionable bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1‚Äì0, India 5‚Äì0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1‚Äì0. He lost 2‚Äì1 to the 1961 Australians and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests (20 wins, 10 defeats and 11 draws), Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series. He retired entirely from first-class cricket in 1963, taking up a post in the City with the insurance brokerage Willis Faber Dumas; now Willis Group. Cricket administrator May succeeded Alec Bedser as Chairman of the England cricket selectors in 1982 and held the post for seven years, including presiding over the notorious 1988 Summer of four captains. The reappointment of David Gower as captain for the disastrous 1989 Ashes series was widely seen as a mistake and precipitated May's departure from the role. He served as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club and posthumously as President of Surrey County Cricket Club from 1995 to 1996. Personal life In 1959, May married Virginia Gilligan, a daughter of the former England captain Harold Gilligan and they had four daughters. May died at Liphook, Hampshire, from a brain tumour on 27 December 1994, four days before what would have been his 65th birthday.

At the time, Blakeley, Alabama had been the county seat of Baldwin County. The Battle of Blakeley was the final major battle of the Civil War, with surrender just hours after Grant had defeated Lee at Appomattox on the morning of April 9, 1865. Mobile, Alabama was the last major Confederate port to be captured by Union forces, on April 12, 1865. After the assassination of President Lincoln on April 15, 1865, other Confederate surrenders continued into May 1865. Course of the battle Positions of units involved Position of 2nd Division, 13th Army Corps Maj. Gen. Edward Canby's Union forces, the XVI and XIII Corps, moved along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, forcing the Confederates back into their defenses. Union forces then concentrated on Spanish Fort, Alabama and nearby Fort Blakeley. By April 1, Union forces had enveloped Spanish Fort, thereby releasing more troops to focus on Fort Blakeley. Union forces built 3 rings of earthworks reaching ever closer until nearly from the Fort Blakely front. Confederate Brig. Gen. St. John R. Liddell, with about 4,000 men, held out against the much larger Union force until Spanish Fort fell on April 8 in the Battle of Spanish Fort. This allowed Canby to concentrate 16,000 men for the attack on April 9, led by Brig. Gen. John P. Hawkins. Sheer numbers breached the Confederate earthworks, compelling the Confederates, including Liddell, to surrender within about 30 minutes in the final assault after 5:30 pm. The casualty figures are approximate, but an estimated 75 Confederate soldiers were killed, with over 2,800 captured, and 150 Union troops were killed with 650 wounded during the siege and assault. The siege and capture of Fort Blakeley was basically the last combined-force battle of the war. Yet, it is criticized by some (such as Ulysses S. Grant) as an ineffective contribution to Union war effort due to Canby's lateness in engaging his troops. The battle was actually fought hours after the Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox. The battle is considered the last major battle of the Civil War with the exception of the Battle of Columbus, Georgia, fought a few days later. African-American forces played a major role in the successful Union attack, with 5,000 colored troops of the Union U.S.C.T. brought through Pensacola, FL. Two days later, the 2 nearby island batteries in the Blakeley River were abandoned. After this battle, Union forces were finally able to occupy the city of Mobile, Alabama on April 12, 1865. Legacy The site of the battle is now a historical park, Historic Blakeley State Park. The Civil War Trust, a division of the American Battlefield Trust, has saved 67 acres of Fort Blakeley Battlefield in partnership with the Historic Blakeley Foundation.

Welsh communities are analogous to civil parishes in England. In 2016 there were 870 communities in Wales. Until 1974 Wales was divided into civil parishes. These were abolished by section 20 (6) of the Local Government Act 1972, and replaced by communities by section 27 of the same Act. The principal areas of Wales are divided entirely into communities. Unlike in England, where unparished areas exist, no part of Wales is outside a community, even in urban areas. Most, but not all, communities are administered by Community councils, which are equivalent to English parish councils in terms of their powers and the way they operate. Welsh community councils may call themselves town councils unilaterally and may have city status granted by the Crown. In Wales, all town councils are community councils. There are now three communities with city status: Bangor, St Asaph and St Davids. The Chair of a town council or city council will usually have the title Mayor (Welsh: maer). However, not every community has a council. In communities with populations too small to sustain a full community council, community meetings may be established. The communities in the urban areas of the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport do not have community councils. As of the United Kingdom Census 2001 there were 869 communities in Wales. More than 730 have a council (i.e. 84%). They vary in size from Rhayader with an area of to Cefn Fforest with an area of . In the 2001 Census they ranged in population from Barry with 45,053 recorded inhabitants to Baglan Bay with no permanent residents. The twenty-two principal area councils are required to review the community boundaries within their area every fifteen years. The councils propose changes to the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales, which prepares a report and makes recommendations to the Welsh Government. If the Welsh Government accepts the recommendations then it implements them using a statutory instrument. For example, in 2016 four new communities were created in the City and County of Cardiff.

His parents were Stuart Morton Winter Sheppard (1895‚Äì1937) and Barbara Sheppard (n√©e Shepherd). He is a direct descendant of William Shepherd (1735‚Äì1814), his grandfather four times removed. His father was a solicitor, and a cousin of Tubby Clayton, founder of Toc H; his mother was the daughter of the artist and illustrator, William James Affleck Shepherd (1866‚Äì1946). His family moved to Sussex after his father died in the late 1930s. He was educated at Northcliffe House School in Bognor Regis and then at Sherborne School, Dorset, where his cricketing talent first emerged. After National Service as a second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment, he then went up to read history at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1947, and started to play first-class cricket.  Cricketing career  Sheppard played cricket for Cambridge University (blue 1950, 1951 and 1952; captain 1952), Sussex (captain 1953) and England. He made his Test debut against West Indies in August 1950, having scored heavily for Cambridge against the tourists earlier that summer. He toured Australia as an undergraduate with Freddie Brown in 1950‚Äì51 without success. In 1952 he topped the English batting averages, scoring 2,262 runs at an average of 64.62, including a record 1,281 runs and 7 centuries for Cambridge University. His career total for Cambridge University, 3,545, was also a record. He hit 1,000 runs in a season six times, reaching 2,000 three times (highest 2,270, average 45.40, in 1953). He hit three double centuries, one for Sussex and two for Cambridge University (highest 239 not out for Cambridge University v Worcestershire at Worcester in 1952). He reached his highest Test score, 119, against India at the Oval in 1952. Sussex were the runners-up in the County Championship in 1953, and Sheppard was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year that year. In 1954 he captained England in two Tests against Pakistan in the absence of Len Hutton. He won one Test and drew the other, but the series ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Sheppard was a favourite with the Old Guard at Lord's, who had wanted him to captain the tour of Australia in 1954‚Äì55 instead of the Yorkshire professional Hutton, but this came to naught. Sheppard was already progressing his clerical career and declined to tour unless required as a captain. In 1956 he was recalled to play Australia and made 113 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, where Jim Laker famously took 19 wickets and England won by an innings. He was a staunch opponent of apartheid in South Africa, and one of many signatories in a letter to The Times on 17 July 1958 opposing 'the policy of apartheid' in international sport and defending 'the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games'.Brown and Hogsbjerg, Apartheid is not a game, 16. He refused to play against the touring South Africans in 1960, refused to watch the touring South Africans in 1965 and was a vocal opponent of the proposed MCC tour in 1968‚Äì69 which was ultimately cancelled after the South African government refused to allow Basil D'Oliveira to play. In 1970 he supported the Fair Cricket Campaign against the proposed 1970 tour of England by South African cricket team.Brown and Hogsbjerg, Apartheid is not a game, 68. Sheppard was willing to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia in 1962‚Äì63. His many friends at Lord's wanted him to captain the Fourth and Fifth Tests against Pakistan in 1962, but Sheppard had not played serious cricket for years. He made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Ted Dexter was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the home series and the forthcoming tour of Australia. Sheppard agreed to tour and \\"the presence in the pulpit of David Sheppard...filled the Anglican cathedral of every state capital from Perth to Brisbane\\"Swanton, E.W. (1975) Swanton in Australia, with MCC 1946‚Äì1975, Fontana. p. 124. . Sheppard made 0 and 113 in the victorious Second Test at Melbourne, but dropped two catches and was dropped himself when he was on a pair in the second innings. He ran out his captain Ted Dexter, took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry so that Ken Barrington had to come out to see Colin Cowdrey make the winning single. Although he held some good catches on the tour \\"the ones I dropped were at such vital moments\\", Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry in the Second Test and Neil Harvey in the Fourth Test off Trueman, who told him \\"The only time your hands are together are on Sunday\\".Trueman, Fred (2004) As It Was, The Memoirs of Fred Trueman, Pan Books. p. 282.

One couple in Australia asked Mrs Sheppard if the Reverend could christen their baby, but she advised them not to as he was bound to drop it. Sheppard played his last Tests against New Zealand in early 1963. Ecclesiastical career Sheppard was converted to evangelical Christianity whilst at Cambridge, influenced by Donald Grey Barnhouse, and trained for the ministry at Ridley Hall, Cambridge from 1953 to 1955, where he attended the lectures of Owen Chadwick and Maurice Wiles, and was much impressed by a visiting lecturer, Donald Soper. He was involved with the ministry of E. J. H. Nash.Manwaring, Randle (2002) From Controversy to Co-Existence: Evangelicals in the Church of England 1914‚Äì1980. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 58. He was ordained in 1955, serving his title as curate at St Mary's Church, Islington, but continued to play Test cricket sporadically until 1963, being the first ordained minister to do so. From early 1958, he and his wife lived in Canning Town, working at the Mayflower Family Centre. Sheppard became Bishop of Woolwich (a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Southwark) in 1969, and Bishop of Liverpool in 1975. When installed as Bishop of Liverpool, he was the youngest diocesan bishop in England. He was an active broadcaster and campaigner, especially on the subjects of poverty and social reform in the inner cities, and opposition to apartheid and the tour to England by the South Africa national cricket team scheduled in 1970. Sheppard worked closely with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Derek Worlock, on these issues, and was often an outspoken critic of Margaret Thatcher's government. The Queen visited both Liverpool cathedrals in 1978 to celebrate the long-delayed completion of the Anglican cathedral, and Pope John Paul II visited both cathedrals during his tour of England in 1982. The bishops worked together in the aftermath of the 1981 Toxteth riots, the 1985 Heysel stadium disaster and the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium disaster. Sheppard also worked with other church leaders in Liverpool, including the Methodist chairman John Newton. He gave the Dimbleby Lecture in 1984, on \\"The Other Britain\\". In 1985 he was appointed as a member of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission on Urban Priority Areas, culminating in the publishing of the controversial report \\"Faith in the City\\". He was national president of Family Service Units from 1987 and chaired the religious advisory committee for the BBC and IBA from 1989 to 1993. Sheppard retired in 1997, and in the 1998 New Year Honours was elevated to a life peerage, taking the title Baron Sheppard of Liverpool, of West Kirby in the County of Merseyside. He sat in the House of Lords on the Labour benches. Awards and tributes * He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1960 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Islington Boys' Club. * In 2001 Sheppard was named President of Sussex County Cricket Club. Writing Beginning in the mid-1950s, Sheppard wrote a weekly column for Woman's Own, 520 words a week, \\"trying to make one point that had something to say about the everyday God in an accessible way\\". His column continued for 17 years.Sheppard, David (2002) Steps Along Hope Street. Hodder & Stoughton, London. p. 33. He wrote several books: Built As a City in 1974 about urban mission, Bias to the Poor in 1983, and two autobiographies, Parson's Pitch in 1964 and Steps Along Hope Street in 2002 (named after the street in Liverpool which links the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals). Personal life Sheppard was married to Grace (n√©e Isaac), a daughter of a clergyman, whom he met at Cambridge. They were married in 1957 and their only child, Jenny (now Sinclair), was born in 1962. Lady Sheppard died of cancer on 10 November 2010, aged 75.Bergin, Claire (12 November 2010) \\"Archbishop Kelly pays tribute to Lady Grace Sheppard\\". Independent Catholic News In December 2003, Sheppard announced that he had been suffering from colorectal cancer for the previous two years. He died on 5 March 2005, the day before what would have been his 76th birthday. He was survived by his wife and daughter. After a funeral near his retirement home at West Kirby on the Wirral, his ashes were buried in Liverpool Cathedral, with a memorial service at the cathedral in May 2005. Legacy On Pentecost Sunday, 11 May 2008, during the Christian Walk of Witness, a memorial statue, the Sheppard-Worlock Statue in the form of two bronze doors, was unveiled to honour both Sheppard and Archbishop Derek Worlock. The memorial was designed by notable sculptor Stephen Broadbent and funded by public donations.

Born in Oakland, California, Plunkett studied law at the University of California, where he was a member of the California-Alpha chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, but showed greater interest in the school's theatrical group. He moved to New York City in 1923 and began work as a stage actor as well as a costume and set designer. After some time in Greenwich Village, he moved back to California, this time to Hollywood, and found work as a movie extra. (He can be seen dancing with Irene, another future top designer, in Erich von Stroheim's 1925 film The Merry Widow.) He soon made a career change to costume and wardrobe. Plunkett's first credited work as a costume designer was the 1927 film Hard-Boiled Haggerty. At RKO, he developed a huge costume and wardrobe department that became a major studio asset. Given free rein, he set about creating costumes that rivaled the work of his contemporaries, such as Travis Banton and Adrian. Plunkett's best-known work is featured in two films, Gone with the Wind (1939) and Singin' in the Rain (1952), in which he lampooned his initial style of the Roaring Twenties. In 1951, Plunkett shared an Oscar with Orry-Kelly and Irene Sharaff for An American in Paris. Plunkett retired in 1966, after having worked in films, on Broadway, and for the Metropolitan Opera. He spent the last years of his life with his partner Lee, whom he formally adopted so that he could inherit his estate. He died at age 79 in Santa Monica, California.

Biography=Life and career Born in Prague, Baarov√° studied acting at the city's Conservatory and received her first film role in the Czechoslovak film Pavel ƒåamrda's Career (Kari√©ra Pavla ƒåamrdy) at the age of 17. Her mother sang in a choir and appeared in several theatre plays; her younger sister, Zorka Jan≈Ø (1921‚Äì1946), also became a film actress. In 1934, Baarov√° left Prague for Berlin after winning a contest at the UFA film studios for a role in the film Barcarole. In Berlin, she made a successful appearance in the film Barcarole (1935), along with the German actor Gustav Fr√∂hlich (1902‚Äì1987). She and Fr√∂hlich, meanwhile divorced from the Hungarian opera singer Gitta Alp√°r, became lovers and starred together in several films. Baarov√° also performed on stage at the Deutsches Theater and the Volksb√ºhne. She received several job offers from Hollywood studios. She turned them down under pressure from the Nazi authorities, but later regretted it and claimed to her biographer, Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω: \\"I could have been as famous as Marlene Dietrich.\\" After her engagement to Fr√∂hlich, the couple moved to Schwanenwerder island on the outskirts of Berlin, where their house was close to the residence of Joseph Goebbels, a leading member in the Nazi government of Adolf Hitler with a decisive voice in German film production and Nazi cinema. Baarov√°, still working for the UFA studios, met him when Goebbels visited Fr√∂hlich's home in 1936. Gradually, they became closer and, under the urging of Goebbels, started a relationship that lasted over two years. Their love affair caused serious complications between Goebbels and his wife Magda. When the minister began to show up in public with his mistress, Magda Goebbels in turn began an affair with Goebbels' state secretary Karl Hanke and eventually asked Hitler for permission to divorce her husband. According to Baarov√°'s own statements, she herself, fearing Goebbels' wounded pride, approached the dictator for help. Hitler intervened on 16 August 1938 and rebuked his minister, stating that in view of his \\"perfect marriage\\" as well as the coming annexation of the Sudetenland, his affair with a Czech actress was an impossibility. Baarov√° was told by the Berlin chief of police Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorff that she had to quit her relationship with Goebbels immediately and was prohibited from performing on Hitler's direct order. Her recently completed film A Prussian Love Story, which depicted the love affair between Wilhelm I and the Polish princess Elisa Radziwill, and was a thinly-veiled reference to Goebbels and Baarov√°, was banned, and not shown in theatres until 1950 as Liebeslegende (\\"Story of Love\\"). Paid shills yelled out \\"Get out, minister's whore\\" when Baarov√†'s character appeared on the screen at the premiere of Der Spieler (\\"The Gambler\\"), and did not stop until the showing was halted. The film's run was ended and the actress had a nervous breakdown. She tried to contact friends in Hollywood, with an eye to going there, but Hitler told her that she could not leave the country. Followed by the Gestapo wherever she went, ordered by Helldorf to stop making public appearances, and pressed by her friends, in the winter of 1938‚Äì39 Baarov√° fled back to Prague. There, she was temporarily allowed to perform under German occupation and, in 1942, moved to Italy, where she starred in such films as Grazia (1943), La Fornarina (1944), Vivere ancora (1945) and others. After Allied troops occupied Italy, she had to return to Prague. In April 1945, however, L√≠da Baarov√° left Prague for Germany again. On the way, she was taken into custody by the American military police, imprisoned in Munich, and later extradited to Czechoslovakia. Post- war years In Czechoslovakia in 1945, Baarov√° and her family were taken into custody on suspicion of collaboration with the Germans during the war. Her mother died under interrogation; her sister Zorka committed suicide in 1946. She herself was released after 18 months of custody due to lack of evidence. She had never been convicted or sentenced. While in custody, she was often visited by the puppeteer Jan Kopeck√Ω and they eventually married on 27 July 1947. Kopeck√Ω was a close relative of a prominent politician in the post-war government of Czechoslovakia. Kopeck√Ω's prominent relative did not approve of the marriage and Kopeck√Ω lost his job as a result. Kopeck√Ω emigrated to Argentina, leaving L√≠da behind to recuperate in the sanatorium of Dr. Lundwall. In Austria, the actress attempted a comeback, but when the Austrian- British actor Anton Walbrook withdrew from a film where he was cast with her, she left for Argentina to escape the resulting negative media. Living in extreme poverty, she decided to return to Italy. Her husband stayed in Argentina and they were divorced in 1956. Back in Italy, she appeared in several films, including Fellini's I Vitelloni (1953), where she played the wife of a rich merchant. In 1958, she moved to Salzburg, where she again performed on stage. She married Austrian physician Kurt Lundwall in 1969; he died in 1972.Profile cineartistes.com; accessed 14 August 2015. After the fall of Communism in Europe In the 1990s, Baarov√° re-appeared on the cultural scene of the Czech Republic. She published her autobiography. A film, L√≠da Baarov√°'s Bittersweet Memories, was released in 1995 and won an award at the 1996 Art Film Festival in Trenƒçianske Teplice, Slovakia. Later life and death Baarov√° suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 2000 in Salzburg, while living alone on the estate she inherited after the death of her second husband, Dr. Lundwall. Her ashes were interred in Prague's Stra≈°nice Cemetery, where she rests with her parents and her sister Zorka. In popular culture In 2016, a dramatization of Baarov√°'s life was set on film in ' (L√≠da Baarov√°) by Filip Renƒç, with Tatiana Pauhofov√° starring as Baarov√° and Karl Marcovics as Goebbels.

History In 2000, Jeff Lynne found a new impetus to work on the music of his old band and returned to the recording studio to work on an ELO project for the first time in some 15 years just prior to the comeback album Zoom in 2001. This work resulted in a digitally remastered compilation released in late 2000. Unlike its predecessors, this project, Flashback, was personally approved and endorsed by Lynne. The set includes songs featured from all 11 studio albums up to that point, including an edit of \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" from their live album The Night the Light Went On in Long Beach, plus some new recordings amongst the band's extensive back catalog, most notably a reworking of Lynne's only UK number one hit \\"Xanadu\\".

Despite critical acclaim and support from DJ John Peel who featured them on his \\"Perfumed Garden\\" radio show, the band was not a great success in commercial terms. They were among the first psychedelic bands in England along with Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. Tomorrow recorded the first ever John Peel show session on BBC Radio 1 on 21 September 1967. The band included Steve Howe on guitars, who would later join the british prog band Yes. History As The In-Crowd, they recorded the songs \\"Am I Glad to See You\\" and \\"Blow-Up\\" especially for the film Blowup in 1966. The lyric to \\"Blow-Up\\" is an almost-literal interpretation of the film's plot. The two songs remained unused however when the Yardbirds were hired to film the nightclub sequence that the In-Crowd would have appeared in. As Tomorrow, they appeared in the 1967 film Smashing Time under the name of the Snarks. John \\"Junior\\" Wood was ill during shooting of the film and was replaced by John Pearce, a clothes dealer. Again, their music was not used in the film. Instead, the music used in the film is performed by Skip Bifferty.Colin Larkin, The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Volume 7, page 541 (Oxford University Press, 2006. ) During 1967 the band released two singles, one of which, \\"My White Bicycle\\", was later covered by heavy rock act Nazareth, and as a novelty record by Neil the Hippy (Nigel Planer) of the British sitcom The Young Ones. According to drummer John 'Twink' Alder, the song was inspired by the Dutch Provos, an anarchist group in Amsterdam which instituted a community bicycle program: \\"they had white bicycles in Amsterdam and they used to leave them around the town. And if you were going somewhere and you needed to use a bike, you'd just take the bike and you'd go somewhere and just leave it. Whoever needed the bikes would take them and leave them when they were done.\\" Tomorrow's September 1967 single \\"Revolution\\" preceded the Beatles song \\"Revolution\\" by a year. In Joe Boyd's book White Bicycles ‚Äì Making Music in the 1960s he asserts the band's performance of the song one night at the UFO Club as the apotheosis of the '60s UK underground.PUNKCAST#1129 Video of 'White Bicycles' reading in NYC, 28 March 2007. Tomorrow also jammed with Jimi Hendrix at the UFO Club. There was a long delay between their 1967 single releases and the eventual release of their self-titled album in February 1968, and the album would fail commercially. However the album has gained a cult following today, with reissues of the album gaining traction more than 50 years after its original release. Youtube postings of the album, as well as their unreleased tracks has also earned Tomorrow there cult status in the 60's and in music as a whole. Much like bands like The 13th Floor Elevators, Kaleidoscope and July who have all sparked a resurgence years after their music was mainly forgotten to the public, in addition no radio airplay after they disappeared, Tomorrow's self titled vinyl remains a treasure of the late 60's Psychedelic Era. Tomorrow singer Keith West is perhaps better known as a participant in Mark Wirtz's A Teenage Opera project that gave him the solo hit single \\"Excerpt from 'A Teenage Opera' (Grocer Jack)\\" and brief commercial success in 1967. Guitarist Steve Howe later joined progressive rock band Yes, whilst Twink joined the Pretty Things in order to complete their concept album, S.F. Sorrow, before forming the Pink Fairies. John Wood moved into music production.

The player controls the adventurer Sabreman as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its caverns to find an escape past the exit guardians. Underwurlde features about 600 flip screen areas. Unlike other games of its time, Sabreman is not injured when touched by enemies and is instead knocked backwards. Underwurlde is the second game in the series, between Sabre Wulf and Knight Lore, and released alongside the latter for the ZX Spectrum during Christmas in 1984. Another developer, Firebird, ported the game to the Commodore 64 the next year. Reviewers recommended the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics commented on the game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version was similar to the original, reviews were mixed‚Äîone critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it near the bottom of their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.  Gameplay  Atop this screenshot of gameplay is the player's score and a measure of Sabreman's depth from the surface. Underwurlde is a platform game viewed from a side-angle perspective. The player controls Sabreman, a pith-helmeted adventurer, as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its caverns to find a way to escape past the exit guardians. Sabreman must use a specific weapon‚Äîknife, dagger, and torch‚Äîthat corresponds to each guardian. The player uses the keyboard's QWERTY keys to progress through a series of flip screens in which the player's character reaches the boundary of the viewable area on the screen to flip to another area, with 597 screens in all. While Sabreman begins in a castle adorned with clocks, birds, and baskets, the character must also descend down into caverns through several successive vertical screens. Sabreman automatically attaches a rope to the ceiling when the player controls him off of a ledge. The player can then swing Sabreman side to side to jump to another ledge. At the bottom of a cavern, Sabreman can ride a bubble to the top. As a change from earlier games by the developer, Sabreman is invulnerable to enemies and is instead knocked back in a bounce by their touch. However, Sabreman will fall to his death if knocked off a precipice. The player starts with seven lives and few extras can be found throughout the game. Blue gemstone power-ups turn Sabreman invincible to enemy touch for a limited amount of time. Enemies include harpies and gargoyles, who can be killed by Sabreman's weapon. After passing the first guardian, eagles appear and can pick up and drop Sabreman. Underwurlde has three possible endings, and each was designed to correspond to the plots of the three planned sequels in the Sabreman series. The player receives a score calculated by the number of objects acquired, enemies defeated, and percentage of rooms visited. The game also supports keyboard and joystick control, and as with other games from the developer, the instructions packaged with Underwurlde were cryptic, and left the player to figure out the controls and sequence on their own. The Commodore 64 version of the game is similar to the original in appearance and gameplay.  Development  Little is known about the development processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and to let their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side view as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game was released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version was released a year later.  Reception  Reviewers recommended the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. Critics noted the game world's size and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Retro Gamer described the game's near 600 flip screens as \\"colossal\\". At the time of its release, Computer and Video Games said it was likely the most expansive world on the platform. Later reviews noted the game's exceptional difficulty. Crash magazine recommended the game as \\"A Crash Smash\\". ZX Spectrum magazine Crash considered Underwurlde to be \\"excellent\\" and Ultimate's best game. Each of the magazine's three reviewers appreciated different features of Sabreman's navigation within the game, but namely liked riding volcanic bubbles and being carried by birds. Another reviewer compared Sabreman's jump to that of Bugaboo (The Flea) and added that the game's single difficulty level was adequately balanced. All three Crash critics noted that the QWERT keyboard controller mapping worked well in this game, though it was awkward in others. They also praised Underwurlde detailed graphics and sound. One reviewer additionally noticed that the game lacked a score leaderboard, but surmised that this was a trade- off for the game's expansive world. Unlike Crash, Computer and Video Games did not like the controls, which was the reviewer's main criticism of the game. Another ZX Spectrum reviewer, Chris Bourne (Sinclair User), said that the game was fast, colourful, and akin to a \\"vertical Atic Atac\\". Commodore 64 magazine Zzap!64 reviewers were mixed. Jaz Rignall said it was among the best arcade adventures on the Commodore 64 since it had the right balance of frustration and addiction to keep him playing the ZX Spectrum version for weeks. Gary Penn, however, considered the game average when it first released for the ZX Spectrum and thought that the port of the year-old game had out-of-date sounds, out-of-tune title music, and was overall not among the Commodore 64's best adventure games. Gary Liddon thought that the Commodore 64 version appeared \\"crude\\" compared to other releases for the platform, though perhaps par for the ZX Spectrum. The magazine noted the difficulty of traversing the vertical caverns and found the eagles annoying, especially when they dropped Sabreman to his death. Zzap!64 critics felt that the game presented well, but was less accessible, overpriced for its age, and poorly animated. Ultimately, they considered the game better than the developer's previous two 1985 releases, but not as good as it could have been. The Computer and Video Games review of the Commodore 64 release judged otherwise: that the version was up to the developer's standards and worth the yearlong wait. The magazine praised Firebird's work on the port.  Legacy  In the early 1990s, Your Sinclair rated the game within the top fifth of their top 100 ZX Spectrum games. The magazine said that Underwurlde was the most simultaneously loved and hated game of its era‚Äîthough Sabreman's invulnerability to direct damage was novel, the Your Sinclair also recalled the game's \\"stratospheric level of frustration\\". Their readers, however, ranked the game near the bottom of their top 100 games for the platform. Underwurlde was later included in the 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation Rare Replay, wherein critics rated it among the worst of the 30 titles by Ultimate Play the Game and its successor, Rare. Kyle Hilliard (Game Informer) wrote that Ultimate's early games, such as Underwurlde, fared the worst in the package, though he was glad they were included. \\"By today's standards,\\" began New Zealand newspaper The Nelson Mail, \\"the likes of ... Underwurlde are so clunky and archaic that they are almost laughably impenetrable; strange relics from a bygone era that serve only to illustrate how far the industry has progressed.\\"  Notes  References     External links 1984 video games Action-adventure games Commodore 64 games Platform games Rare (company) games Single-player video games Video games developed in the United Kingdom ZX Spectrum games ","title":"Underwurlde"},{"id":"1351739","text":"Mirage is a name given to several types of jet aircraft designed by the French company Dassault Aviation (formerly Avions Marcel Dassault), some of which were produced in different variants.

Early life  James Gore King was born in New York City on May 8, 1791 at the residence of his maternal grandfather. He was the third son of Mary (n√©e Alsop) King and Rufus King. Among his siblings were brothers John Alsop King, who served as Governor of New York, and Charles King, the president of Columbia University, and Edward King, an Ohio politician. His father served as the first U.S. Senator from New York and was the 3rd and 8th U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom under Presidents George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams. His paternal grandparents were Isabella (n√©e Bragdon) King and Richard King, a prosperous farmer-merchant. Among his extended family were uncles William King, who served as the first Governor of Maine, and Cyrus King, who was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts. His mother was the only child of his maternal grandparents, Mary (n√©e Frogat) Alsop and John Alsop, a prominent merchant and Continental Congressman. He pursued classical studies in England and France, returned to United States and graduated from Harvard University in 1810. He studied law under Peter van Schaack of Kinderhook, followed by study at the Litchfield Law School in Connecticut. Career During the War of 1812, he served as assistant adjutant general of the New York Militia, under Major General Ebenezer Stevens. After the war, he opened a commission house in New York City with his father-in-law, Archibald Gracie, under the name James G. King and Company. Three years later in 1818, he moved to Liverpool, England and established King & Gracie with his brother-in-law, Archibald Gracie Jr., where he established \\"a high reputation for business ability, and, despite the severe financial crisis of 1822, 1823, and 1824, was able to meet all his obligations and to finally close up the affairs of his house on a satisfactory basis.\\" While in Liverpool, he met and eventually became a close friend of John Jacob Astor (later serving as an executor of his will), who offered him the presidency of the American Fur Company, which King declined. In 1824, he returned to New York City and engaged in banking as a partner in the firm of Prime & Ward (thereafter Prime, Ward & King), with residence in Weehawken, New Jersey. In 1835, he succeeded Eleazar Lord to become president of the Erie Railroad, although he did not collect a salary. He served until 1837, when by his visit to London he secured the loan to American bankers of $1,000,000 from the governors of the Bank of England. United States Congress In 1834, he was a candidate for Congress in New York City, but was defeated. King was elected as a Whig to Congress, succeeding fellow Whig Dudley S. Gregory, the former mayor of Jersey City. He served alongside his older brother John in office from March 4, 1849 to March 3, 1851, but declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1850 and was succeeded by Democrat Rodman M. Price (who later served as the 17th Governor of New Jersey after leaving Congress in 1853). While in Congress, he was a member of the Committee of Commerce, and he opposed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Upon the ascendancy of Millard Fillmore to the presidency after Zachary Taylor's death in 1850, King was reportedly considered for United States Secretary of the Treasury, but informed Fillmore that he did not wish to serve as he had planned on retiring from public service and was, in fact, leaving Congress at the end of the term. Later career After leaving Congress, he resumed the banking business. By this time the firm he had worked for had undergone dissolution, and so was succeeded by the House of James G. King & Son.  Personal life  Portrait of his wife, Sarah Rogers Gracie King, by Thomas Sully, 1831. On February 4, 1813, King was married to Sarah Rogers Gracie (1791‚Äì1878), the daughter of Archibald Gracie, a Scottish-born shipping magnate and early American businessman and merchant in New York City and Virginia. Together, they were the parents of eleven children, many of whom married into prominent colonial families, including: * Caroline King (1813‚Äì1863), who married Denning Duer, a son of William Alexander Duer. * James Gore King, Jr. (1819‚Äì1867), who married his first cousin, Caroline King, a daughter of John Alsop King. * Archibald Gracie King (1821‚Äì1897), who married Elizabeth Denning Duer, a daughter of William Alexander Duer. * Mary King (1826‚Äì1890), who married Edgar Henry Richards in 1856. * Frederika Gore King (1829‚Äì1916), who married Bancroft Davis, an American lawyer, judge, diplomat, and president of Newburgh and New York Railway Company. * Edward King (1833‚Äì1908), who married Isabella Ramsay Cochrane in 1858. After her death, he married Elizabeth Fisher. * Fanny King (1836‚Äì1905), who married James Latimer McLane, brother of Robert Milligan McLane, in 1859. King died of a \\"congestion of the lungs\\" on October 3, 1853 at his country place, \\"Highwood,\\" near Weehawken, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1832. He was interred in the churchyard of Grace Church, Jamaica, New York. Descendants Through his son Archibald, he was the grandfather of May Denning King (1848‚Äì1925), who married John King Van Rensselaer, a son of Henry Bell Van Rensselaer and grandson of Stephen Van Rensselaer III, the patroon of Rensselaerwyck. His great-great-granddaughter Ellin Travers Mackay married Irving Berlin. Another great-great-grandchild was Wolcott Gibbs, who was also a direct descendant of Martin Van Buren (James Gore King's grandson married Martin Van Buren's granddaughter, and Wolcott Gibbs was their grandson). Through his youngest daughter Fanny, he was the grandfather of Robert McLane, who served as the 32nd Mayor of Baltimore.

Career King wrote Trollslayer (1999), the first novel for the Black Library label. His most memorable characters, Gotrek and Felix, have appeared in a series of novels, beginning with Trollslayer, a collection of previously published and new short stories. His next-most-famous character is Ragnar Blackmane, a Space Marine from the Warhammer 40,000 game setting universe (although the character was already in existence in the game and background material, King took him and expanded his history in the novel series). In 2010, he signed a three-book deal with Black Library that will focus on elven brothers Tyrion and Teclis. Prior to moving to the Czech Republic, King spent a number of years as a designer for GW, contributing to their game universes (where much of his fiction is also set). He has also written a tetralogy of books featuring the Death's Angels which are available in the Czech Republic, Spain and Germany. He married his long- time girlfriend, Radka, on 24 September 2005, and lives in Prague with his family.

It is the world's largest manufacturer of aircraft landing gear. The company can be traced to the establishment of a 50/50 joint venture in 1995 between France's Messier and the United Kingdom's Dowty Group, then owned by TI Group. Messier-Dowty was purchased outright from TI Group by the SNECMA group in 1998. The 2005 merger of SAGEM and SNECMA made Messier- Dowty part of the new Safran company. In May 2011, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty was formed through the merger of three Safran subsidiaries: Messier-Dowty, Messier-Bugatti and Messier Services. In May 2016, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty became SAFRAN Landing Systems. Safran Landing Systems operates a number of sites across the globe, in Asia, Europe, Canada, Mexico and United States; workshare is divided between these locations, each one typically specialising in an aspect of landing gear design, manufacture and support. Its main headquarters is located in V√©lizy, outside Paris. The company's projects are divided into two business units: Airbus & European Programs and Boeing & North American Programs. History The origins of the company dates back to the formation of a 50/50 joint venture between the France-based Messier and the United Kingdom-based Dowty Group, then owned by TI Group, in 1995. That same year, the company announced its intentions to develop a universal landing gear platform that would be shared between multiple airliners; the aim of such commonality was a 20-40% reduction in the cost of the landing gear to manufacturers and end customers. According to Tony Edwards, the chief executive and chairman of the merged entity, while acknowledging the new entity had been experiencing some difficulties due to a lack of preparation, he regarded it as being: \\"a successful example of European integration that works\\". During early 1998, Messier-Dowty was purchased outright from TI Group by the SNECMA group. During 1998, the company decided to invest $30 million in the creation of a new US subsidiary, known as A-Carb, to produce carbon brakes for both Airbus and Boeing airliners. That same year, Messier-Dowty and Messier Bugatti teamed up to form a new SNECMA-held subsidiary, Messier Services, which specialised in delivering the maintenance of both landing gear systems and brake units. During late 1998, Messier-Dowty announced that, to support future product development and testing efforts, it was planning to construct the world's largest landing gear drop test rig at its facility in Toulouse, France. In 1999, Messier-Dowty announced plans to create a design office in Seattle, America, as part of an effort to work closely with Boeing on both its civil and military programmes. That same year, it was announced that a new manufacturing facility would be established in Singapore as a joint venture between Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing and Messier-Dowty. In June 2001, Messier-Dowty was awarded a $2.9 million contract for research into the field of low-noise landing gear; this deal was a part of the SILENCE(R) initiative, a four-year European effort launched to improve the environmental qualities of commercial aircraft. During 2002, the company opened the world's largest landing gear test centre in Gloucester, England. In February 2004, Messier-Dowty officially opened its new Chinese production facility in the city of Suzhou; it was the first Chinese operation to be wholly owned by a SNECMA company. Around this period, the company won several key bids; in February, it secured a deal to provide the main landing gear for the Airbus A400M; in March, it was appointed to supply both the main and nose gear of the Boeing 787, as well as the integrated landing gear of the Sukhoi Superjet 100 in October 2003. In 2010, Messier-Dowty became the first company in the world to incorporate composite braces onto the main landing gear of a commercial aircraft, this being the Boeing 787. The 2005 merger of SAGEM and SNECMA made Messier-Dowty part of the new Safran company. During December 2007, Airbus announced that Messier-Dowty had been confirmed as the supplier for the main landing gear of the upcoming Airbus A350 XWB; under this arrangement, it was responsible for the design, development, qualification testing, manufacturing and in-service support of the main gear. In the following year, the firm invested around C$2 million in the introduction of robotic surface finishing of its landing gear outer fittings at its plant in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada. In March 2010, Messier-Dowty opened a new undercarriage components factory in Quer√©taro, Mexico. The facility was part of a larger deal between Safran and the local Mexican government; expansion into the production of increasingly advanced components was seen at the time as being highly likely. In May 2011, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty was formed through the merger of three Safran subsidiaries: Messier-Dowty, Messier-Bugatti and Messier Services. During 2014, the firm became the sole owner of French joint-venture maintenance company Hydrep after acquiring the other 50% share formerly held by Sabena Technics. In May 2016, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty became SAFRAN Landing Systems. Operations Landing gear for the Airbus A400M Safran Landing Systems has operational sites across the globe. The sites are located in Asia (Singapore, Seremban, Suzhou), Europe (V√©lizy, Molsheim, Bidos, Villeurbanne, Gloucester, Feyzin), Canada (Ajax, Montreal), Mexico (Quer√©taro) and United States (Walton, Seattle). The main headquarters is located in V√©lizy, outside Paris. Each site is responsible for certain aspects of landing gear design, manufacture and support. * Bidos: responsible for the production of large components (bogies, main fittings, integral axles) for large commercial, business, commuter aircraft and helicopter gears. * Gloucester: Design, research and systems integration together with manufacturing capability. This site is focused on the manufacture of complex major structural components such as main fittings and bogies for large commercial aircraft together with main fittings and large components for military and commuter aircraft platforms.

Avast has more than 435 million monthly active users and the second largest market share among anti-malware application vendors worldwide as of April 2020. The company has approximately 1,700 employees across its 25 offices worldwide. Avast was founded by Pavel Baudi≈° and Eduard Kuƒçera in 1988 as a cooperative. It had been a private company since 2010 and had its IPO in May 2018. In July 2016, Avast acquired competitor AVG Technologies for $1.3 billion. At the time, AVG was the third-ranked antivirus product. It is dual- listed on the Prague Stock Exchange and on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company's main product is the Avast Antivirus along with tools such as the Avast Secure Browser and the Avast SecureLine VPN. History Avast was founded by Eduard Kuƒçera and Pavel Baudi≈° in 1988. The founders met each other at the Research Institute for Mathematical Machines in Czechoslovakia. They studied math and computer science, because the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia would require them to join the communist party to study physics. At the Institute, Pavel Baudi≈° discovered the Vienna virus on a floppy disk and developed the first program to remove it. Afterwards, he asked Eduard Kucera to join him in cofounding Avast as a cooperative. The cooperative was originally called Alwil and only the software was named Avast. The cooperative was changed to a joint partnership in 1991, two years after the velvet revolution caused a regime change in Czechoslovakia. The new regime severed ties with the Soviet Union and reverted the country's economic system to a market economy. In 1995, Avast employee Ond≈ôej Vlƒçek wrote the first antivirus program for the Windows 95 operating system. In the 1990s security researchers at the Virus Bulletin, an IT security testing organization, gave the Avast an award in every category tested, increasing the popularity of the software. However, by the late 1990s, the company was struggling financially. Alwil rebuffed acquisition offers by McAfee, who was licensing the Avast antivirus engine. By 2001, Alwil was experiencing financial difficulties, when it converted to a freemium model, offering a base Avast software product at no cost. As a result of the freemium model, the number of users of the software grew to one million by 2004 and 20 million by 2006. Former Symantec executive Vince Steckler was appointed CEO of Avast in 2009. In 2010, Alwil changed its name to Avast, adopting the name of the software, and raised $100 million in venture capital investments. The following December, Avast filed for an initial public offering, but withdrew its application the following July, citing changes in market conditions. In 2012, Avast fired its outsourced tech support service iYogi, after it was discovered that iYogi was using misleading sales tactics to persuade customers to buy unnecessary services. By 2013, Avast had 200 million users in 38 countries and had been translated into 43 languages. At the time, the company had 350 employees. In 2014, CVC Capital bought an interest in Avast for an undisclosed sum. The purchase valued Avast at $1 billion. Later that year, Avast acquired mobile app developer Inmite in order to build Avast's mobile apps. Additionally, in 2014 Avast's online support forum was compromised, exposing 400,000 names, passwords, and email addresses. By 2015, Avast had the largest share of the market for antivirus software. In July 2016, Avast reached an agreement to buy AVG for $1.3 billion. AVG was a large IT security company that sold software for desktops and mobile devices. In July 2017, Avast acquired UK-based Piriform for an undisclosed sum. Piriform was the developer of CCleaner. Shortly afterwards it was disclosed that someone may have created a malicious version of CCleaner with a backdoor for hackers. Avast had its IPO on the London Stock Exchange in May 2018, which valued it at ¬£2.4bn and was one of the UK‚Äôs biggest technology listings.Cyber security group Avast valued at ¬£2.4bn in IPO. Financial Times. Aliya Ram in London 10 May 2018. Ondrej Vlcek assumed the role of CEO and co-owner of Avast Plc in July 2019. A day later, he changed his annual pay to $1 and pledged his board director's compensation of $100,000 to charity. In October 2019 Jaya Baloo joined Avast as their Chief Information Security Officer. In April 2020, Avast released a new secure, private mobile web browser for Android based on technology acquired from previously unreported acquisition of Tenta, a Seattle-based startup. Products Avast develops and markets business and consumer IT security products for servers, desktops, and mobile devices. The company sells both the Avast product line and the acquired AVG-branded products. As of late 2017, the company had merged the AVG and Avast business product lines and were working to integrate the corporate departments from both companies. Additionally, Avast has developed utility software products to improve battery life on mobile devices, cleanup unnecessary files on a hard drive, find secure wireless networks or create a VPN connection to the internet. Avast and AVG consumer security software are sold on a freemium model, where basic security features are free, but more advanced features require purchasing a premium version. The free version is also supported by ads. Additionally, all Avast users provide data about their PC or mobile device to Avast, which is used to identify new security threats. Antivirus scanning, browser cleanup, a secure browser, password management, and network security features are provided for free, while firewall, anti-spam, and online banking features have to be purchased. According to PC Pro, the software does not \\"nag\\" users about upgrading. About 3% of Avast's users pay for a premium version (10% in the US). The Avast business product family includes features for endpoint protection, Wi-Fi security, antivirus, identity protection, password management, and data protection. For example, the desktop product will look for vulnerabilities in the wi-fi network and run applications suspect of having malicious hardware in an isolated sandbox. The Avast Business Managed Workplace monitors and manages desktops, and assesses on-site security protocols. The company also sells management software for IT administrators to deploy and manage Avast installations. Reception PC Magazine gave the Avast free antivirus software an overall score of 8.8 out of 10 and gave AVG a score of 8.4. The review said Avast gets good lab test results overall and has many features, but its password manager is a bit limited. In tests by the AV-TEST Institute, Avast 2017 received six out of six points for protection and usability, and 3.5 points for performance. A review in Tom's Guide said the free Avast antivirus product has \\"good malware protection\\" and has a small footprint on the system. The review said Avast has a competitive set of features for a free antivirus product, but the scans are slow and it pushes users to install the Google Chrome browser. The Avast antivirus product for business users received 4 out of 5 by TechRadar in 2017. The review said the software had good features, protection, configuration, and an \\"excellent interface,\\" but took up too much hard drive space and didn't cover mobile devices. According to Tom's Guide, the mobile version is inexpensive and feature-laden, but some features are unreliable or do not work as expected. PC Magazine said the mobile version \\"has just about every security feature you could want\\" but was difficult to use. AVG, which was purchased by Avast in 2016, has also generally performed well in lab tests. AV-Test Institute gave AVG six out of six points for usability, 5.5 points for protection and 5.5 points for performance. However, AVG scored 81.05 in Virus Bulletin's lab tests, which is slightly below average. The software is \\"very good\\" at detecting malware, but \\"disappointing\\" in antiphishing screening. A review in Tom's Hardware gave the AVG software seven out of ten stars. The review highlighted that the software has a small system footprint and has good malware protection, but does not have a quick scan option and lacks many additional features. Controversy On 27 January 2020 Motherboard reported \\"An Avast antivirus subsidiary sells 'Every search. Every click. Every buy. On every site.' Its clients have included Home Depot, Google, Microsoft, Pepsi, and McKinsey.\\" The investigation showed that the Avast Antivirus and AVG AntiVirus programs collected data from the users' computers and that the Avast subsidiary Jumpshot repackaged and sold them. In response Avast announced on 30 January 2020 that Jumpshot would cease operations over the data privacy backlash. On the basis of the information revealed, on 11 February 2020 the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection announced that it has initiated a preliminary investigation.

Taney photo by Mathew Brady The Taney Arrest Warrant is a conjectural controversy in Abraham Lincoln scholarship. The argument is that in late May or early June 1861, President Lincoln secretly ordered an arrest warrant for Roger B. Taney, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, but abandoned the proposal. The arrest order is said to have been in response to Taney's Circuit Judge ruling in Ex parte Merryman, which found Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus to be unconstitutional. As McGinty (2008) concludes, if there was such a plan to arrest Taney it would have been both reckless and inflammatory on Lincoln's part, for it would have dramatically escalated political tensions. McGinty, like all of Lincoln's major biographers, concludes there never was any arrest warrant.p.76-77 History and evidence The single primary source document is a manuscript written in the 1880s by Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln's friend, bodyguard, and United States Marshal for the District of Columbia during his administration. According to the manuscript, which is a brief history of Ex Parte Merryman by Lamon: :After due consideration the administration determined upon the arrest of the Chief Justice. A warrant or order was issued for his arrest. Then arose the question of service. Who should make the arrest and where should the imprisonment be? This was done by the President with instructions to use his own discretion about making the arrest unless he should receive further orders from him. The warrant was never served, according to Lamon, for reasons that are not given. The manuscript dates from the 1880s and resides in the collection of Lamon papers at the Huntington Library. Taney's own memoir, completed from his unfinished autobiography by Samuel Tyler in 1872, refers to the Chief Justice's fears of arrest. According to Tyler, as Taney \\"left the house of his son-in-law, Mr. Campbell\\" en route to his courtroom \\"remarked that it was likely he should be imprisoned in Fort McHenry before night, but that he was going to Court to do his duty.\\"p. 74 Lamon's story emerged during the early 1970s in A More Perfect Union by Harold Hyman. Some recent writers have accepted the story as credible including Jeffrey Rogers Hummel in Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men. For a time in the 1980s and 1990s, it was believed that a second corroborating document by Francis Lieber referred to the warrant. This was the result of a mistaken numerical citation in an earlier work. The error was discovered by John Rodehamel, a manuscripts librarian at the Huntington Library. Once informed of this error, Jeffrey Hummel described Lamon's unsupported account as \\"not credible.\\" That President Lincoln considered, and then rejected, the possibility of arresting Taney is briefly mentioned in The Civil War produced by Ken Burns and aired on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) public television stations. Controversy One criticism is that Lamon is an unreliable source, remembered for lending his name to a ghost-written 1872 biography of Lincoln by Chauncey Black. The biography was received unfavorably by Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, and was denounced for a lack of discretion. On the other hand, the habeas corpus manuscript was written in the mid-1880s around the time Lamon was working on his second book, Recollections of Abraham Lincoln, incomplete when he died (Lamon's daughter edited the completed portions of it for posthumous publication). This second book is highly regarded among Lincoln scholars and is the main source for many well-known Lincoln anecdotes and quotes. The Taney warrant story does not appear in this second book. Another criticism is that no copy of the warrant or other documentation has been found to support Lamon's story. During Lincoln's administration several prominent political adversaries were arrested, including Congressman Clement Vallandigham, a leading Copperhead, and at least one other federal judge ‚Äì William Matthew Merrick of the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia ‚Äì was placed under house arrest for defying the suspension. Several northern newspapers also publicly called for Taney's arrest after the Merryman ruling. NotesReferences * Brandt, Dennis W.

He is also known as Israel of Neustadt, Israel of Marpurk, and Maharai.  Personal life  Even though Regensburg in Bavaria is often quoted in literature as Isserlein's birthplace it is now clear that he was born in the Styrian Maribor or Marburg an Drau, present-day Slovenia, in the last decade of the 14th century. As a son of R. Petachia of Maribor he came from a well-known scholarly family. His grandfather Rabbi Chaim, named Henschel of Hainburg or Hetschlein of Herzogenburg was well-versed in Jewish learning, which held especially for Isserlein's great-grandfather R. Israel of Krems. R. Shalom of Neustadt was related to him. He is considered to be the most influential rabbi of the Empire in the second third of the 15th century and the last great rabbi of medieval Austria. With his wife Schoendlein he had four sons named Petachia (Kachil, Khatschel), Abraham, Shalom, Aaron, and a daughter Muscat, who died in her childhood. After the early death of his father, it appears, he and his mother moved to Krems, where his uncle R. Aron Bluemlein of Krems/Vienna was teaching, and was together with his mother a victim of the Vienna Gesera in 1421. He studied also in Vienna and in Eger and probably also in Italy. Soon after the Gzerah he returned to Maribor, where he started to serve as a rabbi; already in 1425 his correspondence and socializing with other scholars of his age is attested. Such a scholar was, for instance, Anshel of Maribor (Anshel Marpurk). His authority also included ordination of other rabbis. Responsa of rabbis Israel Bruna, Moses Mintz and Jacob Moelin or the Maharil of Mainz quotes Isserlein with great respect. For an unknown reason he moved to Neustadt, where he is attested in 1445, even though due to the fact that he frequently traveled between Maribor and Neustadt, we can assume that he actually took residence in Neustadt around 1450. He dealt with money-lending only marginally and with small sums of money. In Neustadt, as before in Maribor, he started to run a yeshiva until 1460, when he died. Because of his activities he is also named R. Israel Marpurk and R. Israel of Noyshtat. On many occasions he signed himself as 'The small one and the young one in Israel' (Ha-katan ve-ha-tzair she-be-Israel). His pupils were coming from Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, Silesia, Bavaria, and the Rhineland, among them Israel Bruna, Moses Mintz, and Joseph b. Moses. He is considered as an ideal type of medieval rabbi, who demanded from the community and its members a strict observance of ritual laws, social justice and fairness in business and commerce. He was prone to mysticism, studied kabbalistic works and accepted some kabbalistic customs as his own, even though he was also acquainted with the contemporary Christian scientific literature. He often served as an arbitrator between different communities and his decision was considered final. With the appearance of the press and the codification of halachah his responsa were included in numerous collections, the most prominent being the Shulchan Aruch. His works include: Trumat ha-Deshen, 354 responses, edited by himself, and Psakim u-Chtavim, 267 responses, edited by his pupils after his death (both printed in Venice already in 1519), Beurim, commentaries on Rashi's Commentary on Torah, 36 Shearim (36 Gates), laws on Kashrut, and Seder Gitin, a handbook for divorces. His oldest son Petachia or R. Kachil studied at his father's yeshivah, where he served as his secretary. In his father's name he even answered a question of R. Abraham from Poland. He married in Maribor. On 3 June 1489 he was still involved in lending money. On 12 November 1489 and on 8 March 1493 he is mentioned in Graz, with Nassan (Natan), son of Khatschl of Maribor or R. Kachil or Petachia, son of R. Israel Isserlein.  Works =Terumat HaDeshen Terumat HaDeshen is a work in two parts. The first part of is a collection of 354 responsa by R' Isserlein. The work is named for the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem of removing a part of the previous day's ashes from the furnace ‚Äì 354 is the numerical value of Deshen (Hebrew: ◊ì◊©◊ü). Terumat HaDeshen serves as an important source of the practices of the Ashkenazi Jews. The work was therefore used by R' Moses Isserles as one basis for HaMapah ‚Äì the component of the Shulkhan Arukh which specifies divergences between Sephardi and Ashkenazi practice. According to Shabbatai ha-Kohen (the \\"Shach\\"), it was \\"known\\" that Rabbi Isserlein was not answering questions posed to him in the Terumat HaDeshen, rather he actually wrote the questions and answers himself. Therefore (Shach concludes) unlike with other responsa, the parameters of the questions posed in the Terumat HaDeshen are themselves binding when alluded to in the answer.Commentary of the Shach on Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 196:20 However, with the printing of the work Leket Yosher of Joseph (Joselein) ben Moses in 1903, it became apparent that the responsa were in fact based on actual questions, as the individuals who asked the questions are clearly identified there.See Leket Yosher, introduction, p. XIV The second part of Terumat haDeshen, entitled Pesakim u-ketavim, contains 267 decisions largely on points of the marriage law.

Discovery  It was discovered on April 20, 1904, by Max Wolf in Heidelberg, and initially catalogued as 1904 NY.Provisional elements of the minor planet 1904 NY. J. C. Hammond, Astronomical Journal, vol. 24, iss. 564, p. 105-105 (1904) ADS archive copy The origin of its name is not known; it may be named after the mythical Hercules, given a feminine form as were all asteroids at the time, or after an unknown woman of that name. The bulk of the asteroids discovered by Wolf around this date were named for characters in operas, but if this name was also drawn from such a source, no explanation has been recorded.  Physical characteristics  Herculina is one of the larger members of the main asteroid belt. It is believed to rank among the top 20 in size, but the exact dimensions of many large asteroids are still uncertain. The current estimate for its mass would rank it close to the top 10. It has often been noted for its complex lightcurves, which made determination of its shape and rotation somewhat difficult. A set of 1982 speckle interferometry observations led to a simple preliminary model of Herculina as a three-axis object, perhaps 260 by 220 by 215 km. 1985 analysis of this data concluded there was a nonspherical shape with one bright spot, whilst a 1987 photometric astrometry study concluded the object was spherical with two dark spots (and rotated around a completely different pole), which was in turn negated by a 1988 thermal study which showed the object could not be spherical. By the late 1980s, the generally accepted model was a three-axis object with major albedo or topographical features.Speckle interferometry of asteroids (NASA CR-180438). J. Drummond, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, May 31, 1988 Recent (2002) modelling of photometric data indicates that Herculina is not spherical, but a blocky shape not unlike a battered cuboid - or, as the analysis described it, it \\"resembles a toaster\\". This analysis indicates the presence of multiple largish craters, similar to 253 Mathilde, but no major variation in albedo. The approximate ratios of the axes were suggested as 1:1.1:1.3, broadly consistent with earlier models if slightly more elongated.Models of Twenty Asteroids from Photometric Data. M. Kaasalainen, J. Torppa, and J. Piironen, Icarus 159, 369‚Äì395 (2002).  Satellites  Following anomalous observations during an occultation of the star SAO 120774 in 1978, Herculina became the first asteroid to be \\"confirmed\\" to have an asteroid moon, with the parent asteroid estimated at a 216 km diameter and a satellite of about 45 km orbiting at a distance of around 1,000 km.

Ground plans can help in creating sufficient floor space, especially for larger designs where appropriate planning is needed such as with Depot and shops, however modern architectural large-scale designs are usually done by means of computer with certain dedicated software. Ichnography today can crudely be used for small- scale plans such as Garden and Bedroom layouts, sometimes with 3D sketches.

Biography Judge was born in Helena, Montana. He earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Notre Dame and did his graduate study at the University of Louisville. He graduated from the United States Army Adjutant General School at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. Judge married Carol Anderson in 1966. The couple had two sons, Thomas Warren Judge and Patrick Lane Judge. The Judges, who were serving as governor and first lady of Montana, separated in the fall of 1979 and divorced during the winter of 1980. Judge then married his second wife, Suzan Koch, in 1981. Judge and Koch separated in 2003. Career Judge was a Second Lieutenant in the US Army and a captain in the US Army Adjutant General Corps and in the US Army Reserves from 1958 to 1964. In 1960, he became president and owner of a public relations firm. Judge served in the Montana House of Representatives from 1961 to 1967 and in the Montana Senate from 1967 to 1969, and as 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Montana from 1969 to 1973. In 1972, when incumbent Governor of Montana Forrest Anderson declined to run for a second term, Judge ran to succeed him. He defeated several opponents in the Democratic primary, and advanced to the general election, where he comfortably defeated Republican nominee Ed Smith, a rancher and legislator from Dagmar, Montana. Judge was 38 years old at the time of his election as governor. When Judge ran for re- election in 1976, he was opposed by State Attorney General Bob Woodahl, whom he defeated in a landslide. He ran for re-election for a third consecutive term in 1980, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by his lieutenant governor, Ted Schwinden, who went on to win the general election. During his tenure as governor, Judge served on the executive committee of the National Governors Association and was chair of the Western Governors Conference. When Schwinden declined to seek re-election to a third term in 1988, Judge ran to succeed him, and won a competitive and crowded Democratic primary. In the general election, Stan Stephens, the former President of the Montana Senate and the Republican nominee, defeated Judge by a slim margin. Death Judge died in Chandler, Arizona, on September 8, 2006, at the age of 71. He is interred at Resurrection Cemetery in Helena, Montana.

Due to their humorous tongue-in-cheek lyrics, they have been considered part of the Punk Pathetique subgenre. History Peter and the Test Tube Babies were first featured in Sounds magazine in July 1980, and after a John Peel Radio One session, made their vinyl debut on the Brighton compilation album Vaultage 78. In recent years the band has played at festivals including the 11th Antifest in 2005. They also had two songs on the Oi! compilation Oi! the Album in that same year. They favoured absurd lyrics and strange titles, such as \\"The Queen Gives Good Blow Jobs\\". In 1982, they covered the chart-topping Gary Glitter hit \\"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\\" on their album Pissed and Proud. When the band is not touring, Peter Bywaters offers personal English as a second language tuition on a live-in basis at his home in Brighton. Del Strangefish currently hosts a punk rock radio show with Jimmy Skurvi of the Brighton punk band, Skurvi, on Brighton's Radio Reverb. The shows are also podcasted every week on his podcast page. In 2017, Peter Bywaters was refused entry and deported from the USA, apparently for having imitated Donald Trump the previous year, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said that he was deported for having the wrong visa.

Kljaiƒá, Stipe (2020): IVO BANAC (1947-2020): FIDES, RATIO, LIBERTAS Review of Croatian history XVI (I): 267-273. , Banac was a consultant for the Bosnian Institute. He died after a serious illness at age 73. Biography Banac was born in Dubrovnik in 1947. In 1959 he emigrated to the United States with his mother, reuniting with his father who had escaped from Yugoslavia in 1947. After his father's death in a traffic accident a year later, Ivo lived with his mother in New York City, where he studied history at Fordham University, graduating in 1969. In the same year Banac moved to California, where he obtained M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Stanford University. Although he was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, by his own account he was not attracted by the West Coast flower power movement of the late 1960s. Banac worked at the Stanford University Department of History and Linguistics from 1972 to 1977, and then moved back to the East Coast to teach at Yale University. While at Yale, he earned his tenure, and was a two-time master of Pierson College.His 1984 book The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics was awarded the Wayne S. Vucinich Prize for the best North American book in the field of Russian and Eastern European studies.Othon Anastasakis, David Madden, Elizabeth Roberts; (2016) Balkan Legacies of the Great War p. x; Palgrave Macmillan, Ivo Banac - Nagrade i priznanja (Ivo Banac - Awards and recognitions); During his stay in the United States, Banac regularly visited Yugoslavia. While visiting Zagreb in 1971, he met Vlado Gotovac and Franjo Tuƒëman, who would both become major Croatian political figures after the fall of communism. Banac remained in close contact with Gotovac until his death in 2000; on the other hand, he reportedly didn't think highly of Tuƒëman, describing him as a person who could not tolerate dissent. Nonetheless, Banac organized Tuƒëman's lecture at Yale University in 1990. In 1990, Banac was accepted as an associate member in the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Between 1994 and 1999 he was the director of the Institute on Southern Europe at the Central European University, Budapest. From 1990 onwards, Ivo Banac was also active in Croatian politics. He joined the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and became one of the strongest critics of Franjo Tuƒëman and his government, especially with regards to policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. He expressed his criticism in a column written for Feral Tribune. After the HSLS split in 1997, Banac joined the Liberal Party, keeping a critical distance towards the government even after LS became part of a new governing left-centre coalition in 2000. He often accused Ivica Raƒçan of the SDP of not doing enough to reverse the negative policies of Tuƒëman's era. Many were surprised to find Banac, who had a reputation of a maverick and independent intellectual, become the leader of the LS. It was even more surprising to see him take the post of Minister of Environmental Protection in 2003. He held that post for only a few months, until the SDP - the party with whom the LS was aligned - lost the election to a rejuvenated HDZ. He was elected to the Croatian Parliament in the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election. After the elections, Banac advocated a merger of all liberal parties in Croatia. This policy was opposed by Zlatko Kramariƒá who orchestrated Banac's removal from the party leadership in 2004. Banac left the LS in February 2005 and was an independent representative in the Sabor for the rest of his term. He was publicly criticized for having allegedly mishandled public funds, by renting his personal apartment to himself as office space, as well as furnishing it with taxpayers money. Banac replied, to accusations that such actions constitute mishandling of public funds, that while \\"the data published in the media are correct, it is all a matter of interpretation, is the glass half full or half empty\\". Between 2007 and 2009, Banac was the President of the Croatian Helsinki Committee. At Yale, he was the Bradford Durfee Professor of History Emeritus. He also served as the director of the Council on European Studies at Yale University.

She was appointed the fourth Poet Laureate to the Library of Congress in 1945, and was the first woman to hold this title. Throughout her life she wrote poetry, fiction, and criticism, and became the regular poetry reviewer for The New Yorker. Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Brett C. Millier described her as \\"one of the finest lyric poets America has produced.\\" He said, \\"the fact that she was a woman and that she defended formal, lyric poetry in an age of expansive experimentation made evaluation of her work, until quite recently, somewhat condescending.\\" Early life Bogan was born in Livermore Falls, Maine. With the help of a female benefactor, Bogan attended Girls' Latin School for five years, where she began writing poetry and reading the first issues of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse. Her education eventually gave her the opportunity to attend Boston University. In 1916 she left the university after completing her freshman year. Bogan moved to New York to pursue a career in writing, and her only daughter, Maidie Alexander, was left in the care of Bogan's parents. In 1920 she left and spent a few years in Vienna, where she explored her loneliness and her new identity in verse. She returned to New York City and published her first book of poetry, Body of This Death: Poems. Four years later, she published her second book of poetry, Dark Summer: Poems, and shortly after was hired as a poetry editor for The New Yorker. It was during this time frame that Bogan came to be in contact with influential writers of the time like William Carlos Williams, Edmund Wilson, Marianne Moore, John Reed, Lola Ridge, and Malcolm Cowley. Career Bogan is the author of six poetry collections, including Body of This Death (1923), Collected Poems: 1923‚Äì1953 (1954), and The Blue Estuaries: Poems, 1923‚Äì1968 (1968). She is also the author of several books of prose and translations. Bogan's awards include two fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Bollingen Award from Yale University, and monetary awards from the Academy of American Poets and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1945, she was appointed the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Not only was it difficult being a female poet in the 1930s and 1940s, but her lower-middle-class Irish background and limited education also brought on much ambivalence and contradiction for Louise Bogan. She even refused to review women poets in her early career and stated, \\"I have found from bitter experience that one woman poet is at a disadvantage in reviewing another, if the review be not laudatory.\\" Bogan published her first volume of poems, Body of This Death, in 1923. Her second volume, Dark Summer, appeared six years later in 1929. She also translated works by Ernst J√ºnger, Goethe, and Jules Renard. Later in Bogan's life, a volume of her collected works, The Blue Estuaries: Poems 1923‚Äì1968, was published with such poems as \\"The Dream\\" and \\"Women.\\" Her poetry was published in The New Republic, The Nation, Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, Scribner's, and Atlantic Monthly. Her Collected Poems: 1923‚Äì1953 won her the Bollingen award in 1955 as well as an award from the Academy of American Poets in 1959. She was the poetry reviewer of The New Yorker from 1931 until she retired in 1970, shortly before her death, stating: \\"No more pronouncements on lousy verse. No more hidden competition. No more struggling not to be a square.\\" She was a strong supporter, as well as a friend, of the poet Theodore Roethke. In a letter to Edmund Wilson, she detailed a raucous affair that she and the yet-unpublished Roethke carried on in 1935, during the time between his expulsion from Lafayette College and his return to Michigan. At the time she seemed little impressed by what she called his \\"very, very small lyrics\\"; she seems to have viewed the affair as, at most, a possible source for her own work (see What the Woman Lived: Collected letters of Louise Bogan). A number of autobiographical pieces were published posthumously in Journey around My Room (1980). Elizabeth Frank's biography of Louise Bogan, Louise Bogan: A Portrait, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986. Ruth Anderson's sound poem I Come Out of Your Sleep (revised and recorded on Sinopah 1997 XI) is constructed from speech sounds in Bogan's poem \\"Little Lobelia.\\" > \\"I cannot believe that the inscrutable universe turns on an axis of > suffering; surely the strange beauty of the world must somewhere rest on > pure joy!\\" ‚Äì Louise Bogan Though open to interpretation, \\"Medusa\\" is a poem that revolves around the petrification of the speaker who contemplates the concept of time. In the poem, after the speaker bears witness to the apparition of the Gorgon Medusa, the speaker ponders on how nature and life will continue, as \\"the water will always fall, and will not fall\\" and \\"the grass will always be growing for hay\\" while \\"I shall stand here like a shadow\\" and \\"nothing will ever stir\\". While many interpretations of the poem exist, one possible explanation for the bleakness of this poem may revolve around Bogan's depression and solitude after divorcing from her first husband and living in poverty with a daughter in hand. The idea that one would become petrified and lost in time by Medusa is similar to a feeling of loss and despair as one feels helpless and stuck in a situation where one feels their situation is unchangeable. Brett C. Millier, a Professor of Literature at Middlebury College, describes Bogan's poetry as one where \\"Betrayal, particularly sexual betrayal, is a constant theme.\\" At a time where she most likely felt betrayed by her husband and society, Bogan feels like the speaker in \\"Medusa\\", stuck in a dead scene where her eyes could no longer drift away to a better life.

History The character originally appeared in various Silver Age DC Comics advertisements, and was used to promote DC's entire line of comics. He had a cartoonish face, wore a mortarboard, had stick figure lines for his arms and legs, and a body that consisted of the DC Comics logo. In the late 1980s, Johnny DC hosted a DC promo page called \\"DCI with Johnny DC\\" which appeared in many comics of the era. Like Marvel's \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\"‚Äîand DC's previous incarnation, the late 1970s/early 1980s Daily Planet feature‚Äî\\"DCI with Johnny DC\\" featured miscellaneous DC news items, often spotlighting certain books or creators, and also included a partial checklist of current DC titles. In the mid-1990s, Johnny DC appeared in the satirical special Sergio Aragon√©s Destroys DC. He's shown as having become disillusioned with the modern direction of DC's superhero comics, criticizing the various members of the Justice League and accusing them of having changed for the worse, before turning into a \\"psychotic and badly-drawn\\" pastiche of 1990s comic book anti-heroes in an attempt to destroy the heroes, only to be defeated when Batman tricks him into saying his name backwards √† la Mr. Mxyzptlk. In 2004, Johnny DC was revived and redesigned, as a mostly-silhouette cartoonish child. His name is now used as the name of DC Comics' imprint of comics marketed primarily to children, approximately ages 8‚Äì13. The line consists primarily of books based on Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network animated TV series. These have included series that began as animated features (e.g. Scooby-Doo, Looney Tunes, and The Powerpuff Girls) and those based on DC Comics superheroes (Krypto the Superdog, The Batman Strikes!, Teen Titans Go!, Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century, Justice League Unlimited and Super Friends, based on the eponymous Imaginext toyline).

The Glidden Tours, also known as the National Reliability Runs, were promotional events held during the automotive Brass Era by the American Automobile Association (AAA) and organized by the group's chairman, Augustus Post. The AAA, a proponent for safer roads, acceptance of the automobile and automotive-friendly legislation, started the tour to promote public acceptance and bring awareness of their goals. The original Glidden Tours were held from 1904http://www.gliddentour.org/?page_id=26 until 1913. They were named after Charles J. Glidden, a financier and automobile enthusiast, who presented the AAA with a trophy first awarded to the winner of the 1905 tour. In 1906, the Glidden Tours were the first motor race to use a chequered flag to indicate the end of the race: Sidney Walden divided the courses into sections; the time check at the end of each section was performed by race officials called \\"checkers.\\" These checkers used chequered flags to identify themselves. At the turn of the century automobile travel was difficult as the road systems around the world were generally not well suited for the horseless carriage. To bring more awareness and sponsorship to the event, the AAA announced that the tour would be a \\"reliability and endurance\\" tour, a type of road rally. This attracted automobile manufacturers who competed to test their vehicles and use the events for advertising. The tours were gruelling events: cars broke down, were damaged by accidents, and encountered nearly impassable roads. Drivers and teams did repairs on the run and helped out other drivers having difficulties. The tours went several hundred miles in the US and occasionally into Canada with time limits between check points and a point scoring system to determine a winner of each event. The time limits caused some problems with the inhabitants of where the tour traveled through as autos scared horses, caused personal and property damage and sometimes appeared to not care. Belle Isle Park, Detroit  Revival  Glidden Trophy The Glidden Tours were revived in 1946 by the Veteran Motor Car Club of America (VMCCA) and have continued since with antique cars traveling premarked routes and stopping in local towns to show off their vehicles, many people dressed in period costume. Original founder Augustus Post participated in every Glidden Tour until his death in 1952. In 1954, Dr. Jay Rice Moody was given the Col. Augustus Post Memorial Award by the AAA in recognition for his role in reestablishing the Glidden Auto Tours, and maintaining the spirit of the original tours as founded by Post. The silver Glidden trophy is still presented to the winner of the event.

It is related to the broader Nath Sampradaya. Living preceptor and 163rd head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya's Kailasa Parampara is Bodhinatha Veylanswami. It is most popular among Tamil Hindus.  Origins and lineage  The Nandinatha Sampradaya traces its beginning to at least 200 BCE. Its founder and first known spiritual preceptor was the Maharishi Nandinatha. Nandinatha is said to have initiated eight disciples (Sanatkumar, Sanakar, Sanadanar, Sananthanar, Shivayogamuni, Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, and Tirumular) and sent them to various places to spread the teachings of Shaiva Siddhanta. Though some of these disciples were sent as far as China to spread the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy of their Guru, the work of two is especially important. Patanjali is remembered as the author of the Yoga Sutras. This crucial text is one of the most widely quoted and respected texts on the practice of Yoga. Its translations are studied today in Yoga Centers throughout the world. Most of the mystical, Sanskrit vocabulary of Yoga teachings are first codified in this text. The Ashtanga Yoga (eight-limbed) process of Yoga comes from this text. The text contains a spiritual blueprint for using the physical body to yoke consciousness to the Divine source. Tirumular authored the Tirumantiram, which is a well known Tamil text. The Tirumantiram is still chanted in Tamil Nadu. It covers a wide variety of topics and illuminates much of the esoteric mystical insight of this Sampradaya. It illustrates the life style and moral conduct advocated by this tradition. It provides much insight into the mystical meditations and tantras (techniques) valued by the Nandinatha Sampradaya. It places great emphasis on repetition of the panchakshara (or five lettered) mantra: Om Namah Shivaya Spiritual lineage : Maharishi Nandinath‚Üí Tirumular‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí nameless rishi from himalayas‚ÜíKadaitswami‚Üí Chellappaswami‚Üí Siva Yogaswami‚ÜíSivaya Subramuniyaswami ‚Üí Bodhinatha Veylanswami  Beliefs  The teachings of the Nandinatha Sampradaya, value highly the necessity of a living preceptor to carry the unseen, energetic essence of these teaching to devotees. The Nandinatha Sampradaya is a Siddha Yoga Tradition (\\"Siddha\\" means literally attainment), and its Gurus have often demonstrated great mystical abilities and wisdom. It is said that these teachers have realized their oneness with the Supreme God (they call \\"Shiva\\") and have merged as completely as humanly possible with this Divine source of all. With such realization, it is said, comes limitless bliss and direct command of every power in the universe. There are many accounts of miraculous powers demonstrated by the Teachers of this lineage. It is taught that the aid of such a highly realized Siddha can greatly quicken spiritual practice. Some even say that without the diksha (initiation) of such teachers, the human instincts will always fail to lead to this highest Realization. The Nandinatha Sampradaya is maintained today by several groups stemming from MahaRishi Nandinatha's eight disciples. The Kailasa Parampara is based out of Kauai, Hawaii, U.S.A. where a monastery and mandir (temple) is maintained. The Sannyasis (Monks) of this order continue to spread the teachings of this Sampradaya through the Himalayan Academy and the \\"Hinduism Today\\" magazine. Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami is the living preceptor or the 163rd Guru Mahasannidhanam of the Kailasa Parampara of the Nandinatha Sampradaya.

Career After studying at Heidelberg, Bonn and Berlin, he graduated at Kiel in 1847, and the next year went to France, where he was a teacher of German at Laval and at Reims. His leisure was given to Oriental studies, in which he had made great progress in Germany. In 1851 he joined the French archaeological mission to Mesopotamia and Media under Fulgence Fresnel. Larsen, M.T., The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land, Routledge, 2014, pp 307-08 and p. 315 On his return in 1854, he was naturalized as a French citizen in recognition of his services. He occupied himself with analyzing the results of the expedition, with special attention to the cuneiform inscriptions he had collected. Nemet-Nejatm K.R., Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, pp 4-6 His account of the Fresnel mission and the results of his consequent study were published as Exp√©dition Scientifique en M√©sopotamie (1859‚Äì1863),Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924 with the second volume entitled D√©chiffrement des inscriptions cun√©iformes. In 1855 he published √âcriture Anarienne, advancing the theory that the language spoken originally in Assyria was Turanian (related to Turkish and Mongolian), rather than Aryan or Semitic in origin, and that its speakers had invented the cuneiform writing system. Nemet-Nejatm K.R., Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, pp 5-7 Although the classification of the \\"Casdo-Scythian\\" inscriptions as Turanian would later be rejected by scholars, research would confirm Oppert in his identification of the distinctness of the Sumerian language (as he renamed it in 1869) and the origin of its script. Jastrow, M., The Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria: Its Remains, Language, History, Religion, Commerce, Law, Art and Literature, J.P. Lippincott, 1915, Chapter 2 In 1856 he published Chronologie des Assyriens et des Babyloniens. In 1857 he was appointed professor of Sanskrit and comparative philology in the school of languages connected with the National Library of France, and in this capacity he produced his Grammaire Sanscrite (1859). But his attention was chiefly given to Assyrian and cognate subjects. In 1865 he published a history of Assyria and Chaldaea (Histoire des Empires de Chald√©e et d'Assyrie) in the context of new archaeological findings. His Assyrian grammar, √âl√©ments de la grammaire assyrienne, was published in 1868. In 1869 Oppert was appointed professor of Assyrian philology and archaeology at the College de France. In 1876 Oppert began to focus on the antiquities of ancient Media and its language, writing Le Peuple et la langue des M√©des (1879). In 1881 he was admitted to the Academy of Inscriptions and in 1890, he was elected to its presidency. He died in Paris on August 21, 1905. Bibliography Oppert was a voluminous writer upon Assyrian mythology and jurisprudence, and other subjects connected with the ancient civilizations of the East. Among his other works may be mentioned: *L'Immortalit√© de l'√¢me chez les Chald√©ens, (1875) *Salomon et ses successeurs (1877) *Doctrines juridiques de l'Assyrie et de la Chald√©e (1877, with Joachim Menant).

A jennet or Spanish jennet was a small Spanish horse.Bennett, Deb. \\"The Spanish Mustang: The Origin and Relationships of the Mustang, Barb, and Arabian Horse\\" It was noted for a smooth naturally ambling gait, compact and well-muscled build, and a good disposition. The jennet was an ideal light riding horse, and as such spread across Europe and provided some of the foundation bloodstock for several horse breeds in the Americas.  Spanish origin of the term  According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"jennet\\" referred to a small Spanish horse. The 2000 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary also defines \\"jennet\\", with the alternative spelling genet, as a small Spanish saddle horse. The \\"jennet\\" described a type, rather than a breed of horse, and thus is not used today; the term was in regular use during the Middle Ages to refer to a specific type of horse, usually one of Iberian or Barb extraction, often gaited. In the etymology provided by the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"jennet\\" is derived from the French genet, from Spanish jinete, a light horseman who rides √† la jineta, explained as \\"with his legs tucked up.\\" This referred to their style of riding with shorter stirrups, which they preferred for closer collection of the horse. The term is taken to be a corruption of Zenata, a Berber tribe famed for its cavalry. In English and French, the word came to refer to the horse rather than the style of riding. In Spanish, that meaning has developed in modern times. The American Heritage Dictionary's etymology is similar, citing the Middle English genet, from Old French; from the Catalan ginet, of Arabic and, ultimately, of Berber origin.\\"jennet\\", American Heritage Dictionary  Modern descendants and recreated breeds  The modern Spanish Jennet Horse, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso breeds probably most closely resemble the original jennet. In the treatise Il Cavallarizzo written by Claudio Corte in 1562, three years after the end of the Great Italian Wars, the author describes at length the qualities of the ginecti (jennets) as horses useful for war. According to Corte, the jennets were one of the most commonly used horses by the Spanish light cavalry. Spanish heavy cavalry used a different breed which Corte refers to as \\" Villanos \\". However, there is no mention of the Andalusian as a war horse in Corte's book, indicating that that breed either did not exist or was not used for war during the rise of Spain as a major European Power in 1494‚Äì1562.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Il_cavallarizzo.djvu The castle of Venafro in the Italian region of Molise (which was under Spanish rule in the 1500s) has numerous frescos portraying the ginecti (jennets), which seem to closely resemble a modern-day Criollo horse or a Peruvian Pasohttp://www.francovalente.it/2007/12/22/i-cavalli-di-enrico-pandone-nel- castello-di-venafro-2/  See also  *Horses in the Middle Ages *Spanish Jennet Horse (modern breed)  References  *  External links  *Bennett, Deb. \\"The Spanish Mustang: The Origin and Relationships of the Mustang, Barb, and Arabian Horse\\" *Sponenberg, Phillip, DVM, PhD. \\"Spanish Jennet: Living in the Past\\" The Gaited Horse web page accessed January 26, 2008.

Early life Kabata was born into a military family in Jeremicze, Poland on 17 March 1924.Ken MacKenzie, \\"Profile: Zbigniew Kabata\\", Systematic Parasitology, Volume 31, Number 2 / June, 1995, He entered the Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Military Academy in Lw√≥w as a cadet in 1937. World War II After the invasion of Poland by Nazi forces in 1939, Kabata joined the Armia Krajowa and fought against the occupying forces. His unit became famous after assaults on two Gestapo jails, which resulted in the liberation of about 200 prisoners. Kabata was cited several times for bravery. During his time in the resistance, Kabata wrote several patriotic poems honouring the Polish armed forces. His most famous work, The Underground Army, became the unofficial anthem of the Polish combatant community and is inscribed on numerous Polish war memorials. Following the defeat of Nazi forces in Poland, Kabata made a daring escape across Soviet lines to join up with the Polish 2nd Army Corps in Italy and commanded a rifle platoon in the 3rd Company, 1st Carpathian Rifles (the famous \\"Tobruk Rats\\"). After the war After demobilisation, he was transferred to Great Britain when Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies and found work as a deck-hand on North Sea trawlers. Kabata became fascinated with marine life and registered for a zoology degree. After graduation, he began work at the Fisheries Laboratory in Aberdeen as a specialist in fish parasitology, while at the same time following postgraduate courses that gained him a PhD (1959) and D.Sc. (1966) from the University of Aberdeen. It was in this time that Kabata developed the notion that separate populations of fish can be identified by study of the prevalence of various parasites and diseases. The identification of populations is an integral part of fisheries science. In September 1953, Kabata, then still an undergraduate student, married an Irish physician, Mary Ann Montgomery. The couple had a daughter, Marta, in 1954 and a son, Andrzej, in 1956. During the 1960s, Dr Kabata translated a number of Russian texts on fish biology and parasitology. It was during this time that he began work on his main work, The Parasitic Copepoda of British Fishes, published in 1979 by the Ray Society, . A seminal work in taxonomy, this book features over 2,000 original hand-drawn illustrations of the complex morphology of copepod parasites. In 1967, Kabata moved to the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia, where he became head of the Marine Fisheries Section. He died on 4 July 2014. Awards and recognition His outstanding contribution to the field of parasitology was awarded with patronymy of 22 taxa, including most notably, the imaginatively named copepod, Bobkabata kabatabobus. He served for 15 years on the editorial board of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Kabata held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Polish army, and was awarded one of Poland's highest decorations, the Grand Commander Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. For exceptional heroism during the war, he was awarded a Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari, twice the Cross of Valour, War Medal (three bars), Underground Army Cross, Partisan Cross and Gold Medal for Contributions to the Defensiveness of the Country. For his contribution to world science, he received the A. Wardle Medal from the Canadian Society of Zoologists, K. Janicki Medal from the Polish Parasitological Society and K. Demel Medal from the Sea Fisheries Institute in Gdynia, Poland. Other honours included honorary membership in four scientific societies, an honorary D.Sc. from the Agricultural University of Szczecin, Poland (1993), an honorary D.Litt. from Malaspina University College, Nanaimo, B.C.

His work has mostly concerned his family, the place he grew up in the West Midlands, but also landscapes elsewhere. Billingham is best known for the photography book Ray's A Laugh (1996), which documents the life of his alcoholic father Ray, and obese, heavily tattooed mother, Liz. He has also published the collections Black Country (2003), Zoo (2007), and Landscapes, 2001‚Äì2003 (2008). He has made several short films, including Fishtank (1998) and Ray (2016). Billingham adapted the latter into his first feature film, Ray & Liz (2018), a memoir of his childhood. He won the 1997 Citibank Private Bank Photography Prize (now Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize) and was shortlisted for the 2001 Turner Prize. His work is held in the permanent collections of Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Government Art Collection in London. Billingham is based in Swansea and teaches art at Gloucester and Middlesex universities. Career Billingham was born in Birmingham and studied as a painter at Bournville College of Art and the University of Sunderland. He came to prominence through his candid photography of his family in Cradley Heath, a body of work later added to and published in the acclaimed book Ray's A Laugh (1996). Ray's a Laugh is a portrayal of the poverty and deprivation in which he grew up. Billingham chose to use the cheapest film and development he could find. Ray, his father, and his mother Liz, appear at first glance as grotesque figures, with the alcoholic father drunk on his home brew, and the mother, an obese chain smoker with an apparent fascination for nicknacks and jigsaw puzzles.Julian Stallabrass, High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s, Verso, 2001, pp. 350‚Äì1. However, there is such integrity in this work that Ray and Liz ultimately shine through as troubled yet deeply human and touching personalities. The critic Julian Stallabrass describes Ray and Liz as embodiments of \\"what is in legend a particularly British stoicism and resilience, in the face of the tempest of modernity.\\" In 1996 Billingham had an exhibition at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford, UK. In 1997, he was included in the exhibition Sensation at the Royal Academy of Art which showcased the art collection of Charles Saatchi and included many of the Young British Artists.Royal Academy of Art, Sensation, 1997, pp. 52‚Äì7. Also in 1997, Billingham won the Citibank Private Bank Photography Prize (now Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize). He was shortlisted for the 2001 Turner Prize, for his solo show at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, and others. In 1998 Billingham made his first documentary video, Fishtank, a study of his father filmed with a handheld camera. It was commissioned by Artangel and Adam Curtis for BBC Television and shown on BBC Two in December 1998. Since 2011 Fishtank has been part of The Artangel Collection ‚Äì 25 notable films available for loan, free of charge, to publicly funded UK museums and galleries. He has also made landscape photographs at places of personal significance around the Black Country, and more of these were commissioned in 2003 by the arts organisation The Public, resulting in a book. In late 2006, Billingham exhibited a major new series of photographs and videos inspired by his memories of visiting Dudley Zoo as a child. The series, entitled Zoo, was commissioned by Birmingham-based arts organisation, Vivid and was exhibited at Compton Verney Art Gallery in Warwickshire. A book of the work was published the following year. In the following year he created a series of photographs of \\"Constable Country\\", the area on the Essex / Suffolk border painted by John Constable. These were exhibited at the Town Hall Galleries, Ipswich. Billingham's work was included in the 2007 BBC television series The Genius of Photography, being the subject of part 3 of the \\"We Are Family\\" episode, made by Wall to Wall Media. In 2009‚Äì2010, Billingham participated in a collective exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany titled: Ich, zweifellos. Billingham wrote and directed his first feature film, Ray & Liz, in 2018. It is a memoir of his childhood and his parents, told in three separate time frames. He now lives near Swansea, and travels widely. He is a lecturer in fine art photography at the University of Gloucestershire and a third year tutor at Middlesex University.
