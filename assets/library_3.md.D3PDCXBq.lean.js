Organization  The General Intelligence Directorate is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. It is divided into three branches: *Internal Security Division *External Security Division *Palestinian Affairs Division The internal security division is responsible for the internal surveillance of the population. The external security division is responsible for foreign intelligence work. And, the Palestinian division is responsible for monitoring the activities of Palestinian groups in Syria and Lebanon. Hisham Bekhityar became the head of the General Security Directorate in 2001, replacing Ali Hammoud, who became the Minister of Interior. General Bakhtiar was close to Bashar al-Assad's deceased brother-in-law Assef Shawkat. In the late 20th century Maj. Gen Ali Houri was director of General Security Directorate. The service was in competition with Idarat al-Amn al-Siyasi in the late 20th century. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan possibly headed international security of the General Security Directorate in the late 20th century. President Bashar Assad in June 2005 appointed General Ali Mamluk as commander of the General Security Directorate. Six years later in April 2011, the US government imposed sanctions on Ali Mamluk, saying he had been responsible for human rights abuses, including the use of violence against civilians. His agency had repressed internal dissent, monitored individual citizens, and had been involved in the Syrian government's actions in Daraa, where protesters were killed by Syrian security services. The next month, the EU also imposed sanctions on Ali Mamluk, saying he had been involved in efforts to suppress anti-government protesters.

January 23, 2009 Abdel Aziz, who was President of the High Council of State, stepped down in April 2009 in order to stand as a candidate. The opposition initially planned to boycott the election, arguing that the junta pursued a unilateral electoral agenda, and as a result Abdel Aziz was widely expected to win the election.Vincent Fertey, \\"Boycott could see Aziz triumph at the polls\\", Reuters (IOL), April 23, 2009. Later, however, the opposition agreed to participate as part of a deal with the junta in June 2009, making the election appear more competitive; as part of the deal, the election was delayed to July and a national unity government was formed to lead the country through the election period.

Months before the election, it was widely expected that Abdel Aziz would stand as a candidate; Abdel Aziz said that retired officers should be allowed to run, fuelling speculation that he might retire from the army and run as a civilian. On 4 February 2009, while still expressing support for the coup and saying that Abdallahi should not be restored to the Presidency, Ahmed Ould Daddah--the country's main opposition leader, who heads the Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD) and placed second in the 2007 presidential election-- proposed that the army give up power and that anyone who was serving in the military at the time of the coup should not be allowed to run in the presidential election.\\"Coup backer wants Mauritania army to relinquish power\\", AFP, 4 February 2009. Abdel Aziz announced that he would run in the election on 29 March 2009, as was widely expected, and said that he would resign as Head of State (to be succeeded by the President of the Senate) in order to stand as a candidate.Scott Stearns, \\"Mauritania's Military Ruler Running for President\\" , VOA News, 29 March 2009. On 8 April, Abdel Aziz told France 24 that he intended to resign prior to 22 April, as necessary for him to stand as a candidate. He also said that the election would be held as planned on 6 June, contradicting rumors of a delay that could facilitate possible mediation aimed at securing the participation of opposition parties. According to Abdel Aziz, the election was desired by 90% of the population. Later on 8 April, members of the pro-Abdallahi National Front for the Defense of Democracy (FNDD), including the President of the National Assembly, Massaoud Ould Boulkheir, held a protest in Nouakchott. Boulkheir denounced the \\"unilateral electoral agenda of the putschists\\" and warned that \\"neither tanks, nor guns nor live bullets can stop our fight against the usurpation of power by force\\".

Due to Baba's friendly attitude towards the junta, he was expelled from the FNDD coalition. Another candidate was Sghair Ould M'Bareck, who served as Prime Minister under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya from 2003 to 2005.

The deadline for the registration of presidential candidacies expired on 22 April; by that point none of the major opposition leaders, including RFD President Daddah, had registered, as they were all participating in the boycott. Observers concluded that the lack of a credible challenger meant that Abdul Aziz would easily win the election, although they noted that the credibility of the election itself could be threatened by the opposition boycott. The Constitutional Court approved four candidacies on 27 April: those of Abdel Aziz, Ibrahima Sarr, Kane Hamidou Baba, and Sghair Ould M'Bareck.\\"Le Conseil constitutionnel rend publique la liste d√©finitive des candidats √† la prochaine √©lection pr√©sidentielle\\", AMI, 27 April 2009 .

He stressed, however, that his candidacy was not directed against any particular individual, and he said that his goal, if elected, was \\"to build a reconciled country that is politically and economically viable and stable\\".

A survey in the newspaper Le R√©novateur had Abdel Aziz, Daddah, and Boulkheir as the top three candidates. Boulkheir, a black descendant of slaves, notably won support from many white Moors (the traditionally dominant ethnic group), marking a significant change from past attitudes; some compared Boulkheir to United States President Barack Obama. Boulkheir was supported by Abdallahi, and Boulkheir and Daddah agreed that each would support the other if either reached a second round against Abdel Aziz.Todd Pitman, \\"Post-coup Mauritania election takes place\\", Associated Press, 18 July 2009. Conduct In the hours prior to the beginning of voting, a shootout occurred in Nouakchott between police and suspected Islamist militants. Two of the suspects were arrested, and the government said that they were involved in the death of Christopher Leggett, an American who was killed in Nouakchott on 23 June. The election was monitored by more than 200 elections observers, including those from the African Union and the Arab League. Voting opened at 7:00 a.m. UTC and lasted for twelve hours. Some Mauritanians living outside of the nation who had registered for the election were unable to vote because their names did not appear on voting lists. They say it is because they opposed the 2008 Mauritanian coup d'√©tat. One such Mauritanian, Mohamed Sidatt, said that 300 people, including himself, who had registered to vote did not have their names on the final voting lists. Sidatt said, \\"I did [register] and I have a valid Mauritanian passport, but my name did not appear on the final list. And I know it's because I was an active voice against the military coup.\\" Observers from the African Union, La Francophonie, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, African Arab Maghreb Union, and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States jointly endorsed the conduct of the election as \\"satisfactory\\". Meanwhile, FNDD spokesman Mohamed Ould Mouloud alleged \\"massive fraud\\"; he said that the coalition would gather evidence and take the matter to the Constitutional Court.\\"Opposition claims 'massive fraud' in Mauritania poll\\", AFP, 20 July 2009. Abdel Aziz, voting in Nouakchott, expressed confidence that he would win in the first round, although observers expected that a second round would be necessary. He also said that if he won the election it would mean \\"the victory of change for a prosperous Mauritania, worthy of its independence\\". Also on election day, Vall alleged fraud, saying that in some cases the votes of whole villages had been bought. Boulkheir, voting in Nouakchott, stressed that the country would \\"never turn back\\" to dictatorship. Results Partial results on 19 July, with 61.17% of votes counted, showed Abdel Aziz with a narrow first-round majority of 52.2%; his supporters celebrated in the streets of Nouakchott. Boulkheir and Daddah, the main opposition candidates, trailed distantly with 16.63% and 13.89% respectively. Mansour had 4.66% and Vall had 3.78%.

It is based on a stage play, The French Mistress by Sonnie Hale under the pen name Robert Monro, first produced in 1955 at the Theatre Royal Windsor, starring Sonnie Hale. Plot summary A young French woman, Madaleine Lafarge, is unintentionally appointed as the French teacher at an English public school for boys, which is not used to having women teachers. She causes a stir with pupils and other school staff, and complications ensue. A romance develops between Lafarge and the headmaster's son who is also a teacher at the school. This is a cause of concern for the headmaster when he comes to believe that she is his daughter, from an affair he had during a holiday in France in his youth. He attempts to stop the romance by sacking her, so that she will go back to France, but the boys go on strike and nearly riot. All the problems are resolved when it becomes apparent that she cannot be his daughter.

Design and development Designed as a basic trainer for the French military the prototype MS.730 first flew on the 11 August 1949. The prototype was a low- wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear and powered by a 240 hp (134 kW) Mathis 8G.20 inverted V8 engine. The engine was replaced with a German war-surplus 240 hp (179 kW) Argus As 10 and the prototype flew again in November 1949 as the MS.731. Two further prototypes were built and flown in 1951 designated MS.732, they were each powered by a Potez 6D 02 engine and the original fixed landing gear of the prototype was replaced with retractable main wheels. Operational history Preserved MS.733 with French Navy markings on display in France, 2009. The production version followed designated the MS.733, with five pre-production aircraft and 200 production aircraft. The aircraft were delivered to the French Navy (40), the French Air Force (145) and the Cambodian Air Force (15). Seventy of the French Air Force aircraft were fitted with machine guns for gunnery training and some of these were later converted for counter-insurgency operations (and re-designated MS.733A) for use in Algeria. After the war, some aircraft were sold to Morocco. The Alcyon was a successful trainer, capable of basic aerobatic maneuvers. It was often used in replacement of pre-war vintage Stampe SV.4 biplanes. Several civilian flying schools, including Air France, used the Alcyon. For the time, it was well equipped with full IFR equipment: two VOR- ILS sets, one ADF set, two VHF radios, a radar altimeter, an attitude indicator, and a directional gyroscope.

Opened in 1972, the mall originated as part of an urban renewal project. Much of it was demolished in 1995, and later replaced with Rockville Town Center. History 360 panorama of Rockville Town Center In 1962, Rockville became the first small city in Maryland to undertake a federal urban renewal program. Forty-six acres in the town center were bought; old and new buildings were demolished, and street patterns were changed. In their place rose the residential Americana Centre, more County buildings, high-rise offices, and a large shopping mall with 1,560 spaces of underground parking.Peerless Rockville website, article Rockville Town Center, March 2000. A decade after the project began, the , 40 shop Rockville Mall opened in 1972, on . Although designed originally to have Sears and JC Penney as the two anchors, no second lease was ever signed. The sole anchor at opening was a branch of the Washington, D.C.-based Lansburgh's department store chain. Within a year, Lansburgh's closed and was replaced briefly with a branch of Lit Brothers, followed by a W. & J. Sloane furniture clearance center and Franklin Simon & Co. store.\\"Rockville Mall Struggles On,\\" by Claudia Levy, The Washington Post, May 5, 1974, p. G1.

B1. In 1983, Eisenger-Kilbane of Gaithersburg, Maryland, spent $50 million attempting to redevelop it as a more entertainment-oriented facility. It was reopened as Rockville Metro Center, reflecting the connection at its east end to the newly opened Rockville Metro station across Maryland Route 355. This renovation brought in the late 1980s a large United Artists theater complex and \\"Breakers,\\" a billiards parlor. Though these businesses, at the east end of the mall closest to the Metro station, attracted some traffic, the remainder of the mall lacked attractive tenants and therefore remained largely vacant. Rockville Mayor and later Montgomery County executive Doug Duncan launched a massive campaign against the mall, known locally as the \\"Berlin Wall\\", in 1993, arguing that the large, scarcely occupied facility was a millstone holding back downtown development and limiting the city's property tax intake. His argument struck a chord with the majority in Rockville, and the west end of the mall was finally torn down in 1995 (the portion connected to the Metro station still exists as an office/health care/fitness center complex that is not recognizable as having once been part of a mall). New York-based Essex Capital Partners purchased the mall from Marine Midland Bank in 1998.

It has been associated with many famous people throughout its history. History Springfield, circa 1936‚Äì1941 One of the oldest mansions in Mississippi, the Springfield Mansion was built between 1786 and 1791. The original plantation had over and was purchased by Thomas M. Green Jr., a wealthy Virginia planter, in 1784. Green had the house built to show off his wealth. The mansion was one of the first houses in America to have a full colonnade across the entire facade and is the first such mansion to be built in the Mississippi Valley. The whole house was built by his slaves out of clay from the land. The hinges, knobs, and all metal tools were built at the plantation's blacksmith building. Possibly what makes Springfield Plantation most famous is the wedding that took place there in 1791. Thomas M. Green Sr., the owner's father, was one of the magistrates of the Mississippi Territory and as such, performed the marriage ceremony of Andrew Jackson and Rachel Donelson at the house in August 1791. This marriage would lead to one of the first romantic tragedies in America. For two years, Green Jr. had to leave his beloved plantation to go to Washington, D.C. when he became a Congressman from the Mississippi Territory. The plantation survived the Civil War and the Union occupation of Mississippi during the later half of the 1800s. Restoration After numerous owners over the years, the house decayed for decades. Arthur Edward Cavalier de LaSalle, Arthur LaSalle as he liked to be called, was given a lifetime lease of the home by the owners to repair, live in, and give tours of the mansion in the early 1970s. When asked about the mansion when he first arrived, he said, \\"It was occupied by the rats and pigeons, nothing else.\\" Springfield is still a working plantation. On August 14, 2008, LaSalle died there. The tours have stopped, but the owners say they will be restarted. Road to Springfield Plantation. Cemetery It is not known how many people are buried at the Green Family Cemetery at Springfield Plantation. These are the names of those known. *Thomas M.

Life Thomas Sutton went to school in Newington Butts and studied architecture for four years before studying at Caius College, Cambridge graduating in 1846 as the 29th wrangler. He opened a photographic studio in Jersey the following year under the patronage of Prince Albert.Thomas Sutton Panoramic Camera Lens In 1855 he set up a photographic company in Jersey with business partner Louis D√©sir√© Blanquart-Evrard that produced prints from calotype negatives. The following year, Sutton and Blanquart-Evrard founded the journal Photographic Notes, which Sutton edited for eleven years. A prolific author, Sutton wrote a number of books on the subject of photography, including the Dictionary of Photography in 1858. In 1859, Sutton developed the earliest panoramic camera with a wide-angle lens. The lens consisted of a glass sphere filled with water, which projected an image onto a curved plate. The camera was capable of capturing an image in a 120 degree arc. In 1861, Sutton created the first single lens reflex camera. Sutton was the photographer for James Clerk Maxwell's pioneering 1861 demonstration of colour photography. In a practical trial of a thought-experiment Maxwell had published in 1855, Sutton took three separate black-and-white photographs of a multicoloured ribbon, one through a blue filter, one through a green filter, and one through a red filter. Using three projectors equipped with similar filters, the three photographs were projected superimposed on a screen. The additive primaries variously blended to reproduce a gamut of colour. The photographic materials available to Sutton were mainly sensitive to blue light, barely sensitive to green and practically insensitive to red, so the result was only a partial success. Forty years later, adequately panchromatic plates and films had made excellent colour reproduction possible by this method, as demonstrated by the work of Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky. The principle of reproducing a full range of colour by three- colour analysis and synthesis is based on the nature of human colour vision and underlies nearly all practical chemical and electronic colour imaging technologies. Sutton's ribbon image is sometimes called the first colour photograph. There were, in fact, earlier and possibly better colour photographs made by experimenters who used a completely different, more purely chemical process, but the colours rapidly faded when exposed to light for viewing. Sutton's photographs preserved the colour information in black-and- white silver images containing no actual colouring matter, so they are very light-fast and durable and the set may reasonably be described as the first permanent colour photograph. Sutton also worked on the development of dry photographic plates.

It is located in Olympic National Park where the Elwha River enters Rica Canyon, east-southeast of Olympic Hot Springs. Toponymist Smitty Parratt described Goblins Gate: \\"...the Elwha River swerves at a severe right angle and tumbles into an extremely narrow cliffside opening. Resembling two large gates such as might have been found on a medieval castle, the rock portals appear to reach out and suck the waters of the Elwha into their grasp, only to send them plummeting down a precipitous canyon in a headlong rush to sea level.\\" History Golblins Gate was given its name by members of the 1889‚Äì90 Seattle Press Expedition. Charles Barnes, one of the expedition's members, described Goblins Gate as \\"...like the throat of a monster, silently sucking away the water.\\" And as a resembling \\"multitude of faces...with tortured expressions.\\" The chasm of Goblins Gate has been bridged twice. The first bridge was washed away during a flood event around the turn of the 20th century. The second eventually became a decaying hazard and was removed in 1935. Natural history As part of the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project, Olympic National Park fisheries biologists snorkel-surveyed for salmonids along the entire Elwha River. However, due to dangerous currents within Rica Canyon, Goblins Gate was one of the only areas, other than the Grand Canyon of the Elwha where the surveys could not take place. Recreation Goblins Gate is the first stop along the Geyser Valley trail route along the Elwha River above Lake Mills within Olympic National Park. It is from the Whiskey Bend trailhead.

Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate. It is also a part of The Basement Collection. McMillen and Glaiel created the game and developed it in 14 days. Both developers expressed interest in seeing a version being released on the Wii game console through the WiiWare online service. Aether received a positive response from video game blogs for its unusual visual style and atmosphere. The single looped piece of background music received a mixed response and the controls were highlighted as an area of the game that could have been improved before release. Gameplay Aether is a space adventure game with washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack consisting of a piano, synthesizer, guitar, and percussion piece. There are four monochrome planets to explore, which have subdued hues. Players control a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends. The monster's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets. Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder as you approach it. Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character, requiring momentum to escape from the planet's orbit. To escape a planet, the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet's surface, which can then be used to swing the player around. By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum, players can latch onto the next and repeat the process to leave the planet's orbit. After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids. In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object. The boy and his monster swing on a crystal hanging from Gravidas' interior. When travelling through space, players are drawn to a planet's orbit once they get close. Each planet's location is labeled with a colored marker which disappears once that planet's puzzle is solved. The player encounters characters who can be helped if a puzzle is solved. Each planet besides Earth has its own puzzle. The monster's ability to swing around objects is used in some of the game's puzzles. One puzzle involves swinging on the crystals which surround the core of a hollow planet called Gravida, without swinging on the same crystal twice or breaking the chain. Solving each planet's puzzle produces a flash of light, after which monochrome planets change to color, subdued pastel colors brighten, and the planet's unique soundtrack becomes permanent. The game's plot describes a journey through a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes to find someone to relate to.Intro excerpt He lowered his head and the boy bustled up, looking proud atop his new steed. For the boy had a venture: he was bound for adventure, and this monster had planted the seed. Looking up to the stars he thought to himself, imagine all of the people up there.

Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys.Trapped boys \\"... Why do you look like me? ...\\" \\"I'm going to blow this place up one day.\\" \\"I'm stuck here because I'm bad.\\" (Aether) Armor Games, 2008 Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.Endgame(Aether) Armor Games, 2008 Development Aether was created by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, McMillen was a member of independent development studio Cryptic Sea and co-creator of the award- winning Gish. Glaiel runs his own independent studio, Glaiel Games, and develops Flash games for game and animation website Newgrounds. The game's graphics and story were created by McMillen, while Glaiel wrote the game's music and code. The game was developed in 14 days; McMillen found he could \\"ride off\\" Glaiel's inspiration and allowed the project to be completed quickly. \\"People being creative and taking risks with their work always is inspiring to me, honesty in art is also very inspiring,\\" he stated. McMillen's childhood experiences and fears were used for the game's themes of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment or rejection. The boy's journeys through space represent inward-thinking and imagination, planets represent fears and the inhabitants personify McMillen's childhood \\"inner demons\\". He was initially unsure as to whether or not he wished to release Aether, since it was based on personal experiences and made him feel vulnerable. Glaiel created the game's planets and gameplay, designing the layout of the planets to convey the emotions involved in the game, but he did not know which planets would ultimately be used to relate to each emotion. He felt that the game's sense of emotion and mood was improved because development was not thoroughly planned from the outset. Both developers expressed a wish to port the game to the WiiWare service on the Wii video game console. Aether was released as part of McMillen's game and comic compilation CD This is a Cry For Help in early November 2008. Reception The game was positively received by gaming blogs, though reviewers held mixed opinions about the controls. The story was compared to The Little Prince, Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry's 1943 novella. Aether's graphics were praised by reviewers. Alec Meer of website Rock Paper Shotgun described them as \\"beautiful to look at\\", Justin McElroy of Joystiq said the game has a \\"unique visual style\\" and described the pastel shades as attractive, and Peter Cohen of Macworld described them as a unique look composed of \\"cute characters with sometimes grotesque imagery\\". \\"StaceyG\\" of Jay Is Games found the music relaxing and called the game \\"a truly compelling experience with excellent atmosphere\\". Meer also enjoyed the game but found the looped piano music irritating. Nate Ralph of Wired found the game \\"hauntingly beautiful, if short\\". Reviewers noted that the solution to some of the puzzles were unclear, further hindered by the planets' inhabitants, whose dialogue does not change when the planet's puzzle is completed. The tongue propulsion physics were said to be clumsy by StaceyG, who stated that, in conjunction with the gravity exerted by planets, it is more difficult to leave planets' surfaces than to navigate through space. Both Meer and StaceyG enjoyed the spacefaring aspect of the game, and Derek Yu of website TIGSource stated the controls \\"sometimes felt brilliant, at other times felt unresponsive and awkward.\\" Patrick Dugan of Play This Thing saw potential in the tongue-swinging gameplay, noting that Aether appeared to be the first of a series. He suggested that more spatial elements, such as nebulae and black holes, would have made space flight more interesting. McMillen described Aether as \\"just the prelude to a larger experience\\", while Yu suggested that a larger game with improved controls \\"could be something better than great\\". Aether received an Honorable Mention at IndieCade in 2009.

BFI's update on the list reveals that the film is now found and commercially available on DVD from mid-2015. Plot Deborah and Charles are an engaged couple, and both are young executives at the successful Pontifex Advertising Agency in London. Deborah writes very successful jingles for television commercials, whilst Charles creates advertisements for print publications. However, the Pontifex board of directors will only allow the employment of single women on their staff, so Deborah worries about her future with the company if they get married, although Charles believes a successful man should be able to support a stay-at-home housewife. Just before they get married, Deborah is asked to compose a series of jingles in a very short time and then take them to the company's New York office to run an advertising campaign there. This results in her spending most of her time at the office and seeing very little of Charles. Meanwhile, a promotion which Charles was hoping for goes to someone else. After their wedding, Deborah has to immediately fly to New York, and while she is away Charles is flattered by the attentions of his attractive secretary Pauline and spends time with her outside work. At the same time, he is annoyed that Deborah seems to be writing to everyone else in the office but he has had only one postcard, despite her promise to write letters.

It currently has 112 congregations nationwide and 63,000 baptised members.LWF Statistics 2009 The Borneo Basel Self Established Church was founded in 1925. Though following in the tradition of the Basel Mission, it was an independent institution. After the Second World War, the Chinese segment of the population experienced a period of urbanisation and economic growth. The foundation of the Malaysian state in 1963 was the occasion for the church to change its name to \\"Basel Christian Church of Malaysia\\" (BCCM). By the end of the 1960s, the church followed the example of its sister church in Hong Kong and joined the Lutheran World Federation. By the end of the 1970s, the BCCM‚Äôs awareness for its mission among the native population of Sabah grew. The missionary work, which the BCCM began to do independently and in different places in Sabah, led to the establishment of local Malay-speaking congregations. Since a few years, this native branch of BCCM congregations is organised in a separate synod, which is part of the overall synod of the BCCM. Its name is BCCM ‚Äì Bahasa Malaysia (BCCM-BM); it represents 22'000 congregation members and is mainly present in central and west Sabah. In many places, the dependency on the Chinese-speaking congregations is still considerable and is seen as a burden by the Chinese. The BCCM-BM has six congregation districts with a total of 90 congregations (including Kuala Lumpur).Asia Lutheran Communion: Change of Leadership in BCCM ; 13 December 2007 (Retrieved on 6 September 2008) The current president of Basel Christian Church of Malaysia is Soon Chong Voon. History The Cross on the hill of Lau San Church In the beginning, the Basel Missionary Society Mission sent her missionaries to Africa, later to India in 1833. In 1846, missionaries were also sent to China. The first two missionaries to Mainland China and Hong Kong were Rev. Theodore Hamberg and Rev. Rudolph Lechler. They worked especially among the Hakka linguistic tribe in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. After many years of labour and hardship, about two hundred congregations and more than one hundred schools were built up. The church membership was about twenty thousand. In the aftermath of the failed Taiping Rebellion in China, Hakka speaking Christians affiliated with the Basel Mission were viewed with suspicion by the Qing Government as the leader of the rebellion, Hong Xiuquan, was himself a Hakka who claimed to be a Christian. This resulted in an increase in the number of Hakka speaking refugees from China into the Southeast Asian region.Hsiao, Andrew: \\"A Brief History of the Chinese Lutheran Church\\", Hong Kong: Taosheng Publishing House, 1999, With the establishment of a settlement by the British North Borneo Company in North Borneo in December 1882, when an initial group of 100 Hakka Chinese Christian laborers from mainland China landed at Kudat, a town in the northern part of North Borneo. Many groups followed within the next few years. In this new land the Hakka immigrants worked hard on their land for six days and rested only on Sundays. On Sundays they gathered in one of their own homes for worship. Groups of Hakka immigrants arrived at North Borneo. A large number of them located on the west coast where railway construction had commenced. New towns with a majority of Chinese were set up along the railway line. The Hakka Christians who came along with the other immigrants set up their own worship places on the west coast and other parts of Sabah. Chinese labourers were sought to develop the interior of the territory and the British North Borneo Company sent agents to Hong Kong to recruit these labourers. Rudolph Lechler of the Basel Mission enthusiastically supported the scheme and Hakka Christians from the Basel Mission and the Basel established Chongzhen Church (Tsung-Tsin Church or Â¥áÁúüÊúÉ) were recruited. The pioneer batch of settlers consisted of 10 families who arrived in Kudat and proceeded to found a settlement in Lausan. Worship meetings were held on Sundays in one of the houses until the first attap roofed church building was built in the plantation of Lo Tai Hong in 1886. This became known as the Lausan Church and was the first Basel congregation organised in the territory.Zhang, Delai: \\"The Hakkas of Sabah\\", Sabah Theological Seminary, 2002, BCCM Kota Kinabalu: A Brief History of the Basel Christian Church in Malaysia (Retrieved on 6 September 2008) Self-Establishment Basel Church Memorial in Telupid, Sabah The Hakka Christians set up their own churches wherever a few families were gathered together. They set up schools as well to educate their children in Chinese. In 1925, during the first Synod in Kudat, Rev. Schule, a Basel Mission representative, proposed that the Church should immediately practise self-reliance, so that the various gifts in the Church could be channelled to administrate and develop the Church. Even though the Church authority felt then that it was not the time yet, but accepted the good intention of Rev. Schule and became a self-governing, self-supporting and. self-propagating Church. Under the mighty hand of the Lord, the leadership of our fore-fathers and the collective participation of all believers, the Church and schools made great strides forward. On July 7, 1937, Japanese militant imperialism exploded an aggressive war with China. In 1941, Japanese advanced to invade South East Asia. In 1941-45, the people of the state were ravaged and trampled on by the Japanese army. During that time, as many as 70-80 of our believers were murdered by the Japanese, a few hundred were caused to die. Church buildings were burned, schools bombed and homes destroyed. Believers were scattered and schools standstill. Livelihood was full of pains and agony. In 1945, the Emperor of Japan surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Forces after the Atomic bombs were deployed against Japan. But the war had left much devastation and chaos everywhere in the state. The believers had difficulty even in the rehabilitation of their homes, so they could hardly spate themselves for the reconstruction of the mined churches and schools. Fortunately, at that time, the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) was willing to extend a helping hand to aid the Church in the forms of finances and manpower such as teachers in the secondary schools. Consequently, it was not just confined to rehabilitation, it excelled by having a development of larger scope and of vitality. Such a brotherly concern toward a friend in dilemma reflected an impressive love in Christ. This had become one of the factors that brought the Church into the family of LWF. Mission Zeal Active outreach towards the Bumiputra actually began in 1974, when two zealous members from the congregation at Inanam, Chong Yun Leong and Paul Chung, first launched the campaign of \\"Preaching the Gospel to the Natives.\\" This ministry was first sponsored by the congregation at Inanam. A sub-committee was formed to plan strategy and raise funds for the mission. In June 1975, Gasin Guntidong, a young Kadazandusun, was engaged to do surveys in the villages. Mission began to reach out to the Kadazandusun living in the Inanam and Menggatal areas. In July, 1975, the first Sunday service in Bahasa Malaysia was conducted at the old BCCM Inanam church building with an attendance of 16 people. The outreach was stepped up and many villages like Kg. Kokol, Kg. Piniang, Kg. Binaung, Kg. Munsiang, were reached. In July, 1976, the first Bumiputra chapel was built at Kampung Peniang. The first baptism service for the Kadazandusuns was held on Ascension Day of 1976 with 76 persons baptized. The mission among the Bumiputra expanded quickly and spread out. It was taken over jointly by the Kota Kinabalu Parish and the Central Council. Outreach was not only directed at the Kadazandusuns in the west coast but was extended to the Muruts in Pensiangan District in 1978. The mission to the Muruts began when a Christian brother was on official duty to Pensiangan in 1972. He saw that thousands of Muruts were living and dying without the gospel. They were victims of their social systems and traditions. Their need for the gospel was conveyed to the BCCM Central Mission Committee and a team was sent to survey the possibility of a mission there in April, 1978. In 1978, Richard Angang, a half-Murut pastor, was posted to Sapulut with his family. A month later, a young Bible school graduate was sent to join him. By 1993, there were altogether a total of 20 young Bumiputra pastors, and 11,000 Bumiputra members worshipping in 80 churches, chapels or gathering places since BCCM first began its cross-cultural mission about three decades earlier. As more and more Bumiputra congregations and places of worship were set up, the BCCM felt the constraints of manpower in the field and leadership for the newly established congregations. The BCCM Central Mission Committee felt that it was time to establish a centre to provide basic training both in Bible knowledge and leadership for the Bumiputra in Bahasa Malaysia. Bible Training Centre Sabah Theological Seminary In 1980, a BCCM Bible Training Center in Kota Kinabalu (Pusat Latihan Alkitab Kota Kinabalu or PLAKK) was set up at the location of the BCCM Kota Kinabalu's old church building on Signal Hill, Old Tuaran Road (located in between the heart of the city center, Karamunsing, Likas, Damai and Luyang neighbourhoods). Two old buildings of the Lok Yuk Secondary School were converted into classrooms, hostels, dining hall and teachers' quarters. In its early stage, the Bible Training Center provided only one year of training with an initial admission of ten students supervised by two full-time teachers, the Rev. Datuk Thomas Tsen and the Rev. Daniel Taie. In 1981, another twelve students joined the program. As the need for better equipped full-time pastoral workers in the Bumiputra congregations continued to grow, the Church felt that it was time to further up-grade the Bible Training Center to a full seminary in order to provide a regular program of theological studies toward Diploma and bachelor's degrees in theology. The inauguration of Sabah Theological Seminary was proposed and adopted during BCCM's Synod in 1985. Sabah Theological Seminary became the first seminary in Malaysia to use Bahasa Malaysia as the medium of instruction. Structure and organisation The former missionary in Sikuati; operated by Basel Church and PCS With the increase in the number of immigrant Hakka settlers from China, other congregations were organised in places and settlements like Kudat (1901), Papar (1903), Jesselton (1904), Sandakan (1907), Beaufort (1910), Tenom (1912), and Inanam (1914). The Basel Christians also pioneered formal Chinese language education in the territory when the first Chinese school was established in Kudat in 1886.Charney,Michael W. ; Brenda S. A. Yeoh; Tong Chee Kiong; Chee Kiong Tong: \\"Chinese Migrants Abroad: Cultural, Educational, and Social Dimensions of the Chinese Diaspora\\", World Scientific, 2003, The first synod of the Basel churches in North Borneo was convened in Kudat in 1925 and following a challenge from the representative of the Basel Mission to practice self-reliance, organised themselves as the Borneo Self-Governing Basel Church under the leadership of the Rev. Wong Thien Nyuk. The Church was first called the Basel Church. After independence in 1925, she was named the Borneo Basel Self-Established Church. Meanwhile, the Basel Church in Guangdong and Hong Kong adopted a new name, i.e. Tsung Tsin Church in 1924. The Church did not follow suit because of her root and origin. In 1963 Sabah was freed from the British colonial rule, and became a state within the Federation of Malaysia. The Church was then renamed The Basel Christian Church of Malaysia and the church officially became a member of the Lutheran World Federation in 1973. As early as the 1950s, the BCCM was involved directly and indirectly in the Basel Mission's cross-cultural mission to the Rungus people in Kudat. The BCCM had shared both the joys and struggles in the process of growth of the PCS since its birth in 1951. In 1967, the BCCM took over the mission work among the tribal people along the Labuk River in Murok, Sandakan. This was a ministry founded by a foreign medical doctor, Dr. G. Christopher Willis. He had to leave Sabah in that year. Today the BCCM has a total of 39 Chinese congregations, 7 English congregations and 80 Bahasa Malaysia congregations. Three secondary schools, fourteen primary schools, and more than fourteen kindergartens have been set up in the major towns in Sabah. The BCCM, being a predominantly Hakka Chinese church in the last century, launched its mission to the Bumiputra, primarily the Kadazandusuns on the west coast and the Muruts in the Interior Residency in Sabah in 1975. Since then, BCCM has experienced tremendous growth in its Bumiputra membership. In 2002, the BCCM-BM has around 18,000 church members in six parishes, Paroki Tuaran (15 congregations), Paroki Kota Kinabalu (10 congregations), Paroki Sandakan (12 congregations), Paroki Tawau (3 congregations), Paroki Pedalaman I (13 congregations), Paroki Pedalaman II (7 congregations). Sunway Kuala Lumpur and Kudat are two new congregations established in 2000 and 2001 respectively to cater the needs of church members of BCCM-BM who have migrated and work there respectively. There are altogether 46 full-time pastors serving in BCCM-BM in 2002. Besides, there are 4 part-time pastors and 8 theological students who are still studying at the Sabah Theological Seminary. Beliefs and Practices Basel Christian Church Malaysia (BCCM) Tamalang, Kudat, Sabah Basel Church in Sepanggar Mission Statement Jesus says, \\"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven\\" ( Mat 5: 14-16, NIV). It is our prayer that the BCCM will be the Light not only in Sabah, but also in other parts of the world! Boat: Historical background Our ancestors travelled far from China to Sabah and established Basel Church. Though passing through rough seas, with Jesus as the boatman, they got through safety. Mount Kinabalu: Mission Under the leadership of the Holy Spirit though the path is difficult, dangerous and with a lot of temptation, all will be overcome and the gospel shall be spread throughout Sabah. Circle Unity in the love of the Lord. All Christians are circled in the love of the Father disregarding race, colour, language and customs. To become perfect person in the Salvation of Christ, spreading the gospel in one accord. The circle also represents the length, breadth, height and depth of the love of God. Blue Signifies the long history and the infiniteness, it also represents meekness and peace. Red Signifies the fire of the Holy Spirit, full of love, faith, zeal, wisdom, boldly marching forth. Christian Mission Schools And Kindergartens Christian Mission Schools were set up in Sabah by various Christian Missionaries organisations during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. In 1882, the first batch of Chinese (Hakka) Basel Christians arrived at Kudat, as laborers recruited by the British North Borneo Chartered Company. The development of the schools of the Basel Church is the story of pioneers coming to Sabah from China, striving to give their children a suitable education. In spite of poverty and two World Wars, the Christians of the Basel Church in Sabah sought ways and means to build and maintain their schools. Even though the schools were established by the church, they are open to children of all races and religions. The development of the schools were greatly helped by the Basel Mission in Basel Switzerland and in China, and the Lutheran Church of America providing missionaries, pastors, principals and teachers, especially after the Second World War, until the early 1970s. To date, the Basel Christian Church of Malaysia has established a total of 29 Schools and Kindergartens as follows: 5 Chinese Primary Schools SJK (C) Pinangsoo * SJK(C) Lok Yuk, Likas * SJK(C) Lok Yuk, Menggatal * SJK(C) Anglo Chinese, Papar * SJK(C) Pinangsoo, Kudat * SJK(C) Lok Yuk Batu 1, Kudat 7 Bahasa Medium Primary Schools (Formerly English) SK Yok Luk Tamalang * SK Sung Siew, Sandakan; * SK Lok Yuk Inanam; * SK Lok Yuk Likas; * SK Lok Yuk Telipok; * SK Lok Yuk Batu 1, Kudat * SK Lok Yuk Tamalang, Kudat * SK Lok Yuk, Sikuati, Kudat 3 Secondary Schools SM Sung Siew, Sandakan * SM Sung Siew (CF), Sandakan * SM Lok Yuk (CF) Likas * SM Lok Yuk, Kudat 14 Kindergartens Kindergarten of BCCM Tawau (Gereja Basel Malaysia, Tawau) * Tadika Yuk Yu, Inanam * Tadika Lok Yuk, Keningau * Tadika Lok Yuk, Kota Belud * Tadika Lok Yuk, Kudat * Yuk Yu Kindergarten, Likas * Tadika Lok Yuk, Menggatal * Tadika Lok Yuk, Papar * Tadika Yuk Yu, Penampang * Tadika Lok Yuk, Petagas; * Yuk Yu Kindergarten, Ranau * Sung Siew Kindergarten Sandakan * Tadika Lok Yuk, Tamparuli * Wonder Kids Taska Lok Yuk, Tawau * Tadika Lok Yuk, Tenom In addition, BCCM Sandakan has established a Day-Care Centre, named Agape Centre, for special children (Handicapped children), and BCCM Tawau has established a Centre for the deaf and down syndrome children. The first school of BCCM was established in Kudat in 1903. In fact, several schools are more than 100 years old. According to a Census Report, there were 8 Mission Schools in Sabah (formerly known as British North Borneo) in 1910, but the number increased to 45 in 1934. Of these, 18 were operated by the Basel Christian Church, 20 by the Roman Catholic Mission, and 7 by the Anglican Church. Recently, the 7 bahasa Medium Primary Schools and 3 Secondary Schools together with 19 other Christian Mission Schools were presented with cheques of various amounts (based on the schools‚Äô application) under the Economy Stimulus Package II, for upgrading of schools, maintenance and repair. Our Chinese Medium Primary Schools were given similar grants earlier in the year, under the Economy Stimulus Package I. In the whole of Malaysia, there are around 425 Christian Mission Schools. On 26‚Äì27 June 2009, 41 representatives from Sabah, Sarawak, and Peninsular Malaysia attended the Conference of Christian Mission Schools in Malaysia at Olympic Hotel, Kuala Lumpur, organized by the Malayan Christian Schools Council and the Mission School Authorities of Sabah and Sarawak under the auspices of the Christian Federation of Malaysia (CFM). The representatives were encouraged, affirmed, and united by their common concern in improving their current high standards of education and providing the best opportunities for the children attending these schools.

Managed by the Savannah-Chatham County School Board of Education, its attendance area includes the southside Savannah neighborhoods of Windsor Forest, White Bluff, Wilshire, and Georgetown. History Windsor Forest High School opened in the autumn of 1967. It was the city's first air-conditioned high school and included grades 7 through 12. In 1967, fifth-grade pupils from overcrowded Windsor Forest Elementary were temporarily housed in a wing of the new high school. For several years, Windsor's middle school students were fully drawn from the area south and west of Holland Drive, while its high school students came from a larger attendance zone that stretched north and east to the middle of Montgomery Cross Road. Two court-mandated busing plans (in the summers of 1970 and 1971) markedly changed this attendance area, bringing in minority students from the subdivisions of Cloverdale and Liberty City in Savannah and reassigning some of Windsor's white students to Jenkins High School (1970-71 attendance year) and then to formerly all-black Beach High (from fall 1971 until 1992).

Although many mainstream political parties including the Indian National Congress support the deal along with regional parties like Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Rashtriya Janata Dal its realisation has run into difficulties in the face of stiff political opposition in India. Also, in November 2007, former Indian Military chiefs, bureaucrats and scientists drafted a letter to Members of Parliament expressing their support for the deal. However, opposition and criticism continued at political levels. The Samajwadi Party (SP) which was with the Left Front in opposing the deal changed its stand after discussing with ex- president of India and scientist Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. Now the SP is in support of the government and the deal. The Indian Government survived a vote of confidence by 275-256 after the Left Front withdrew their support to the government over this dispute. Indian government survives vote Political opposition  Bharatiya Janata Party  The main opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which laid the groundwork for the deal criticized the deal saying that the deal in its present form was unacceptable to the BJP and wanted the deal renegotiated. The BJP had asked the government not to accept the deal without a vote in the parliament. However, the government remained steadfast on its commitment to the deal and has refused to back down on the agreement. Veteran BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, in a statement to the Indian Express newspaper, seemed to indicate willingness to support the government provided some legislative measures. However his party refused to follow that line and stuck to its earlier stand. =Supply of uranium and testing-bans= IBN reported:http://www.ibnlive.com/news/bjp-sees-red-after- bushs-comment-on-fuel-supply/73462-3.html  Left Front  The primary opposition to the nuclear deal in India, however, comes from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M))and its parliamentary allies (Communist Party of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party (India), All India Forward Bloc) November 17 the left parties had provisionally agreed to let the government initiate talks with the IAEA for India specific safeguards which indicated that they may support.

United Nationalist Progressive Alliance (UNPA) The United Nationalist Progressive Alliance (UNPA) was divided over support of the nuclear deal. While the Samajwadi Party supported it after consultations with Abdul Kalam, the other members of the UNPA led by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) opposed it saying that the deal is against India's interest. The SP was eventually suspended from the UNPA. Bahujan Samaj Party The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also opposed the nuclear deal, saying that it was anti- Muslim. The party joined hands with the Left Front and the TDP in voting against the government in Parliament on the nuclear deal.  Others  In 2006, some Indian ex-nuclear scientists had written an appeal to Indian Members of Parliament to ensure that \\"decisions taken today do not inhibit India's future ability to develop and pursue nuclear technologies for the benefit of the nation\\".

His term lasted only three days before Deliƒá was fired and another three days before he was expelled from city hall. Personal life Svetozar Deliƒá was born in Petrinja (then part of Austro-Hungary) to Tomo and Franciska Deliƒá n√©e Hula. He attended a realschule in Zagreb and graduated in 1905. He was not accepted to the University of Vienna so he became a clerk at the Zagreb County Workers' Insurance Fund. This job motivated him to become a communist as he noticed the social stratification in favor of the wealthy. Deliƒá was married on May 11, 1913 to Paulina Wallner, an Evangelical Catholic from Austria. He had two children, one of whom, Dr. Svetozar Deliƒá, fought in World War II for the partisans. Work in \\"Napred\\" Upon becoming a resident of Zagreb in 1910, Deliƒá, together with Josip Cimermanƒçiƒá, became involved in the work of the recently formed communist organization, \\"Napred,\\" becoming one of its first 50 members. During this time, the organization started to flourish and became more involved in Zagreb politics, increasing the number of its members 18-fold and its financial capital by almost 200 times between 1914 and 1919. This advance is astonishing, because it occurred during World War I in an area heavily influenced by famine, bombardment, and other war-time problems.Buntak, p. 224 Deliƒá rose to a high-ranking position in the organization, becoming heavily involved in its marketing in the Zagreb newspapers Novosti (hr) and Sloboda to attract new members. He also took loans to increase the stability and capital of the organization. Contrary to the trend toward recession then present in the aftermath of the war, organization \\"Napred\\" had bought over 36 million krones worth of various products. The three-day mayor On March 21, 1920, city council elections were held. The emerging Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia (communists), SRPJ(k) (renamed the very next year to become the Communist Party of Yugoslavia), attracted votes all over Croatia and the rest of Yugoslavia. In Zagreb the party received 7,011 out of 17,852 votes cast. Although the voters constituted less than a sixth of Zagreb's population, SRPJ(k) won 20 seats in the city council and was entitled to elect the city mayor. A large crowd of more than 50,000 people from Zagreb and its surroundings gathered on the Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square and Saint Mark's Square to find out the result of the elections and later celebrate the win of SRPJ(k).Buntak, p. 227Buntak, p. 228 The next day, Svetozar Deliƒá was chosen as president of the SRPJ(k) delegates in the city council. Two weeks later, in early April, Deliƒá gave a speech directed against the opponents of communism, accusing them of restricting the freedoms of the general population. The mayoral elections were conducted on April 16, 1920 by the two-round voting system. Svetozar Deliƒá and Stjepan Srkulj, the mayor whose term just ended, each failed to get more than 50%, but managed to get into the second round. The second round was won by Deliƒá with 27 votes against Srkulj's 14. The ruling Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty perceived rising communism and the elections of numerous communist mayors such as Deliƒá all over the country as a threat to the monarchy and ordered measures to be taken to prevent them from gaining influence in politics. The following day, on April 17, the ban Matko Laginja barred all public and city hall meetings according to an old 1875 law. At 9 a.m. on April 18, Deliƒá received a phone call from the ban's advisor Dragutin Tonƒçiƒá, relieving him of his duty and disbanding the city council. Deliƒá requested a written notification in an attempt to make his term longer, although his fate was already sealed. Later that day the Regional Government sent Deliƒá a written notice of Tonƒçiƒá's takeover. Deliƒá refused to cooperate.Buntak, p. 229 Termination The next day, Deliƒá was relieved of duties and his pay was suspended. A criminal procedure was started against him and other SRPJ(k) delegates, but that did not convince him to leave the city hall. His first act that day was to notify other delegates of the dismissal of the scheduled April 22 meeting, which was supposed to be the first meeting of the newly formed city council. However, Deliƒá later re-scheduled and held the meeting on April 22. The meeting was held under a siege by gendarmerie and army troops surrounding the building, as Deliƒá locked himself and 27 present councilmen inside, trying to perform mayoral duties while under suspension. The quorum was confirmed to be met and the minutes were signed, but nothing else could have been accomplished before officer Vragoviƒá and his 30 men broke into the city hall and arrested Deliƒá and all attending councilmen.Milƒçec, p. 70Buntak, p. 230 Even at six days, Deliƒá's term is the shortest term in the history of Zagreb mayors. On the following day, April 23, public protests were held to convince the government to return Deliƒá, but they failed and Dragutin Tonƒçiƒá became the new mayor. A few months later, Tonƒçiƒá yielded power to a new, politically neutral, mayor, Vjekoslav Heinzel, who would retain office for the following eight years. In 1923 Deliƒá left politics. He died in Samobor.

The music soundtrack was written by Pat Boone and Jeff Corey and performed by Boone. An unscrupulous drifter causes problems for a small European circus. Plot Eddie (Pat Boone) is a singing drifter who wants to travel around the world. He works in an Italian caf√©, but is fired when he gets into a brawl with a drunken customer. At the same time he meets Gina (Mai Zetterling) a ventriloquist in a visiting circus. Soon enough Eddie helps Gina out with her act and they become lovers. All is well until Eddie moves on, falling in love with another circus performer, Tessa (Nancy Kwan); this is complicated by the intense jealousy of both Gina and Tessa's ex-husband, Ricco. Eddie runs off after a fight, fearing he has killed Ricco, but runs into Tessa on a train. They return to the circus. Cast * Pat Boone as Eddie * Nancy Kwan as Tessa * Mai Zetterling as Gina * Yvonne Mitchell as Elenora Moreno * Kieron Moore as Ricco Moreno * John Le Mesurier as Bozo Production The film was the first in a multi-picture deal between MGM and Seven Arts. Pat Boone says he was talked into doing the film by Ray Stark who encouraged Boone to try a straight dramatic role. Boone agreed because Hollywood was making fewer musicals at the time. He also felt that \\"the film's moral is good.\\" \\"I want to develop as an entertainer and also an actor\\", he said. \\"I realise I can't always be an ex teenager... I want to take on anything that a guy my age would be called up on to do in the movies with one exception: it must be family entertainment. I wouldn't want to make a picture that I wouldn't permit my children to see.\\" The film was originally called Maria. Stark and writer-producer John Patrick wanted Boone's character to sleep with Nancy Kwan's. Boone was reluctant and refused to shoot a scene with them in bed together. However, as he did not have script approval he filmed scenes which indicated his character slept with Kwan's. Filming Filming started February 5, 1962. There were seven weeks of studio filming in London, followed by three weeks location work in Tuscanny, Italy. In order to play his role, Boone learned how to play the guitar and do basic trapeze tricks. After filming was completed, Boone said he would oppose release of the film unless it was given approval by the US censor, the Shurlock office. Boone was worried some scenes had been re-shot to be more lurid and sexy ‚Äì something Ray Stark denied. \\"There have been no changes at all in the film\\", said Stark. \\"It is exactly the same film that Pat Boone saw when he attended its world premiere in London some weeks ago.\\" \\"I am terribly concerned about the board's reaction to certain scenes\\", said Boone. \\"Because as long as I have anything to do with it, no Pat Boone picture will ever be released without a seal of approval.\\" Boone offered to reshoot any objectionable scenes, even do the whole movie over again without pay. Seven Arts compromised and agreed to cut some scenes in exchange for Boone going on a publicity tour for the movie. Reception According to Diabolique magazine \\"it's a weird film, not quite successful, but interesting which benefits from being shot in Europe. And there is a catchy theme tune. The public didn‚Äôt particularly like it. Pat Boone said it was because it was too sexy for something starring him, and he's probably right. It was a role that needed an Elvis.\\" Leonard Maltin simply said, \\"Boone is fatally out of his depth...\\" References External links 1962 films 1962 drama films British drama films Circus films English-language films Films directed by Daniel Petrie British films Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films ","title":"The Main Attraction (film)"},{"id":"19205126","text":"Ennio Balbo (18 April 1922 - 18 June 1989) was an Italian actor and voice actor.

Two electrically driven passenger trains collided on the Up Local line; the second train, from Coulsdon North to Victoria, had been allowed into the section while it was still occupied by the first train, from London Bridge to Victoria. The signalman at Battersea Park, G. F. Childs, believing there was a fault with the Sykes electromechanical interlocking apparatus which was installed at the box, had opened up the case of the instrument and inadvertently cleared the interlock which should have prevented this situation. The official enquiry ruled that he subsequently accepted the Coulsdon train, although he should have been aware that the London Bridge train had not cleared the section. Ten people were killed, including the guard of the London Bridge train, and eighty people were injured, seven sustaining serious injuries. Another accident had occurred at Battersea Park in 1881.  Sequence of events  On 2 April 1937, Battersea Park signal box was operated by Relief Signalman G. F. Childs, rather than the usual signalman (F. W. Harvey). Although Childs was a very experienced and well-respected signalman within the SR, and had been passed as competent to operate the box two weeks previously, this was the first time he had operated it unsupervised, and he had never operated it during the morning rush-hour. During the course of the morning, he made several mistakes, the last one of which was the direct cause of the accident. The various boxes on this section of the railway used Sykes electromechanical \\"Lock and Block\\" interlocking, which used treadles to detect the presence of trains on the line rather than electrical track circuits, and prevented unsafe signal indications by mechanically locking the signal slides in the box, rather than interrupting an electrical circuit. A feature of the Sykes system was that the various actions needed to set up a route for a train and clear the appropriate signals had to be completed in the correct order, otherwise the apparatus would lock up and require releasing. On the boxes to the south of Battersea Park, the apparatus could be released by the signalman alone using a key, but Battersea Park and the boxes to the north required the signalman to request a release from the next box in the chain ‚Äì for Battersea Park, this was Battersea Pier box. This procedure required the signalman making the request to send a bell signal, then for both signalmen to press the appropriate button in their respective boxes ‚Äì the interlocking would only be released if both buttons were pressed simultaneously. Childs' first mistake occurred at approximately 0605, when his apparatus locked up after the passage of a boat train. In his evidence to the enquiry, he described this as a \\"treadle failure\\", but it was ruled that the lock-up had been due to his operation of two signals in the wrong order. He was able to clear the interlocking in this case without requiring permission from any other box. Between 0757 and 0804, no fewer than ten trains were due to pass Battersea Park, and Childs was working under considerable pressure. The three trains directly involved in the accident were the 0737 train from London Bridge to Victoria, referred to in the report as the \\"South London\\" train, the 0730 from London Bridge to Victoria via Tulse Hill, referred to as the \\"London Bridge\\" train, and the 0731 from Coulsdon to Victoria, the \\"Coulsdon\\" train. All three trains were due to depart Battersea Park on the Up Local line, the South London train from the Wandsworth Road line, and the other two from the Clapham Junction line; the box immediately on the country side of this line from Battersea Park was Pouparts Junction. Childs accepted the South London train at 0758, and the London Bridge train at 0759, intending to hold the London Bridge train at the Up Local home signal until the South London train had cleared the section. He made his second mistake at this point; he failed to put the switch-hook on the Clapham line Up Local plunger, which had to be pressed to accept a train on the line. The switch-hook would both mechanically prevent the plunger being depressed, and electrically prevent the block indicator at Pouparts Junction from showing \\"Line Clear\\". While attempting to allow the South London train into the station, Childs made his third mistake; he attempted to clear the home signal for this train before setting the points correctly. This again caused the Sykes apparatus to lock up, and, on this occasion, it would have to be released by Battersea Pier box. Childs sent the bell signal, but (his fourth mistake), he pressed the wrong release button, leaving the apparatus locked. Rather than attempting the release again, or contacting Battersea Pier by telephone to investigate the problem, Childs assumed the apparatus had failed, and decided to open the case and reset it manually. He was permitted to do this by the regulations then in force, but this procedure should only have been used in an emergency. While resetting the signal slide for the South London train, Childs inadvertently also cleared the interlock for the London Bridge train, which was still standing at the home signal. This caused the block indicator at Pouparts Junction to return to \\"Line Clear\\", as it was not being held on by the switch-hook circuit. The signalman at Pouparts Junction (T. P. G. Hillman) then offered the Coulsdon train forward. He should not have done this until he had received the \\"Train out of Section\\" bell signal for the London Bridge train, which Childs denied strongly that he had sent. The enquiry made no definite ruling on this point ‚Äì it was possible that Hillman had mistaken another bell signal relating to a down train for the \\"Train out of Section\\" signal. However, Childs' fifth and fatal mistake then occurred. He pressed the plunger to accept the Coulsdon train, and, as the enquiry ruled, sent the acceptance bell signal to Hillman. Hillman cleared his signals, and the Coulsdon train entered the occupied section at approximately 40 mph. The driver of the Coulsdon train initially thought that the London Bridge train was on another line, and only realised there was a conflict a few seconds before the accident. He made an emergency brake application, but the speed was not significantly reduced. The leading car of the Coulsdon train overrode the rear car of the London Bridge train, completely destroying the wooden bodywork of all but one of its compartments. Nine of the ten fatalities occurred in this car. The leading car of the Coulsdon train also suffered considerable damage, but there was no significant damage to any other car of either train, and neither train derailed.  Causes  The immediate cause of the accident was Childs' acceptance of the Coulsdon train into the occupied section. The interlocking apparatus should have prevented him doing so, but his interference with it, and his failure to apply the switch-hook, rendered the interlocking ineffective.  Recommendations  The enquiry recommended that the paragraph of the rules which permitted signalmen to manually reset the apparatus in an emergency should be deleted, so that any such maintenance tasks would only be performed by qualified linemen, and that the conversion of the signalling in the area from electromechanical interlocking to entirely electrical track circuiting should be expedited.

Corbett. Plot Mrs. Cragg (Peggy Mount) works as a charwoman (part-time domestic servant) for retired Colonel Whitforth (Robert Morley) and as a cleaner at an office block in London. It is whilst doing her office cleaning that she retrieves a cigar discarded by financier James Ryder (Harry H. Corbett) as a gift for the Colonel, wrapping it in a scrap of paper. The Colonel discovers that the scrap of paper is actually a telegram containing details about a City takeover bid that has fallen through. He unscrupulously uses this insider information to make ¬£5,000 on the stock exchange, which he offers to share equally with Mrs. Cragg. Though she does not understand what happened, she is convinced that he has done something wrong, so she goes to inform Ryder. However, before she can, she hears him on the telephone talking about his plan to demolish Pitt Street, evicting her and all her friends, so he can erect an office building. She argues with him, to no avail. He tells her, \\"If you want anything, you've got to go out and get it ... so long as it's legal.\\" She takes his advice to heart. Determined to foil Ryder's plan, she recruits three of her friends and neighbours in Pitt Street, fellow 'chars' who clean the offices of other noted financiers, to gather information. They form the company 'Ladezudu' (\\"Ladies Who Do\\"), a speculation syndicate headed by Whitforth. All goes well until they invest all of their capital, now ¬£60,000, in an Irish pig producer, only to lose everything when an outbreak of swine fever kills the stock. Meanwhile, Ryder and his partner Sydney Tait offer the residents of Pitt Street ¬£100 each if they agree to move within a month. with very little success. Ryder desperately needs the office building project to succeed, otherwise he will be wiped out. Aware of Ryder's precarious finances, Tait dissolves their partnership. However, having lost everything, the ladies are unable to put up a fight when Ryder brings his demolition crew in. Then the Colonel brings news: when the pigs were buried, valuable \\"deposits\\" were discovered, meaning Ladezudu will recoup much more than their investment. Heartened, Mrs. Cragg organises stiff resistance, which convinces Ryder's investor Strang to withdraw from the project. The Colonel invites Ryder to his office to discuss selling out. There he meets the board of directors, the four charwomen, and realises how they obtained their information. The Colonel invites him to lunch to discuss Ryder joining the board.

Jose Azocar Jose Enrique Azocar (born May 11, 1996) is a Venezuelan professional baseball outfielder in the Detroit Tigers organization. Azocar signed with the Detroit Tigers as an international free agent in October 2012 and would make his professional debut in 2013 with the VSL Tigers (the Venezuelan Summer League). He would then join the short-season single-a Connecticut Tigers in 2015, before quickly being sent to the GCL Tigers roster, where he was named a 2015 Post Season All-Star. He hit .325 with 29 RBIs and ten doubles to go with five triples. His play warranted a call-up for the 2016 season to the West Michigan Whitecaps, where he spent the entire year. He made another jump in play up to high-A Lakeland for 2017, however despite seeing his first professional home runs (he would hit three), his average would drop from .281 in 2016 to .220 in 2017. Azocar would spend 2018 in both West Michigan and Lakeland. He would start 2019 with the Erie SeaWolves. As of May 11, 2019, he possessed the third-highest batting average in the Eastern League with a .336 clip. His average would ultimately take a down-tick, but it would be sitting at .293 when, on June 24, he was named to the Eastern League All-Star Game for the Western Division. At time of honoring, he led the league in hits with 136, was tied for third-highest batting average in the league (.284), had 39 multi-hit games, and also had ten home runs and 56 RBIs. He would ultimately earn the dubious distinction of leading the minor leagues in 2019 by grounding into 22 double plays. However, he would be named the Eastern League Rookie of the Year for 2019, becoming the first SeaWolves' player to earn the honor. Azocar was re-signed by the Tigers organization after becoming a minor league free agent on November 7, 2019. Nolan Blackwood Nolan Blackwood (born March 16, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Detroit Tigers organization. Blackwood attended Southaven High School in Southaven, Mississippi, where he developed his side-arm delivery, saying, \\"In high school one day, I was having arm issues. My elbow kept bothering me, and my high school coach said, 'Hey, drop it down and just see how it feels and see how you do.' My first bullpen [session] I threw like that, I think I threw like 90 percent strikes.\\" He would help lead the school to a state championship in 2013 as a senior, allowing just a single run in 39 2/3 innings. Blackwood would then attend the University of Memphis where he would set a program record for appearances as a freshman (31) following that up with a program record in saves as a sophomore (14). He spent three years at Memphis finishing his career with 24 saves, a 7-9 record, a 2.32 ERA, and 77 strikeouts in 116.1 innings. Blackwood was drafted by the Oakland Athletics as a 16th round pick in the 2016 MLB Draft. Blackwood spent the majority of his season in A-ball with five appearances for the Vermont Lake Monsters and 13 appearances for the Beloit Snappers finishing with 25 strikeouts in 26.1 innings and a 2-2 record with a 3.26 ERA in his first pro season. He spent the full 2017 season with the High-A Stockton Ports where he held batters to a .205 average, made 19 saves in 20 opportunities, and struck 48 batters out compared to 18 walks. He finished the year with a 1-5 record and 3.00 ERA. He started the 2018 campaign with the AA Midland RockHounds in the Oakland organization, however the Athletics would trade him to the Detroit Tigers along with a player to be named later (eventually Logan Shore) for Mike Fiers. Blackwood played six games in the Tigers organization with the AA Erie SeaWolves and finished 2018 with a 6-4 record and 4.13 ERA over 45 AA appearances in the Oakland and Detroit organizations. Starting the 2019 season with the AAA Toledo Mud Hens, Blackwood made just three appearances giving up seven earned runs in three innings. He returned to Erie where he had a career-low ERA (1.76) and career-high in strikeouts (61), more than in any other full season. He held batters to just a .211 average and struck out 61 in 66.1 innings. He would also finish with a 6-4 record while earning four saves. Ethan DeCaster Ethan DeCaster (born October 27, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Detroit Tigers organization. DeCaster attended Creighton University for his first three years of eligibility, and subsequently transferred to Duke University as a graduate transfer. As a freshman at Creighton, he developed his side-arm style of pitching as a result of an injury suffered. He would end his career as a Bluejay with a 2.42 ERA over 75 appearances, all coming in relief. At Duke, he was named to the Second Team NCBWA All-American team after going 6‚Äì0 in relief with a 1.34 ERA, and 57 strikeouts to just six walks. DeCaster was drafted by the Tigers as an 18th round pick in the 2018 MLB Draft, and would be assigned to the GCL Tigers shortly after the draft. After merely two games, a stint lasting eight days, DeCaster would be called up to the Connecticut Tigers, where he spent under a month before moving up to the single-A West Michigan Whitecaps. He would see one game of action in Lakeland as well, for the Lakeland Flying Tigers, and would finish the 2018 campaign with a cumulative 0.84 ERA over 32 innings pitched. Opponents would only manage a .173 average off him. DeCaster would continue his rise through the Tigers minor league ranks in 2019 as after just seven more games to start the season in Lakeland, he would be called up to the Erie SeaWolves. Throughout the season, DeCaster would shuffle between Erie and the Toledo Mud Hens, where he would not give up a run through his first six appearances. In less than 365 days, DeCaster was able to move from getting drafted to the Triple-A Mud Hens' roster. Dillon Dingler Francis Dillon Dingler (born September 17, 1998) is an American professional baseball catcher in the Detroit Tigers organization. Dingler attended Jackson High School in Massillon, Ohio, where he played baseball, basketball, and football, leading Jackson to state championships in both basketball and baseball his senior year.

As a freshman at Ohio State in 2018, Dingler batted .244 with four home runs and 17 RBIs over 53 games. He earned Big Ten Conference All-Freshman honors. In 2019, his sophomore year, he was named a team captain. He missed 19 games during the season due to a broken hamate bone in his left hand. Over 49 games, he slashed .291/.392/.424 with three home runs and 19 RBIs, and was named to the All-Big Ten second team. As a junior in 2019, Dingler once again was named a team captain. He hit .340 with five home runs and 14 RBIs over 13 games before the college baseball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dingler was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the second round with the 38th overall pick in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft.

Ecker signed with Detroit and was assigned to the Connecticut Tigers. After posting a 0.50 ERA through 18 innings, he was promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps where he finished the season, posting a 1.86 ERA in 9.2 innings. In 2017, he played for both the Lakeland Flying Tigers and the Erie SeaWolves, pitching to a combined 2‚Äì4 record and 3.06 ERA in 51 relief appearances between both teams. Ecker spent 2018 with Erie, compiling a 4‚Äì6 record with a 3.66 ERA in 44 appearances in relief. He returned to Erie to begin 2019, but would bounce between Erie and Lakeland throughout the 2019 season. He would see better numbers at Lakeland, a 6‚Äì1 record with a 3.67 ERA, 25 strikeouts to nine walks, and 28 hits allowed in 27.0 innings, good for a 1.37 WHIP, versus Erie, a 1‚Äì4 record with a 5.85 ERA, 32 strikeouts to 21 walks, and 41 hits allowed in 32.1 innings, good for a 1.92 WHIP. Parker Meadows Parker Meadows (born November 2, 1999) is an American professional baseball outfielder in the Detroit Tigers organization. Meadows attended Grayson High School in Loganville, Georgia, the same school as his brother, fellow professional baseball player Austin Meadows. Meadows would get drafted in the second round, 44th overall, by the Tigers in the 2018 MLB Draft. Meadows signed with the Tigers organization and received a $2.5 million signing bonus, nearly a full $1 million above the slot value for the 44th overall pick. Meadows began his professional career in rookie ball with where he hit .284 with an OBP of .376, to go with four home runs in just 22 games. He would get called up to the Connecticut Tigers to finish the rest of the 2018 campaign where he continued the strong start to his professional career, going six-for-19 (.316 average) in his six games at that level. In the lead-up to, and following, the 2019 season, he would be listed within the top twelve Tigers prospects in the organization by various outlets, including a rating as high as ninth. In that 2019 season, Meadows spent the entire year with the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps. Meadows saw a dip in productivity, falling to a .221 batting average and .296 OBP, however he also hit seven home runs and drove in 40 RBIs while stealing 14 bases. He also walked 47 times over the course of the season, though he struck out 113 times as well. Meadows was not selected to be part of the Tigers alternate training squad for the shortened 2020 MLB season, however, with the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season, Meadows would continue to work out at his parents' residence in Loganville and Grayson High School. On September 3, Meadows was among four Tigers minor league players called up for the Tigers' alternate training site in Toledo. Gerson Moreno Gerson Mateo Moreno Vizcaino (born September 10, 1995) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher in the Detroit Tigers organization.

He is played by Sunderland-born actor James Bolam. In The Likely Lads Terry works with friend Bob Ferris as an electrician at Ellison's Electricals, before joining the British Army. During his time in the Army he married a West German woman, Jutta Baumgarten, from whom he separates a few months later. Terry's army service is not shown, nor is his marriage (although his wife was due to appear in the episode 'End of an Era', and remains on the credits despite the scene not being shown). Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads begins with Terry being finally discharged from the Army, and for the duration of the series he spends most of his time unemployed, although he takes brief short-term work as a car washer, hospital porter, fork-lift truck driver, and finally as a minicab driver. In The Likely Lads film, he works briefly as a mobile salesman.  Early life  Terry was conceived during an air raid on Newcastle upon Tyne and born on 29 February 1944 (possibly in Hartlepool, as mentioned in dialogue in the first episode). From an early age Terry was seen as a disruptive threat to other children, and teachers would often warn other children not to talk to him for fear his disruptive influence would transfer to other children. According to Terry during \\"No Hiding Place\\", his mother wanted him to be a doctor. Terry showed little aptitude in school, generally cheating his way through exams. After leaving school at 14, Terry went to night school, where, despite cheating at the exams, he still failed. He eventually qualified as an electrician and began working at Ellison's Electrical factory.  Army service and marriage  In 1966, Bob decides to sign up for the British Army. Terry, not wanting to be away from Bob, also signs up. However, Bob is discharged due to flat feet, whilst Terry is accepted, to his initial horror. He is stationed for most of his time in Cyprus, and also serves in Malta and West Germany. He also loses contact with Bob. In November 1969, he married a West German woman, Jutta Baumgarten. They separated in June 1970 after West Germany defeated England in the World Cup, before finally divorcing in 1976. Terry is discharged from the Army in 1973.  Personality  Despite being particularly proud of his working class status, Terry is notably workshy, informing Bob in one episode that he has 'dropped out of the rat race'. Terry often uses his previous Army service (in \\"the hot tropic night\\") to avoid working, because of his \\"dodgy spine\\", \\"Burmese malaria\\", and other mysterious ailments (including a never explained leg injury). Terry is down to earth, quick witted, po faced and cynical. He aggressively dislikes being referred to as 'thin' or 'slim', preferring instead to describe himself as 'wiry'. Terry has old fashioned views about women, seeing them primarily as sex objects. However, these views seem to mellow as the series goes on. Terry drinks and smokes heavily, tempting Bob to also indulge in the two vices he is always trying to cut down on. Much of Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? consisted of reminiscent nostalgia, while the film was largely made of observations of the current status and lifestyles of the main protagonists, and perhaps fear of the future. Terry was in both cases largely the main driver behind these features of the series. Terry is usually the character to make the apt and sometimes ironic observations on life, sometimes in a drunken state, and these observations are largely the basis for the humour and pathos of the latter parts of the series. Terry is scornful of any habits he sees as being 'Southern', pretentious or middle class, as well as treating modern fads, conservatism and religion with the same sarcastic scorn. Terry has a strained friendship with Thelma, Bob's wife. Thelma viewed Terry as the biggest threat to hers and Bob's marriage, though the two are known to have had a brief courtship (which Thelma described as \\"mistreatment by something coarse and vulgar\\"). As the series goes on, Thelma's attitude towards Terry begins to mellow, as she describes him as \\"honest\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" when a snobbish friend of hers insults him, and she turns to him for advice when she and Bob experience marital problems. Terry is a fairly politicised character and often airs his views, which Bob refers to as The Thoughts of Chairman Collier. A staunch Socialist, Terry states that his grandfather and uncle were on the Jarrow Marches (with Bob keenly reminding him it was only until the pubs opened). Terry holds great prejudices. In the episode of Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, \\"No Hiding Place\\", Terry describes his impression of several nationalities: the Italians and Spaniards are greasy, the Russians are \\"sinister\\", the Americans are \\"flash\\", Germans are \\"arrogant\\", Orientals are \\"cruel\\" and the Danish are \\"pornographic\\". He then moves onto the British Isles: 'I've never liked the Welsh', the Scots are 'worse than the Koreans'. Bob then points out that Terry never liked Southerners, to which Terry adds that he doesn't like many local people, in fact he hates his next door neighbours. Bob eventually narrows it all down to the fact Terry only really likes himself. During \\"Count Down\\", when choosing suits for Bob's upcoming wedding, Terry initially refuses to let a shop assistant adjust his trousers (believing the assistant to be homosexual) until the assistant reveals he is married.  Army service ambiguity  The number of years Terry actually serves in the Army is disputed. In the first episode of Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, in 1973, Terry has been discharged from the Army and states that he served for five years. However, there was a gap of seven years between the last episode of The Likely Lads (1966, when Terry signed up for the Army) and its sequel (1973). Bob mentions that Terry originally signed up for three years, before signing on for a further two, which means he should have been discharged in 1971. In the first episode, when Terry asks Bob how things have changed while he was away, Bob mentions that they can now receive BBC2, with Terry replying that they were able to before he left. BBC2 did not arrive in the North East until 1967, which implies that Terry had not joined the Army. During the episode \\"Moving On\\", when discussing the various changes in Newcastle during Terry's time away, he asks if \\"there is one pre-1967 brick left standing on top of another\\" and in the episode \\"I'll Never Forget Whatshername\\", Terry, Bob and Thelma all refer to a shared trip to Blackpool Illuminations in September 1967, further implying that Terry had not yet joined the Army at that point. A potential explanation is that a version of the original series was broadcast on BBC Radio in 1967 and 1968, which may suggest Terry's military career actually lasted from 1968 (the end of the radio adaptations) to his discharge in 1973 (the beginning of the TV sequel).

He is single in The Likely Lads, marries Thelma Chambers in Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? and is still married to her in the film. He works as an electrician and later as a civil engineer. Bob is a long-term friend of Terry Collier. Early life Bob was conceived in Scarborough (hence his middle name) by unmarried parents, the day before his father was posted to Catterick by the British Army. Bob was born on 22 February 1944 into a working-class family. Once he started school, he proved to be an impressionable child, on his own being conscientious, but being easily coaxed into trouble by friends, particularly Terry. At an early age Bob and Terry got into mild trouble, stealing Dinky toys from Woolworths and a hosepipe from a care home. Bob left school to become an electrical apprentice with Ellisons Electrical. While serving his apprenticeship, he also attended night school, eventually becoming a qualified electrician. In the last episode of The Likely Lads, he signs up for the British Army but is discharged for having flat feet. Terry, who only signs up in order to be alongside his friend, is accepted, and goes on to serve in West Germany. Personality Bob is keener than Terry to mask his working-class roots. After marrying Thelma Chambers, Bob aspires to be accepted into the middle class, much to Terry's disgust. Bob enjoys playing squash with wife Thelma, but equally enjoys drinking with Terry. He often blames his drinking and smoking on Terry, and also his poor diet. Although that is in part true, Bob needs little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry rather than going home to his wife. Bob Is hard-working, conscientious, fairly conventional, and (unlike Terry) ambitious, although he Is usually in need of guidance in order to achieve his ambitions. However, he is not particularly assertive, which makes him easily led by his headstrong wife Thelma and equally headstrong friend Terry. Despite Bob's ambition and enjoyment of his new-found status, he has often defended Terry's 'down-to-earth' and 'unpretentious' ways, on one occasion even offending one of his own and Thelma's friends in order to defend Terry.

Currently, the mine is no longer in use, but the area has become a popular ski resort. The village lies at an elevation of above sea level, about north of Liknes and about east of Tonstad in Sirdal municipality. The molybdenum mines were operated here from 1885 to 1973. Buildings and constructions are still partly intact. The workers' living houses are now used as tourist lodgings.  Nature  The Knaben uplands (Knabeheiene) are mainly located at an elevation of between above sea level. The area has a rich bird-life and animal life, with moose, reindeer, black grouse, lagopus, falcon, and eagle.  Mining activity  Occurrence of molybdenite was the basis for the mining activities at Knaben. In 1897, it was determined that tempering of steel with molybdenum resulted in an alloy with qualities favourable for weapon production. In 1902, the mining rights of the area were bought for , and subsequently sold to an English company in 1904 for . Due to low molybdenum prices the mining operations ceased in 1909. World War I led to an uprise at Knaben. At its height ten different mining companies had operations in the area, but all operations ceased when the war was over. The Swedish company Avesta J√§rnverks AB took over from A/S Knaben Molybd√¶ngruber, and the production increased through the 1930s, with about 400 mine workers and a total population at Knaben of about 700.  Second World War  Mosquito fighter bombers attacking the washing plant at Knaben. At the time Norway was invaded in 1940, during World War II, the Knaben mines were one of the only molybdenum mines in Europe still in operation. The occupying German forces stationed about 1,000 men in the area, and established gun sites for anti- aircraft guns. The mine operations were the target for allied bombing twice in 1943. The first attack took place on 3 March, with 10 British de Havilland Mosquito strike fighters of No. 139 Squadron RAF participating. The second attack was on 16 November, when 130 American B-17 bombers from the Eighth Air Force (in its mission number 131) attacked the Knaben molybdenum mines in a raid against Norway.  Post-war  The school at Knaben was built in 1954. In 1973, the mining company announced it would cease operations. The mines were finally closed on 30 April 1973, and the village was more or less abandoned. A museum, Knaben Gruvemuseum has been established in the old administration building, and is run by Knabens Venner and Kvinesdal municipality. Norsk Bergverksmuseum is running a pilot project at the Knaben mining community. A large sand deposit in the valley is a visible result from 88 years of mining activity. The percentage of molybdenum was low, on average below 0.2%. The sand deposits cause some leaching of metals (cadmium, copper and molybdenum), and flotation of chemicals into the river Kvina. Today, tourism is the main activity at Knaben. There is an alpine ski resort in operation, and several mountain cabin resorts. The ski resort operates three different pistes of around 1,000m (3,280 ft) each, with an elevation of 182 m (597 ft).

He appeared in 60 films between 1953 and 1999. He won the Best Actor Award at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival for the film Sacco & Vanzetti.  Biography  Born in Bari, in southern Italy, Cucciolla gained a degree in law, then made his stage debut in an amateur production in his home city. From 1946, he started working in radio as a voice actor and as the narrator of documentaries; at the same time, he started working in cinema, as a dubber and a voice actor. Cucciolla made his film debut in 1953, in Anton Giulio Majano's Good Folk's Sunday. After some minor roles, he had his first important role in Italiani brava gente (1965), followed by a further significant role in Giuliano Montaldo's Grand Slam (1967). Cucciolla came to national and international recognition with the leading role in Montaldo's Sacco e Vanzetti, for which he was awarded best actor at Cannes and won a Silver Ribbon. In the wake of that sudden popularity, he intensively worked throughout the decade, alternating notable films with others of more modest quality and ambition. Starting from eighties he thinned out his appearances, mainly focusing on dubbing and television roles. As a dubber, he provided voice-overs for Roger Moore, Claudio Villa, Erland Josephson, John Cazale, Jonathan Pryce, Richard Egan, James Caan, Robert Duvall and more.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) On 17 September 1999, Cucciolla died in Rome at the age of 75.

His racing career lasted from 1948 to 1959. Tidwell set track records at Albany, Georgia and Macon, Georgia during his career. Tidwell was likely the first NASCAR driver to have a personal human mascot; \\"Little Willie\\" Leonard, an African American dwarf whom he befriended in spite of the racial prejudices that existed during the time. Little Willie traveled the racing circuit with Tidwell and danced in front of the grandstands for the crowd. \\"The Flying B\\", as he was called by his opponents, raced with such greats as Fonty Flock, Tim Flock, Bob Flock, and, Lee Petty, Buck Baker, Junior Johnson, Fireball Roberts, and Nero Steptoe (aka \\"The Wild Indian). He also raced against the first woman racecar driver to compete against men in the state of Georgia, Ethel Flock Mobley, who was the sister of the Flock brothers. Tidwell lost his hearing during his racing career and was very likely the first totally deaf racecar driver. Tidwell first married Mildred Smith and together they had two daughters, Sandra Tidwell and Charlotte Mae Tidwell. They later divorced and in 1963 he married LaTrelle Russ and they had one daughter, Angela \\"Connie\\" Tidwell. Charles Tidwell died in 1990 from complications related to diabetes. His daughter, Angela \\"Connie\\" Tidwell Frady, is the owner of his legacy. Charles Tidwell is buried at Macon Memorial Park Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.  Early life  Charles Tidwell was the son of Lillie Mae Clark Tidwell and Charlie Clifton Tidwell. He was born in Crawford County (Lizella), Georgia and raised in Macon, Georgia. He was the eldest of three sons. His siblings were, Billy L. Tidwell, who also raced cars, and Jesse B. \\"Pop\\" Tidwell. Tidwell attended Virgil Powers Elementary School and Lanier High School in Macon, Georgia. He joined the Army just before WWII started. He was a sergeant and served on the front lines in France, Germany, and Austria. He was in the infantry and tank division. He was injured when he was struck with shrapnel. He eventually had to have his left pinky finger amputated due to the injury. Tidwell was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his service. At the end of World War II, Tidwell drove a tank in a parade at Columbus, Georgia, escorting General George S. Patton. After the war, Tidwell owned Tidwell's Used Cars on Broadway in Macon, Georgia with his father, Charlie Tidwell. He also owned a service station at one time. He owned the T&T; Garage at 4007 Broadway in Macon, Georgia until his retirement in 1977. Tidwell also enjoyed riding motorcycles and was a licensed pilot.  Racing career  Charles Tidwell raced on dirt tracks all over the southeastern United States from 1948 to 1959, owning a small track at one time in Talladega, Alabama. He drove with a cigar clenched between his teeth, once swallowing a burning cigar when he was in an accident and was hanging out of the door of his car. His hometown was Macon, Georgia, where he entered many races at the Central City Park racetrack. He was also on the board of governors with GASCAR. Tidwell's main car number was \\"6\\". He chose this number because his home was at 6 Dessau Place in Macon, Georgia. The names of some of his racecars were \\"The Flying B\\", \\"The Dutchess\\" (his nickname for his first wife, Mildred Smith Tidwell), \\"Flying Saucer, and \\"Ali Khan\\". He built many of his own cars and mixed his own fuel formulas. According to the Macon newspaper, he was rated as the top driver on the Strictly Stock circuit in the southeast and in his home state, Georgia. During his third year of racing, he won 34 track victories in one year, which was a mark no other Georgia driver could equal. He also held the title of Southeastern Champion for 8 years. The Macon Telegraph had this to say about Tidwell, \\"This young blond fellow is completely fearless and has the grit and determination that sets him apart everywhere he goes. He is both a demon on his motorcycle and in his racecar.\\" In June 1949, he set a track record at Central City Park Speedway at a speed of 32.2 seconds, and he also set a track record at the Albany, Georgia speedway for 31.2 seconds in 1952. Tidwell raced at the first annual race held at the Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina. During that race, he drove an Oldsmobile 88, number 102, called the Heart of Georgia Special. He also raced at Daytona, Florida when the races were still being held right on the beach. Due to popular demand, Tidwell and his rival, Barney Smith were matched to compete in a special 5-lap winner take all race, held September 11, 1949 at Central City Park Speedway in Macon, Georgia. The race was listed as a special feature event. Tidwell took the checkered flag for the victory in front of a crowd of 5,000. Tidwell once participated in an added attraction at the Warner Robins, Georgia track, ran by the Warner Robins Civil Air Patrol, in which he raced six laps against a Cub airplane, flown by licensed pilot, Clive Hyatt of the Warner Robins Civil Air Patrol. Hyatt kept his wing tip almost right on top of Tidwell's car the whole race and would get ahead of Tidwell at the back leg of the track when the wind was at his back. Tidwell was the winner of the race. A few years after he lost his hearing, Tidwell retired from racing in 1959. Later in years, Charles Tidwell said that the only place he ever wanted to race and never did was Indianapolis, Indiana. Charles Tidwell's racing memorabilia was on display at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega, Alabama for ten years and now may be seen at the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in Macon, Georgia.

He was the only child of Emmanuel, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then, by his wife Anna Eleonore, daughter of Henry Ernest, Count of Stolberg. Life Emmanuel Lebrecht was born six months after the death of his father on 8 November 1670 and was declared ruler of Anhalt-K√∂then under the regency of his mother immediately at birth. The Dowager Princess Anna Eleonore ruled over K√∂then for almost twenty years, until her death in 1690, and then John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, succeeded her in the regency for the next two years, until January 1692, when Emmanuel Lebrecht was formally proclaimed an adult and took over the government of his lands. When Emmanuel Lebrecht was still a young prince, he fell in love with Gisela Agnes of Rath (b. Klein-W√ºlknitz near K√∂then, 9 October 1669 - d. Nienburg, 12 March 1740), of an old noble family of Anhalt. The Dowager Princess Anna Eleonore was totally against their liaison and tried to separated the couple by sending Gisela Agnes to Stadthagen with her sister. After the death of the Dowager Princess and formal assumption of the rule of his principality, Emmanuel Lebrecht sent for Gisela Agnes and they finally married in a secret ceremony in Nienburg on 22 May (30 September according to some sources) of 1692. The morganatic marriage of a Reformist prince with a Lutheran woman from the lesser nobility brought vehements protest from the Reform Church and the other agnates of the Anhalt principalities. Nonetheless, Gisela Agnes was created Imperial Countess of Nienburg (German: Reichsgr√§fin von Nienburg) on 23 July 1694. The agnates refused to accept the marriage as dynastically valid and Emmanuel Lebrecht sued them before the Reichshofrat for libel in 1696; finally, by means of a treaty of 28 June 1698, the Princes of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Harzgerode, Anhalt-Zerbst, and Anhalt-Dessau all recognized the issue of the marriage as lawful heirs and all descendants as princes and princesses of Anhalt with all appertaining rights, without however creating any precedent against the prescriptions of the law of the House of Ascania. The Imperial confirmation of the treaty was granted on 12 March 1699. On August 3 of that year Emmanuel Lebrecht assigned his wife the castle, city, and bailiwick of Nienburg as dowager for life and made her \\"tutrix and regent\\" in case of the minority of his successor, with the full approval of the agnates.

(2006). Gold Rush Towns of Nevada County. Arcadia Publishing. p. 87. . It is located along Highway 174, with its center at the intersection of Mt. Olive Road. The neighborhood gets its name from its founding residents, who came from Chicago to California in the late 1800s to grow fruit, which was often shipped back to Illinois for consumption. Chicago park is about 9 miles southeast of Grass Valley and about 3 miles north of Colfax.  History   The Early Days of Storms Station  Prior to the 1840s, this area was populated by the Nisenan, sometimes referred to as Southern Maidu.Jones, 1956, p. 1. Emigrants to California then began to arrive. In August 1849, what is reported to have been Nevada County's second store was erected by a Mr. Findley on land overlooking the junction of the Bear River and Greenhorn Creek.Bean, Edwin F., History and Directory of Nevada County (1867) One of the earliest settlers was Simmon P. Storms, who developed a ranch which, among other things, hosted sporting events such as wrestling matches and bear fights. A local newspaper reported \\"If you wish to seek a pleasant locality for spending the day, where after a good ride over a smooth road, where you can enjoy a cool and delightful lounge and excellent dinner, go to Storms.\\" In 1854, area residents led by Mr. Storms succeeded in having the Nisenan removed to a reservation near Tehama, California.Jones, 1983, p. 5 During that period, Benjamin Taylor settled on a ranch in the area which he named Buena Vista, after the Mexican War battle in which he had participated, and engaged in farming and horse breeding.Jones, 1956, p. 4 Others who settled in the area, such as the Louis Orzalli family, found it very suitable for growing fruit, especially pears.Jones, 1956, p. 3. Joseph Shebley established a fish hatchery and picnic grounds. In 1883, he sold the hatchery to the California Fish Commission which abandoned it a few years later.Cook, 1965, p. 8 Mr. Ambergh established a brewery. Gold mining was also prevalent.Cook, 1965, p. 5  The Railroad Arrives  In 1872, the Coleman Brothers purchased the Buena Vista and Storms ranches, and other properties in the area, as they were developing the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad, known affectionately as the \\"Never Come Never Go.\\"Jones, 1956, p. 2 Completed in 1876, the Railroad connected the area to the transcontinental railroad at Colfax, spurring its agricultural development.Jones, 1983, pp. 11-12 Among other things, the Colemans established a saw mill and cleared land of trees to build the Railroad and to feed the Railroad's steam locomotives. Stations in the area were established at Storms Ranch, just south of present Lakewood Lane; at Buena Vista, just south of the present intersection of You Bet Road and Highway 174; and at Peardale.Jones, 1983, p. 16 The Railroad provided a good means of transporting agricultural products to market.Cook, 1965, p. 6 Still standing at the intersection of Mount Olive and Lower Colfax Roads is the Pacific Fruit Packing Shed, built in 1930 alongside the railroad tracks, to replace an earlier shed which collapsed in a snowstorm.Jones, 1983, p. 21 File:Chicago_Park_Packing_Shed.jpg The Railroad also brought people to Chicago Park for recreation at sites such as Shebley's Pond. In 1908, the Railroad was rerouted to run directly through Chicago Park, causing the Chicago Park station to be relocated close to where the packing shed now stands. The Railroad was discontinued in the 1940s and the bridge across the Bear River was removed in 1963 to make way for Rollins Dam.Jones, 1983, p. 6  The Chicago Park Colony  In 1887, a group of Colfax and Chicago, Illinois developers led by Mssrs. Lobner, Hayford, Stafford, Briot and Porter, acquired several thousand acres of land and drew up plans for the Chicago Park Colony.Jones, 1973, p. 1Weeks, 1956, p. 3 The Colony was to consist of 20 and 40 acre tracts as well as town lots laid out around a public square with streets named for prominent streets in Chicago. Much of the planned development never materialized, but reportedly almost 7000 acres were sold, principally to residents of Chicago.Jones, 1973, passim. This article contains a detailed history of the rise and fall of the Chicago Park Colony. Many of the colonizers found the weather too cold, given their expectations fueled by advertisements of sunny California.Cook, 1965, p. 7 Many of the tracts were planted with orchards, and the area was referred to as the Bartlett Pear Belt. File:Chicago_Park_Colony_ad.png The railroad station at Storms Station was renamed Chicago Park Station. One of the original developers, Dr. Charles A. Pusheck built a sanitarium and hotel in the Orchards Springs area of Chicago Park. It burned down in 1924Jones, 1983, p. 30 He and his mother were also instrumental in the founding of St. Paul Lutheran Church in 1904. Chicago Park also had a Catholic church.Jones, 1983, p. 4 A post office was established at the railroad station in 1888, with Joseph H. Hubacheck as postmaster.Jones, 1983, p. 3Janicot, Michel (August 1994). A History of Nevada County Post Offices, 1850-1994. Northern Mines Series. Nevada County Historical Society, p. 13. . It moved into the Chicago Park Store when it was erected in 1915.Jones, 1983, p. 31. In 1897 a schoolhouse was built.< Telephone service, initially to Colfax, arrived in 1905.Jones, 1983, p. 40. PG&E; electric power arrived in 1930.Jones, 1983, p. 52.  Agriculture  Fruit was king in the area for about 100 years. Orchards growing pears, plums, peaches and apples were everywhere. Because water was not abundant, dry farming techniques were mastered which improved fruit color.Lardner, William Branson and Michael John Brock (1924). History of Placer and Nevada Counties, California: With Biographical Sketches of the Leading Men and Women of the Counties who Have Been Identified with Their Growth and Development from the Early Days to Present. Placer County Historical Society, p.366. Reportedly, pears from Chicago Park fetched twice the price as pears from the Central Valley.Jones, 1983, p. 20. In 1915, J.F.

Retrieved 2008-09-06; Grand Prize Pears. sacramentohistory.org. Retrieved 2008-09-06. As the 20th century progressed, pear blight appeared, causing some growers to switch to other crops.Cook, 1965, pp. 5, 8. The Bierwagens are one of the prominent area farming families. In 1904, William Bierwagen bought much of the Storms Ranch.> His nephew Ernie (1915-2004) was a leader in the local agricultural community.Comstock, 2016, No 19 The Bierwagen family continues to grow apples and other fruit on the family farm in Chicago Park.  Chicago Park Today  Today, Chicago Park is a pleasant agricultural residential community. In recent times, a new school, post office, and fire station have been constructed. In addition to several private grape growers, a formal winery was established in 2000. Of historical significance are the Chicago Park store, the old schoolhouse, the St. Paul cemetery and the packing shed erected in the 1930s.Comstock, 2016, Nos. 18-21 Rollins Lake, hiking, and a number of fruit farms, including the Bierwagen Donner Trail Fruit Farm, in operation since 1902, draw visitors to the area.

The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during the 3rd century BCE and transformed it into a centre of Buddhist culture and religion. Later, between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Silharas from 810 to 1260. King Bhimdev established his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century, and brought many settlers to the islands. The Muslim rulers of Gujarat captured the islands in 1348, and they were later governed by the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1534. The Treaty of Bassein between the Portuguese viceroy Nuno da Cunha and Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534. The islands suffered incursions from Mughals towards the end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with Mecca and Basra. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in 1853. The city became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century and was the centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946. After India's independence in 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State. In 1960, following protests from the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, the city was incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State from Bombay State. The city has also faced some unfortunate events like the communal riots of 1992‚Äì93, while the bombings of 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property. The city was renamed Mumbai on 6 March 1996. 'Panoramic View of Mumbai taken from Malabar Hill' (1862), a watercolour on 5 folding pages, by Mary Ann Scott-Moncrieff Early history Pre-historic period The seven islands of Mumbai with their anglicised names Geologists believe that the coast of western India came into being around 100 to 80 mya, after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the R√©union hotspot, a volcanic hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of R√©union. An eruption here some 66 mya is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region led to the formation of hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Malcolm Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Mumbai Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism. Age of Indian empires Kanheri Caves served as a centre of Buddhism during ancient times The islands were incorporated into the Maurya Empire under Emperor Ashoka of Magadha in the third century BCE. The empire's patronage made the islands a centre of Buddhist religion and culture. Buddhist monks, scholars, and artists created the artwork, inscriptions, and sculpture of the Kanheri Caves in the mid third century BCE and Mahakali Caves. After the decline of the Maurya Empire around 185 BCE, these islands fell to the Satavahanas. The port of Sopara (present-day Nala Sopara) was an important trading centre during the first century BCE, with trade contacts with Rome. The islands were known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE. After the end of the Satvahana rule in 250 CE, the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra and Vakatakas of Vidarbha held dominion over the islands. The Abhiras ruled for 167 years, till around 417 CE. The Kalachuris of Central India ruled the islands during the fifth century, which were then acquired by the Mauryas of Konkan in the sixth and early part of the seventh century. The Mauryas were feudatories of Kalachuris, and the Jogeshwari Caves were constructed during their regime between 520 and 525. The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes visited Kalyan (near Mumbai) during 530‚Äì550. The Elephanta Caves also dates back to the sixth century. Christianity arrived in the islands during the sixth century, when the Nestorian Church made its presence in India. The Mauryan presence ended when the Chalukyas of Badami in Karnataka under Pulakeshin II invaded the islands in 610. Dantidurga of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty of Karnataka conquered the islands during 749‚Äì750. Banganga Tank and Walkeshwar Temple The Silhara dynasty of Konkan ruled the region between 810 and 1260. The Walkeshwar Temple was constructed during the 10th century and the Banganga Tank during the 12th century under the patronage of the Silhara rulers. The Italian traveler Marco Polo's fleet of thirteen Chinese ships passed through Mumbai Harbour during May ‚Äî September 1292. King Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in Mahikawati (present day Mahim). He belonged to either the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri in Maharashtra or the Anahilavada dynasty of Gujarat. He built the first Babulnath temple in the region and introduced many fruit-bearing trees, including coconut palms to the islands. The Pathare Prabhus, one of the earliest settlers of the city, were brought to Mahim from Patan and other parts of Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev during his reign. He is also supposed to have brought Palshis, Pachkalshis, Bhandaris, Vadvals, Bhois, Agris and Brahmins to these islands. After his death in 1303, he was succeeded by his son Pratapbimba, who built his capital at Marol in Salsette, which he named Pratappur. The islands were wrested from Pratapbimba's control by Mubarak Khan, a self-proclaimed regent of the Khalji dynasty, who occupied Mahim and Salsette in 1318. Pratapbimba later reconquered the islands which he ruled till 1331. Later, his brother-in- law Nagardev for 17 years till 1348. The islands came under the control of the Muslim rulers of Gujarat in 1348, ending the sovereignty of Hindu rulers over the islands. Islamic period The Haji Ali Dargah at Mahalaxmi built in 1431, in honour of the Muslim saint Haji Ali The islands were under Muslim rule from 1348 to 1391. After the establishment of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1391, Muzaffar Shah I was appointed viceroy of north Konkan. For the administration of the islands, he appointed a governor for Mahim. During the reign of Ahmad Shah I (1411‚Äì1443), Malik-us-Sharq was appointed governor of Mahim, and in addition to instituting a proper survey of the islands, he improved the existing revenue system of the islands. During the early 15th century, the Bhandaris seized the island of Mahim from the Sultanate and ruled it for eight years. It was reconquered by Rai Qutb of the Gujarat Sultanate. Firishta, a Persian historian, recorded that by 1429 the seat of government of the Gujarat Sultanate in north Konkan had transferred from Thane to Mahim. On Rai Qutb's death in 1429‚Äì1430, Ahmad Shah I Wali of the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan captured Salsette and Mahim. Ahmad Shah I retaliated by sending his son Jafar Khan to recapture the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought with Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431. After the death of Kutb Khan, the Gujarat commandant of Mahim, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. Ahmad Shah I responded with a large army and navy under Jafar Khan leading to the defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali. During 1491‚Äì1494, the islands suffered sea piracies from Bahadur Khan Gilani, a nobleman of the Bahamani Sultanate. After the end of the Bahamani Sultanate, Bahadur Khan Gilani and Mahmud Gavan (1482‚Äì1518) broke out in rebellion at the port of Dabhol and conquered the islands along with the whole of Konkan. Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed into the deep natural harbour of the island in 1508, and he called it Bom ba√≠a (Good Bay). However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Mahim creek. After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah. In 1526, the Portuguese established their factory at Bassein. During 1528‚Äì29, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio seized the fort of Mahim from the Gujarat Sultanate, when the King was at war with Nizam-ul-mulk, the emperor of Chaul, a town south of the islands. Bahadur Shah had grown apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun and he was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the islands of Mumbai and Bassein were offered to the Portuguese. Bassein and the seven islands were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha, Viceroy of Portuguese India, on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Mumbai. Portuguese period Davies' sketch of Bombay harbour 1626 Castella de Aguada (Fort of the Waterpoint) was built by the Portuguese at Bandra in 1640 The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their religious orders in Bombay. The islands were leased to Mestre Diogo in 1534. The San Miguel (St. Michael Church) in Mahim, one of the oldest churches in Bombay, was built by the Portuguese in 1540. Parel, Wadala, Sion, and Worli were granted to Manuel Serr√£o between 1545 and 1548, during the viceroyalty of Jo√£o de Castro. Mazagaon was granted to Antonio Pessoa in 1547. Salsette was granted for three years to Jo√£o Rodrigues Dantas, Cosme Corres, and Manuel Corres.

The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere and Shipman was prevented from landing in Bombay. He was forced to retire to the island of Anjediva in North Canara and died there in October 1664. In November 1664, Shipman's successor Humphrey Cooke agreed to accept Bombay without its dependencies. However, Salsette, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. Later, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English.

For reasons not revealed in the saga, but probably related to his courtship of Solveig, Olvir was attacked and nearly killed in his home by Solveig's brothers shortly after King Harald's conquest of M√∏re.Egil's Saga ¬ß 2 (Thorsson 9). Atli's sons, Hallstein, Holmstein and Herstein, were famous Norsemen who sailed with the foster brothers Hj√∂rleifr Hr√≥√∞marsson and Ing√≥lfr Arnarson. They fell out, however, over Ingolfur's sister Helga, who married Hj√∂rleifur. In the ensuing blood feud two of Atli's sons were killed and their erstwhile allies fled Norway for Iceland, becoming the first permanent settlers there.Jones 275. After Harald Fairhair conquered M√∏re and Fjordane he assigned the governance of the former to Rognvald Eysteinsson and the latter to H√•kon Grjotgardsson. H√°kon and Atli soon came into conflict over Sogn and fought a battle at Fjalir in Stafaness Bay, in which H√•kon was killed. Atli was severely wounded in the battle and taken to a nearby island, where he died.Saga of Harald Fairhair ¬ß 12 (Hollander 69). Eyvindr sk√°ldaspillir wrote a verse about the battle which is preserved in Heimskringla: :Was Hakon, Hogni's daughter's-tree :fey when to fight he went; :and his life lost in combat :Frey's offspring on Fjalir strand. :Blended was with blood the wave, :as friends fell, faithful to him, :and wound-gore warm of warriors, :in Ygg's storm :by Stafaness.

The song was written by Kern and P.G. Wodehouse for their 1917 musical Oh, Lady! Lady!! for Vivienne Segal to perform, but withdrawn because it was considered too melancholy for that show. However, when Kern and Hammerstein were at work on the serious and somewhat tragic Show Boat, they decided that the song would be perfect for a nightclub scene in the show. Hammerstein revised Wodehouse's original lyrics somewhat (though he would always give full credit to Wodehouse for the song and take none for himself), and the song was given to real-life nightclub singer Helen Morgan, who portrayed the mulatto Julie in Show Boat, to sing. The song is rendered only once in the show and is highly emotional, with the singer supposedly on the verge of tears. It is sung in an audition scene in Act II. At the Trocadero, a local Chicago night club, Julie LaVerne, the former leading lady of the show boat, is the featured singer. Julie, who is of mixed blood, has been permanently abandoned by her white husband, Steve Baker, years after the two were forced to leave the show boat because of their interracial (and therefore illegal) marriage. Despondent, Julie has taken to drink and is quickly becoming an alcoholic. At the urging of Jim Green, the nightclub manager, Julie rehearses the song \\"Bill\\", which is a woman's confession of deep love for a less-than-perfect man named Bill, and it is clear that the emotion that Julie puts into the song comes from the fact that she is really thinking about her husband as she sings. \\"Bill\\" became one of Helen Morgan's signature songs, and onstage she sang it in her trademark style sitting atop a piano. Although the song is heard only once in Show Boat and never reprised, it became one of the musical's most famous. On film, Helen Morgan sang \\"Bill\\" both in the prologue to the 1929 part-talkie film version of Show BoatShow Boat (1929) - Soundtracks at Internet Movie Database and in the classic 1936 film version.Show Boat (1936) - Soundtracks at Internet Movie Database Lena Horne was filmed singing it for the Jerome Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By, but the scene was eventually cut, and Ava Gardner, using the dubbed-in voice of Annette Warren, sang it in the 1951 Technicolor remake of Show Boat.Show Boat (1951) - Soundtracks at Internet Movie Database Gardner's own voice can be heard on the soundtrack record. Shirley Bassey recorded the song for the 1959 Studio Cast Album of \\"Show Boat\\". The song was a regular part of Dorothy Lamour's repertoire. Lamour frequently sang it on radio and in concert and recorded it in 1958.

He also played cricket for Hampshire in 1877 and for Cambridge University in 1877 and 1878. Education Bury was born in Withington, Manchester and was educated at Eton College. He played for the college football team in 1875 and 1876, before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he earned a blue for football in both 1877 and 1878, as well as a blue for cricket in 1877. He was also especially noted for his sprinting and hammer throwing, and won athletics blues in 1878, 1879 and 1880. He graduated BA in the latter year. Football career Bury appeared regularly for the Old Etonians and for Cambridge University. His first England appearance came as left-back on 3 March 1877, when he was still at University. He was one of seven d√©butantes in the England team to play Scotland at the Kennington Oval. According to Philip Gibbons, in the 1870s the England side \\"tended to be chosen on availability rather than skill alone\\" The change in the England line-up made little difference to England's performance against the Scots who won the game 3‚Äì1, with England's consolation goal coming from Alfred Lyttelton; the Scots thus inflicted England's first international defeat on home soil in the sixth appearance between the two countries. Along with most of the other international d√©butantes, he was not selected for the next England match, but he was recalled for the first ever match between England and Wales on 18 January 1879. As Wales had been defeated 9‚Äì0 in their previous international against Scotland, England were confident of victory and selected an inexperienced eleven, including five d√©butantes. The match was played at the Kennington Oval in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was working late on a case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) and was unable to leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived. Despite this, England won the match by two goals to one, with Herbert Whitfeld and Thomas Sorby scoring for England. In 1879, he helped the Old Etonians reach the Cup Final where they met Clapham Rovers at Kennington Oval on 29 March. Bury and his team captain, Arthur Kinnaird were required to call on \\"their well-known powers ... to keep the enemy out of their quarters\\". The match was dominated by the defences and was goalless at half-time. In the second half, Charles Clerke scored for the Old Etonians \\"following an excellent run by Goodhart\\" and \\"arguably the poorest Cup Final to date\\" ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory for the Old Etonians. Bury served on The Football Association committee in 1878. He also played for Swifts F.C. and in representative matches for The South v The North. Cricket career He played cricket for Cambridge University in 1877 and 1878, and made one appearance for Hampshire against Derbyshire in July 1877. He was a right-handed batsman and a fast right-arm bowler. In his nine first-class appearances, he totalled 115 runs at an average of 9.58 and claimed 18 wickets at an average of 13.83. Life after sport He later emigrated to Florida where he became an orange planter, possibly in association with his former Eton College and Cambridge University compatriot Rupert Anderson who had gone to Florida at the same time. Bury subsequently returned to England, settling near Bradfield, Berkshire where he died, aged seventy-eight, on 30 October 1935. He was a J.P. for that county. In the First World War he volunteered to serve with the French Red Cross.

According to him, it was a time when \\"parents considered only medicine or engineering\\" to be \\"serious professions\\", that he did not have interest but continued with it anyway. Rangan claims that he was fascinated with writing and liked reading critical analyses on world cinema, especially those by American critics. He was selected for a workshop by the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI), Mumbai which led to him having a stint as a copywriter with J. Walter Thompson in Chennai. After that, Rangan received a full scholarship from the Marquette University, Milwaukee for a Master's degree in Advertising and Public relations, focusing on Internet advertising. Later, Rangan worked as an IT Consultant in the United States for about five years. He still had the urge to write and started reviewing films for the website \`sitagita.com\`. That was when he was noticed by Sushila Ravindranath, then the editor of The New Sunday Express, the Sunday edition of The New Indian Express. Rangan worked there for two years, before shifting to The Hindu, which he became the deputy editor of. Rangan also wrote for the magazine Tehelka, while still working at The New Indian Express. His first review was of the Hindi film Dum, published on 30 January 2003 in the Madras Plus supplement of The Economic Times. Rangan has authored two books: Conversations with Mani Ratnam (2012), wherein he interviews film director Mani Ratnam on the perspectives of his films, and Dispatches From The Wall Corner: A Journey through Indian Cinema (2014), which he describes as a \\"panoramic view of Indian cinema\\".

Awards  At the 53rd National Film Awards which took place in 2006, Rangan won in the Best Film Critic category. The citation given to him by the jury of the 53rd National Film Awards reads, \\"The Award is presented for intelligent and reader-friendly reviews of popular cinema with a depth of understanding of the form, a discernible passion for the medium bulwarked consistently by a knowledge of the trends and touchstones of global cinema.\\" In 2013, Arul Mani of Tehelka described Rangan as \\"far and away the most intelligent writer we have in India when it comes to cinema\\".

Early life Sonya (n√©e Goldberg) was born on October 6, 1923 in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts. There, she regularly attended Saturday classes at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts where she studied with Karl Zerbe. She spent her childhood summers at the art colony in Ogunquit, Maine.\\"Digitizing the Golem: From Earth to Outer Space\\", Leonardo Journal, Vol. 39, No. 2, (MIT, 2006),17. Education She attended MassArt (Massachusetts College of Art) for two years from 1941 to 1942 and during this period she met Henry Rapoport while he was a Ph.D. Candidate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1942 she was enrolled in a summer philosophy program taught by John Dewey in New York at Columbia University. She then returned to Massachusetts and studied at Boston University from 1943 to 1944, majoring in biology. She married Henry Rapoport in 1944 and the couple moved to New York. Sonya Rapoport enrolled at New York University and, in 1946, received her B.A. in Labor Economics. She then attended the Art Students League of New York where she studied with Reginald Marsh. In September 1946 the couple moved again, this time to Washington, D.C., where Rapoport entered the Corcoran School of Art to study figurative art and oil painting. In late September 1947, Henry Rapoport accepted a position as professor of organic chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. There Sonya Rapoport studied with Erle Loran, receiving her master's degree in art practice in 1949. The Berkeley art practice curriculum at that time was heavily influenced by the aesthetic philosophy of Hans Hofmann, although the school produced artists as divergent in their practices as, Rapoport, Jay DeFeo and Sam Francis.PDF of \\"The Eightieth Year, The Berkeley School of Painting: 1930s - 1950\\", ArtLetter, Berkeley Art Alumni Group, (Summer 2003), 1. Artistic evolution Rapoport's work in the late 1940s explored the human figure in abstracted form. In the 1950s her painting practice shifted, displaying Abstract expressionist influences while abandoning figuration. While developing her ABEX style, she experimented in watercolors. These joint practices culminated in two solo exhibitions; one at the East West Gallery in San Francisco in 1958,James McCray, \\"Sonya Rapoport at the East West Gallery\\", The Argonaut, January 31, 1958 and the other at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 1963.Dean Wallace, \\"Five One-Man Shows at Legion\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 3, 1963 In the mid-1960s, inspired by reading her husband's scientific journals, she began to assemble different canvases into unified works. In these artworks, she incorporated scientific illustrations, graphic forms, and three-dimensional abstract expressionist constructions. These canvases were juxtaposed according to Rapoport's personal aesthetic.\\"Sonya Rapoport\\", John Bolles Gallery pamphlet, November 3 - December 4, 1964 About these works, Dean Wallace wrote, \\"Sonya Rapoport [is] now tacking together canvases of different expressionist tendencies into a single unit; a work like \\"Psyche Trio\\" gives a strange almost schizophrenic feeling. Odd that no one has thought of using this device before.Dean Wallace, \\"A Survey of Bay Area Styles\\", San Francisco Sunday Chronicle, July 19, 1964, p. 25 In the late 1960s, Rapoport helped to found the New York \\"Pattern painting\\" movement which she defined as, \\"buying kinky fabrics and painting out shapes.\\"Miriam Dungan Cross, \\"Berkeley Artist Shows Unique Works\\", Oakland Tribune, August 6, 1967 1970s The 1970s saw a sea change in Rapoport's artistic vision. In 1971 she purchased an antique architect's desk, inside of which she discovered a series of geological survey charts on linen paper from 1905. She used these charts as a background for her \\"pictorial language of shapes\\". This language consisted of shapes that represented gender symbols, for instance the uterus, a mandarin orange (fetus), cue holder (udders), fleur-de-lis (fetus), the Moon, etc. and which she collected in a \\"Pandora's Box\\". These symbols were used again and again in Rapoport's work during this period. Digital Mudra (1988 ‚Äì 1989) featured people making hand signs, here the lower two images feature the sculptor Kati Casida and her husband John E. Casida. In 1976, after concentrating for many years on painting and drawing, Rapoport turned her attention to electronic media, with the focus of her work oriented towards interdisciplinary and cultural studies. Computer printouts took the place of the \\"Survey Charts\\". In 1977 she exhibited mixed-media works on computer printouts at the Union Gallery at San Jose State University. In these years Rapoport's artworks focused on the representation of overlap between language, symbols, stories from the newspaper, the Bible, and cultural anthropology. She worked with C. Michael Lederer at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, on a project entitled \\"The Table of Isotopes\\" in 1977 which dealt with the transformation of cobalt and mercury into gold. Working with the anthropologist Dorothy Washburn in 1978 Rapoport completed \\"A Shoe-In\\" held at Berkeley Computer Systems; \\"Shoe-Field at Media Gallery in San Francisco, \\"Interaction: Art and Science\\" at the Truman Gallery in New York,\\"Interaction: Art and Science\\", Truman Gallery Pamphlet, 38 E. 57 NYC January 12 - February 3, 1979. and \\"Aesthetic Response\\" at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. 1980s From 1979 to 1984 Rapoport worked on her largest project to date, entitled Objects On My Dresser. This project unfolded in eleven successive phases. Rapoport began by making personal, visually based, free-associative connections in which images of the twenty-nine objects on her dresser were correlated with twenty-nine other random images. Her associations varied from formal to cultural to psychological. Later, she developed interactive installations and magazine polls which required that each of the fifty-eight objects be grouped into one of six themes: (Hand], Chest, Eye, Masking, Threading, and Moving) by people working in three respective fields: artists, scientists, and attorneys. Rapoport plotted the subsequent data to find that the three separate groups made significantly different choices when they categorized the visual objects into the six themes. Lawyers tended to classify the objects similarly to their peers, choosing the same categories for similar objects, while the artists and scientists both displayed broader associative connections when placing the objects into categories.Judy Malloy and Sonya Rapoport, Objective ConnectionsTerri Cohn, Tansu, Text, and Technology: Sonya Rapoport‚Äôs ‚ÄòObjects on My Dresser‚Äô, Lecture given at the Mid-Atlantic Popular/American Culture Association Conference, October 2007 In 1983 she created a large-scale interactive installation entitled \\"Biorhythm: How Do You Feel?\\" at WORKS gallery in San Jose. In this work, Rapoport connected participants to bio-feedback equipment, and asked them to relate their feelings on that particular day. Participants described their emotions both in words and by creating hand gestures that expressed those feelings. Participants then compared their self-assessments with the biofeedback readings. Rapoport then evaluated this information and created an installation as part of the 1984 show \\"SF/SF San Francisco/ Science Fiction\\" at the Clocktower in New York. Four years later, in a 1987 interactive installation at the Kala Institute entitled \\"Digital MudrƒÅ\\" Rapoport returned to the data acquired from \\"Biorhythm: How Do You Feel?\\". She associated each participant's gesture with one of 52 hand gestures known as MudrƒÅs. In doing so, Rapoport suggested the cross-cultural correlations of hand gestures and their trans- cultural meanings. MudrƒÅs and their word meanings were juxtaposed within a western context and transcribed onto a computer printout and also, into a Kathakali dance. Rapoport discovered that the words people chose to describe their gestures in western culture, and the words given to the gestures in the MudrƒÅ vocabulary were surprisingly similar. Finally, Rapoport created a slide presentation showing current political leaders making similar gestures having similar verbal contexts.Archana Horsting, Seeing Time 87, (Kala Institute Publication, September 3, 1987), 2. In 1988 she received a grant from the California Arts Council for the production of \\"Digital MudrƒÅ\\" online via Carl Loeffler and Fred Truck's Art Com Electronic Network (ACEN). In 1989, a simplified version of \\"Digital MudrƒÅ\\" was uploaded to the Internet as a web- based interactive artwork. 1990s The Animated Soul: Gateway to Your Ka was a site-specific interactive installation exhibited at the Ghia Gallery, a casket showroom in South San Francisco in 1991, the Takada Gallery in San Francisco, and the Kuopio Museum in Finland, in 1992. The Animated Soul, in book format, traveled from 1992-1993 throughout the United States under an NEA grant. In this show, set in a tomb environment, viewer-participants interacted with a HyperCard computer program which prompted them to make a series of choices represented by icons. By going through this process, users reenacted the ritual sequence laid out in the Egyptian Book of the Dead in order to discover their double, who in turn would lead them to everlasting life.Katherine Cook. \\"Is Art At Death's Door?: Blurring the Line between Illusion and Reality\\", VOX Magazine: Contemporary Art and Culture (San Francisco, 1991), 10-11.Meredith Tromble. \\"60s Redux\\" West Coast Weekend (segment Roving Painterly Eye) (March 23, 1991).David Skarjune. \\"Off the Shelf and On-Line (at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, September 12-November 21)\\" Artpaper, (November 1992), 20.Nancy Princenthal.

In 1993 Sonya Rapoport produced Sexual Jealousy: The Shadow of Love as an interactive installation at the Fourth International Symposium on Electronic Art in Minneapolis. In this participatory artwork she combined a Gamelan-inspired algorithmic multi-channel musical composition by Michael McNabb, with images from Aubrey Beardsley, Indonesian shadow puppets, and Jungian mythological symbols in a computer assisted interactive installation wherein participants explored their feelings of sexual jealousy and methods of coming to terms with these feelings. Rapoport designed a \\"Self-help\\" HyperCard software package in which the user became a protagonist in a shadow play. The user's choices generated lessons in coping, using clips from the soap opera, The Young and the Restless. The personal emotional subjective states of individual users were linked to symbolic psychological representations. These in turn became the components of a narrative of self-discovery and revelation which subsequently controlled the generation of music.Greg Garvey: Leonardo Electronic Almanac December (1993)\\"Sexual Jealously: The Shadow of Love\\" Words on Works, ed. Judy Malloy, Leonardo, Vol. 27, No. 1, 1994) 16-17. The Garden of Brutal Myth (1996) From 1993 to 1996 Rapoport produced, in several phases, The Transgenic Bagel, an interactive computer-assisted artwork, with a gene splicing theme. Participants were invited to gamble for the \\"splice of life\\" in the \\"Bagel Casino\\". Traits were extracted from mythological animals residing in Noah's \\"Virtual Ark\\". The \\"winning\\" trait gene was processed and injected into a section of a bagel (bagel fragment DNA). Participants could accept the gene by eating the recombinant transgenic bagel, or they could trade the trait.\\"Transgenic bagels and neurotic genes\\", Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 15, January (1997), 1.Stephen Wilson, Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2002), 107.Frank Popper, From Technological to Virtual Art (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2007), 69-75. 1995 saw the production of \\"Smell Your Destiny\\", another parodic interactive web art project much in the same vein as \\"The Transgenic Bagel\\". In this artwork, Rapoport posited that traits historically considered undesirable are now considered more desirable. For example, aggressiveness and competitiveness were once considered negative traits when displayed by women, but now such traits are seen as a key to success in the corporate environment. Rapoport proposed that these new values and traits might be administered to a population by means of aromatherapy. She introduced the idea that pharmaceutical pills that carried specific favorable traits could be fed to fish living near or within a given society. After consuming the pills, the fish would give off a \\"stink\\" that would permeate the air and be inhaled by the inhabitants of the surrounding community, thus transmitting the desired traits / societal values to its citizens. This process was historically specific, in that pills fed to fish in the Qumran region in 150 BCE would have been different from those fed to fish today. This piece displayed Rapoport's characteristic love of word play...for instance, the names of the pills given to the fish were all puns of common over-the-counter products, e.g. \\"Anvil\\" (for Advil), All-to-rest (for Allerest), Chums (for Tums), My-Thrill (for NyQuil), Contract (for Contac), No-mor-fussin (for Robitussin), and Re-lax (for Ex-Lax), etc.Sonya Rapoport. \\"Smell Your Destiny\\",Leonardo, Vol. 37, No. 3, (2004) 182-186.Dena Elisabeth Eber. \\"Smell Your Destiny\\" (Review), Intelligent Agent, Vol. 1, No. 4, July/August 1996.\\"Smell Your Destiny\\" (Review), Leonardo, Vol. 28, No. 5, (1995), 480. From 1996 onward, Rapoport created artworks specifically as websites in which she exhibited an interest in liberal feminist issues. In 1996 she created \\"Brutal Myths\\" with collaborator Marie-Jose Sat. \\"Brutal Myths\\" was inspired by the sadistic male fantasies about women as found in the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches), a manual for witch-hunting written by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger in the 15th century. Because women were traditionally the lay healers of their societies and used ancient herbs in their medicinal practices, Rapoport used representations of herbs as the metaphoric interface of the web artwork. The first section of \\"Brutal Myths\\" describes the \\"evil\\" herbs that contaminated the minds of men and made them believe in the dictums laid forth in the Malleus Malificarum. In the second section, the participant \\"plants\\" a \\"blissful\\" herbal garden of ‚Äúblessed‚Äù herbs. By participating in interactive rituals with the herbs the viewer destroys the prejudicial myths about women and assuages the fears of the men.Anne de Haanby. \\"The Vagina is the Boss on the Internet: New Female Media Artists Inspired by Erotics, Identity and Social Interaction\\", (1997), Rhizome Raw, June, (1997). \\"Make Me A Man\\" (1997) marked a change in Rapoport's voice as an artist wherein she adopted the theoretical standpoint of a man, a voice which she carried through works of the next few years. The artwork reflected on what Rapoport saw as \\"the stereotype of modern manhood\\" and reflected on the way that stereotype has been sustained by cultures as diverse as those of Western Europe and the New Guinea Highlands. Both of these cultures acknowledge the superiority of the physiological woman, said to be born with all the vital organs and fluids necessary for giving birth and nurturing an infant. This is contrasted to men who must be molded by the society to conform to an \\"Ideal\\" masculinity. Both cultures have a similar gender dogma. Comparative examples of how tribal or technological societies achieve their objective of \\"growing a man\\" provide the structure of the work.Dena Elisabeth Eber. \\"Make Me A Man\\" (Review), Intelligent Agent, Vol. 2, No. 4, July/August 1997.\\"Net Works\\", Leonardo, Vol. 31, No. 5. (1998), 467. \\"Arbor Erecta: A Botanical Concept For Masculinity\\" (1998) continued Rapoport's exploration of narrative from the male perspective. This artwork centered around the ethos of the 159 CE. Greek physician Galen who declared \\"God created plants as a provision for the health of human beings, and left a sign on them ‚Äì some feature of their shape, color, habitat or behavior‚Äìfor human beings to decipher.\\" For example, Galen pointed to a plant shaped like an ear that was used as a cure for ear-aches. The artwork fancifully interweaves a news story about \\"James\\" (a transsexual person who underwent surgery to change from female to male) with representations of the New Guinea initiation rite of \\"tree bonding\\". In the artwork, as James grows from his female body into that of a male, he re-enacts certain New Guinean tribal rituals that purported to purge the female pollutants acquired from the mother from the body of the initiated man.David Stairs. \\"ART+BIO\\", Leonardo, Vol. 31, No. 4, (1998), 267. In 1998-99, strongly influenced by the book \\"Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish Man\\" by Daniel Boyarin,Daniel Boyarin. Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish Man (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997) Rapoport created \\"Make Me A Jewish Man: An Alternative Masculinity\\", which she described as exploring the paradox of rabbinic masculinity. In this, the rabbinic male seeks to usurp for himself the female's characteristics, while at the same time, coupling these acquired feminine aspects with his dominant role as a male. This practice is what leads to the marginalization and exclusion of women. Although appropriations of \\"femaleness\\" are necessary in the production of the Jewish male \\"Ideal\\", strong gender biases are associated with both the blood of circumcision (which is associated with power) and the blood of childbirth (associated with impurity). Rapoport's project addressed the question of a reversal of female penis envy, that is, how do men cope with the envy of birthing and nurturing? Her main goal was to provide an explanation for male \\"coping mechanisms\\" as related to male appropriations of \\"femaleness,\\" under Talmudic Law in the year 400 CE. A secondary theme was the developing metaphor of the morphology of the Olive Tree for which the Lord named Israel. During interactive interruptions in the narrative, Olive Oyl, wife of macho Popeye, provided the feminist voice which objected to the gender imbalance of the material. For her research on the cultivation of olives, Rapoport used material from her daughter Hava Rapoport's chapter in the book \\"El Cultivo del Olivo\\".D. Barranco. \\"Botanica y Morfologia\\", El Cultivo del Olivo, (Madrid: Ediciones Mundi-Prensa, 1998), 37-60. 2000s This work was followed by \\"Redeeming the Gene, Molding the Golem, Folding the Protein\\" in 2002. Returning to the feminist voice Rapoport created a mythic parody designed to be viewed on the Internet. In it, she wanted to challenge the current genetic engineering technology by creating an artificial anthropoid, the Golem, according to the ancient Hebraic ritual directions given in the Kabbalah. In the story, Lilith and Eve, maligned sources of female evil for many years reinvented themselves by creating an ethical gene that they used to mold the Golem. The \\"Kabbalah gene\\", displaced the \\"artist's gene\\" that Eduardo Kac invented in his artwork, \\"Genesis.\\"Ernestine Daubner, \\"Manipulating Genetic Identities: The Creation of Chimeras, Cyborgs and (Cyber Golems), Eduardo Kac and Sonya Rapoport\\", Parachute 105: Autofictions (National Museum of Canada, 2002), 84-91.Sonya Rapoport. \\"Reencontrando, redimindo o gene, moldando o golem, dobrando a prote√≠na\\", In Vitro, in vivo, in silicio: ensaios sobre a rela√ß√£o entre arte, ci√™ncia, tecnologia e o sagrado, Trans. Adauto Villela, (S√£o Paulo: cnpq/pronex, 2007), 321-336. In 2004, Rapoport produced \\"Kabbalah/Kabul: Sending Emanations to the Aliens\\". This work, another interactive web artwork concerned with the transmission of traits, opened with an image of a US helicopter carrying the Kabbalah‚Äôs major icon, the Tree of Life, whose branches are marked with altruistic \\"emanations\\". This time, Rapoport proposed that encoded altruistic traits could be transmitted across interstellar space by radio or laser signals. When the participant selects an emanation by clicking on its icon, an associated image of a stem cell within a cell cluster differentiates (lights up and changes into) a body part. The selected cell is eventually enhanced with a DNA altruistic trait in preparation for delivery to the extraterrestrials. Participants absorb the altruism(s) into their psyches as the messages are catapulted from earth into outer space. \\"Kabbalah/Kabul\\" endeavors to integrate the infinite outer universe with the altruistic universe that resides within each person on Earth.Sonya Rapoport. \\"Kabbalah/Kabul\\", 4th International Symposium of Interactive Media Design (Yeditepe University Visual Communications Design Department), (Istanbul: Yeditepe University Press, April 28‚Äì30, 2006), 211. \\"(in)AUTHENTIC: Woman, War, Jew\\" (2007) was created as a \\"Memory Theatre\\" in collaboration with Robert Edgar. The work exists as an interactive website that builds itself while the viewer watches. Memory Theatres were first formulated in the 16th century by Giulio Camillo as a way to sense the structure of the cosmos through painting, text and architecture. in the artwork, Rapoport reflects upon her own cosmos of gender, race, science, and mythology in the artwork. Images used include those of various military tanks, African hairstyles mitochondria and Jungian mythological images. These were accompanied by audio recordings consisting of an imaginary contentious dialogue between Luce Irigaray, Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the \\"play\\" these voices trigger an invasion of robotic tank warfare into the cosmology of Rapoport‚Äôs persona. The concept of theatre in this work takes on two meanings: in once sense it refers to a theatre of memory; in another sense it refers to a theatre of war. Within these co-extensive theatres, an army tank, a phallic metaphor, moves between what Rapoport considers authentic and what is inauthentic as found in the aggressive environments of gender, war and religion.Sonya Rapoport, \\"(in)Authentic: Woman, War, Jew\\", In Transition Russia 2008, Ed. Helene Black, (2008), 122-133, 196. 2010s A retrospective exhibition of Rapoport's work, \\"Sonya Rapoport: Pairings and Polarities\\" was held at the Kala Institute from 4 March to 9 April 2011. Another retrospective of her work is planned for the Mills College Art Museum in January 2012. In 2013 the collage, video, and interactive installation \\"ImPOSSIBLE CONVERSATIONS?\\" was shown at the Fresno Museum of Art alongside Rapoport's early \\"Pattern and Design\\" paintings from the 1960s. In 2014 the archives of her life's work were accepted at the Bancroft Library of Western Americana at UC Berkeley.  Legacy  The Sonya Rapoport Legacy Trust was established and endowed during Rapoport's lifetime to preserve her work and to broaden its critical and historical recognition. The trust supports her legacy through a variety of initiatives including exhibitions, loans of artworks, research, publications, conservation, and educational programs for the public and the scholarly community. It also maintains a collection of Rapoport's artwork in a variety of media and encourages collaborative projects with artists, writers, and scientists in recognition of Rapoport‚Äôs unique methodology. Study of the Sonya Rapoport Papers at the Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley is also encouraged.

It is the first example of an RNA expressed on one chromosome that has been found to influence transcription on another chromosome.  Gene and transcribed RNA product  The HOTAIR gene contains 6,232 bp and encodes 2.2 kb long noncoding RNA molecule, which controls gene expression. Its source DNA is located within a HOXC gene cluster. It is shuttled from chromosome 12 to chromosome 2 by the Suz-Twelve protein.  Function  The 5‚Ä≤ end of HOTAIR interacts with a Polycomb-group protein Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and as a result regulates chromatin state. It is required for gene-silencing of the HOXD locus by PRC2. The 3‚Ä≤ end of HOTAIR interacts with the histone demethylase LSD1. It is an important factor in the epigenetic differentiation of skin over the surface of the body. Skin from various anatomical positions is distinct, e.g. the skin of the eyelid differs markedly from that on the sole of the foot.  Clinical significance  HOTAIR is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancers. High levels of expression in primary breast tumours are a significant predictor of subsequent metastasis and death. This is partially due to HOTAIR-mediated overexpression of the HER2 oncogene through sequestration of miR-331-3p, which is a negative regulator of HER2 expression. In cells, especially those that over express PRC2, the prevention of HOTAIR expression leads to a reduction in invasive potential of that cell. It is also involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

During Japanese occupation, he was a prominent figure in the secret police of the collaborationist regime.  Early life  Born in Changde, in Hunan Province, Ding was initially a member of the Chinese Communist Party, but later became a Kuomintang politician active in Shanghai. Career He rapidly rose within the Kuomintang hierarchy with the support of the so-called \\"Central Club Clique\\" led by Chen Lifu and by 1934 chaired the Research and Statistics Department, which was a cover for the Kuomintang secret police. However, when forced out of power due to numerous corruption scandals in a reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1938, he defected to the Japanese side along with Li Shiqun. Under the direction of Japanese spymaster Kenji Doihara, the two worked to create an intelligence and secret police security service, which was founded in April 1939 and whose headquarters was located at 76 Jessfield Road in Shanghai. This address contained holding cells, where suspected Communists and Kuomintang prisoners could be interrogated and executed. Under the collaborationist Reorganized National Government of China led by Wang Jingwei Ding served in the Central Political Committee, the Military Committee, and the Executive Yuan of the Reorganized National Government. He later held the cabinet-level posts as Minister of Society and Minister of Transport in the Reorganized National Government and served at one point as governor of Zhejiang Province. On December 21, 1939 he escaped an assassination attempt involving Zheng Pingru. Arrest and death Following the surrender of Japan and the collapse of the Reorganized National Government of China, Ding was arrested in September 1945 and charged with treason. During his trial, he pleaded that he had been serving with the Nanjing regime as a spy under the orders of Dai Li, the commander of Kuomintang secret service. He was convicted in February 1947 and executed in prison in Suzhou, Republic of China, on July 5, 1947.  References  Ritter, Mana. Forgotten Ally: China's World War II, 1937‚Äì1945.

He is the son of former MLB player and hitting coach Mickey Brantley. After he starred for Central High School in Fort Pierce, Florida, the Milwaukee Brewers selected Brantley in the 2005 MLB Draft. During the 2008 season, Brantley was traded to the Cleveland Indians along with other prospects for CC Sabathia. He made his MLB debut with the Indians in 2009. In 2014, Brantley was named an MLB All-Star and won the Silver Slugger Award. Early life Brantley was born in Bellevue, Washington. His father, Mickey Brantley, played in Major League Baseball (MLB), and was a member of the Seattle Mariners at the time Michael was born. Michael was raised in Port St. Lucie, Florida. Starting at age seven, Brantley played in Southwestern Port St. Lucie Little League Baseball. When Mickey worked as the hitting coach for the New York Mets in 1999, Michael got to spend time around the Mets. Brantley attended Central High School in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he played for the baseball and golf teams. In his senior year for the baseball team, he had a .595 batting average, scored 22 runs, and recorded 12 runs batted in and 32 stolen bases. After being drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers out of high school, Brantley gave up his National Letter of Intent to play college baseball for the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. Professional career Milwaukee Brewers The Milwaukee Brewers selected Brantley in the seventh round, with the 205th overall selection, of the 2005 MLB Draft. After he signed with the Brewers, Brantley played for their Rookie-level affiliates, the Helena Brewers of the Pioneer League and Arizona Brewers of the Arizona League. He batted .347 with 14 stolen bases in 44 games for Arizona, and .324 in 10 games for Helena. The Brewers assigned Brantley to the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2006. He batted .300 with 24 stolen bases in 108 games for West Virginia. In 2007, Brantley began the season with West Virginia. After batting .335 in 56 games, the Brewers promoted Brantley to the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA Southern League, where he batted .251 in 59 games. Playing for Huntsville in 2008, Brantley had a .319 batting average with four home runs, 40 RBIs, and 28 stolen bases. Cleveland Indians The Brewers traded Brantley to the Cleveland Indians on October 3, 2008, as the player to be named later (PTBNL) in the July 7 transaction where the Brewers acquired CC Sabathia for Matt LaPorta, Zach Jackson, and Rob Bryson. The list of choices for the PTBNL was narrowed down to Brantley and Taylor Green. The Indians and Brewers agreed that if the Brewers reached the 2008 MLB postseason, the Indians could make the choice. Since the Brewers made the playoffs, the Indians got to choose, and they chose Brantley. Brantley in 2011 Brantley played for the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League in 2009. He hit .267 for the Clippers. When major league rosters expanded on September 1, the Indians promoted Brantley to the major leagues. Brantley reached base safely in his first eight games. Near the end of the 2009 season, he replaced the injured Grady Sizemore in center field. In his time there, he hit .313 with 11 RBIs in 28 games. Due to an injury to Russell Branyan, Brantley opened the 2010 season with Cleveland, starting in left field on Opening Day. When the Indians activated Branyan on April 19, Brantley, who had batted 5-for-32, was optioned to Columbus. Brantley batted .315 in 59 games for Columbus, and was recalled to the major leagues on July 4 after an injury to Shin-Soo Choo. After batting 11-for-70 with one home run in 26 games in his second stint with the 2010 Indians, he was demoted to Columbus on July 27 to make room for Josh Tomlin. Manager Manny Acta said that Brantley would soon be back in Cleveland, and he was recalled to Cleveland on August 6, as the Indians' leadoff hitter. He batted .292 for the remainder of the season, and finished the season with a .242 batting average. In 2011, Brantley batted .266 in 114 games. He hit seven home runs, recorded 46 RBIs, and stole 13 bases. After missing time due to tendinitis in his right wrist, Brantley's season ended prematurely when he required surgery on the hamate bone in his right hand in August. In 2012, Brantley shifted to center field to replace the injured Grady Sizemore. He had a career-high 22-game hitting streak. Brantley has a patient approach to the plate that is followed by a short, compact swing. He rarely swings at the first pitch and will only do so if he has guessed the right location and type of pitch. In 2012, he was given the nickname \\"Dr. Smooth\\" by Cleveland Indians sports writer Dennis Manoloff for his smooth swing and approach at the plate. In 144 games, he batted .288 with a .348 on-base percentage, .402 slugging percentage, 37 doubles, and 60 RBIs: all setting new career highs. After the 2012 season, Brantley had surgery to correct a sports hernia. Before the 2013 season, the Indians signed center fielder Michael Bourn as a free agent, and moved Brantley back to left field. The Indians discussed a contract extension with Brantley's representatives, but talks ended when the season began. In August 2013, Brantley set a new Indians' franchise record for games without an error by an outfielder with 213, passing Rocky Colavito. Brantley had a break-through season in 2013, batting .284 with 158 hits, 10 home runs, 73 RBIs, and 17 stolen bases. His errorless streak reached 245 at the end of the season. Brantley was eligible for salary arbitration before the 2014 season. Rather than going through with arbitration, the Indians signed Brantley to a four-year contract extension worth $25 million, with an option for a fifth season valued at $11 million and a $3.5 million signing bonus. Brantley was selected to appear in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game after hitting .322 with 15 home runs and 63 RBIs during the first half of the season. On the final game of his 2014 season he picked up his 200th hit of the season making him the 18th player in Indians history to do so and first since Kenny Lofton reached the milestone in 1996. He batted .327/.385/.506 with a career-high 20 home runs in 2014. After the season, Brantley won the Silver Slugger Award. He was named a finalist for the 2014 American League Most Valuable Player Award and finished in third place in the balloting, behind winner Mike Trout and Victor Mart√≠nez. In 2015, Brantley batted .310/.379/.480 with 15 home runs, led the majors in doubles (45), and had the lowest strikeout percentage of all major league baseball players (8.6%). He also led the major leagues in walks-per-strikeout at 1.18, and had the highest contact percentage on his swings in the major leagues (92.6%). Brantley underwent shoulder surgery in the off-season, but returned to the Indians in April. By August, it was clear that a second surgery would be necessary, ending his season. In 2016, in 36 at bats he hit .231/.279/.282/. On August 9, 2017, Brantley was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a right ankle strain. In 2017 he batted .299/.357/.444 with 9 home runs.

The faculty comprises approximately 300 students from 18 countries including Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Nauru, The Solomon Islands, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. All of these countries are in or close to the Caribbean except The Solomon Islands, Nauru and Vanuatu, which are all located in the Pacific. Also the students of this school are mostly from anglophone countries with the exception of Belize (which shares borders with Mexico and Guatemala) and Ecuador where Spanish is spoken natively, and Haiti where French and French Creole are the dominant languages. The school is currently under the jurisdiction of two leaders: Irma Martinez Silva, the Directora of the premedical programme and Nadia Macias Hernandez, the Decana of the medical programme  Grouping system  The school currently comprises nine different groups and four advances. Each advance is defined by the level of Spanish known upon entry of the school. The first advance is composed of group seven and contains 34 students from Belize, Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia and Suriname. This group is considered to speak the most fluent Spanish in the school although a few grammatical errors still exist among those who had very little exposure to Spanish in their respective countries. Also this group is known to have exposure to variants of Spanish spoken by Cubans, Nicaraguans, Bolivians, Ecuadorians, Argentinians and other countries. This group has recently matriculated into the school oef medicine. The second advance is composed of groups one to six and contains students from Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Nauru, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Suriname. This group is considered to speak a fair amount of Spanish that allows them to communicate with most persons within the community and to communicate fluently enough with their respective teachers. These students are a part of the premedical school. The third advance is composed of group eight and contains students from Haiti and The Solomon Islands. The students of this group arrived in the month of March 2008 with little or almost no knowledge of Spanish. This group speaks Spanish sufficiently enough to communicate and have conversation with other Spanish speakers but they do not possess a large dominion over the language. These students are a part of the premedical school The fourth advance is the newest advance of the school and contains students from The Bahamas, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu. These students arrived in late August and September 2008 and will begin classes shortly in the premedical school.  Languages  Because of the variety of countries present in this school, there are many languages spoken. Among those are: English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Javanese, Hindi, Nauruan and various creoles such as Bajan, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Creole, French Creole, Guyanese Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Pidgin and Sranan Tongo (A creole language spoken in Suriname). There is also a small presence of Maroon languages spoken in Suriname such as Ndyuka.  Culture and lifestyle  The students of ELAM10 have somewhat developed a culture of their own, which includes a rich mixture of cultures worldwide with a Caribbean base.  Living conditions  The boarding house of the school, which is annexed to the actual school by a bridge of sorts, consists of 28 available dormitories, each containing 8 bunk beds and thus housing 16 persons in each room. The school, therefore has enough capacity high enough for 448 students. This value excludes 4 rooms which are currently used by the ancillary staff of the school and also a separate section reserved for teachers. These rooms are divided into sections. The males dormitory has sections V1 to V4 and the females dormitory has sections from H2 to H4. Each section contains 4 rooms and a large communal bathroom which has seven toilets, six shower stalls, a large wash sink with six taps and a smaller wash sink with three taps. There are also several recreational areas on the campus. These include a tranquil, nicely shaded park in the front of the school with large poinciana trees used as an area for study and also for worship by various students. There are several sporting areas as well. These include 2 basketball courts, a volleyball court, and a sand area used to practice various sports such as beach football, beach volleyball and also for traditional games played by the students. There is also a driveway of approximately 120 metres used for athletic activity. There are also several useful facilities on the campus such as a washroom, a general dining room and a nurses bay. Also, there are intranet facilities with highly restricted internet in each classroom where students have the opportunity to communicate with family and persons from other schools using email addresses given to them by the school.

Mountaindale changed drastically in character from a rural farming hamlet, beginning with the arrival of the New York, Ontario & Western Railroad, and the name change of the local post office, in December 1880, from Sandburg(h) to Mountain Dale. Around that time a number of farmhouses that were more hotels than farms opened, and beginning in 1899 the ethnic character of the area began to change from predominantly gentile to predominantly Jewish. By the time of the crash of 1929, several Jewish welfare organizations were engaged in resettling Jewish families whose breadwinners were unable, due to health reasons, to make a living in the New York City sweatshops, onto subsistence farms in the Mountaindale area. While good-hearted this effort may have been, in some cases it simply replaced urban poverty with an even more extreme form of rural poverty. Helen Brown, principal of Mountaindale High School in 1931, told stories of children being sewn into their long underwear in October to be cut out in April, and one particularly poignant story of a young man who played on Mountaindale High School's basketball team who broke a leg going up for a rebound when her husband had taken them to New York City to scrimmage the Columbia freshmen. The broken leg simply did not heal. Ultimately, it was discovered that the young man's diet at home did not contain any of the necessary nutrients‚Äîin fact, it consisted of little more than flour and water. Discovering that the poverty in the homes of most of the basketball players was equally dire, they undertook the practice of feeding the basketball team each Friday evening at their home in Liberty.http://www.betweenthelakes.com/NY/sullivan/mountaindale/mountaindale_basketball.htm The hamlet is also famous for the \\"Yeshiva Zichron Mayir of Mountaindale\\", a school founded by Rabbi Yehuda Davishttp://personal.stevens.edu/~llevine/rav_yehudah_davis_v12.pdf in 1960 in Brooklyn, NY. The school was moved to Mountaindale in 1974, and passed down to Rabbi Rothenberg, who died in early 2013. Mountaindale came within hours of hosting Bach to Rock Festival a concert intended to rival Woodstock in both scope and size. For the month of August in 1970 the hamlet played host to over 50,000 hippies until a court order halted the concert less than one day before it was to open. The Hebrew Congregation of Mountaindale Synagogue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Leadership Chris Stone serves as Chair and President, Maija Arbolino serves as Member and Treasurer, and A. Nicole Campbell serves as Member and Secretary of AOSI. Lawsuit In September 2005, AOSI sued the United States Agency for International Development and other U.S. Government agencies in response to the government extending an anti-prostitution pledge that was a component of HIV/AIDS policy during the George W. Bush administration to cover non-profit organizations based in the United States. The pledge required recipients of funding under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act to state that they had a policy opposing prostitution and prohibited them from engaging in speech or activity the government deemed inconsistent with an anti-prostitution policy. The requirement covered recipient organizations as a whole, and therefore restricted speech or activity that took place outside the government-funded program and was paid for with entirely private funds. OSI Sues USAID over Dangerous Public Health Policy As described by the online magazine Medical News Today: > At issue in the case is a requirement that public health groups receiving > U.S. funds pledge their \\"opposition to prostitution\\" in order to continue > their life-saving HIV prevention work.

The February 2007 ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution through affiliate organizations that did not receive federal funding.US Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in DKT v.

USAID Questions and Answers About the August 8, 2008 Ruling Granting InterAction and Global Health Council a Preliminary Injunction In May 2006, Judge Victor Marrero, a federal judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from requiring AOSI and Pathfinder International to sign the anti- prostitution pledge. The government appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. During the oral argument in the case, the government stated that it intended to issue regulations that would allow legally and physically separate affiliates of recipient organizations to engage in the prohibited speech. The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Court of Appeals returned the case for trial to the District Court for reconsideration in light of the new guidelines but left the injunction in place. USAID v. AOSI Timeline. Retrieved 21 November 2013. In August 2008, the district court held that the new guidelines did not cure the constitutional problems with the requirement. The government appealed again to the Second Circuit. While the appeal was pending, the government again revised the affiliate guidelines. In July 2011, the Second Circuit held that the requirement was unconstitutional and that the new affiliate guidelines did not cure the violation. The Supreme Court granted review in January 2013. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc. that the requirement was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court explained that the requirement would \\"plainly violate the First Amendment\\" if ‚Äúenacted as a direct regulation of speech,‚Äù and that the question in the case was whether the government could ‚Äúnonetheless impose that requirement as a condition on the receipt of federal funds.‚Äù The Court noted that it had previously struck down ‚Äúconditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.‚Äù The Court concluded that the requirement was just such a condition because it ‚Äúcompel[led] as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program,‚Äù and therefore that the requirement violated the First Amendment. The decision is significant for its holdings on the scope of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and it is likely to have continuing importance for evaluating the constitutionality of government attempts to restrict speech by recipients of government funding.

The Vanneau was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a pilot and student in tandem under a long glazed canopy. It had a retractable tailwheel landing gear and the prototype was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12X inline engine. The production MS.472 was powered by a Gnome- Rh√¥ne 14M-05 14-cylinder radial engine and first flew on 12 December 1945, with deliveries to the French Air Force starting in December 1946. From December 1947 the French Navy received 70 of the MS.474 variant modified for carrier operations. A re-engined version the MS.475 was produced from 1950 which had minor differences but was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 V-12 engine. One MS.475 was modified as the MS.476 with an increase in wing surface area and another MS.475 was fitted with a Renault 12S-02 engine as the MS.477 in 1950. A proposed variant was the MS.478 which was to be fitted with an Isotta Fraschini Delta engine but was not built.

It was built for the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, and like most buildings from that Exposition it features Mission Revival Style architecture. It acquired its current name, \\"House of Charm\\", during the park's second Exposition held in 1935-36. It now houses the San Diego Art Institute and the Mingei International Museum as well as rehearsal space for the Old Globe Theatre. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Panama- California Exposition, 1915-1916 San Diego staged the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal and to call attention to the fact that San Diego would be the first American port of call north of the Panama Canal on the Pacific coast. In 1910 San Diego had a population of 39,578, San Diego County 61,665, Los Angeles 319,198, and San Francisco 416,912. San Diego's scant population made it the smallest city ever to attempt holding an international exposition. However, the Exposition was a huge success and was extended for a second year.\\"The San Diego Historical Society.\\". Panama-California Exposition 1915-1916.Retrieved on September 5, 2008. The building now known as the House of Charm was originally named the Mining Building, intended to showcase the mineral wealth and abundance of the region of San Diego.\\"The San Diego Historical Society.\\". History of the Indian Arts / House of Charm Building, by Richard Amero. Retrieved on September 5, 2008. Another temporary name was the \\"Arts and Crafts Building,\\" but by the time the fair opened in 1915 the building was called the \\"Indian Arts Building.\\" When the fair was extended to 1916, the exhibits changed and the building was once again renamed, this time to the \\"Russia and Brazil Building.\\" From 1917 to 1922 it was known as the \\"Science of Man Building\\" and housed specimens, casts, statues, and photographs illustrating the development of the human species. It was later used for refreshment stands and flower shows. Bertram Goodhue, master architect of the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, had urged that the temporary buildings on Balboa Park's main avenue, El Prado, be torn down. However, San Diego's citizens scorned this advice. With the assistance of money from the federal government, they patched up the plaster palaces in 1922 and 1933. This meant that the most of the original buildings were available for re-use in the second exposition in 1935. California Pacific International Exposition: 1935-1936 The California- Pacific International Exposition used many of the Mission Revival Style buildings remaining from the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition, including the Science of Man Building. During the 1935-36 exhibition the building was renamed the House of Charm, by which name it is still known today. During 1935 it housed commercial concessions devoted to women's clothing, jewelry, hosiery, shoes, cosmetics and perfumes, as well as a drug store and refreshment stand. In 1936 the name was changed again to Palace of International Arts, featuring gems and artifacts from all over the world, some for sale and some for exhibit. Later use Although there were ongoing doubts about the soundness of the building, which was not intended to be a permanent structure, it continued to be used during the 1940s and 1950s. Tenants included the Model Railroad Museum, the San Diego Hall of Champions, and the San Diego Men's Art Club (forerunner of the San Diego Art Institute). In 1978 the building was condemned as unsafe and was temporarily evacuated, but the San Diego Art Institute moved back in after sprinklers were installed. During the 1980s various tenants competed for use of the building, but none could afford the necessary renovations. Finally in 1989 the city of San Diego decided to tear down and rebuild the House of Charm, along with the House of Hospitality which was in similar disrepair. The recreated House of Charm building was reopened on September 21, 1996, with external features carefully duplicating the original highly ornamented exterior. The building now houses the San Diego Art Institute, the Mingei International Museum, and rehearsal space for the Old Globe Theatre. Museum of the Living Artist (MoLA) The San Diego Art Institute's (SDAI) Museum of the Living Artist (MoLA) has a gallery in the House of Charm, featuring works by San Diego artists. A new exhibit opens every four to six weeks. Solo artist exhibitions are also featured. With more than 30 shows a year, SDAI aims to be a supportive center for local emerging artists. The Institute also offers many outreach and educational programs. The David Fleet Young Artists' Gallery showcases art done by students at regional elementary, middle and high schools, while the Outreach through Exhibition Series calls upon artists to address community issues in their art. Mingei International Museum Mingei International Museum reveals the beauty of use in folk art, craft and design from all eras and cultures of the world. The word mingei, meaning 'art of the people,' was coined by the Japanese scholar S≈çetsu Yanagi by combining the Japanese words for all people (min) and art (gei). Yanagi's teachings awakened people to the essential need to make and use objects that are unfragmented expressions of head, heart and hands. Established in 1978, Mingei International Museum collects, conserves and exhibits these arts of daily use - by anonymous craftsmen of ancient times, from traditional cultures of past and present and by historical and contemporary designers.

The character was created by Rob Thomas, Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah, with later developments by Rebecca Sinclair, and occasional input from McCord. During early stages of production, Naomi was largely described as a privileged and popular socialite & West Beverly High's Queen Bee. Prior to the series' premiere, Sachs and Judah would further develop Naomi into an antiheroine with a number of flaws, virtues, and familial issues. In the second season, Sinclair, the new show-runner, maintained the previous developments but presented a more comedic take on the character. McCord has expressed fondness for the multi-faceted nature of the role, citing it as a factor in her decision to accept the part. Often regarded as the show's central figure, Naomi has received critical acclaim from the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, People magazine, and other media outlets. Reviews have praised AnnaLynne McCord's performance and the complexity of the role. Conversely, Naomi has also been a recipient of criticism, particularly during the second season. For her work in the role, McCord was nominated for a Teen Choice Award in 2009, and won a Breakthrough of the Year Award in 2010. Season 1 Creation Naomi Clark was initially developed by the series' original show-runner, Rob Thomas, who was succeeded by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah prior to the premiere. Early press releases described the character as a privileged, popular Queen Bee of West Beverly Hills High, prompting the media to draw comparisons to Kelly Taylor of Beverly Hills, 90210, the first series of the franchise which launched 90210. As production of the spin-off began, the part would become more defined, with actress AnnaLynne McCord, who received the role, labeling Naomi an intelligent girl who possessed both manipulative and sensitive sides. She further described the character as \\"kind of a chameleon\\", stating that \\"she'll be someone with the principal and then someone else with her mother and then someone else with her friend.\\" Sachs also described Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, \\"I tend to reach out to people like Clark because I can see they are putting on a facade and are not as bad as they seem. They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people.\\" The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin-off, expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity. Prior to being cast in 90210, McCord had begun building a reputation for playing vixens and antiheroines, notably via the role of Eden Lord in the FX series Nip/Tuck. After declining two offers to play Naomi, she eventually accepted in April 2008, believing that her exposure on the show would help to benefit the charities she was involved in. McCord was able to offer the creators her input on the character following her casting. Additionally, she was the second performer and the first actress to be cast. Introduction Naomi is introduced as a rich girl who attends West Beverly Hills High. Her first on-screen birthday coincides with the birth of the series, during which several aspects of the character's personality are revealed. Self-esteem is shown to be one of Naomi's biggest virtues and vices early on. When she is assigned to work with new student Annie Wilson (Shenae Grimes), she initially appears snobbish and withdrawn. Afterward, she unveils a more pleasant demeanor as the two spend time together, but also reveals an opportunistic side by attempting to plagiarize one of Annie's papers. Upon being caught, however, she becomes offended when others express doubts about her ability, and seeks to prove that she can complete the work herself. Naomi is gradually shown to have a friendly nature during her introduction, inviting Annie to her birthday party when asked to, while fidelity is revealed to be of importance to her as well. When her personal life is explored, she is shown to value her longtime boyfriend Ethan Ward (Dustin Milligan). However, her birthday party is disrupted by the news that Ethan has been unfaithful to her. Social power is also said to be a priority of Naomi's in early episodes, along with social prominence. According to Erin Silver (Jessica Stroup), who is commonly called by her surname Silver, the two were best friends until an ambitious Naomi told various people that Silver's father had cheated on her mother with a much younger woman. Progression Several of the foundations laid in the opening episodes are built upon as the series progresses. In the third episode, Naomi is traumatized by the discovery that her father is having an affair. In episode four, she is shown to maintain a close relationship with Ethan, despite their break-up, turning to him for comfort. She again reveals a friendly side when she pacifies Ethan's autistic brother. Later, she is presented with an opportunity to confront her father's mistress, and boldly does so. She and Erin Silver also take steps toward reconciliation. Afterward, Naomi schemes to save her parents' marriage, though her efforts are ultimately in vain. When her friend Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) encounters problems due to her drug habit, Naomi's good will is displayed again, as she eventually steps in and attempts to intervene. In the eighth episode, her intelligence is further hinted at when it is revealed that Naomi speaks Spanish. Though their personalities differ at times, several of Naomi's issues parallel those of Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) from the original series. Early on in the show, she values her 'in-crowd' status and experiences repeated friction with a friend over a boy (as Kelly did). When Annie begins bonding with Ethan, Naomi reveals that the situation is likely to interfere with their friendship. Annie's eventual dismissal of this statement leads to a temporary rift between the girls. Also like Kelly, Naomi endures the experience of a family torn apart by adultery, and is later faced with the matter of an absent parent, as her mother departs town unexpectedly. After her parents have officially split, Naomi seeks temporary refuge in a hotel. Later, Naomi dates a West Beverly student named Liam Court (Matt Lanter). At Naomi's after-prom party, Jen (Sara Foster), her sister, seduces Liam to get back at Naomi for defying her and holding the event at their house. Naomi catches the aftermath (sans Jen) and finds Annie's wrap with Liam, causing her to publicly accuse Annie of sleeping with him. She is last shown being comforted by Jen while police sirens are heard due to Annie reporting the underage drinking. Season 2 Impact During the initial development of 90210, the character Annie Wilson was conceived as the central role of the series. As the first season progressed, however, AnnaLynne McCord gained recognition as the show's breakout performer in the role of Naomi. Media outlets began referring to McCord as the series' lead throughout Seasons 1 and 2; the actress was also nominated for a Teen Choice Award in the category of \\"Breakout Star Female\\" in 2009. Rebecca Sinclair, the series' show-runner, had also become impressed with Naomi's portrayal. Though McCord's cast billing would remain the same in the second season, Naomi Clark was placed \\"front and center\\", largely becoming the show's central character. Several of the series' story lines in Season 2 are shown to have various ties to Naomi, including the deepening of Jen Clark's duplicity, the shaken state of Annie Wilson, and the development of a sensitive side in the character of Liam Court. In addition, Silver and Adrianna, who did not associate often in the first season, are shown to have grown closer in the second through their mutual bonds with Naomi. Shortly after the second season premiered, articles from Entertainment Weekly and MSN applauded the increased focus on McCord's character. The actress also promoted the series on Live with Regis and Kelly and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Direction At the beginning of Season 2, McCord reported that producers would be taking her character into \\"more comedic\\" territory. \\"I don't really consider myself funny, but they wanted her to go along this route, so I'm learning alongside Naomi how to be funny.\\" The actress also claimed that Naomi would continue to display an \\"ever-emerging heart,\\" and that \\"at the end of the day, she's the most loyal friend you‚Äôll have‚Äîas long as you don't screw her.\\" With regard to the character's appearance, McCord described Naomi as \\"beautiful,\\" but requested that her makeup be limited in Season 2, stating that \\"the girls who are watching the show don‚Äôt need to see a girl portraying seventeen caked up in all this makeup.\\" Story lines The second season opens on Naomi completing her final day of summer school, which she'd been forced to attend due to the underage drinking at her party. It is revealed that she, Silver, and Adrianna have formed a friendly trio during the summer. Naomi briefly dates an older man who she later discovers is married, leading her to break up with him. She is still upset at Annie and considers revenge after obtaining naked pictures of her. She hesitates to act at first, but is later encouraged to by Jen, widening the rift between her and Annie. Later, after she escapes some of Jen's influence, Naomi visits California University, and grows close to the dean's son, Richard, along with a boy named Jamie. Following the death of Silver's mother, Jackie, Naomi provides Erin with comfort. Soon afterward, Naomi learns the truth about Jen's actions on the night of the prom, creating a rift between the two. Naomi then offers Annie her apologies. Annie initially keeps her at a distance, while Liam, after much effort, is eventually given a second chance with Naomi. Later, she begins to encounter awkwardness with Liam. After clashing with Mr. Cannon (Hal Ozsan), a faculty member, Naomi falsely accuses him of sexual harassment while talking with her friends, who unexpectedly urge her to come forward with the experience. As with her attack on Annie, she initially declines to act. However, she eventually does so when Liam faces expulsion for assaulting Cannon. She is later called to testify in front of the school board, which prompts her to reveal the truth. Afterward, Naomi faces new conflicts with her sister Jen, while Liam eventually leaves Naomi upon deciding that their relationship is no longer working. While experiencing trouble with her car one evening, she seeks assistance in school and stumbles upon Mr. Cannon. He kisses Naomi repeatedly as she refuses and pushes him away, but he continues and eventually rapes her.  Season 3   Direction  In an interview with E!, McCord revealed what she expected for Naomi after she was attacked at the end of Season 2. \\"I kinda feel like there will be some downward spiral in a way for Naomi's character, but she's good at covering, so she'll still have that facade.\\" In a later interview with HollywoodLife.com, she further stated, \\"For me, it's important to let all teenagers know, and all women know, if you're violated you have to speak up.\\" The actress also expressed a personal investment in the story, having worked with victims of abuse in a real-life anti-trafficking organization. Story lines In the Season 3 premiere, it is revealed that Naomi spent the summer at a motel. She later decides to press charges against Cannon, but becomes discouraged from going through with the process. In the second episode, she gains access to her trust fund upon turning 18. Later, her friends attempt to help prove that Cannon raped her. She and Jen reconcile in the process. Eventually, Naomi and the police obtain new evidence against Cannon. However, Cannon disappears before he can be arrested. She then begins moving forward in her personal life. When she returns to her hotel room after Adrianna's Christmas party, Mr. Cannon is shown waiting for her unnoticed. He later holds both Naomi and Silver captive, though they eventually manage to subdue him and call the police. While recovering from her last encounter with Mr. Cannon, she takes up meditation, leading her to cross paths with a guru who cons her out of a large sum of money. Naomi later retrieves the money with the help of her science partner, Max (Josh Zuckerman). Naomi is shocked to find herself beginning to like Max, and they soon begin a relationship. At the end of the third season, Naomi tells Max that she is pregnant. Season 4 The fourth season begins with Naomi breaking up with Max after what she feels is his excessive relief on discovering that her pregnancy was a false positive. Attempting to make a big impression at California University (CU), Naomi buys a large house, coming into conflict with the owner's son Austin Tallridge (Justin Deeley), who had been growing marijuana on the property. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi. Vowing revenge, Naomi buys her way into the only sorority that will have her: one made up of nerds and social rejects, and becomes their president. Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin. At a talent show fundraiser for Raj (Manish Dayal), Naomi becomes obsessed with outdoing Austin's new 'girlfriend', who is really his cousin who's staying with him for the week. After surprising a clueless Max during their performance, Max breaks things off with Naomi, saying he can't be the guy who's okay with his girlfriend having feelings for someone else. Naomi and Austin then embark on a relationship. In Project Runway, Naomi is thrilled to compete in CU's fashion design competition, but her excitement quickly dies down when she finds out she's competing against nemesis Holly. The two waste no time in trying to one-up each other, with Naomi donating a large sum of money to the competition's fashion show so that her fashions can be showcased in the most flattering way. When she reveals she'll have the ab-man himself Liam, modeling her designs, Holly goes behind her back and books him through his modeling agency. But that's not all she steals; the night of the fashion show, Naomi discovers that Holly's ripped off her designs and the two end up in a full-blown fight backstage. Though neither gal wins the competition, Naomi gets an internship offer from a Hollywood event planner, and the two dueling divas decide to call a truce. Holly also wanted the internship with the influential planner, who just happens to be her mother. In O Holly Night, Naomi tries to earn her stripes as an intern, at the expense of her friendship with Holly and relationship with Austin, ultimately. Naomi tries to pull double duty both working and playing at Holly's birthday bash, though she is pretty quickly outed as the person who \\"stole\\" the internship at her mom's party planning firm. In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi is still rocking her party-planning internship under Rachel's guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him right after he came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly's mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‚ÄòNew Naomi‚Äô and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi's suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi's new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn't staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends. In Trust, Truth and Traffic, Naomi has embarked on her career as a freelance event planner, and she has even managed to spot her probable new client. Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa's party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences. Season 5 In the fifth season opener, Max proposes to Naomi after leaving his bride-to-be standing at the altar. They elope and get married. When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as he seems to be the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she will do the job. After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer. Bryce accepts the position but manages to fire Max, which was set up by Alec. He later admits to Naomi that he is in love with Max, who in the meantime has left for a gamer conference in Iceland. Naomi finds out that he had been hiding at his parents' house. The couple seeks the help of a marriage counselor. Max explains he didn't want Naomi to run his life and the counselor says that Naomi lost herself. The pair later agrees to divorce and Max decides to go back to MIT. Naomi finds her and Annie's half brother, Mark Holland (Charlie Weber), a chef who owns a gourmet food truck. After he doesn't want anything to do with her, Naomi decides to host a band and food truck contest at CU and sabotages it to let Mark win. Mark is initially upset with Naomi but agrees afterwards to open a restaurant with her after Annie talked to him. Reception Acclaim In its biographical page on McCord, Yahoo! states that via the role of Naomi, the actress \\"became one of Hollywood‚Äôs top young stars-to-watch after the series premiered to more than 5 million viewers worldwide.\\" In a review of the series premiere, Tom Gliatto of People magazine stated that, \\"The standout is AnnaLynne McCord as bad-girl Naomi Clark: She‚Äôs very striking physically‚Äîalmost startling, somewhere between Charlize Theron and Courtney Love‚Äîand she conveys a mix of high drama, meanness and little-girl self-pity that‚Äôs a lot of fun.\\" Staff members of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram found McCord's performance \\"surprisingly more nuanced\\" than her previous work as Eden Lord. The article also declared that Naomi appeared to be the most complex of the younger characters early on, labeling her a \\"popular but vulnerable but snotty but misunderstood but vindictive high-school queen.\\" Seventeen magazine called the character \\"the ultimate queen bee\\" in 2009. Following the completion of Season 1, McCord appeared on the premiere cover of Beauty Entertainment magazine, which made reference to Naomi's \\"Good Girl, Bad Girl\\" status. Shortly after the premiere of Season 2, Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly stated that the series \\"is getting better and better this season as it deliciously morphs into The AnnaLynne McCord Show\\". In a later EW review, Jennifer Armstrong labeled Naomi \\"awesome\\", and declared McCord \\"a treasure\\" in the role. In an autumn television recap, the magazine proclaimed the series' second season an improvement on the first, and remarked that, \\"Moving AnnaLynne McCord's immensely entertaining anti-heroine, Naomi, front and center certainly didn't hurt.\\" While noting 90210's continuing focus on its younger cast in 2010, E! Online stated, \\"AnnaLynne McCord, we're looking at you\\". While discussing Jennie Garth of the original series, HollywoodLife.com proclaimed McCord \\"the modern-day leading lady\\". In the midst of Season 2, the actress was labeled \\"the star of 90210\\" by Shape magazine, also appearing on the cover. In regards to the humorous aspects of the character, Emily Exton of Entertainment Weekly stated that McCord had \\"honed her comedic timing\\" in the second season. Jethro Nededog expressed similar acclaim in a review for the Los Angeles Times, in which he commented on a comically driven Naomi, and asked, \\"Is there anything better than Naomi when she knows what she wants?\\" Nededog also lauded Naomi's material in the second-season finale, citing the character's \\"movement, activity and depth.\\" While reviewing the third season, Andy Swift of HollywoodLife.com compared McCord to Joan Collins, stating that she \\"gives every scene 110 percent\\". Entertainment Weekly's Archana Ram wrote, \\"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: AnnaLynne McCord is the best part of 90210. And last night, she proved it again by giving us a glimpse of all the colors of the Naomi rainbow‚Äîbitchy, scared, confident, relieved, and more.\\" Criticism In addition to her popularity, Naomi has been the subject of criticism. In a review of the series premiere, Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter labeled Naomi \\"vapid\\" and \\"prissy\\". Further criticism arose in the later episodes of Season 2, with reviewers citing her dishonesty and insensitivity during this period. While discussing the story in which Naomi makes false accusations of sexual harassment, Entertainment Weekly's Archana Ram likened the character to her villainous sister Jen. Jethro Nededog of the LA Times also condemned Naomi's actions, but commended her for eventually revealing the truth. At a later point in the season, Lisa Todorovich of Zap2it chastised Naomi for being \\"all about herself\\" while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While acknowledging Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of MassLive.com stated that \\"it is totally consistent with her character that she would want to try to be there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, I think it makes sense that someone like Liam would think he would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality.\\" Award recognition For the role of Naomi Clark, McCord was nominated for a 2009 Teen Choice Award in the category of \\"Breakout Star Female\\". In 2010, she won a Breakthrough of the Year Award in the category of \\"Breakthrough Standout Performance\\".

Varied soft bodied organisms are locally preserved, a fauna (including Naraoia, Wiwaxia and Hallucigenia) and preservation style (carbonaceous film) normally associated with the more famous Burgess Shale. As such, the Wheeler Shale also represents a Konservat-Lagerst√§tten. Together with the Marjum Formation and lower Weeks Formation, the Wheeler Shale forms of limestone and shale exposed in one of the thickest, most fossiliferous and best exposed sequences of Middle Cambrian rocks in North America. At the type locality of Wheeler Amphitheater, House Range, Millard County, western Utah, the Wheeler Shale consists of a heterogeneous succession of highly calcareous shale, shaley limestone, mudstone and thin, flaggy limestone. The Wheeler Formation (although the Marjum & Weeks Formations are missing) extends into the Drum Mountains, northwest of the House Range where similar fossils and preservation are found. Taphonomy and sedimentology Asaphiscus wheeleri, Cambrian, Wheeler shale, Utah. Emeraldella brocki an arthropod From the Burgess Shale Detailed work recognises a number of ~10 m thick lagerst√§tten sequences in the formation, each of which formed at a sea-level high stand in deep water.

The vessel entered into the United States Navy under an agreement with Maryland for joint state and federal service during World War I as a patrol boat with identification ID-1283 from 1917 to 1918. In 1891 the schooner, part of what was then nicknamed the \\"Oyster Police Navy,\\" supported a scientific survey of southern Maryland sponsored by Johns Hopkins University, Maryland Agricultural College and the U.S. Geological Survey. The lead vessel was the force's steamer Governor P. F. Thomas with the force's schooners Daisy Archer and Folly in support. The survey's scope ranged from natural resources to archaeology. During an extreme cold period in January 1893, with Annapolis iced in and ice extending across the upper Chesapeake Bay, many of the force's schooners were frozen in ice. The force's steamers, and Governor P. F. Thomas, along with tugs broke ice keeping a narrow channel in Annapolis clear and then carried supplies and ammunition to schooners trapped in ice. Governor P. F. Thomas brought in the captain of Daisy Archer in for supplies and then returned him to the schooner in West River. Daisy Archer was acquired by the Navy from the Conservation Commission of Maryland under a contract between the state and Navy in 1917. The Fishery Force vessels operated in a dual role of state fishery enforcement and Navy patrol from August 1917 to November 1918. She was placed in service in the 5th Naval District, where she engaged in patrol and transport duties. She was returned to her owner on 27 November 1918. The vessel, along with the older Fishery Force schooners Julia Hamilton, Helen Baughman, Bessie Jones and Anna B. Smith were then sold by the Commission. See also *Julia Hamilton *Governor R. M.

Gage plays both diatonic and chromatic \\"harps,\\" as the harmonica is informally known. He is a veteran of several bands, most recently the eponymous \\"Gage,\\" and an acknowledged master of the \\"tongue switching\\" technique that modifies standard harmonica tongue blocking to create a rock- guitar effect similar to the tapping made famous by guitarist Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen. As the reviewers from Planet Harmonica stated, \\"Dave Gage puts forward a modern Rock/Heavy Metal approach rather than a bluesy one, although his style doesn't depart as radically from blues as say, John Popper's.\\" Biography Looking for a way to round out content on a website devoted to an early iteration of his band, Gage began posting harmonica tips to the web in 1997. Those tips proved popular with visitors, and Gage soon realized the utility of consolidating his web-based harmonica instruction into its own site. The result, Harmonicalessons.com, has since become the largest and most-visited web site of its kind in the world. Gage has taught harmonica to students of all levels at McCabe‚Äôs Guitar Shop, in Santa Monica, California since 1980. His television credits include bumper and theme music for shows such as Davis Rules (ABC, 1991-1992) and Adventures in Wonderland (Disney Channel, 1993-1995), as well as numerous TV and radio commercials. His film credits include harmonica playing, along with Tommy Morgan, for Without a Paddle. Gage plays many different styles of music and studied jazz improvisation with vibraphonist Charlie Shoemake, but he is most closely associated with rock. His live performances around Los Angeles, according to his own website, typically draw rave reviews. He has recorded or played with members of such bands as Devo, Black Sabbath, and The Police. Outside the recording studio and various gigs, he also worked as a product consultant for the Hohner and Lee Oskar harmonica companies. The Gage discography includes Well You Can‚Äôt Now, Can You?

It lies at an elevation of 3300 ft. about 10 m. northeast of Nevada City as the crow flies, and about 3 m. southeast of North Columbia, and 3 m. southwest of North Bloomfield. It is located at the junction of modern day North Bloomfield, Back Bone and Lake City Roads. It was an important mining and transportation center in the second half of the 19th century.  Early History  Lake City was founded in 1853 when Israel Joiner built a cabin there.Thompson, Thomas H. and West, Albert A. (1970 ed.) History of Nevada County -1880, p. 59. Two years later, a group known as the Dutch Hill Company began mining there. In 1855, the Bell Brothers built a hotel, and for a while the town was known as Bell's Ranch. In 1857, the Irwin ditch, which brought water from Poorman's Creek about 12 m. away, reached town and it began to boom as a center for hydraulic mining.Thompson and West, p. 59; Bean, Edwin F. (1867) History and Directory of Nevada County, p. 68; Selverston, Mark (2016) The French of Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park (hereafter French), p. 8. Many of the early residents were French, and French culture and language were common.French, pp. 1, 8-9. In 1858, the Eureka Lake Co., which had taken over the Irwin ditch, laid out a town, anchored by its district office. Inspired by a reservoir or \\"lake\\" the Company had built, it was named Lake City.Thompson and West, p. 59; Bean, p. 396. Politically, it was part of Bloomfield Township.Thompson and West, p. 58. That same year, the Lake City Hotel, also called the French Hotel, with a restaurant and a saloon, opened. In 1862, a third hotel, the Bordas, opened next to the French Hotel.French, pp. 8-9, 19. In addition to the hotels, the town had several stores, a tailor shop, a saw mill,The saw mill burned down in 1871. Union, July 21, 1871. In its long history, the Union has had different names, including the Grass Valley Union and the Morning Union. For simplicity's sake, it will be referred to here as the Union, regardless of its name at the time of the cited article. a canvas hose factoryFrench, p. 16. and a number of homes.Thompson and West, p. 59. Lake City had its own school and election districts. A Catholic church was consecrated in 1872.Union, June 16, 1872. The population at its heyday was estimated at about 300.Massey, P., Wilson, J., Titus, A. (2006) California Trails Northern Sierra Region, #25. By 1880, the town had been reduced to one hotel, one store, one saloon, a blacksmith shop, a livery stable and several homes.Thompson and West, pp. 59. The 1880 census counted 93 residents.Union, July 21, 1881.  Some Prominent Residents  Henry Arnold took over the Bell Brothers hotel, which burned down in 1859. He rebuilt the hotel, now called Arnold House, and held several prominent balls there.Comstock, David, Lives of Nevada County Pioneers, Henry Arnold. He also experimented with planting fruit trees on his ranch, managing to produce very large apples.Morning Transcript, Oct. 24, 1860; Nevada Gazette, Sept. 4, 1865. At times, Lake City was referred to as Arnold's Ranch.French, p. 8. Julius Poquillon, a prominent miner and engineer on the Ridge, opened the Lake City Hotel, complete with French restaurant, in 1858. Reportedly, he sold memberships in the Lake City Yacht Club.An illustration on p. 168 in Thompson and West depicts a small sailing vessel on the \\"lake\\" behind Paine's hotel. The references to a yacht club may be more lore than fact. See French, p. 63; Union, Feb. 24, 2007. In 1860, Poquillon sold his hotel to Marius Dominique and Henrietta Bremond, who renamed it Bremond House, and operated it until it burned in 1872. The family continued to operate a hotel in nearby North Bloomfield.French, p. 25. In 1866, P. A. Paine, a native of Painesville, Ohio,Assertions that Lake City was once call Painesville, or that it had a post office, are mistaken. See ie, Janicot, Michel (1994) A History of Nevada County Post Offices, pp. 30-31. When Mr. Paine moved to Nevada County, he settled in the Rough and Ready area near the Zinc House. A post office called Painesville was established in that community in 1864. Not long after Mr. Paine moved to Lake City, that post office closed. Nevada Transcript, March 2, 1864; Dec. 12, 1866.

Mr. Paine continued the successful apple orchard, once producing a pound and a half pippin.Union, Oct. 15, 1870. Francis M. Pridgeon for many years was the elected member of the county Board of Supervisors for District 3, which included much of the Ridge. In endorsing his reelection, a newspaper observed: \\"Pridgeon has been one of the best supervisors this county has ever had or ever will have.\\"Union, Sept. 26, 1894. His wife Elizabeth operated the hotel, which they took over from Mr. Paine. William and Bridget Waldron owned the town's general store and stable and had a number of other prominent positions.Union, June 27, 1872.  Fires  As with many mining communities, fire was a constant threat, and Lake City experienced several major ones. In 1859, the Bell Brothers hotel burned down. In 1868, fire destroyed the Lake House hotel, and several other buildings.Grass Valley National, June 27, 1868. In 1869, the school and blacksmith shop burned down.Union, June 26, 1869. In 1872, fire destroyed the Bremond House hotel, and several other buildings. Arson was suspected.Union, Nov. 19, 1872. In 1873, a fire \\"threatened the destruction of the town\\" but it escaped that fate.Union, Sept. 12, 1873.  School and Election Districts  Lake City had its own school district and schoolhouse and its own election district.Thompson and West, pp. 143, 146. The schoolhouse burned down in 1869.Union, June 26, 1869 In 1873, the \\"new\\" schoolhouse was described as being in \\"poor\\" condition to be replaced \\"as soon as fortune favors.\\" The school then had 32 pupils and 1 teacher.Union, Oct. 29, 1873. It had 43 students in 1880 but by 1888, the number had fallen to 20. In 1894, the school district was declared lapsed and students had to go to North Bloomfield.Union, July 17, 1894. In 1865, the Board of Supervisors established an election district at Lake City.Nevada Gazette, Sept. 1, 1865. Voting was liveliest in local elections. In the 1873 county election, 61 people voted.Union, April 14, 1873. By contrast, 16 total votes were cast in the 1880 presidential election.Union, Nov. 10, 1880. In 1892, 14 voted in a local election, and soon the Supervisors abolished the Lake City election district. Residents had to vote in North Bloomfield.Union, July 22, 1892.  Mining  The area was considered part of the North Bloomfield mining district, which was located on auriferous gravel beds which ran down the San Juan Ridge, and often branched out. One rich branch ran from N. Columbia through Lake City and on towards Red Dog and You Bet.Thompson and West, p. 59. Hydraulic mining took off with the arrival of ditch water. The principal ditch was the Eureka, which brought water from dams in the High Sierra, and channelled it to Lake City through the Irwin ditch. Principal mines were the North Star, McDonald, I XL and Ballarat.Thompson and West, pp.183-184. Following the 1884 Sawyer decision, which prohibited discharging mining debris into the Yuba River or its tributaries, hydraulic mining rapidly declined.The Sawyer decision is reported as Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Co., 18 F. 753 (CCD Cal. 1884). Soon thereafter, it was estimated that 130,000,000 yards of auriferous gravel remained to be mined.Lindgren, Waldemar (1911) The Tertiary Gravels of the Sierra Nevada of California, p. 139. In the early part of the 20th Century, there were efforts to revive hydraulic mining but most efforts were directed to drifting or quartz mining.Union, Nov. 13, 1915; April 16, 1915; March 2, 1916. Prominent were Mr. F. M. Phelps,Union, Oct. 5, 1913; Aug. 15, 1916. the El Oro Mines CompanyUnion, Jan. 6, 1915. and the Paine Brothers.Union, June 5, 1913; Oct. 5, 1913: Nov. 15, 1913. These do not appear to have succeeded.  Transportation  Taking advantage of its strategic location at the junction of the principal roads between Nevada City and many of the mining communities on the San Juan Ridge, and later on one of the roads to the Henness Pass and the Nevada mines, Lake City was an important transportation stop for travelers and teamsters.Bean, p. 396. For many years, the road to Nevada City was a toll road owned by Edwards and Manchester.Union, Aug. 24, 1874. Toll roads were usually well maintained. Had the Central Pacific determined to run the Transcontinental Railroad through the Henness Pass, the planned route would have gone through Lake City.First Annual Report And Theodore D.

Paine, Elizabeth Pridgeon, and Frank Kropp. Mr. Kropp ran it for many years into the 20th century, attracting visitors with a 13 rattle \\"monster\\" rattlesnake on display.Union, Aug. 1, 1913. In 1858, the Lake City Hotel opened. It soon became Bremond House. There is mention of a third hotel, the Bordas, open in the 1860s.French, p. 19. This may be the hotel, called the Lake House, that burned down in 1868. Grass Valley National, June 27, 1868. Lake City was a stop on the Gregory & English stage and pony express line between Nevada City and Graniteville, on the Summit City (Meadow Lake) Stage Line from Grass Valley Union, June 5, 1866. and on Dornin's Express Line between North San Juan and North Bloomfield.Bean, pp. 182, 339. It was also connected to the Ridge Telephone Company's long distance telephone line.Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_long- distance_telephone_line  Today  The town declined as hydraulic mining declined, especially after the 1884 Sawyer decision. In 1886, a local newspaper reported that \\"Lake City, like nearly all the hydraulic mining towns in this county, looks much like a deserted village.\\" Union, June 1, 1886, quoting the San Juan Times. In the last century, mining was gradually replaced by ranching and horticulture.Union, Aug. 15, 1913. In 1939, an observer reported that: ‚ÄúA picture of decay is LAKE CITY, ... where two or three decrepit houses and a forlorn hotel (1855), its balcony sagging drunkenly, huddle by the grassy depression in the pasture which was once the \\"lake.‚ÄùFederal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration of Northern California (1939) California : A Guide to the Golden State, p. 480. Today, it is a very rural outpost with a few ranches and residences and a vineyard planted about 30 years ago. There are no commercial establishments, and no readily visible remains of its historic past.

It is the 39th entry in George Abell's 1966 Abell Catalog of Planetary Nebulae (and 27th in his 1955 catalog) of 86 old planetary nebulae which either Abell or Albert George Wilson discovered before August 1955 as part of the National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. It is estimated to be about 6,800 light-years from earth and 4,600 light-years above the Galactic plane. It is almost perfectly spherical and also one of the largest known spheres with a radius of about 2.5 light-years.  Central star Its central star is slightly west of center by about 2‚Ä≥ or 0.1 light- years. This offset does not appear to be due to interaction with the interstellar medium, but instead, it is hypothesized that a small asymmetric mass ejection has accelerated the central star. The mass of the central star is estimated to be about with the material in the planetary nebula comprising an additional . This planetary nebula has a nearly uniform spherical shell. However, the eastern limb of the nebula is 50% more luminous than the western limb. Additionally, irregularities in the surface brightness are seen across the face of the shell. The source of the east‚Äìwest asymmetry is not known but it could be related to the offset of the central star. The central star is classified as a subdwarf O star.  Structure and composition The bright rim of the planetary nebula has an average thickness of about 10‚Ä≥.1 or about 0.34 light-years. There is a faint halo that extends about 18‚Ä≥ beyond the bright rim giving a complete diameter of around 190‚Ä≥ under the assumption that this emission is uniform around the planetary nebula. This planetary nebula has been expanding for an estimated 22,100 years, based on an assumed expansion velocity between 32 and 37 km/s and a 0.78 parsec radius. Background galaxies are visible near the nebula, and some can be seen through the translucent nebula. Oxygen is only about half as abundant in the nebula as it is in our own sun.

Its type and only species is Capsospongia undulata. It has a narrow base, and consists of bulging rings which get wider further up the sponge, resulting in a conical shape. Its open top was presumably used to expel water that had passed through the sponge cells and been filtered for nutrients. Like most sponges, Capsospoingia had a spicular skeleton; long spicules parallel to the growth direction formed columns which were connected by shorter lateral spicules. History Capsospongia undulata was named in 1920 by Charles Walcott as Corralia undulata. However, the name was preoccupied by Corralia Roewer, 1913, a member of Opiliones. In 1955, de Laubenfels renamed the genus Corralio, adopting an incorrect spelling of Corralia Walcott had used. In 1986 Keith Rigby established the new genus Capsospongia for it. In 2004, he and Desmond Collins described a third specimen. C. undulata intersects with the complicated taxonomic history of the anomalocarids. In 1911, Walcott had named two taxa, Peytoia and Laggania, which he interpreted as a jellyfish and a sea cucumber respectively. In 1978, Simon Conway Morris recognized that the mouthparts of Laggania closely resembled Peytoia, but erroneously concluded that this was because Laggania was a composite fossil of a Peytoia and another organism, which he concluded was a sponge and suggested was probably a specimen of C. undulata. However, it was subsequently determined that Laggania and Peytoia were partial specimens of a larger animal, a radiodont, which now bears the name Peytoia.

He studied at the College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas at El Paso (BA 1936), the Juilliard School of Music (piano, trombone and composition; graduated 1939), Yale University (MM) and the University of Rochester (PhD in composition 1942); further study took him to Harvard University (STB 1943), Princeton Theological Seminary (ThM 1949) and Oxford University (BLitt 1954). He taught at the University of Texas and at Westminster Choir College in the 1940s. In 1949 he became a faculty member at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he taught until 1987. Stevenson is well known for having studied with Igor Stravinsky when he was young, and for later being a teacher of influential minimalist La Monte Young. His major interest was within the area of Latin American music and he contributed significantly to the historical record of Spanish, Portuguese and American music. He wrote extensively on African-American music and the music of the Protestant church within the Americas. In 1978 he became founder-editor of the Inter-American Music Review; now in its thirteenth volume. His works include nearly 30 books, a vast quantity of journal articles, and a large number of encyclopedia entries. He was coordinator of American entries for the Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart supplement and wrote over 300 articles for the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

Sir Elkanah Armitage Early life He was born the third of six sons of Elkanah Armitage, a farmer and linen weaver from Failsworth, Lancashire. He left school at the age of 8 and went to work in the cotton industry, along with two of his brothers, at George Nadin & Nephews and soon rose to become manager on account of his diligence and growing shrewdness in business. Personal life In 1816 he married Mary Lomax Bowers. She died in 1836 having borne him eight children; Elkanah, Benjamin, Samuel, Joseph, John, Rebecca, Jane Ann and Mary Bowers. Armitage then married Elizabeth Kirk, daughter of Captain Henry Kirk of Chapel-en-le- Frith and had one further son Vernon. Elizabeth died on 27 July 1868. Armitage lived at Gore Hill, Pendleton Green until 1853 when he purchased Hope Hall, Pendleton, Salford.* Industrial career In the 1810s Armitage and his first wife set up in business as drapers at 18 Chapel Street, Salford, then sometime shortly after 1822 he set up a weaving manufacture business with James Thompson and by 1829 he was employing 29 workers and selling his cloths in Manchester at considerable profit. The business was so successful that he was able to build a new factory at Pendleton, Salford and eventually employed 200 people making sailcloth, ginghams and checks. By 1848, despite economic slumps he had extended Pendleton New Mill and was employing over 600. In 1867 the Armitages took over the Nassau Mills in Patricroft, Eccles. Political career Armitage became active in politics from a young age and his name appeared on the Manchester petition for the abolition of the slave trade in 1806. In 1838 Manchester was incorporated as a municipal borough, and Armitage was elected to the first town council as a Liberal councillor representing Exchange Ward. He became an alderman in 1841, and was Mayor of Manchester from 1846 to 1848. During his term of office there was a surge of support for the Chartist Movement, with the first mass meeting held in Manchester in September 1848. In 1849 he was created a Knight Bachelor by Queen Victoria for his services as mayor during the crisis of the previous year.Death of Sir Elkanah Armitage, The Times, 27 November 1876, p.6 In 1857, Armitage stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully opposing William Nathaniel Massey for the seat of Salford and in 1866 he was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire, having represented the same county also as Deputy Lieutenant before. Armitage was a lifelong friend and supporter of John Bright and the Anti-Corn Law League. He shared Bright's Pacifist stance and spoke out against the war in the Crimea, in opposition to Prime Minister Palmerston. He served for many years as Chairman of the Governors of the Manchester Grammar School and as a Governor of Manchester Royal Infirmary. He was also a Salford Police Commissioner. Death Armitage family vault, Weaste Cemetery Armitage died on 26 November 1876 at Hope Hall, Pendleton at the age of 82, his funeral procession was half a mile long and was made up of a hundred carriages. His mortal remains were laid to rest at Weaste Cemetery.

Pierre de Foix was the last surviving cardinal of the Great Western Schism and was elevated by Pisan Antipope John XXIII. Among them there were three French, two Germans, one Spaniard, one Italian and the one Hungarian. Candidates to the papacy The principal concerns in the conclave of 1458 arose from the rapid rise of the effective power and influence of the French monarchy in the closing years of the Hundred Years War, which had recently ended with the French victory. The principal Italian states ‚Äì Kingdom of Naples, Republic of Genoa and Duchy of Milan ‚Äì feared a rebirth of French interest in Italian affairs and tried to prevent the elevation of a French pope at all costs. The official candidate of the Milanese was Domenico Capranica. The campaign for his election in the pre-conclave period was so successful that it appeared almost certain that he would be elected to the papacy. But Cardinal Capranica died suddenly on August 14, 1458, two days before the beginning of the conclave, leaving his party in great confusion. Ottone de Carretto, ambassador of Milan in Rome, made the quick and unconsulted decision to support Cardinal Enea Piccolomini and managed to convince Latino Orsini, one of the most influential cardinals, to back him in this action. The principal candidate of the pro-French party was d'Estouteville. Bessarion, Torquemada and Calandrini also were considered papabile. The conclave Eighteen cardinals entered the conclave in Vatican on August 16. Initially they subscribed to the conclave capitulation, which obliged the elect to continue the crusade against the Ottoman Empire and to give more welfare to poorer cardinals.Papst Pius II@vaticanhistory.de (German) The first scrutiny took place only on August 18. Cardinals Piccolomini and Calandrini received five votes each, while none of the others obtained more than three. At this point French Cardinal d'Estouteville started an intensive simonical campaign for his own candidature. He promised the office of Vice- Chancellor to the Cardinal of Avignon and offered other bribes to the Greek cardinals. On August 18 in the evening he was certain that he would obtain at least eleven votes on the following morningG. Noel, p. 30 But the opposite Italian party also lost no time. During the night Cardinal Pietro Barbo called together all the other Italian cardinals except Prospero Colonna and proposed to them that, of them all, the one most likely to obtain the required majority of two thirds was Piccolomini, and that all should support him on the following day. Election of Pius II The results of the second ballot on August 19 in the morning were a greatly disappointing surprise for d'Estouteville. He received only six votes ‚Äì those of de Co√´tivy, Colonna, Bessarion, Fieschi, Torquemada, and Castiglione. Cardinal Piccolomini obtained nine votes ‚Äì those of Barbo, Orsini, Calandrini, Isidore of Kiev, de Mella, de La Cerda, Jaime de Portugal, del Mila y Borja, and that of d'Estouteville, who hesitated to vote for himself but certainly did not consider Piccolomini a serious rival. The votes of Rodrigo Borgia, Giacomo Tebaldi and Enea Piccolomini fell to other candidates. After announcing the results, Cardinal Dean opened the customary procedure of the accessus. There was a long silence broken by Rodrigo Borgia who changed his vote to Piccolomini. Then the partisans of d'Estouteville made an attempt to adjourn the session, but Cardinal Tebaldi also changed his vote to Piccolomini, who needed only one vote more for the election. At this point Cardinal Colonna arose to give his vote. Cardinals Rouen and Bessarion attempted to subdue him forcefully but Colonna was able to free himself from the scuffle to proclaim \\"I also vote for the Cardinal of Siena, and I make him Pope!\\" Perie, The Triple Crown, Spring 1935 p.20 The rest of the adherents of the Cardinal of Rouen could do nothing but change their votes too, and a few minutes later Cardinal Bessarion congratulated Piccolomini on his unanimous election to the papacy. Cardinal Enea Silvio Piccolomini accepted his election and took the name Pius II. On September 3, 1458, he was solemnly crowned on the steps of the patriarchal Vatican Basilica by Cardinal Prospero Colonna, protodeacon of S. Giorgio in Velabro.S.

Passenger trains that operated over the line included the Overland Flyer, later renamed the Overland Limited, which also included a connection to Chicago. Although these passenger rail trains are no longer in operation, the Overland Route remains a common name for the line from California to Chicago, now owned entirely by the Union Pacific.  History  Display ads for the CPRR and UPRR the week the rails were joined on May 10, 1869 The Overland's SF ticket office at the Palace Hotel Donner Lake (left) and the now abandoned original CPRR (later SPRR) Track #1 grade over Donner Pass Overland Route schedule, Dec., 1945 The name harkens back to the Central Overland Route, a stagecoach line operated by the Overland Mail Company between Salt Lake City, Utah and Virginia City, Nevada from 1861 to 1866, when Wells Fargo & Company took over the stagecoach's operation. Wells Fargo ended this stagecoach service three years later. While the Council Bluffs/Omaha to San Francisco \\"Pacific Railroad\\" grade was opened in 1869, the name ‚ÄúOverland‚Äù was not formally adopted for any daily extra-fare train over the route until almost two decades later when the Union Pacific inaugurated service of its Overland Flyer on November 13, 1887, between Omaha and Ogden, Utah, where passengers and through cars were transferred to the Southern Pacific which had acquired the CPRR's operations on that line in 1885 under a 99-year lease. The UP changed its designation to the Overland Limited on November 17, 1895, and service continued as a daily train under that name in one form or another for almost seven decades. For the first dozen years that the SP met the UP's Overland trains, however, it dubbed its service the \\"Ogden Gateway Route\\" with its connecting westbound trains operating as the Pacific Express and eastbound trains as the Atlantic Express before finally adopting the name the Overland Limited in 1899 for its portion of the run as well. The original of the route from Omaha to San Francisco traversed some of the most desolate (as well some of the most picturesque) lands of the western two- thirds of the North American continent. While the trip originally took early low fare emigrant trains a full week (or more) to complete, by 1906 the electric lighted all-Pullman Overland Limited covered the route in just 56 hours.The Official Guide of the Railways and Steam Navigation Lines of the United States, Porto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Cuba. New York: National Railway Publication Co., July, 1906. p. 654 E. H. Harriman bought the bankrupt Union Pacific in 1897; in 1901 he assumed control of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific as well. The rebuilding of the Overland Route followed: hundreds of miles of double track, hundreds of miles of signals, and dozens of realignments to reduce grades, curvature, and perhaps distance. (The rebuilding actually started before the CP/SP acquisition‚Äîthe map in the May 1969 issue of Trains shows Howell to Bosler realigned in 1899.) By 1926 the UPRR route from Council Bluffs/Omaha to Ogden was continuous double track, except for the Aspen Tunnel (east of Evanston, Wyoming) which remained a bottleneck until 1949. The CPRR/SPRR portion of the route was also largely double tracked during this period, with the completion of such projects as the 1909 Hood Realignment between Rocklin and Newcastle, double tunneling along the Sierra Grade including at Cisco and the summit (Tunnel #41), and the 1924 agreement to share tracks across Nevada with the Western Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route.\\"Union Pacific Donner Pass Track Improvement and Tunnel Clearance\\" Bloomberg.com Among the most important improvements to the original grade was the Lucin Cutoff, a completely new stretch from just west of Ogden to Lucin, a few miles east of the Nevada border. It included a 12-mile (19 km) trestle on wooden pilings across the Great Salt Lake. Opened in 1904, this line cut off the line, eliminated 3,919 degrees of curvature, and removed of climb from the route, thus decreasing the steepest SP grade east of Lucin from 90 feet per mile to 21. But many other sections of the original 1860s grade were harder to improve on, notably over the Sierra Nevada between Colfax, California, and Reno, Nevada. The newer second track follows a better route here and there, but the original route changed little (except for the removal of the wooden snowsheds, or their replacement by nonflammable concrete ones) until the 1993 abandonment of the 6.7-mile section of the Track No. 1 crossing of the summit between Norden and Eder which includes the original Summit Tunnel (No. 6). Traffic was sent instead over the easier-to-maintain Track No. 2 and through the tunnel called ‚ÄúThe Big Hole‚Äù (No. 41) which had been driven under Mt. Judah a mile south of the Pass when that portion of the line was double tracked in 1925. Aside from those modifications the Sierra grade looks much the same to train passengers as it did when the line opened in 1868.  Connection to Chicago  From the start-up of the Overland Flyer in 1887 the Chicago and North Western Railway handled Overland Route trains between Chicago and Omaha. On October 30, 1955, passenger operations east of Omaha shifted to the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the \\"Milwaukee Road\\").  Demise  Drumhead\\" logos such as this often adorned the ends of the observation cars on the Overland Limited. As intercity passenger rail travel began to decline after World War II and into the 1950s with the growth of the airline industry and development of the Interstate Highway System, the Overland route gradually lost its luster and service declined. After almost seven decades of continuous operation, the Overland Limited came to an end as a daily train on July 16, 1962, when the Interstate Commerce Commission approved termination of the service. While the train continued to run until Labor Day (with some additional holiday runs from Christmas to the New Year), the name ‚ÄúOverland‚Äù did not appear in the schedules of the UP or SP again after its last run on January 2, 1963. The only daily passenger train between Omaha and the San Francisco Bay area today is the California Zephyr, operated by Amtrak and mostly along a different route. The Zephyr only uses the Overland Route in the states of California and Nevada, passing through Salt Lake City instead of Ogden and Denver instead of Cheyenne.Cooper, Bruce Clement (Ed), The Classic Western American Railroad Routes.

In 1996, the Union Pacific again acquired the Southern Pacific, resulting in the entire Chicago-Oakland line being owned by a single company.  Route description   Council Bluffs/Omaha to Ogden (via the Union Pacific)  UPRR & CPRR \\"Great American Over-Land Route\\" Timetable cover 1881 The \\"Thousand Mile Tree\\" located west of Omaha, Nebraska, on the UPRR grade of the Overland Route. Heading west from Council Bluffs/Omaha over the same wide open plains of Nebraska's Platte River Valley that had been followed by so many wagon trains in the 1840s, ‚Äò50s, and ‚Äò60s, Overland trains passed first through Fremont, Grand Island, and Kearney (196 miles from Omaha) where all the wagon trails from the Missouri River communities between Omaha and Kansas City had once converged. There the famous Fort Kearney had been built by the U.S. Army in 1858 to protect the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia Trail heading west, and from which, under the direction of Union Generals U.S. Grant and W.T. Sherman, soldiers had been dispatched to protect UP surveyors and construction crews from Indian attack as the road progressed across Nebraska towards Wyoming. By the time travelers on the Overland Route crossed into Wyoming at Pine Bluffs, they had traveled some westward and risen in elevation above sea level from the at Omaha to . The Rocky Mountains first came into passengers‚Äô view further on at Hillsdale with the appearance of the dark crests of the Laramie Range. About further west the route reached Sherman, the highest point on the line at , on a high and rugged upland with bold rock masses eroded into fantastic, picturesque shapes. The route crossed the Continental Divide at Creston, some west of Omaha. At Green River passengers were treated to views of two of the most spectacular rock formations in Wyoming‚ÄîMan's Face directly southwest of the station, and Castle Rock just north of it. Six miles after crossing the Bear River at Evanston the route entered Utah, a land which would provide passengers with close-up views of some of the most unusual rock formations of the entire trip. After passing Henefer where Brigham Young and his Mormon pioneers had turned southward in 1847 to cross the Wasatch Mountains into Emigration Ca√±on, perhaps the two most famous features on the Union Pacific's section of the Overland, Thousand Mile Tree and Devil's Slide, came into view on the west, and south sides of the track, respectively. Entering the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, the route soon reached Ogden, some from Omaha. Here the Union Pacific lines diverged to Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest while the Southern Pacific (which acquired operational control of the CPRR's original Pacific route under lease in 1885) took charge of the ‚ÄúOverland Limited‚Äù and other trains on to San Francisco.

The West portal of the \\"Summit Tunnel\\" (#6) at Donner Pass SP train ferry \\"Contra Costa\\"When the route opened in 1869, trains reached the San Francisco Bay. For the first 35 years after the driving of the ‚ÄúLast Spike‚Äù at Promontory Summit in 1869, all trains heading in and out of Ogden on the SP passed over the site of that seminal event as they made their way around the northern end of the Great Salt Lake. In November 1903, however, the SP opened the Lucin Cutoff, a stretch of new track featuring a long trestle built on pilings across the Great Salt Lake. Ten miles past Lucin, the ‚ÄúOverland‚Äù crossed into Nevada at Tecoma, the nearest railroad town to the silver, copper, and lead mines discovered in the region in 1874. Passing through other western Nevada mining centers and through Wells, an important supply point on the old Emigrant Trail, the line then followed the valley of the long Humboldt River. Devil's Peak, a perpendicular rock rising from the edge of the Humboldt River, dominated the canyon scenery at Palisade while the last major stop in Nevada was Reno with the Sierra Nevada mountains dominating the view ahead. The next hundred miles of grade from Reno to Colfax, California were by far the most challenging to build and provided the most impressive views of the whole route, although for much of that stretch passengers could see nothing as trains traveled through miles of tunnels and snowsheds. After passing Verdi, Nevada, the site in November, 1870, of the first train robbery on the Pacific coast, the Overland Route crossed into California and followed the Truckee River up a picturesque canyon to the town of Truckee on Donner Lake where the ill-fated George Donner party had been snowbound in the winter of 1846‚Äì7. A serpentine climb around the east end of the lake and up Mt. Judah brought the Overland to the Summit Tunnel at 7,018 feet at Donner Pass and the start of a descent to Sacramento located just above sea level. Travel over this section could be quite treacherous in the winter as the Southern Pacific had to deal with clearing as much as of snowfall as well as ice from water dripping in the tunnels. The miles of showsheds needed to keep the line passable left the impression among passengers that they were ‚Äúrailroading in a tunnel‚Äù for much of the route. The wooden snowsheds also presented another challenge of railroading ‚Äúover the hill,‚Äù however, as fires were often started by lightning strikes or embers from steam locomotives. Still there were some extensive views available to passengers in the Sierras, the most famous of which was that from ‚ÄúCape Horn‚Äùhttp://cprr.org/Museum/Sierra_Grade_8-2003/Cape_Horn/index.html just above the town of Colfax where the grade was carved out of the side of a mountain, providing a panoramic view across Green Valley of the American River flowing in a canyon some below. This spot was so popular that for many years the Southern Pacific stopped the Overland and most other trains for a few minutes so that passengers could get off the train and take it all in from a special observation area. When the route opened in 1869, trains reached the San Francisco Bay area from Sacramento via a line (built by the original Western Pacific Railroad) by way of Stockton over Altamont Pass, and on through Niles Ca√±on first to a pier at Alameda, and shortly thereafter to the nearby two-mile long Oakland Long Wharf (later called the \\"SP Mole\\") from which San Francisco was then accessed by ferry. In 1876, however, the CPRR acquired a line built by the California Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to Vallejo and in 1879 completed an extension of that road across the Suisun Marsh to Benicia. There the CPRR established a ferry service to carry its trains a little more than a mile across the Carquinez Strait to Port Costa from which they ran down the southern shoreline of the Strait and San Pablo Bay, and then along eastern side of the San Francisco Bay to the Oakland Long Wharf, thereby cutting approximately off the journey from Sacramento. After half a century of operation, however, the train ferry between was replaced by a massive drawbridge built by the SP between Benicia and Martinez which opened in October, 1930, and is still in use today.Along the Union Pacific System: The Overland Trail and the Union Pacific Railroad.

It is situated in the locality of Dadar- Matunga. Unlike the other Parsi colonies (also known as , literally gardens) it is not surrounded by a wall or fence and is not isolated from its surroundings. The colony houses the famous Five Gardens created by Mancherji Joshi, a renowned Parsi. It is the largest Zoroastrian enclave in the world and in 2009, out of the 45,000 Zoroastrians living in Mumbai, 10,000 lived in Dadar Parsi Colony. History Parsi colony is in the center of 'Maheshwari udyan and Dadar TT' This area was established for Parsis through the efforts of Mr Mancherji Edalji Joshi, the founder of the Dadar Parsi Colony (M Joshi Colony). The area was built by the British under the Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme of 1899-1900, the first planned scheme in Mumbai. The Bombay City Improvement Trust formulated this plan in order to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the Mumbai plague epidemics of the 1890s. According to the survey plan, 60,000 people were to be housed at Dadar-Matunga and an equal number in Sion-Matunga. 85,000 people were to be accommodated in the developments in Sewri-Wadala. The plans regulated constructions with emphasis on proper sanitation. No building was to be more than three storeys high, and the buildings were to have open spaces between them. The land-use was planned to be a mix of residential, commercial and institutional constructions. Parks and gardens were planned, and the streets were well laid out. of land was procured and leased to the government for selling. For the first time in 1922, housing cooperatives were formed to take advantage of newly developed land. The Parsi and Hindu colonies in Dadar were developed in this way in the 1920s. Dadar was away from Crawford Market by the newly constructed Mohammed Ali Road. The tramways were extended here. The GIP constructed a bridge, now the Tilak Bridge, connecting the two railways. Soon, in February 1925, the GIP Railways opened their line, and started the work of electrifying the railways. Among the institutions which moved here according to the BCIP plan were the VJTI, the Sydenham College of Commerce and Wadia Vachha now known as J.B.Vachha high school for Parsi girls. This posh colony in south Mumbai is home to an estimated 15,000 or more Parsis, which is by far the largest concentration of Parsis in Mumbai, and possibly the world.

Severino The former Italian Catholic Diocese of San Severino, in the Province of Macerata, Marche in Central Italy, existed until 1986. In that year it was united into the Archdiocese of Camerino to form the Archdiocese of Camerino-San Severino Marche. History San Severino stands on the site of the ancient Septempeda, a city of Picenum. The saint from whom the city takes its name is commonly believed to have been Bishop of Septempeda, but his date is unknown.Francesco Lanzoni (1927), Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604) (Faenza: F. Lega), pp. 392-393. In the eighth century it was a fortress of the Duchy of Spoleto. The Church of San Severino gave its name later to a new town that grew up around it. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was at constant war with the neighbouring cities, especially with Camerino, and always supported the cause of the emperors, particularly of Emperor Frederick II. Louis the Bavarian named as vicar of San Severino Smeduccio della Scala, who, passing into the service of the Holy See, gave great help to the expedition of Cardinal Albornoz and became feudal lord of San Severino, a post held later by his son Onofrio. His nephew Antonio paid with his life for attempting to resist the arms of Pietro Colonna, the representative of Pope Martin V; his sons tried in vain to recapture the city (1434), which remained immediately subject to the Holy See. In the Middle Ages San Severino was part of the Archdiocese of Camerino; the old cathedral was then a collegiate church. In 1566 there was a seminary in the town. Creation of diocese On 26 November 1586, by the Bull Superna dispositione, Pope Sixtus V made San Severino an episcopal see, a suffragan of the Archbishop of Fermo.Gauchat, p. 314, note 1. Umberto Benigni, \\"San Severino,\\" Catholic Encyclopedia (1913); retrieved: 25 February 2019. The first bishop was Orazio Marzari. The cathedral was administered by a Chapter, with two dignities (the Archdeacon and the Archpriest) and thirteen Canons, one of whom was Theologus and another Penitentiary. A fourteenth was later added, under the patronage of the Tucci and Gentili families.Ughelli, II, p. 768. cf. Gauchat, p. 314, note 1. In 1913, the diocese of Treia was removed from the supervision of the Archbishop of Camerino and assigned donec aliter provideretur, to Bishop Adam Borghini of San. Severino. On 20 February 1920, the Diocese of Treia was united to the diocese of San Severino by the Bull Boni Pastoris of Pope Benedict XV, in such a way that the bishop of San Severino was to be the Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Treia on a permanent basis.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 12 (1920), pp. 321-322. Bishop Dionigi Pieragostini (1732‚Äì1745) held a diocesan synod in 1733.Collio, p. 28. End of diocese The current configuration of the former diocese was arranged in order to conform to Italian civil law, which was embodied in the Concordat between the Vatican and the Italian Republic of 18 February 1984. After extensive consultations, Pope John Paul II decreed that the status of the bishop governing several dioceses aeque personaliter was abolished, and that the Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino was merged with the Diocese of Osimo e Cingoli, the Diocese of Recanati and the diocese of Treia to form a single diocese, albeit with a long name. The changes were embodied in a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops in the Roman Curia, promulgated on 30 September 1986.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (1987), pp. 729-732. The seat of the merged dioceses was to be in Macerata.AAS, p. 731, no. 1: All of the cathedrals except Macerata were to have the status of co- cathedral.AAS, p. 731, no. 3: Hodiernae Ecclesiae Cathedrales urbium Tolentinae, Recinetensis, Cingulanae et Treiensis titulum sument Concathedralium, in memoriam earum inclitarum et veterum traditionum. On the same day the diocese of San Severino was united permanently with the Archiocese of Camerino, under the new title Archidioecesis Camerinensis-Sancti Severini in Piceno. The former cathedral of San Severino was granted the honorary title of co-cathedral.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (1987), pp. 676-679.

Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court that allowed the United States Border Patrol to set up permanent or fixed checkpoints on public highways leading to or away from the Mexican border and that the checkpoints are not a violation of the Fourth Amendment..New York Times, 7 July 1976, Vol. CXXV, no. 43,264  History  The defendant, Martinez-Fuerte, had agreed to transport two illegal Mexican aliens who had entered the United States through the Port of San Ysidro in San Diego, California. They traveled north and were stopped at a permanent checkpoint on Interstate 5 between Oceanside and San Clemente and then questioned. The two passengers admitted their status, and the defendant was charged with two counts of illegally transporting aliens. He moved to have the evidence suppressed, on the grounds that the checkpoint stop had violated the Fourth Amendment. The motion was denied, and he was convicted of both counts.  Decision  The court ruled 7-2 that the internal checkpoints were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court went on to say that it would be impracticable for the officers to seek warrants for every vehicle searched and that to do so would eliminate any deterrent towards smuggling and illegal immigration. The court felt that any intrusion to motorists was a minimal one and that the government and public interest outweighed the constitutional rights of the individual. The court also ruled that the stops were Constitutional even if largely based on apparent Mexican ancestry: \\"As we have noted earlier, one's expectation of privacy in an automobile and of freedom in its operation are significantly different from the traditional expectation of privacy and freedom in one's residence. United States v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. at 422 U. S. 896 n. 2; see Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583, 417 U. S. 590-591 (1974) (plurality opinion).\\" \\"And the reasonableness of the procedures followed in making these checkpoint stops makes the resulting intrusion on the interests of motorists minimal. On the other hand, the purpose of the stops is legitimate and in the public interest, and the need for this enforcement technique is demonstrated by the records in the cases before us. Accordingly, we hold that the stops and questioning at issue may be made in the absence of any individualized suspicion at reasonably located checkpoints. [Footnote 15]\\" Thus, a Border Patrol agent that sends a vehicle to secondary does not violate the Fourth Amendment even without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion: \\"We further believe that it is constitutional to refer motorists selectively to the secondary inspection area at the San Clemente checkpoint on the basis of criteria that would not sustain a roving patrol stop.\\" (The court was referring to the Terry v. Ohio requirement of roving patrol). \\"Thus, even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the basis of apparent Mexican ancestry, [Footnote 16] we perceive no constitutional violation. Cf. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at 422 U. S. 885-887. As the intrusion here is sufficiently minimal that no particularized reason need exist to justify it, we think it follows that the Border Patrol officers must have wide discretion in selecting the motorists to be diverted for the brief questioning involved.\\"  Dissenting opinion  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote in his dissent that the decision was a radical new intrusion on citizens' rights and \\"empties the reasonableness requirement of the Amendment\\": \\"The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances. And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard.... Anything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction.\\" Part of Justice Brennan's complaint was that it was the ninth decision to rule against Fourth Amendment protections in that term.

Ivan Milev Lalev (; 18 February 189725 January 1927) was a Bulgarian painter and scenographer regarded as the founder of the Bulgarian Secession and a representative of Bulgarian modernism, combining symbolism, Art Nouveau and expressionism in his work. Ivan Milev was born in the town of Kazanlak in the family of shepherd Milyu Lalev. In 1917‚Äì1918, he fought as a soldier in World War I. On 18 November 1918, the same year that he finished high school in his hometown, he arranged an exhibition in Kazanlak. For two years he was a teacher in Gorski Izvor, Haskovo Province. In 1920, he was admitted to the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, where he studied under Prof. Stefan Badzhov, and had three one-man exhibitions. He also contributed to the communist comic magazine Red Laughter (–ß–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω —Å–º—è—Ö, Cherven smyah) as an illustrator and cartoonist. In the summer of 1923, he visited Turkey, Greece and Italy with a group of fellow students. He was introduced to the achievements of the Italian Renaissance and the Italian Baroque in Rome, Naples, Florence and Venice. In 1926, he graduated in set decoration from the National Academy and worked for the Ivan Vazov National Theatre as a stage designer. Afterwards he became an independent freelance painter and illustrator and he also painted frescoes. With a group of colleagues he took part in the Shipka Memorial design competition, but came second. Generally living in poverty, Milev had a brief 18-month marriage to opera singer Katya Naumova; their daughter Mariya Mileva eventually became an architect. Milev died of influenza in Sofia on 25 January 1927, shortly before his thirtieth birthday.

Milev often created socially loaded works. His characteristic decorative style was much influenced by the European Secession, but it was also related to Bulgarian folk art and icon painting. Milev's paintings are exhibited in the National Art Gallery, Sofia Art Gallery, the Shumen, Kazanlak and other cities' galleries.

The fictional family is loosely based upon that of actor/comedian Chris Rock. Main characters While the protagonist is clearly based upon Chris Rock, the surname \\"Rock\\" is never used when referring to the character Chris or any member of his family. (CHAPTER S04E05 football speaker says \\"Rock broken up by number 72\\" last name is mentioned) Chris Chris (played by Tyler James Williams), is the ambitious, normal, responsible, intelligent, and kind-hearted, but unlucky, unpopular, untalented, nonathletic, underachieving, hapless, awkward, nerdy, vulnerable and mischievous eldest child and protagonist of the series. He wishes he was more like his younger brother, Drew. Regardless of whether Chris possesses any positive traits, he's certainly never treated as if he does (being disliked by the opposite race, unlike his siblings). He tries hard to fit in with his peers but often finds himself a victim of circumstance. Chris is bullied at school (with little protection obtained from teachers or faculty members). He is tortured by his sister, humiliated by his brother, victimized by the racist teaching staff, rejected by girls (most of whom prefer Drew), slandered by his neighbors, ignored by his schoolmates, robbed by neighborhood thugs, is underpaid at work, and receives tough love from his mother and distressing treatment from his father. As the eldest child, he is often put in charge of his younger siblings, but they usually disobey him and he usually has to take the blame for them. Next to all this, Chris is always the butt of the last jokes on each show. People just seem to hate him for inexplicable reasons. His luck improves as the series progresses. One of his talents is playing Asteroids and the other is calling basketball games. As he gets older, Chris becomes interested in stand-up comedy and begins telling jokes in school. At the end of the series ‚Äì after being told that he has to repeat the tenth grade for constantly being late for school ‚Äì he drops out and gets his GED, though his narrator dropped out due to bullying. Julius Julius (played by Terry Crews), based on Chris Rock's father, is Rochelle's cheap, frugal, worrisome, levelheaded, and devoted husband and the father of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. He is known for his extreme cheapness and taking the easy way out when it comes to purchasing essential items for his family (such as by using food-stamps and buying store-brands). Julius' cheapness is also exhibited by how he uses duct tape to fix anything and everything broken in the house. He has even been shown to memorize the price of nearly every object in his family's possession, shouting it out loud when such an item has been wasted or ruined. One of his most famous character attributes is bargaining his way out of having to pay full price for an item. He coddles Tonya and is more likely than his wife to give her what she wants, and will react with a lecture every time one of his children considers quitting or asks him about receiving money. Said lectures having been known to last for hours on end and encourage his kids to avoid bringing up such subjects around him. Julius is also shown to be a workaholic, accepting any job offer he receives. It is implied that Julius can understand Chinese but cannot speak it due to the fact that when he communicates with Mr. Fong, (who speaks in Chinese towards him) he is able to respond back. Whenever Chris has a problem, he goes to Julius, who gives him advice in a confusing manner. Once, Chris remarked that even though he didn't understand what his father said, it made him feel better anyway. Rochelle Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold) is Julius' very strict, humorously cheeky wife and is the mother of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. She is an assertive woman who frequently becomes apprehensive over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter (such as Tonya becoming pregnant or her kids selling drugs). She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have. She uses the comebacks to ensure that they do not end up performing a crime or great misdeed of some sort; she also fears that they may wind up as street criminals or teenage parents. The narrator describes her as a \\"Ghetto Snob\\", likely because of her cautious behavior towards the way her family is perceived in public. She shares loving moments with her children, showing that her true intentions for her assertive ways are sincerely because she cares for them. She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles, which often calm her, and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason. She is also noted for getting a job, and then quitting whenever she has a problem with it. Rochelle's famous catchphrase that refers to this running gag is: \\"I don't need this, my man has two jobs!\\" This expresses her reliance on Julius's two jobs as an excuse to resign and be comfortable at home. She is very judgmental towards Julius when it comes to their marriage. This can be seen in the episodes where she starts to think that Julius will leave her for a white woman or finds something which leads her to believe that Julius is having an affair. She sometimes disagrees to Julius' methods about being cheap, like when they celebrated Kwanzaa instead of Christmas. Julius believes that this method is an effective way to save money for more important things rather than materialistic items. There are times where Rochelle understands Julius's behavior, like in the episode where he got a second job in order to earn more money for the family. However, Rochelle eventually developed second thoughts about the situation, for she believed that Julius was actually throwing money away. In the final season of the series, Rochelle works as a beautician at Nessa's Beauty Salon, where in previous seasons she would often get her hair done. She also gossips with her friend and owner of the salon, Vanessa (Jackee Harry) and the other workers. Another running gag about her is that she regularly threatens her children with impossible physical damages but never hits them. It is only when she takes them into a room saying \\"we need to talk\\" when she disciplines them. Drew Drew (played by Tequan Richmond) is Chris's popular, lucky, talented, athletic, academic, and handsome younger brother. As opposed to the malicious rejection and harassment Chris receives from his peers, Drew is idolized above all of his classmates. His supreme charm earned him a multitude of girlfriends in the past. Secretly, Chris envies the limitless amount of luck and talent possessed by his younger brother, who appears slightly older than he does. Drew's height as opposed to that of Chris provides his elder brother with a number of disadvantages. Incredibly, Drew looks up to Chris and envies all the responsibility and trust their parents give him. Highly athletic, Drew loves hockey and idolizes Wayne Gretzky. He is also shown to be interested in magic and karate. Drew also has the talent of copying things he sees off of television, especially karate movies. He becomes more responsible and more hardworking as the series progresses. \\"Wasn't Me\\" is a familiar catchphrase of his, often to get himself out of any possible trouble he is sure he had nothing to do with. In one episode, the narrator even claims that this was his first phrase as a baby. This was first introduced in the Pilot episode. Tonya Tonya (played by Imani Hakim) is Chris and Drew's younger sister. She is a smart-mouthed, and shrewd little girl who enjoys getting her brothers in trouble by whining to her parents about things they never actually did, and Julius and Rochelle always believe her. However, in the third and fourth seasons, she tends to hold a soft spot for Drew and Chris (when Chris got thrown out of the house, she admitted she doesn't want him gone and she and Drew try to rethink Chris's and her mother's decisions) by charging money to keep her mouth shut if they do something wrong (particularly to Chris), and sometimes hangs around Drew. Billy Ocean is her favorite entertainer (though later on she adopts a fondness for Danny Glover), and telling by the way Tonya believes that he originally was responsible for the invention of the Moonwalk instead of Michael Jackson, she might not like to believe what she does not want to believe. Julius over- indulges Tonya and is usually the parent apt to give her what she wants, whereas Rochelle is normally not afraid to not provide Tonya with one of her desires if it is for something she is unwilling to give to her daughter, and worries that one mistake in raising her will be linked to her being pregnant one day, and she \\"ain't raisin' no babies\\". She is very attractive, and is usually given nice gifts from the neighborhood kids; for example, James (one of her admirers) bought her a car in one episode. Greg Vincent Martella as Gregory \\"Greg\\" Wuliger, Chris's weird, nerdy, and anxious best friend. He is the only kid at Corleone Junior High who doesn't hate Chris. He is almost as unpopular as Chris. Chris always comes to Greg for advice, even though Greg is usually terrible at coming up with solutions. Despite being Chris' best and only friend, Greg is always quick to abandon Chris when bullies come in order to save himself and also has disagreements with him from time to time. On top of being a good student, Greg also has a series of odd quirks (such as going to bed dressed as different superheroes and dressing as a car racer after learning Chris bought a car), but considers himself cool and nice. He has a book about almost everything in his locker. He is an only child and is of Italian and Swedish descent. His mom married his dad because she lost a bet but ran off with his uncle Patrick Wuliger, who later had a gender change. After graduating from Corleone, Greg got a scholarship when he went to the Bronx Academy, whereas Chris went to Tattaglia in Season 4, but got kicked out due to poor grades after he adopted\` a tougher image. He later transferred to Tattaglia and the two continue their friendship. Although his father was seen in one episode his mother is never actually seen. Greg's catch phrase is \\"You're so in there\\". He was absent from only two episodes in the entire series.In the series finale Caruso subjects Greg to bullying for the rest of his school life. The Narrator Chris Rock as The Narrator (voice), a sarcastic older Chris looking back at his youth, like that of The Wonder Years. His narration is lots the opposite of what other characters say. The Narrator also mentions his disdain for then-president George W. Bush and for singer Bobby Brown as he frequently says sarcastic things about them. For instance in one episode the narrator talks how Greg has gone from bad to worse like \\"America under Bush\\". He also states things like \\"who do you have to break up with to end up with Bobby Brown?\\" He also states that Bobby Brown perhaps dislikes him back, such as when he thinks Bobby Brown changed the channel after watching one of the situations of the show. Recurring characters Bed-Stuy residents * Mike Estime as Risky, a street dealer who sells items that are always bootlegged or stolen by him. His real name is Richard. Whenever he appears, a chorus of people whispering \\"Risky!\\" is heard in the background in the early episodes. He later works at Manny's barbershop. He also tried working with Julius for a night, but found the job not be as exciting as he hoped for, and then quit working with Julius to return selling his illegal goods. * Antonio Fargas as Doc Harris, the local grocery store owner. Chris later works for Doc. He is kind to Chris and gives him advice. When Chris is unable to work, Drew fills in for him. In addition to Doc, Fargas also played Mr. Harris, a butcher who, on Halloween, dresses as a pimp named \\"Sweet Tooth\\" and takes children's candy. * Todd Bridges as \\"Monk\\", Doc's nephew and former U.S. Armed Forces member who manages the store when his uncle is away.

A dimwitted, older teenager in the neighborhood who frequently greets Chris with \\"Lemme hold a dollar\\" to which Chris almost always complies. He'll sometimes ask for a dollar just out of boredom. He nicknames Chris \\"li'l dude from across the street\\", or simply \\"li'l dude\\". In Jerome's first appearances on the series, he is a predatory, minor villain but that idea is soon abandoned and subsequent appearances portray him as a much friendlier person. Chris soon finds him becoming an unlikely friend, and on occasion, Chris will go to him when in need of some useful teenage advice, advice that he is only too happy to give ‚Äì as soon as Chris gives him the dollar he asks for. The family once caught him breaking into their apartment with a credit card. Despite all of this, he does display genuine concern for Chris when he needs him. * Ernest Lee Thomas as Mr. Omar, a womanizing funeral director, who rents an upstairs room in the family's building. He is seen with a different newly widowed woman for almost every appearance he makes. He claims just to be consoling these attractive women in their time of grief. He frequently says \\"Tragic! Tragic!\\". He also frequently requests to \\"borrow\\" things and takes advantage of Rochelle's need to keep up appearances to the chagrin of Julius.

His real name is Edgar Devereaux. Kill Moves' mother is actually a millionaire, but he prefers to live freely on the streets.

In his first appearance, he is named Mr. Jackson. He occasionally gives Chris a hard time, for example when Chris is collecting empty cans for a school project, Kill Moves appears in trash bins before Chris can even run to them and leaves no cans for Chris. * Blake Hightower as James, a 12-year-old neighborhood kid. James is flirty towards Tonya and wishes to have a relationship with her. He hangs alongside with the other supporting male characters at Manny's barbershop.

Chris is in love with her but she wants to keep their relationship platonic.

She seems to have a slightly promiscuous side to her, and has also expressed attraction to bad boy types ‚Äì something Chris is not. * Whoopi Goldberg as Louise Clarkson, the despicable and nosy next door neighbor and Tasha's maternal grandmother. She insults Chris because she believes that he wants to sleep with her granddaughter, and calls him a \\"cock-eyed hooligan\\" and \\"nappy headed\\" and infuriates Rochelle due to her being chief of the Neighborhood Watch for not being responsible. She only appears in two episodes of season two. * Tisha Campbell-Martin as Peaches Clarkson, Louise's daughter and Tasha's mother. Peaches is very loud, ignorant and eccentric. She is an ex-con who befriends Rochelle in her first appearance. She also dates Malvo during her later appearances.

Rochelle takes Pam's place as the salon's manager.

When asked her again for his $25, she pretends that she forgot about it and that she doesn't have any money despite that there's a cash register in front of her. * J. B. Smoove as Manny', the local owner of the barbershop who appeared in season 3. He is always shown giving helpful advice and joking around.

He constantly calls Chris \\"Lionel Richie\\". He is first seen trying to operate the restaurant out of the family's upstairs room. * Ricky Harris as Malvo, a petty criminal who robs Chris at Doc's and threatens to kill him if he identifies him.

Corleone Junior High School/Tattaglia High School staff and students * Travis T. Flory as Joey Caruso, the Irish-Italian-American, racist school bully who routinely picks on Chris, although he is surprisingly fond of African-American culture. Since the beginning of the show, he mostly picked and beat up Chris for no good reason, to which surprisingly he never got suspended or caught for, possibly for just being white. He is the main antagonist of the series. In each episode, he refers to Chris by a different nickname such as \\"Satchmo\\", \\"Kareem\\", \\"Tito\\" or \\"Cornbread\\", and frequently gives cruel gifts to Chris. In the series finale, it is revealed that Caruso actually admires Chris and the only reason he has picked on Chris in school is because he has been jealous of his determination and achievement and had crushed Chris's spirit only so he himself would not feel inferior. * Jacqueline Mazarella as Ms. Vivian Morello, Chris' beautiful but naively racist teacher, and later his high school principal. Due to her apparent attraction to African American men, she holds a soft spot for Chris and tries to support him at every opportunity (such as giving him a Valentine's Day card out of sympathy, or giving him advice on running for the class president). In her efforts to be supportive, however, she makes statements or uses analogies that come off as racist, even though she might not realize that ‚Äì such as saying that \\"black people\\" must wake up and work up fields before sunrise, that they have tendencies towards vandalism, criminality and drugs, that they often make use of lies and blackmail to rise in life, that Chris has no father and his mother is crack-addicted, and when Chris tries to tell her the truth, she assumes Chris is lying because \\"he is on drugs\\" ‚Äì most of which Chris tolerates. However, in \\"Everybody Hates Graduation\\", she finally realizes Chris' lifestyle, but believed that Chris lied, despite her being the one who made up all that stuff about Chris. In Chris Rock's narration often consists of him wanting to physically hurt her (\\"smack her upside the head with a brick\\") as well as making sarcastic remarks on her ethnicity as she does to him. * Lynda Scarlino as Mrs. Abigail Milone, the elderly school monitor who is later promoted to Vice Principal of Corleone because, according to the adult Chris, she proved that the one thing that she hated a lot more than kids was working with them. She's often seen disciplining someone, and occasionally disciplines Chris even when he hasn't done anything wrong. * Jude Ciccolella as Dr. Julius Raymond, the stern principal at Corleone Junior High. He makes racist assumptions about Chris and thinks that Chris is a crack baby. He always talks in a slow, monotone, voice.

It is implied that he is gay when he is shown dancing with men in a bar dressed in leather. He is last seen in Everybody Hates Halloween * Jason Alexander as Principal Edwards, the eccentric new principal of Corleone who replaces Dr. Raymond in the second season. He is possibly the only non-racist staff member.

He hires Chris as the team's manager. He is hateful, sarcastic and unfair against people, especially towards Chris, and it is implied that he is racist or at least prejudiced, despite denying that he is, as he believes that the reason why black people were brought into slavery was because white people were too lazy to work. He once helped Chris by teaching how to box, despite the constant belittling he always gives Chris. * Monica Anne Parales as Lisa, a hard-working, though seemingly racist Asian student and the head of the school's newspaper. She criticizes Chris very harshly about his writing when he joins the school's newspaper. When Chris is elected school president, she writes negative stories about him in effort to get him impeached.

Enola Yard is a large rail yard located in East Pennsboro Township, Pennsylvania, along the western shore of the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was the world's largest freight yard through 1956. The NYC Railroad also claimed the same title in the early 20th century. The November 1941 issue of Trains magazine depicted Dewitt yard with more car capacity than all single system yards of the time except Proviso. In the 1920-30s Dewitt was claimed to be the largest in the world. Enola, Dewitt and Proviso all shared the title as \\"world's largest\\" at one point or another. (Usually the railroad who owned the yard would be making the claim). Enola continues to operate today at lower traffic levels. History The yard was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1905 with two hump classification yards. Initially the yard processed 7,000 cars per day. The westbound complex had a receiving yard with 20 tracks, and a 25-track classification yard. The eastbound complex had a 21-track receiving yard and 17 classification tracks. There were no separate departure yards. Enola Yard was fully built out by the late 1920s, encompassing 316 acres and a capacity of 9,692 cars. Service buildings included a 43-stall roundhouse and a steel car shop. A yard to handle container freight was added to the complex in 1932.Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Harrisburg, PA (1997). \\"Enola Yard: A Brief History.\\" Brochure. The PRR rebuilt the component yards and installed automatic retarders, starting with the eastbound hump in 1938. The eastbound yard was electrified with 11,000-volt alternating current (AC) service. (See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.) The westbound complex was rebuilt in 1944 with 16 receiving tracks and 35 classification tracks, followed by the eastbound complex, reconfiguring to 15 receiving tracks and 33 classification tracks. The average daily traffic load in 1939 was 11,207 cars, and this average increased during the approach of World War II, with 14,100 daily cars in October 1941. The record traffic level at the yard was 20,660 cars in one day during June 1943. A diesel locomotive shop was added in the late 1940s. In 1953 the yard handled 11,000 cars per day, and the yard comprised 145 miles of track and 476 switches.Kraft, Edwin (June 2002), \\"The Yard: Railroading's Hidden Half.\\" Trains Magazine, Vol. 62, No. 6, p. 48. In the 1950s PRR rebuilt Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, and upon its opening in 1959, Conway became the railroad's major yard for east-west traffic. Traffic at Enola Yard was reduced. Conrail took over operation of Enola Yard in 1976. Traffic levels at the yard declined as more trains were routed by Conrail over nearby tracks of the former Reading and Lehigh Valley rail lines. Conrail removed electrification equipment and closed the eastbound hump yard in 1983, and closed the westbound hump yard in 1993. The steel car shop closed in 1996. Current operation The yard is currently owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), which has operated a flat classification yard and increased operations since taking over from Conrail in 1999.

Holochroal eyes are compound eyes with many tiny lenses (sometimes more than 15,000, each 30-100Œºm, rarely larger). They are the oldest and most common type of trilobite eye, and found in all orders of trilobite from the Cambrian to the Permian periods. Lenses (composed of calcite) covered a curved, kidney-shaped visual surface in a hexagonal close packing system, with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses. Unlike in schizochroal eyes, adjacent lenses were in direct contact with one another. Lens shape generally depended on cuticle thickness. The lenses of trilobites with thin cuticles were thin and biconvex, whereas those with thick cuticles had thick lenses, which in extreme cases, could be thick columns with the outer surface flattened and the inner surface hemispherical. Regardless of lens thickness, however, the point at which light was focused was roughly the same distance below the lens.

Opened on 1 November 1876, it was leased to, and worked by, the Great Western Railway (GWR), before being fully absorbed by the GWR in 1905. The line was built with the hope of becoming part of a through trunk route between Bristol and the industrial Midlands, a development which never took place. Although tourism provided some new passenger business in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, the line's income was always weak. After nationalisation, British Railways reviewed its viability and withdrew the passenger service on 5 January 1959. A limited goods and mineral service continued until 1964, after which residual traffic continued on the southern end of the route to Tintern Quarry, until 1981, and Dayhouse Quarry, near Tidenham, until 1990. Plateways The Wye Valley Railway in 1876The town of Monmouth had become an important regional centre by the 19th century, and local industry was developing. Communication with Chepstow, on the River Severn, had long been undertaken by river transport, or on roads following the valley of the River Wye, and some mineral industries had been established on that route.B M Handley and R Dingwall, The Wye Valley Railway and the Coleford Branch, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1982 reprinted 2000, Keith E Morgan, Monmouth Through Time, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2016, Monmouth (Troy) Station; the train on the right was for the Wye Valley lineBy contrast, the nearby Forest of Dean was the source of a considerable output of minerals‚Äîcoal, iron ore and stone‚Äîand the poor road communications in the Forest had led early on to the provision of tramways there on a small scale. A more ambitious scheme resulted in the Monmouth Railway,Not to be confused with the Monmouthshire Railway, from Newport to Pontypool. which ran from east of Coleford to Monmouth at May Hill, on the east side of the River Wye. This plateway toll line, with a gauge of , was horse operated. It opened in stages between 1812 and 1817.Joseph Priestley, Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals and Railways of Great Britain, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831J J Davis, The Railways of Monmouth, in the Railway Magazine, September 1952 At the same time the Severn and Wye Railway was under construction from the northern and western parts of the Forest to Lydney on the River Severn; it opened, at first as a plateway, in 1817; much later it was converted to an edge railway.Ian Pope, Bob How and Paul Karau, An Illustrated History of the Severn and Wye Railway: volume one, Wild Swan Publications, Upper Bucklebury, 1983, First railways Bridges over the River Wye in Monmouth: foreground Wye Valley Railway and background Ross and Monmouth Railway. A main line railway came to the region when the South Wales Railway opened from 1850; it eventually completed a through line from Milford HavenHere \\"Milford Haven\\" refers to the waterway of that name; the terminal railway station was later known as Neyland. to London in association with its ally, the Great Western Railway. Settlements connected to a railway line found that the cost of materials brought in became much cheaper, and local produce found better prices at market. The Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway was opened in 1855 crossing the north of the region.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch Line to Monmouth, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2008, Coleford was considered the capital of the Forest of DeanRex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1981, and it was the mineral production of the immediate area that encouraged railway access. The Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway was authorised in 1853, intended to convey iron ore output by a shorter route than hitherto, to the ironworks of Nantyglo, Dowlais and Ebbw Vale. Its route would avoid the steep ascent, for loaded trains, of the Western Valley line. As well as building a new line from Monmouth to Little Mill, (near Pontypool, on the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway) to Monmouth, the CMU&PR; was authorised to purchase part of the Monmouth Railway and convert it to main line standards suitable for locomotive operation: this would form the section from Coleford to Monmouth. The CMU&PR; opened from Little Mill to Usk on 2 June 1856, and on 12 October 1857 it was opened as far as Monouth Troy station. Reaching Coleford, the primary object of building the line, required a crossing of the River Wye, and conversion of the Monmouth Railway. As well as relaying all of its permanent way, this would have involved considerable realignment to smooth out the worst of the sharp tramroad curves, and opening out the tunnel profile. However at this stage the CMU&PR; had largely exhausted its financial resources. After taking stock of the situation, and achieving a partial financial recovery, the CMU&PR; set about building the bridge and viaduct to cross the River Wye at Monmouth, and extend its line as far as a mineral depotThe depot was described as a \\"wharf\\". This was a commonly used term for tramway depots at the time, and did not imply a riverside location. at Wyesham, from Monmouth. A transshipment facility was set up there, and the Monmouth Railway continued to operate, unmodernised, as far as that point. The extension of the CMU&PR; from the Troy station to Wyesham opened on 1 July 1861.Stanley C Jenkins, The Ross, Monmouth and Pontypool Road Line, Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition, 2009, James Page, Forgotten Railways: South Wales, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1979, Wye Valley Railway authorised A Stone train in steam in 1963 leaving Tintern station.In 1865 definite proposals were put forward to build a railway from Monmouth to Chepstow. At Monmouth it was to make a junction with the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway 21 chains east of the eastern end of its Wye River Bridge near Monmouth.Prospectus in the Western Daily Press, 18 November 1865 The route was to follow the River Wye but the watercourse was extremely sinuous, and for much of its course it was hemmed in by steep hills. The 1865 projected route was submitted to Parliament in the 1866 session; the line was to be called the Wye Valley Railway. Extremely optimistic forecasts were circulated by the promoters, including the assertion that the line would form part of an artery to the North of England from Bristol, when the Severn Tunnel was opened. Tourism was becoming an important factor, and the natural beauty of the Wye Valley was expected to encourage revenue from that source. The South Wales Railway had been constructed on the broad gauge, and it was assumed at first that the line from Monmouth would join it at Chepstow, and also be constructed on that gauge. The Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway was built on the narrow gauge (as standard gauge was then known), but interchange with that line was not considered important.Mixed gauge would have been needed between Wyesham and Monmouth. Nevertheless, national government had taken an interest in the gauge of new and existing railways, and a Gauge Commission had been appointed to recommend policy. This recommended that no new lines should be built on the broad gauge, except for certain designated extensions to the existing broad gauge network. This resulted in the Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846, which mandated that recommendation. The intended gauge of the Wye Valley Railway was changed to narrow gauge, no doubt recognising the reality that the South Wales Railway itself would eventually be converted.The South Wales Railway was converted to narrow gauge in 1872. The Wye Valley RailwayChristiansen refers to the company on page 135 as the Monmouth and Wye Valley Railway, but this is not used by other authorities. was authorised by Act of Parliament on 10 August 1866.Parliamentary Intelligence, August 10, 1866, in the Evening Mail, 13 August 1866 Share capital was to be ¬£230,000. It was to run from a junction with the CMU&PR; at Wyesham, near Monmouth, to Wye Valley Junction, near Chepstow.Map in F W Arrowsmith, A Description of the Monmouth to Coleford Branch, written at the time of opening, in Thomas B Peacock, Musing on Railways, Four Essays, 1948, T B PeacockE F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Construction The timing of the authorisation was unfortunate, as on 10 May 1866 the banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company suspended payments, having run out of money to discharge its liabilities, and the surrounding financial turmoil provoked a massive failure of the availability of investment money. The company found it impossible to secure the necessary capital, and the start of construction was much delayed. In fact nothing was done for several years, and as the authorising Act specified a time limit, it was necessary to obtain a further Act allowing an extension of time. This was the Wye Valley Railway Act of 16 June 1871.Imperial Parliament, report in the Morning Post 17 June 1871 Looking down on the line at RedbrookStill it proved impossible to get subscriptions, and a financial launch in 1874 offered ¬£230,000 of shares to the public. Confidence was intended to be inspired by the assurance that the Great Western Railway were to work the line, guaranteeing (it was claimed) 6% on capital for five years. The railway was to \\"open a new and much shorter route from Liverpool and the north, Birmingham and the Midland districts, to Newport, Cardiff, Bristol and the West of England, and this through route will be very materially improved on the completion of the Severn Tunnel now in course of construction.\\"Advertisement in the Morning Post, 9 May 1874 A further Act of Parliament in 1874 authorised certain deviations of the formerly approved route, in particular affecting the crossing of the River Wye at Tintern, and the course down the eastern bank of the river.Report of Special General Meeting of the Company held on 12 February 1875, in the Western Mail, 13 February 1875 Construction was started at Tintern on 26 May 1874, the contractor Reid Brothers and Co having undertaken to complete the line by December 1875.Monmouthshire Beacon, 30 May 1874 The technical aspects of the construction were difficult, especially at the southern end of the route. There were two tunnels; the longer was Tidenham (or Denhill) tunnel. When completed it was in length (having been planned at ). The actual construction cost of the line was ¬£318,000, the greater part of the expenditure being on the tunnel. There was torrential rainfall on 18 November 1875 causing severe flooding across the whole country.

In particular the route at Tintern took the line to the east of the town, and the station was some distance away. A petition was raised by residents and industrialists at Tintern, asking for a branch line to serve the Tintern town and the Wireworks factory there. This was agreed to, and a remarkable undertaking was given by the Wye Valley Company in the Wye valley Railway (amendment) Act 1875: the branch was to be ready by 1 November 1874, and be for the exclusive use of the landowners. No charge was to be made for transportation on the branch. The company was to pay ¬£3,086 for the land, but the branch was not to become part of the Wye Valley Railway Company undertakings without the consent of the landowners. The branch involved a substantial bridge over the river Wye, in length, but was nevertheless ready for traffic on 6 August 1875, although the Wye Valley Railway main line was not yet open. Meanwhile, the Wireworks, the principal producer of business on the line, had ceased trading. The line lay dormant until the early 1880s when the Abbey Wire and Tinplate Company established a business there, but this ceased trading in 1901. However the hoped-for passenger station was not made: the branch was to serve industrial locations only. Opening It had been anticipated that the line would be ready for traffic during 1875. It was announced in the press in April 1876 that \\"it has been decided to open the reach of the Wye Valley Railway, from Monmouth (Troy), to Redbrook, for goods traffic, this week. The line will be opened to Tintern for general traffic about Midsummer. The entire route to Chepstow will probably be opened next spring.\\"Monmouthshire Beacon, 22 April 1876 On 8 June 1876 a train ran to Redbrook: \\"On Thursday a Great Western Railway Company's goods train ran from Monmouth to Redbrook and back, thereby opening up this portion of the Wye Valley line to goods traffic... An effort is being made to open the line for goods traffic through, from Monmouth to Redbrook and Tintern...South Wales Daily News, 9 June 1876 On 29 September 1876 the line was inspected by Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade.Cardiff Times, 30 September 1876 The formal opening of the line took place on 19 October 1876, when the directors and their friends travelled over the line. The newspaper reports, no doubt fed by the Company, insisted that this was \\"establishing a route of great importance for through traffic between Bristol and the West of England, and Birmingham, Liverpool and other towns in the north... The line will not be opened to the public until 1 November.\\"Western Daily Press, 20 October 1876Western Mail, 20 October 1876 Footbridge over the Wye at TinternIn fact the ceremonial opening took place on 28 October 1876. This was for the directors and their friends, and the full public opening followed on 1 November 1876. The line was leased to, and worked by the Great Western Railway, for 55% of gross receipts for five years, and 50% thereafter. The line was single, with a passing loop at Tintern; there were four passenger trains and one goods train each way daily. There were four intermediate stations on the line, and trains ran from the existing station at Monmouth to Chepstow or Portskewett (for the Bristol ferry) on the South Wales Main Line. The intermediate stations on the line were Redbrook, Bigsweir, Tintern and Tidenham. At Monmouth the new line used the Wyesham extension of the Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway. Financial difficulties The financial state of the company was difficult immediately on opening, and the company was losing money on operating account. The construction had cost more than was budgeted, and there had also been serious irregularities in the financial control. New preference stock was issued soon after the opening: the Company was \\"issuing ¬£105,000 [of] 5% preference stock, which will be a first charge on the gross receipts of the railway after paying the interest on the debenture stock, amounting to ¬£3,830 per annum... The new capital is required for the completion of the works under the first contract, amounting to about ¬£25,000; the new wharves at Chepstow; branches to tinplate-works and other works and mills on the line, about in length; the Brockweir-bridge and enlarged sidings, made at the request of the Great Western Railway Company.\\"Morning Post, 18 November 1876 Much was made in this period of an extension at Chepstow to wharves there, giving access to shipping on the River Severn. The expenditure proved fruitless, and at a Shareholders' meeting in September 1881 the chairman \\"did not see any prospect of their becoming profitable to the company\\". At that time \\"the gross receipts of the line had fallen off. The net receipts from the Great Western Company were insufficient to pay the interest on the 1875 debentures\\".Morning Post, 30 September 1881 This had brought the financial position of the company into the public arena, and it was evident that there had been financial impropriety on the part of the Chairman, W Hawes. In March 1881 a shareholders' investigation into the financial affairs of the company had been set up. It seems that the Company went into receivership at this time. Hawes was ousted and a new chairman, A Jerrard, was appointed. In fact only one dividend was ever paid by the company, and that was during the construction period.Where there is no income, there can be no justification for a distribution to shareholders. Paying them a dividend out of their own capital is hardly proper. Efforts were made to regularise the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership for a second time in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the travelling public were concerned. Ross and Monmouth Railway The Ross and Monmouth Railway opened on 4 August 1873, but it stopped short at the May Hill station in Monmouth, until the Ross company's own bridge over the Wye was ready; the connection to Troy station was opened on 1 May 1874. Owned by the Great Western Railway Tidenham Tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 243896 In the early years of the line, it had been operated under the train staff and ticket system; the sections were Monmouth Troy to Wyesham Junction, Wyesham Junction to Tintern, and Tintern to Wye Valley Junction. This basic system was rather limiting, and in 1907 the Great Western Railway implemented the electric train staff system, with more sections: Troy, Wyesham Junction, Redbrook, Bigsweir, Tintern, Tidenham and Wyesham Junction were the new staff stations. In addition an electric train tablet system was installed, enabling long section working at quiet periods. Nevertheless, the system incurred significant additional signalling staff costs, and in 1927 a rationalisation scheme was introduced, in which several of the staff stations were abolished. The scenic beauty of the line was used by the Great Western Railway to encourage tourist traffic. Excursions from Gloucester, Cheltenham and Cardiff came to Tintern, and in addition there was an enhanced ordinary passenger train service in the summer. In the 1920s and 1930s the GWR considered it of value to provide additional halts on the line, in an attempt to improve passenger income. Llandogo Halt and Whitebrook Halt were opened in 1927. They were followed by Brockweir Halt in 1929, and Penallt Halt and Wyesham Halt in 1931, and Netherhope Halt in 1932. Tutshill Halt was added in 1934 on the main line between Chepstow and Wye Valley Junction). Penallt Halt and Redbrook Station were located close to one another, separated by the viaduct over the River Wye. Diesel railcars The GWR introduced diesel railcars in the 1930s for use on lightly operated passenger services; the Railway Magazine reported in May 1936: > On March 23, railcar no. 14 entered service to work 17 existing steam-train > services, and also to provide two new passenger services, in the Newport, > Chepstow, Monmouth, Pontypool Road, Panteg and Blaenavon area... The daily > number of diesel railcar services is now 132.What the Railways Are Doing, in > Railway Magazine, May 1936 Mitchell and Smith show a photograph of a railcar, W30, at Tintern on 21 June 1951. Decline The diesel railcars were an attempt to carry light passenger traffic at lower cost, but since 1918 competition from road transport had severely reduced the line's income; motor lorries abstracted goods traffic and omnibuses reduced passenger carryings. The process continued relentlessly, affecting passenger and goods business. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the line was said to be losing ¬£20,000 on its passenger operation, and the decision was taken to stop running passenger trains. The last such train ran on 4 January 1959. A limited goods train operation continued, but that too was unsustainable, and ceased on 6 January 1964. The residual operation was from Chepstow to Tintern Quarry The section from Tidenham to Tintern Quarry closed in 1981, and the rest of the line was abandoned when Tidenham Quarry closed on 29 March 1990. Route and Stations Wye Valley Junction where the railway joined the Gloucester to Newport Line.The northern terminal of the line was the Troy station at Monmouth, on the line from Little Mill Junction, near Pontypool to Ross-on-Wye. The line left the station in an easterly direction, and immediately crossed the River Wye and adjacent low- lying ground by a viaduct. Wyesham Junction followed, where the Coleford Railway diverged. Following the east bank of the Wye, the railway reached Redbrook station, crossing then to the west bank by Redbrook Viaduct, . There was a halt at Whitebrook, and the next station was Bigsweir, adjacent to a road bridge over the Wye, but with little population nearby. The station name was later changed to St Briavels. Next was Llandogo Halt, serving a sizable community, and then Brockweir Halt, although the village of Brockweir was on the other side of the river, requiring a ferry crossing until a bridge was built in 1906.From listed buildings website; Mitchell and Smith say 1904. South of Brockweir the river makes a considerable westward loop, and a railway alignment directly serving Tintern would have been challenging. Instead the line provided a Tintern station some distance east of the community; it was the only passing place on the line. The route continued south, crossing the river, running through Tintern Tunnel, , to penetrate the spur of the hill, and running on the eastern side of the Wye. Immediately south of the tunnel the Wireworks branch trailed in. It served the tinplate works at Abbey Hill and had its own substantial bridge of span, crossing the Wye. Tintern Quarry was located some distance further south, and after that point the railway diverged from the River, passing through Tidenham Tunnel, , to Netherhope Halt.

Palermo had been investigating an international drug and arms trafficking network in which Italian politicians may have been involved.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 204 Palermo was injured in the attack and three passersby were killed: Barbara Rizzo and her young twin sons, Salvatore and Giuseppe Asta.  Attack  On the morning of 2 April 1985 a car bomb loaded with TNT exploded on the side of the highway through Pizzolungo. It was set to detonate as deputy prosecutor Carlo Palermo traveled from his house in Bonagia to the Palace of Justice in Trapani in an armored Fiat 132 followed by an unarmored Fiat Ritmo. Just before the bomb exploded, Palermo's car was overtaken by a Volkswagen Scirocco, driven by Barbara Rizzo, 30, who was taking her six-year-old twins Giuseppe and Salvatore Asta, to school. Her vehicle was caught between the car bomb and the Fiat 132. The explosion was heard miles away. Palermo was wounded, but the Scirocco bore the brunt of the blast, killing its occupants. Barbara Rizzo was thrown out of the car while the bodies of the children were scattered much further away. One body landed on the wall of a building 200 yards (180 meters) away, mangled beyond recognition. Among the first responders were the woman's husband, Nunzio Asta, and his brother. But her vehicle was destroyed to such an extent that Nunzio and his brother did not suspect that the family was involved in the explosion. After the arrival of the police and emergency services, Nunzio went home, and then left by car to go to his workshop. Shortly after, the police called to ask for the license plate number of the car and Nunzio found out that one of his employees had already discovered his children had never reached school. Of the four bodyguards in the rear Fiat car, two were slightly injured while the other two were severely hit by shrapnel: Anthony Ruggiero was hit in the eye, while Salvatore La Porta was hit in the head and other parts of his body.  Aftermath  The prosecutor on the case was Sebastiano Patan√®. Among the survivors, Raffaele Di Mercurio, 36 years old at the time of the massacre, died in 1993 due to heart disease. In the same year, because of heart problems, Nunzio Asta died (at the time of the attack he had already undergone heart-bypass surgery). His oldest daughter Margherita, 11 years old at the time of the bombing, became active as an adult in the anti-mafia movement Libera in the province of Trapani. Gioacchino Calabr√≤ was charged with terrorism and conspiring with others to commit a massacre for the attack. But the charges were quashed in 1991 after judges ruled the defendants would not have committed the crime. Among those judges were Corrado Carnevale. http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/200805175830/articoli-arretrati/i-retroscena- della-sentenza-che-ha-assolto-il-giudice-corrado-carnevale.html In 2004, the Mafiosi Balduccio Di Maggio, Vincenzo Virga and Tot√≤ Riina were convicted for ordering the massacre. http://www.gruppoabele.org/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1678  Memorial  A memorial has been constructed at the site of the attack.

Following the 1840 failure of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which had only ever managed to connect Louisville with nearby Portland, area businessmen met for years before organizing a new railroad in March 1847. The Louisville and Frankfort was chartered to connect the Ohio port to the state capital, as well as Lexington with any points east. The stretch between the capital and Lexington itself was left for the Lexington and Frankfort, chartered the next year. After purchasing the L&O;'s rights-of- way west from Frankfort from the Commonwealth, the Louisville and Frankfort issued stock and raised $800,000 from the City of Louisville. Surveys directed by Col. Stephen H. Long of the U.S. Topographical Engineers selected a new route, employing some but not all of the stretches previously graded by the Lexington and Ohio. The rails for the road were purchased in London, England, and shipped upriver from New Orleans. Construction began in March 1849, heading east from Louisville. The one-story brick passenger station, train shed, freight shed, and roundhouse were all located at Brook and Jefferson Streets. Near Cherokee Gardens in Louisville, the line ran adjacent to present-day Frankfort Avenue.The Encyclopedia of Louisville, p. 176. \\"Cherokee Gardens\\". University Press of Kentucky (Lexington), 2001. Accessed 10 October 2013. On February 6, 1850, the company held a special round trip to LaGrange for the board of directors and their guests. All the initial track was laid by the spring of 1851 and the completion of a bridge over the Kentucky River near Frankfort permitted the first service along the entire mainline in August. In 1852, the L&F; was connected to the completed Lexington and Frankfort mainline and initiated twice-daily service to Lexington. Connection there to the Covington and Lexington Railroad then permitted travel to Cincinnati's Kentucky suburbs. The L&F; and Lexington and Frankfort merged their management and operations on January 1, 1857, and then fully merged as the Louisville, Cincinnati and Lexington Railroad in 1867.The Encyclopedia of Louisville, p. 549. \\"Louisville & Frankfort Railroad\\". University Press of Kentucky (Lexington), 2001. Accessed 10 October 2013. The LC&L; later made up part of the L&N.; Its rights of way now make up part of the CSX Transportation network. Directors The L&F;'s first president was Thomas Smith of New Castle (d. 1850). He was succeeded by James Guthrie of Louisville. The L&F;'s first board of directors included Smith, John J.

There were four episodes. The show has not since been recommissioned.  Synopsis  Two families who have never met take it in turns where one family become servants in the master's home for a week, then in the following week they swap roles, often with explosive results. In turn each family is given the chance to experience the pleasures of having servants to do everything for them. The show sees how the families cope giving and receiving orders. The servants are obliged to wear humiliating uniforms, and abide to rules set by their masters; signing a \\"binding\\" contract outlining their duties. Arguments usually take place the second week, when the first family to serve become masters and take the opportunity to exact their revenge. Disputes tended to be so intense, that families would pull out early before the two-week experiment could end.

October 10, 1900 ‚Äì December 11, 2000)Social Security Death Index listing for Jacob Liebowitz, Social Security Number 091-03-2495, last residence New York City, New York 10019. was an American accountant and publisher, known primarily as the co- owner with Harry Donenfeld of National Allied Publications (later DC Comics). Early life Jack Liebowitz was born Yacov Lebovitz in Proskurov, present- day Ukraine in October 1900, to a Jewish family.Gerard (2006), pg 11. His mother, Mindl, never identified his biological father, her first husband (who had left the family), but married Yulyus Lebovitz when her son was three. Yacov soon adopted his stepfather's surname, and in 1910 the family emigrated to the United States. They arrived in the Jewish neighborhood of New York's Lower East Side and, as was common at the time, adopted Anglicized names: His parents became Julius and Minnie Liebowitz, while he became Jacob, soon shortened to Jack.Gerard (2006), pg 13. Jack was a hardworking child and became a newsboy amongst other small jobs. In high school, he became adept at accountancy, a career he thought would help him escape his poor background.Gerard (2006), pg 18. Career and partnership with Harry Donenfeld By age 24, Liebowitz had earned his accounting degree from New York University, and by 1927 had married (Rose) and moved to The Bronx.Gerard (2006), pg 49. Liebowitz set himself up as an accountant based in Manhattan's Union Square area, with one client, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU); his father had been a steward for that union since the early 1910s. By 1925, Liebowitz was in charge of the union's strike fund, and a year later managed to keep the fund solvent in the wake of a six-month, 50,000-worker strike. His business acumen placed Liebowitz in a position of high standing with the union officials.Gerard (2006), pg 50. Toward the end of the decade, Liebowitz had taken on more clients and begun studying the stock market.Gerard (2006), pg 61. His initial dealings worked well for the union, but after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, funds plummeted and Liebowitz and the ILGWU parted company. In 1929, Julius Liebowitz approached Harry Donenfeld, whom he had befriended through ILGWU ties, and sought work for his son.Gerard (2006), pg 62. Donenfeld, a rising businessperson who felt a sense of loyalty to those from the old neighborhood, took Jack on as his personal accountant. Although a chance meeting, the two men complemented each other very well ‚Äî Donenfeld was a social, chance-taking high-flyer, while Liebowitz was cautious and had a logical mind that ensured Donenfeld's fiscal mistakes were small, and that his business promises were binding only in favor to himself. When Liebowitz first worked for Donenfeld, the latter's empire was little more than a publishing house for \\"sex pulp\\" and art nudie magazines distributed by Eastern News, a company run by Charles Dreyfus and Paul Sampliner. In 1931, Eastern News faced bankruptcy and could no longer pay its publishers; the company owed Donenfeld alone $30,000. A compromise was called for, and Donenfeld, not wanting to find himself hamstrung by a distributor again, approached Sampliner with the idea of creating the Independent News Company, a publishing house with its own distribution system.Gerard (2006), pg 88‚Äì89. As a publisher, Donenfeld had managed to dodge creditors and break deals, but as a distributor, he came to rely more on Liebowitz to ensure that the company ran smoothly. Liebowitz ensured bills were paid on time and began to build a trust with clients that Donenfeld's enterprises had never experienced.Gerard (2006), pg 92. National/DC In 1935, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson came to Independent News seeking a new distributor for the comic book projects his company, National Allied Publications, was producing. Although comic books were not Donenfeld's main field, he took on Wheeler-Nicholson, and Independent News began printing and distributing comic books. Wheeler-Nicholson brought out two comics, New Fun and New Comics‚Äîthe former of historical note as the first modern comic book with all-original material, as opposed to newspaper- comic reprints with occasional, tangential new material‚Äîbut it would be his third publication, Detective Comics, that would prove key. Already in considerable debt with Independent, Wheeler-Nicholson could only fund publication of Detective Comics by creating a subsidiary company -- Detective Comics Incorporated‚Äîin partnership with Liebowitz. In 1938, Donenfeld managed to remove Wheeler-Nicholson from the equation, pushing Detective Comics, Inc. into bankruptcy and buying its assets.Gerard (2006), pg 125. As part of the bankruptcy action, Liebowitz‚Äînow sole owner of Detective Comics Inc.‚Äîbought up Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, and Donenfeld and Liebowitz assumed control over the entire, growing comic-book publisher. Liebowitz, now in control of the fledgling company, devised the title for what was to become National/DC's most important comic book: Action Comics.Rhoades, Shirrel A Complete History of American Comic Books (Peter Lang, 2008), , p. 16 He asked editor Vin Sullivan to find material to fill the new title, and Sullivan, Liebowitz and Sheldon Mayer ultimately created comics history and kickstarted what historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books by selecting writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster's character Superman to star in the new title. All-American Publications In the late 1930s, Max Gaines, who had past experience as a comic book publisher, approached Donenfeld for finances and distribution to set up his own publishing company. Donenfeld agreed, on the condition that Gaines take Liebowitz on as partner. Donenfeld arranged this not only to reward Liebowitz for his work with Independent News, but also as a hook to keep Liebowitz with the company and to ensure Gaines would not act outside the interests of Donenfeld's business.Gerard (2006), pg 164. By the end of 1938, Gaines and Liebowitz were principal and minority owner, respectively, of All-American Publications, an independent sister- company to National/DC. In 1945/46, Gaines left All-American to found his own company ‚Äî initially called Educational Comics, later known as EC ‚Äî allowing Liebowitz to buy his interest in the company. Liebowitz promptly merged All- American with DC/National, and he and Donenfeld continued publishing the best of both companies' titles. New media As the years went by, Liebowitz stayed at the forefront of new technologies and entertainment media, helping oversee Superman's transition to movie serials starring Kirk Alyn; to radio; and to theatrical animated shorts. Comics historian Gerard Jones described Liebowitz as the only comics publisher who \\"made any real effort to make the new medium [Television] work for him\\" when in 1951 producer Whitney Ellsworth brought the syndicated series Adventures of Superman to television.Gerard (2006), pg 258. Company changes DC Comics went public in 1961, and became officially known as National Periodical Publications with Liebowitz remaining president of what was by then America's foremost comics publisher. Six years later, Kinney National Services acquired the company; the following year, Kinney also bought Warner Bros. to form Warner Communications. Liebowitz continued to be an active member of the Warner Communications board, visiting his office daily even into his 91st year, finally relinquishing his place in 1991. 1950s acquisitions In the 1950s the comics industry suffered a massive shrink in sales, credited by many to the newly introduced Comics Code Authority, which banned publications that printed scenes of what was described as of a horrific, violent or sexual nature. This not only affected the popular horror and crime comics, but even the teen romance market. Liebowitz, who had pushed for a moral code in his own publications earlier in his career, was made vice-president of the organization under John Goldwater, and unsurprisingly was least affected by the new code, as his own comics were in- line with the code before it was introduced. In 1956 the comics market had shrunk by fifty percent compared to its early 1950 levels. When the American News Company was found guilty of restraint of trade in 1957 it was forced to divest itself of its newsstands. This caused George Delacorte of Dell Comics to a find a new distributor, and this in turn spelled the end of American News. Of those companies that had survived the early 1950s only half remained after the loss of such a large distributor. Liebowitz made three notable distribution acquisitions during this turmoil. The first was Martin Goodman's publishing company (whose staff would later form Marvel Comics), Bill Gaines's Mad magazineGerard (2006), pg 279. and Hugh Hefner's Playboy.Gerard (2006), pg 280. Non-publishing work and life A founding trustee of the Long Island Jewish Hospital (renamed North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System), Liebowitz served on the board for over 50 years, beginning 1949, acting as honorary chairman, and was also the medical center's second president, from 1956 to 1968.Paid Notices: Deaths -- Liebowitz, Jack (Jacob) S., December 12, 2000. Accessed September 7, 2008 In addition, he was a trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in New York. In 1985, DC Comics named Liebowitz as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. Liebowitz died December 11, 2000, survived by his second wife, Shirley (his first wife, Rose, died in 1956), his two daughters, Linda and Joan, his stepson Robert, and his great grandchildren Eliana, Alex, Josh, Ben, Leo, Harry, and Ariana. Liebowitz's niece Carole was married for many years to Harry Donenfeld's son, Irwin, a long-time DC executive (and co- owner).Irwin Donenfeld entry , Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999.

The organization, which endorsed the doctrine of nativism, rose to prominence in both the labor movement and urban politics in the years after 1901, electing its nominee as Mayor of San Francisco in 1909.  Organizational history   Background  Workers on the San Francisco waterfront in 1901. During the first decade of the 20th century, employers across America made effective use of judicial injunctions to prohibit trade unions from engaging in strikes to win recognition for themselves and wage-and-hour gains for their members. This so- called \\"open shop drive\\" put organized labor, concentrated in an array of local and international craft unions joined under the umbrella of the American Federation of Labor on the defensive. In San Francisco, one of the most heavily unionized cities in the country, matters came to a head in the summer of 1901 when a local employers' association, the Draymen's Association, locked out the city's unionized teamsters on July 21.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900-1905. New York: International Publishers, 1964; pg. 287. The lockout spread to the entire waterfront, which saw the city's transportation essentially shut down. Strikebreakers were imported by the employers, who were met by force, leading to calls by the employers for police assistance. When police were deployed by the Chief of Police, the city's 14 maritime unions joined together in the City Front Federation and voted to initiate a mass sympathy strike in support of the locked out teamsters, rather than see the teamsters' union crushed.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 288. Some 16,000 longshoremen, clerks, packers, and warehouse workers joined the work stoppage on July 30th, thereby increasing the volatility of the situation. San Francisco's Democratic mayor, James D. Phelan, who had been elected thanks in large measure to the support of organized labor, sided with the employers in the battle and gave the Chief of Police authorization to smash the strike. Extreme violence followed, in which picketing workers were clubbed and even shot, resulting in 5 deaths and 336 reported cases of assault. Hundreds more strikers were arrested. The perceived \\"treachery\\" of Mayor Phelan caused San Francisco's organized labor movement to rethink its previous strategy of attempting to elect and influence its \\"friends\\" in the Democratic and Republican parties. Instead, the unions sought an independent political organization to elect their own people to positions of power so that the violence of the state would not be turned against them in a future replay of the strike of 1901. The Union Labor Party was the result of this change of perspective.  Union formed  On September 5, 1901, approximately 300 delegates representing 68 of San Francisco's unions gathered together in a convention to establish the Union Labor Party of the City and County of San Francisco.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 290. The convention approved a platform including a call for the revision of the city charter to curb future intervention by the city administration in labor disputes, a demand for municipal ownership of all public utilities, building more schools and the initiation of the merit system in the promotion of teachers, and the abolition of the poll tax. The platform also contained a frankly nativist demand for the restriction of Asian immigration and the creation of segregated schools for Asian children. The new political party nominated Eugene E. Schmitz, president of the Musicians' Union, as its candidate for Mayor. He was backed by lawyer and political boss Abe Ruef, who threw his considerable influence behind Schmitz. The union put up a slate of its candidates for all other elected positions. The organization was ultimately endorsed by every San Francisco union with the exception of the local Building Trades Council and was bitterly opposed by every newspaper with the exception of the San Francisco Examiner, owned by William Randolph Hearst.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 291. The election of November 1901 proved a great triumph for the union, with its mayoral candidate winning election by a plurality of over 20,000 votes. Three of its members were elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and the group fell just 50 votes short of electing 3 more. Immediately after the election, the teamsters' strike was finally settled in favor of the trade unions. Strikebreakers were discharged and the striking unionized workers were reinstated. The Teamsters Union was recognized, the union wage scale initiated, and the 48-hour week established.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 292. While the union demand for a closed shop was not immediately granted, the year 1901 nevertheless marked a major victory for organized labor and marked a high- water mark for the trade unions of San Francisco and their Union Labor Party.  The ULP in power  With City Hall in the hands of the Union Labor Party, San Francisco's trade unions launched a series of successful strikes in 1902. The city's streetcar employees launched a strike to reverse a 1901 wage cut and to win union recognition, an action which snarled San Francisco's internal transportation. The United Railway Company, employer of the streetcar workers, attempted to import strikebreakers, but this time the ULP Mayor of San Francisco prohibited the company's request for a police guard and ordered that no special permits be granted for security guards to carry firearms.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pp. 292-293. Eight days later, the company signed a contract with its employees which granted all of the union's demands.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 293. Despite some misgivings on the part of Samuel Gompers and other national officials of the American Federation of Labor, the ULP continued its electoral success in 1903, when Eugene Schmitz was renominated for Mayor of San Francisco and won re-election by more than 26,000 votes.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 294. Anti-union forces may have been defeated in the elections, but by no means was there an end to their own organizing. In 1904 there came to San Francisco a new organization known as the Citizen's Alliance, headed by Herbert George, one of the city's leaders of the open shop movement. George initially launched the Citizens' Alliance in Denver, Colorado with great success before importing the organization to the less hospitable soil of the city by the bay. By the end of 1904, George's organization claimed a membership of 16,000, including employers pledged to restore \\"the Americanism of the Open Shop in San Francisco.\\" In the election of 1905, the Citizens' Alliance sought to fragment the union opposition by launching a puppet organization called the United Labor League.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 295. The Citizens' Alliance counted on a split of the labor movement, centered around the conservative Building Trades Council headed by P.H. McCarthy, against which would be pitted a fusion candidate combining the forces of the Republicans and the Democrats under the slogan of \\"Law and Order.\\" Contrary to the best-laid plans of the open shop advocates, McCarthy and the previously resistant Building Trades Council united behind Schmitz and the Union Labor Party in the election of 1905, helping him to win a third term of office.  The ULP in retreat  The year 1907 marked the watershed for the Union Labor Party. In that year, a series of revelations took place detailing graft and corruption in municipal administration, culminating in an investigation and prosecution that showed that the Union Labor Party and the city's Mayor were in the control of political boss Abe Ruef, who received financial kickbacks in the guise of legal fees from public utilities, gambling houses, and houses of prostitution.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 335. The fall of Mayor Eugene Schmitz in the midst of the San Francisco Streetcar Strike of 1907 undermined the strike effort, which ended in utter failure after months of violence between the Carmen's Union and out-of-town mercenary strikebreakers. While little different from the corruption in other major American cities, such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York,See: Lincoln Steffens, The Shame of the Cities. New York: McClure, Phillips & Co., 1904. the San Francisco city graft scandal drew deafening wails of criticism from the local and national press, which sought to emphasize an inevitable connection between labor unions and official dishonesty.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Volume 3, pg. 336. The ULP's 1909 platform advocated public ownership of utilities, a new civic auditorium, extensive public works, and a U.S. citizen-only hiring policy. The ULP nominated and elected the conservative P. H. McCarthy of the San Francisco Building Trades Council in the 1909 mayoral election. While McCarthy's administration was largely scandal-free, it suffered from a number of political failures. Businessmen chose James Rolph, Jr., known as \\"Sunny Jim\\", to run against him in 1911. Rolph won that election and the ULP faded from the scene.  References   Further reading  * Michael Kazin, Barons of Labor.

Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio or a strong market position. The question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives: * The sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target dividend payout ratio, target profit margin, target ratio of total assets to net sales). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations. * The optimal growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L√∂sch, Bj√∂rn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective‚Äîindependent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting. From a financial perspective The sustainable growth rate is the growth rate in profits that a company can reasonably achieve, consistent with its established financial policy. An assumption re the company's sustainable growth rate is a required input to several valuation models‚Äîfor instance the Gordon model and other discounted cash flow models‚Äîwhere this is used in the calculation of continuing or terminal value; see Valuation using discounted cash flows. Several formulae are available here.See for example, Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories, Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School In general, these link long term profitability targets, dividend policy, and capital structure assumptions, returning the sustainable, long-run business growth-rate attainable as a function of these. These formulae reflect the general requirement that all assumptions are internally consistent; see . A check on the formula inputs, and on the resultant growth number, is provided by a respective twofold economic argument. (i) The microeconomic argument: Where the (risk adjusted) Return on capital is significantly higher than achievable in other industries, then this success will attract competition; in the long-run then, the company's returns will tend to those of its industry, in turn tending to the economy; see Profit (economics). Formulae inputs - i.e. assumed profit as compared to targeted capital structure - must be limited correspondingly. (ii) The macroeconomic check: The long-run growth of the company (industry) cannot exceed overall economic growth by any significant amount - otherwise the company in question would eventually constitute the bulk of the economy; see . A calculated growth rate, where the given assumptions are input to a growth formula, can then also act a check as to whether budgets or business plans are reasonable. The sustainable growth rate may be returned via the following formula: Chapter 4 in :SGR = (pm*(1-d)*(1+L)) / (T-(pm*(1-d)*(1+L))) :* pm is the existing and target profit margin :* d is the target dividend payout ratio :* L is the target total debt to equity ratio :* T is the ratio of total assets to sales Note that the model presented here, assumes several simplifications: the profit margin remains stable; the proportion of assets and sales remains stable; related, the value of existing assets is maintained after depreciation; the company maintains its current capital structure and dividend payout policy. Optimal growth rates from a total shareholder value creation and profitability perspective Optimal growth according to Martin Handschuh, Hannes L√∂sch and Bj√∂rn Heyden is the growth rate which assures sustainable company development ‚Äì considering the long-term relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability. Assessment basis: The work is based on assessments on the performance of more than 3500 stock-listed companies with an initial revenue of greater 250 million Euro globally and across industries over a period of 12 years from 1997 till 2009. Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles. Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability In the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates. The more long-term revenue growth companies realize, the more investors appreciate this and the more they get rewarded. File:Graf1 revenue.JPG Return on assets (ROA), return on sales (ROS) and return on equity (ROE) do rise with increasing revenue growth up to 10 to 25% and then fall with further increasing revenue growth rates. File:Graf2 profitability.JPG Also the combined ROX-index (average of ROA, ROS and ROE) shows rises with increasing growth rates to a broad maximum in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth per year and falls towards higher growth rates. File:Graf3 rox.JPG The authors attribute the continuous profitability increase towards the maximum of two effects: # Profitability drives growth: Companies with substantial profitability have the opportunity to invest more in additional growth. # Growth drives profitability: Substantial growth may be a driver for additional profitability, e.g. by higher attractiveness for high performing young professionals, higher employee motivation, higher attractiveness for business partners as well as higher self-confidence. Beyond the profitability maximum extra efforts to handle additional growth ‚Äì e.g. based on integrating new staff in large dimensions and handling culture and quality - do rise sharply and reduce overall profitability. The combination of the patterns of revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability indicates three growth zones: File:Graf4 zones of growth.JPG * Low Return: Low profitability and low value generation below 10% per year * Long-term Sweet-Spot: Solid value generation and highest on average profitability in the revenue growth interval from 10% to 25% per year * High Speed: Even higher total shareholder value generation however in combination with lower profitability beyond 25% per year Growth rates of the assessed companies are widely independent of initial company size/market share which is in alignment with Gibrat's law. Gibrat's law, sometimes called Gibrat's rule of proportionate growth is a rule defined by Robert Gibrat (1904‚Äì1980) stating that the size of a firm and its growth rate are independent. Independent of industry consolidation and industry growth rate, companies in many industries with growth rates in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth p.a. have both, higher total shareholder value generation as well as profitability than their slower growing peers. Base strategies and growth moves These findings do suggest two base strategies for companies: * For companies (e.g. in established markets like central Europe and USA) with low single digit growth rates: Consider acceleration of growth given the fact that TSR and profitability are higher in the sweet-spot * For companies (e.g. in fast growing regional markets like China with India and/ or rapidly growing industry segments) with growth rates beyond 25%: Consider best ways to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù and to stabilize rapid growth and ensure a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù should market growth come to a sudden stop. How to achieve long-term growth in the sweet-spot and beyond The authors have identified a set of preconditions and levers to achieve long-term growth in their defined sweet-spot and beyond: =Preconditions= * Generating a common understanding regarding growth and profit ambitions among the management team as a prerequisite for aligned and coordinated strategy development and implementation * Understanding relevant markets (current or future promising markets). Generating market foresight when identifying and assessing growth initiatives, e.g. megatrends and scenario analyses, segment specific benchmarking and in depth assessments, market demand projections =Levers and strategy= * Applying formulas for rapid growth, e.g. maxing out the number of relevant customers, maxing out the share of wallet and lifecycle potentials, continuous innovation, killer offerings, network based growth, M&A;/buy-and-build driven growth, franchising proven business concepts, pyramid-like network expansion and managing value networks * Defining the growth strategy as a portfolio of best suited growth initiatives considering a multidimensional set of criteria, e.g. ease of implementation, growth and profit impact, expected risk vs. return, cash flow stability * Making growth happen: Strategy and corresponding culture must be addressed in a consistent way, e.g. creating the case for growth, clearly defining and communicating vision and strategy as well as actively developing and energizing the organization. Criticism As described the sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins is based on several assumptions such as constant profit margin, constant debt to equity ratio or constant asset to sales ratio. Therefore, general applicability of SGR concept in cases where these parameters are not stable is limited. The Optimal Growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L√∂sch, Bj√∂rn Heyden et al. has no restrictions to certain strategies or business model and is therefore more flexible in its applicability. However, as a broad framework, it only provides an orientation for case/company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting. Additional company and market specific considerations, e.g. market growth, growth culture, appetite for change, are required to come up with the optimal growth rate of a specific company. Additionally, considering the increasing criticism of excessive growth and shareholder value orientation by philosophers, economists and also managers, e.g. St√©phane Hessel, Kenneth Boulding, Jack Welch (nowadays), one might expect that investors' investment criteria might also change in the future. This may lead to changes in the relationship of revenue growth rates and total shareholder value creation. Regular reviews of the optimal growth assessments may be used as an indicator for the development of stock markets\` appetite for rapid growth.

The site opened in January 1941 as a RAF Bomber Command airfield for training gunners, radio operators and navigators and closed after the end of the Second World War in 1945. It reopened in 1969 and remains in civil operation today as Caernarfon Airport. History No. 9 Air Gunnery School was the first tenant of the base when it opened at the end of January 1941. It was equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers and Avro Anson training aircraft. Two days after flying commenced, the airfield was attacked by a single Junkers Ju 88 bomber that strafed the airfield, damaging one Whitley. Airspeed Oxford trainers from No. 11 Service Flying Training School were deployed to Llandwrog in mid-1941 to complete its students' night flying requirements. The following year, three of its Whitleys were deployed to RAF Driffield to participate in the first \\"Thousand Bomber\\" raid on Cologne, Germany on the night of 30/31 May 1942, although one aircraft failed to return. Several weeks later the Air Gunnery School was disbanded and the field became a satellite of No. 9 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit at RAF Penrhos. The unit conducted its night- flying training at Llandwrog and later moved its headquarters there. It was disbanded on 14 June 1945 and flying activities ended. No. 2 Air Crew Holding Unit then became the tenant. The airfield was reactivated for private aircraft in 1969 in preparation for the Investiture of the Prince of Wales at nearby Caernarfon Castle and it was occasionally used from then on. Eventually, this became frequent enough that the airfield became Caernarfon Airport. The runways and taxiways are still intact, although the original hangars have been demolished. Units The following additional units were here at some point: * No. 31 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 277 Maintenance Unit RAF Mountain Rescue Early in 1942, prompted by an increasing number of aircraft accidents in the North Wales mountains, the RAF Llandwrog Mountain Rescue Section was formed on a local, volunteer basis. The initiative came from the medical officer at the base, Flight Lieutenant G. R. Graham.MoD history of Mountain Rescue The team at Llandwrog, and other similar teams elsewhere, were officially recognised towards the end of 1943. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service started operations in May 1943, but due to the administrative lag of wartime, it was not officially promulgated until January 1944. Chemical weapons storage Almost 71,000 bombs containing the nerve agent Tabun had been seized in Germany at the end of the war, and these were stored in the open at RAF Llandwrog, until 1954 when, in Operation Sandcastle, they were transported to Cairnryan for disposal aboard scuttled ships at sea, 120 miles (190 km) north-west of Ireland. Current use The main site is now Caernarfon Airport. Other parts of the site have been repurposed as workshops and small businesses, whilst many buildings remain largely untouched since the end of the war.

The brand uses innovations in leather treatments including: waxes, distressing, pigmentation, oxidation and organic dying processes. Dog fur controversy In 2007, The Humane Society of the United States reported that some Andrew Marc coats labelled as having fake fur were in fact trimmed with fur from Chinese domestic dogs, potentially indicating a federal crime. The chief executive of Andrew Marc disputed the finding. In 2008, the Humane Society filed a lawsuit claiming that Andrew Marc labeled real fur as fake fur, or labeled raccoon dog fur as common raccoon, fox or rabbit fur. In 2009, through a court settlement with the Humane Society, Andrew Marc agreed to phase out raccoon dog fur usage by 2013, and improve its garment labeling practices. In 2015, having failed to phased out raccoon dog fur usage by 2013, Andrew Marc settled a civil contempt lawsuit with the Humane Society. Andrew Marc was required to certify that it will never again sell raccoon dog fur, and to pay $25,000 to the Humane Society.

Early life Born at South Yarra, Melbourne Victoria to parents Frederick and Martha Thompson. Thompson was educated at Toorak College in Melbourne leaving with Honours, Proficiency Certificates Pianoforte and Ice Skating.  Flying qualification and early career  On 28 May 1930 she did Thompson took her first flight as a pilot and later in that year obtained her A Licence. In 1932 she obtained her 'B' Commercial Pilot licence, and the fifth woman in Australia to hold that license. She qualified as a flying instructor in 1933 and was reported as the first woman in the British Empire to obtain instructors licence. In April 1934 Thompson sailed for England to collect a new De Havilland Moth Major, which she named Christopher Robin. It had been fitted with long range fuel tanks for the journey to Australia. Thompson had accumulated over 250 hours of flying experience by this time. On 28 September 1934 Freda left Lympne, Kent for the long journey to Australia flying solo. The trip took 39 days with the actual flying time being 19 days.

Formed in Ohio back in 2005 under the name Absentee. They released their debut album Absentee in 2008 featuring guest contributions from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe and Human Furnace of Ringworm. History Hoglan and Popson met back in 2004 while Jason was selling T-shirts for Meshuggah while they were on tour with Strapping Young Lad. Popson was taking a break from touring with Mushroomhead where he was known as J Mann. He never mentioned that he was Mushroomhead‚Äôs frontman and it wasn't until late in the tour that Hoglan found out. Originally, the group was intended to be similar to Probot with Popson as the vocalist and a revolving door of guitarists and drummers. When Popson was finally ready to record, though, the only one who was not busy was Hoglan. In January 2007, Hoglan flew to Ohio and he and Popson wrote and recorded Absentee in 10 days. Guitarist Rob Reinard (NDE) was brought in by studio engineer Bill Korecky. Bassist Craig Martini was also brought in for the band. Popson and Martini are longtime friends and have performed in bands in the past, including Unified Culture, State of Conviction and The Alter Boys. Shortly after finishing recording Absentee Martini left the band in good terms, relocating to Nevada and was replaced by Steve Rauckhorst, who Popson had previously known from the Cleveland scene and his time in Integrity. They played their first show in nearly six months at Peabody's in Cleveland. On May 5, 2011, Pitch Black Forecast announced Tom Shaffner of Keratoma fame would be their new second guitarist. The band's name was originally \\"Absentee\\" before switching it to Pitch Black Forecast and using the former as the name of the first album. The first track recorded, titled \\"Revolve\\", was included on the Melvins Tribute album We Reach: The Music of the Melvins and released on Popson's record label, Fractured Transmitter. The band's second album, a five- track EP, titled Burning in Water... Drowning in Flame was recorded at Cleveland's Galahad Studios and was released on Aug. 11, 2012, at a live show for Popson's bands Unified Culture and State of Conviction at Peabody's Down Under in Cleveland. The album features Devin Townsend and M. Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold In summer of 2014 the band's Facebook page mentioned a new album later in the year. The post stated the release would be a compilation of previously-released songs remixed and re-tracked to become \\"closer\\" to the vision Popson desired from the start. The title of the album was later revealed to be As The World Burns. It was released October 21st on compact disc, vinyl and digital download by Ohio-based Ferocious Records. The album features guest appearances by M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, Devin Townsend, and The Human Furnace.

He was first recorded in 1242 working as a Kings clerk, although it is assumed that he had been previously working for the government as he was, in 1242, awarded the Moiety of a church in Blackburn, and also given a papal indulgence in February 1245. He was most likely a clerk in service to one of the King's justices, but there is also the possibility that he worked for the clerk of Chancery. Before 1245 he was presented to the parish church at Kirkoswald by Thomas of Moulton, either the Thomas of Moulton who served as a royal justice or his son of the same name. In 1250 he was made Canon of Salisbury Cathedral by William of York, another royal justice. In the late 1240s Martin served as an occasional Assize Justice, but did not begin full service as a royal justice until the 1260s. In the first half of 1261 he served as a junior justice on three Eyres led by Gilbert of Preston, and became a senior justice on his own Eyre circuit when Eyres resumed in 1262. His final Eyre was in 1263 in Lincolnshire, although the circuit was never completed due to the outbreak of the Second Barons' War. He did not serve during the 1264 reign of Simon de Montford, the \\"uncrowned King of England\\", and was not returned to the bench until 1267, when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. According to official record he was a voice of moderation after the defeat of de Montford at the 1265 Battle of Evesham, calling for provisions to be made for the widows of those who had died and for the wives of noblemen who had survived but been disinherited. He served as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas until 1272, when on the death of Henry III he was appointed as the Lord Chief Justice, serving less than two years before dying in June 1274.

He was a devout Buddhist who encouraged the emperor to become a devout as well, but eventually, the corruption by him and the even more powerful chancellor Yuan Zai, with whom he had a long association, drew Emperor Daizong's ire. In 777, Yuan was executed, and Wang was demoted, never to return to the capital Chang'an.  Background  Wang Jin was born in 700, during the reign of Wu Zetian. His family was originally from Wang clan of Taiyuan, but by the time of Wang Jin was living at Hezhong (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His great- great-grandfather Wang Ruxian (), great-grandfather Wang Zhijie (), and father Wang Chulian () all served as military advisors to prefectural prefects, while his grandfather Wang Zhou () served as a low-level official at the ministry of worship. He had at least five brothers ‚Äî older brother Wang Wei and younger brothers Wang Chan (), Wang Hong (), and Wang Dan ().New Book of Tang, vol. 72.2 Wang Jin was said to be studious in his youth, and both he and Wang Wei ‚Äî who would eventually become a well-renowned poet ‚Äî were both known for their literary talents. Wang Jin passed two special imperial examinations ‚Äî one for poor provincial scholars, and one for scholars with literary talent.  Early career as imperial official  After passing the imperial examinations, Wang Jin successively served as Shiyushi (), a low-level imperial censor, and a low-level official at the ministry of defense (Ê≠¶ÈÉ®, Wubu). After the general An Lushan rebelled in 755, Wang was selected to be the deputy mayor of Taiyuan Municipality, assisting the general Li Guangbi in defending Taiyuan. It was said that his strategies greatly helped in the defense. During the rebellion (known as the Anshi Rebellion), Wang Wei was captured by the rebels and forced to assume an official post in the rebel state of Yan. After the Anshi Rebellion was largely quelled, Wang Wei was indicted and set to be punished. Wang Jin offered to resign in exchange for his brother's being spared. Wang Wei was then spared, but Wang Jin was only reduced in rank.Old Book of Tang, vol. 118. Sometime thereafter, Wang Jin was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as the principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁ•≠ÈÖí, Guozi Jijiu). He later successively served as the mayor of Fengxiang Municipality (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang), and Zuo Sanqi Changshi (), a high-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). When then-reigning Emperor Suzong's father Emperor Xuanzong, then Taishang Huang (retired emperor) died in 762, Wang was put in charge of drafting the official mourning text for Emperor Xuanzong, and the work was considered well written. Thereafter, he was made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang). After the complete end of the Anshi Rebellion (with the death of Yan's final emperor Shi Chaoyi) in 763, Emperor Suzong's son and successor Emperor Daizong (Emperor Suzong's having died as well in 762) sent Wang to survey the former Yan territory. In 764, when the chancellors Liu Yan and Li Xian were removed, Wang and Du Hongjian replaced them ‚Äî with Wang given the post of Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng); director of Taiwei Palace (); and imperial scholar at Hongwen () and Chongxian () Pavilions, in addition to the de facto chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().  As chancellor  In 764, when Li Guangbi, who was the deputy supreme commander of Tang forces in the Henan region (i.e., modern Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui) died, Emperor Daizong sent Wang Jin to Luoyang to replace him and to defend Luoyang. It appeared that he soon returned to Chang'an, however, as he was in Chang'an in 766 when the powerful eunuch Yu Chao'en, then the principal of the imperial university, tried to provoke Wang and his fellow chancellor Yuan Zai by, during a lecture about the I Ching, talking about how a ding (a large cooking vessel often used to symbolize chancellorship) would overturn if imbalanced. Wang was visibly incensed, but Yuan remained calm and pleasant, leading Yu to comment, \\"It is common for the target to get angry, but one who remains smiling needs to be paid attention to even more carefully.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. He was also at Chang'an in 767, when the general Guo Ziyi visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor, as Emperor Daizong had him, Yuan, and Yu invite Guo to feasts held in Guo's honor. In 768, when the military governor (Jiedushi) of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Li Huaixian, who had been ruling his circuit de facto independently from the imperial government, was assassinated by his subordinates Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci, and Zhu Tao, Emperor Daizong tried to take back control of the circuit by sending Wang to Lulong to serve as its military governor. When Wang subsequently arrived at Lulong, Zhu Xicai formally showed him the utmost respect, but had the soldiers be on high alert and did not allow Wang to take actual reign of the circuit. Wang, knowing that he would be unable to wrest control of the circuit from Zhu Xicai, stayed in Lulong only a few days before returning to the Tang capital Chang'an. Subsequently, Zhu Xicai was made acting military governor and, at the end of 768, military governor. Later in 768, when Xin Yunjing () the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan) died, Emperor Daizong sent Wang to Taiyuan to replace him but also had Wang retain all of his other titles. In 769, Wang offered to yield his post as deputy supreme commander and associated military titles, and Emperor Daizong agreed. Meanwhile, while he was at Hedong, the officers Wang Wuzong () and Zhang Fengzhang () both believed that since he was a civilian, they could disobey him without consequence. In fall 769, when he ordered them to lead soldiers to the western borders with the Tibetan Empire to guard against Tibetan attacks, Zhang stalled, while Wang Wuzong reentered the city of Taiyuan without permission. He executed them both, and thereafter the officers did not dare to disobey him any further. In 770, he returned to Chang'an. Throughout the years, Yuan became the leading chancellor at court, particularly after he helped Emperor Daizong kill Yu in 770. It was said that Wang was obedient to Yuan and therefore their relationship remained well, although Wang was known for his arrogance ‚Äî an arrogance that even Yuan was displeased with. At that time, the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (), which encompassed Chang'an, was Li Gan (), who was willing to criticize Yuan's governance. On one occasion, when Li was reporting to Wang, Wang insulted Li, who was from Rong Prefecture (ÊàéÂ∑û, in modern Yibin, Sichuan), by stating, \\"You are a southern gentleman. What do you know about the protocols at court?\\" Wang Jin and his brothers were all devout Buddhists, and Wang himself ate no meat at all. After his wife Lady Li died, he made his mansion into a Buddhist temple known as Baoying Temple (), to seek blessings for Lady Li. It was said that whenever regional governors arrived at Chang'an, he would take them on a tour of Baoying Temple in order to pressure them into donating to the temple. Due to the influence of not only Wang, but also Yuan and Du (who died in 769 ‚Äî after first taking tonsure), who were both Buddhists as well, Emperor Daizong also became a devout Buddhist and came under the deep belief that if he remained devout, whatever disasters the empire suffered would not destroy the empire. He thus ordered that Buddhist monks and nuns not be punished for any reason, and that many temples be built. As a result of the emperor's and the chancellors' devotion to Buddhism, many officials became Buddhists as well, and the Old Book of Tang attributed the lack of accomplishments by the imperial administration during Emperor Daizong's reign to this. By 777, it was said that both Yuan and Wang were exceedingly corrupt, and while Emperor Daizong tolerated them, he was becoming displeased. In 777, he had his uncle, the general Wu Cou (), arrest them. They were interrogated by a panel of five officials, including Liu Yan and Li Han (). Yuan was executed. Originally, Wang was to be sentenced to forced suicide, but at Liu's suggestion ‚Äî pointing out that Wang was less culpable than Yuan ‚Äî Emperor Daizong spared Wang's life and demoted him to be the prefect of Kuo Prefecture (Êã¨Â∑û, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang).  After demotion  In 779, Wang Jin was given the honorary position of staff member for Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo, but was not allowed to return to Chang'an; rather, he was ordered to settle in at Luoyang. He died around new year 782, early in Li Kuo's reign (as Emperor Dezong).

Biography  Gu√©rard served his apprenticeship at the patisserie of Kleber Alix, in Mantes-La-Jolie. He worked at a number of Parisian restaurants, including Maxim's, and in 1958 won the Meilleur Ouvrier de France Patisserie, while working as a pastry chef at the H√¥tel de Crillon. He also worked at Le Lido. In 1965 Gu√©rard opened a restaurant in Paris called Le Pot-au-Feu, which in 1967 earned Gu√©rard his first star in the Michelin Guide. The restaurant gained a second star in 1971, and was successful until it was compulsorily acquired for the purposes of a road-widening. In 1972 Gu√©rard met Christine Barthelemy, the daughter of the founder of the Biotherm range and the owner of a chain of spas and hotels. They married, and in 1974 he moved with her to Eug√©nie-les-Bains, where she was running one of her family's smaller, less successful spas. They restored the buildings, and Gu√©rard invented a style of food, cuisine minceur, a form of healthy cooking, designed to lure health- conscious Parisians to travel the 800 km to Eug√©nie. In 1977 his main restaurant received three Michelin stars, and all his properties in Eug√©nie have been very successful, transforming the tiny village into a significant tourist destination. In 1983 Christine and Michel purchased the Ch√¢teau de Bachen, replanting the vineyards, and producing their first harvest in 1988.

The histories of franchises in the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP), National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), Union Association (UA), and American Association (AA) before they joined the National League are also included. In 1900 the minor league Western League renamed itself the American League (AL). All of the 1899 Western League teams were a part of the transformation with the Saint Paul Apostles moving to Chicago and to play as the White Stockings. In 1901 the AL declared itself a Major League. For its inaugural major league season the AL dropped its teams in Indianapolis, Buffalo and Minneapolis and replaced them with franchises in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore and the Kansas City Blues moved to Washington to play as the Senators. The first line is the formation of the National League in 1876, and the second is the transformation of the American League to a major league in 1901. The third line is the beginning of the expansion era in 1961.

The object of the game is to move a hockey puck through the center dividers, of the box, out through a hole placed at each end of the box, also known as the goal. The two players face one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to their left. If a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point (or goal). The first player to score the predetermined number of goals wins the game. History Four-player box hockey being played in Miami, FL 1935 Box hockey has little known origin, but the game has been around since at least the late 19th century, as described in various game books, such as Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gym (Jessie H. Bancroft, 1913) and 400 Games for School, Home, and Playground (F.A. Owen Pub. Co., 1920). Box Hockey was listed as the \\"Game of the Month\\" as published in the 1914 Volume 2 of the \\"Recreational helps\\" by the New York State College of Agriculture Department of Rural Sociology with the following description: > \\"Box hockey is an excellent active game for picnics camps and playgrounds. > It can also be adapted to indoor recreation if the floor upon which it is > played is well padded with old rugs to prevent being damaged with the hockey > sticks.\\" \\"Equipment: Take two pieces [boards] of lumber 2 inches by 10 > inches by 8 or 10 feet [5 cm √ó 25 cm √ó 2.4 or 3.0 m], and two [end] pieces 1 > inch by 10 inches by 4 foot [2.5 cm √ó 25 cm √ó 1.2 m] and construct a > rectangular box fastening it together with spike nails or wagon bed rods. > Take another board 2 inches by 10 inches by 4 feet [5 cm √ó 25 cm √ó 1.2 m] > and nail it into the rectangular frame, dividing it into two equal > compartments. On the bottom side of the box, cut a hole inches at the base > and about inches high [8.9 cm √ó 6.4 cm] in the center of each of the end > boards, and cut two such holes in the bottom of the dividing board, which > make the two equal compartments. These last two holes should be equidistant > from the sides of the box. Now get a couple of three-foot [91 cm] sticks and > an old baseball and you are ready to play. Almost any kind of a stick will > do. Saplings cut off underneath the ground so as to get the curve are very > good. Also cheap commercial hockey sticks with the blade reinforced with > vtirc are excellent.\\" Around 1937, Milton Bradley sold a box hockey game (model No. 4125).\\"AGCA-The Game Catalog, 8th Edition, Oct. 1998 By the late 1930s and into the 1940s, it was not uncommon for towns to host youth box hockey tournaments, such as in Reading, Pennsylvania, where the winners of the Essick Playground and Oakbrook were reported by the local newspaper in the July 11, 1939, July 4, 1941 and June 29, 1949 issues of the Reading Eagle. By the 1950s, Sears & Roebuck was selling a mass-produced version of box hockey for 50 cents.The Milwaukee Journal - Aug 8, 1950 In the mid-1950s adult box hockey clubs in Eugene, Oregon battled for the title \\"Springfield Box Hockey service club champions\\".Eugene Register-Guard - Mar 7, 1954 In the mid-1950s, Larry Best, Director of Recreation for the Milton Hershey School for Boys in Hershey, PA (the Milton Hershey School was established in 1909 by Milton S. Hershey), in search of an activity that would be healthy, active and fun for the students, became aware of the game BOX HOCKEY and introduced it to the students as part of their summer recreation program. Individual play as well as school tournaments were promoted, and Box Hockey is still an active program at the school with almost 75 student homes (approx. 16 students per home) each having a game set today, manufactured by Box Hockey International, Inc.http://www.box-hockey.com World Wide Games, Inc. in Delaware, Ohio, manufactured the suitcase-style hockey box in 1965; one is on display at the Elliott Avedon Museum & Archive of Games. In the mid-1970s to early 1980s, box hockey had a major resurgence in the United States, as a part of the dramatic increase in funding and staffing in municipal recreation and parks departments across the country to reduce youth crime and violence that was prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, by providing activities to keep teenagers active and social. In 1994, Andy Brody founded Box Hockey International and started to market and mass-produce the larger floor version.http://www.box- hockey.com/ This variant of the game features multiple walls with staggered \\"mouse holes\\" through which the puck must be passed to reach either goal. Today, many children play the larger floor version in summer camps throughout the upper part of North America, such as Triumphant Life Camp in Larabee Valley, California, Wilderness Northwest on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state,http://www.wildernessnw.org/ and Shady Hollow Campground in Brainerd, Minnesota.http://www.shadyhollowresort.com/ Box hockey is also used for agility training in hockey schools and camps throughout Canada and the U.S. \\"Coaches Corner\\", Hyland Hills Hockey Association, Canadian Hockey Video Series (noted \\"dryland exercises\\" for stickhandling skills, box hockey), webpage: HHHA82. Handmade suitcase-style box hockey games are still available at crafts events like the Lowell Folk Festival in Lowell, Massachusetts. Each year they also have a dozen or so set up for playing during the festivities. Modern rules *To start the game (and after each goal), the puck is placed under the center mouse hole. Each player raps the bottom of the box with his hockey stick and then taps his opponent's blade, repeating this three times. After the third tap, both players can go after the puck and play begins. *Each player hits the puck with his hockey stick blade, attempting to move the puck through the holes to his left (see diagram) and out the hole at the end of the box (the goal). *In addition to advancing the puck towards his own goal, each player can use his blade to block his opponent's progress or to steal the puck. *It is legal to use the blade to block the goal from either inside or outside of the box. *When a player succeeds in getting the puck to exit the box through the goal, the player scores one point. *The first player to score 11 points wins the game. Traditional rules Box Hockey in the streets of Philadelphia 1930 *Each player stands on opposite sides of the box. Your goal is to the right as you face the box, and your opponent's goal is to the left. *To start, and after each goal, the puck placed flat, centered, on top of middle wall for the face off. Each player taps the bottom of their side of the box with their stick and then raises it to tap their opponent's stick directly above the puck in rhythm, repeating this three times. After the third tap, both players try to knock the puck off the wall. *Each player takes turns with two hits, and whichever side of the center wall the puck lands on determines who goes first. The player with the furthest distance to score goes first. *Each player hits the puck with their stick, moving the puck through the holes to their left (see diagram) and through goal. *To score, you must get the puck completely through your opponent's goal. *Interfering with your opponent is not allowed. *The dragging or carrying of the puck is not allowed. *Pinning the puck in the corner is allowed. *The first player to score 3 goals wins the game. * \\"McPherson's Rules\\", also occasionally utilized at the \\"Waterworks\\" do not prohibit interference, but in fact, encourage it. Speed and interference are tantamount to finesse and aptitude while eliminating any need for prohibition of \\"dragging\\". Modern equipment The equipment needed to play the game is as follows: #Box. Approximately 8 ft long by 3.3 ft wide by 1 ft high (2.4 m √ó 1.0 m √ó 0.30 m) constructed with a plywood bottom and three plywood dividers (to create four sections in the box). Each divider has one or more \\"mouse holes\\" that are slightly wider than the puck. #Two hockey sticks, shortened. Each player uses one floor hockey stick (plastic) whose shaft has been shortened to . #One hockey puck. A floor hockey puck (plastic, hollow) is the best type of puck to be used in box hockey. Box construction and dimensions Player orientation and puck travel Traditional equipment The equipment needed to play the game is as follows: #Box.

Associated genealogies Modern and medieval historians have sought to associate various versions of the same Old Welsh pedigree with Glastonbury. The earliest genealogy is a 10th-century text, the Harleian Genealogies, preserved in London, British Library, Harleian MS 3859, which ends with Glast and states unum sunt Glastenic qui uenerunt que uocatur Loytcoyt, or \\"one of those who came to Glastenning from the place called Luit-Coyt\\" (modern Lichfield). Other versions are given in the later Achau Brenhinoedd a Thywysogion Cymru and William of Malmesbury's De antiquitate Glastonie ecclesie, where the pedigree is listed as brothers. From the versions it not clear whether Glast was a personal name or a kindred group as Glastening, \\"descendants of Glasten\\", or an epithet Glas meaning \\"the Blue, Green or Grey\\". In literature The Glastening may be connected in some way to the Sumorsaete, an obscure Anglo- Saxon group who may have given their name to Somerset. According to William of Malmesbury, Glast was one of twelve brothers who migrated from the north to assume control of parts of Wales (the Britons still held much of the west of Britain) who were great-grandsons of Cunedda. He settled in Glastonbury with his livestock after finding it deserted. The 14th century codex from Oxford, Bodleian Library, Jesus College 20, actually gives Glas map Elno (or Elnaw) as the great-grandson of Cunedda. David Thornton finds \\"no strong evidence\\" for the association of the pedigree of the Glastening with Glastonbury other than the similarity of the names. He concludes that the Glastening had an association with Lichfield (problems of textual corruption making it difficult to be precise about the relationship) and that \\"their sojourn in Glastonbury, however, is the product of medieval pseudo-historical thought supported by the zealous ingenuity of subsequent scholars.\\" It is unclear when Glastonbury was first established, but it is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th centuries, as Glestingaburg. The burg element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure. However the Glestinga element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name.

He was the son of Octave Doyen (1831‚Äì1895), who served as mayor of Reims. Eug√®ne Doyen studied medicine in Reims and Paris, and later opened a private medical institute in Paris that attracted a wealthy clientele. Doyen was a skilled and innovative physician who introduced several surgical techniques and medical instruments, some of which bear his name today. He was a pioneer in the use of electrosurgery and electrocoagulation, and also marketed a yeast extract he called \\"mycolysine\\" for treatment of infectious diseases. He had a keen interest in photography and cinematography, and performed early experiments of color film, microcinematography and stereoscopic film. He produced numerous films of operations, including a craniectomy, an abdominal hysterectomy, and a surgery for separation of conjoined twins Radhika and Dudhika Nayak, united in the area of the xiphoid process of the sternum. Although his films were popular at medical conferences abroad, they were harshly criticized by his contemporaries in France, who felt that the integrity of their profession had been compromised.

The film won several awards.IMDb.com awards It was shot in several locations of Curitiba, Paran√°. Plot The film shows in parallel two periods in the life of Raimundo Nonato (Jo√£o Miguel): one follows his successful career as a cook, the other as a prisoner in a cell with about ten other convicts. It gradually becomes clear that these events happen after the former. His period as a cook starts when he arrives by bus in a big city, without a place to sleep nor money for food. After eating chicken snacks in a cafeteria, he has to wash the dishes to pay for it and is eventually offered a job, receiving merely food and lodging as payment, even though the snacks he cooks are so good it attracts more customers. Nonato falls in love with √çria, a gluttonous prostitute, who offers her services in exchange for food. He also gets a better job in an Italian restaurant, where he learns more of cooking from his boss Giovanni. One day he finds Giovanni having sex with √çria, despite he having proposed to her earlier. Enraged, he steals and drinks from his boss' prized wine collection, before murdering them both and cannibalizing a slice of meat removed from √çria's buttocks. In the prison cell there is a power hierarchy with Buji√∫ (Babu Santana) at the top. The food is poor, and Nonato is assigned to cook better food. The inmates are usually quite satisfied with it, and Nonato rises in the hierarchy. However, Buji√∫ rejects Gorgonzola, raw meat, and cooked ants, much to Raimundo's frustration. When top-criminal Etcetera, who is highly regarded by the inmates, arrives, Buji√∫ decides that a great meal should be cooked to please him.

Graham originated from an area of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low pressure that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported. Meteorological history On 23 February 2003, an area of convection that was situated over land for roughly a week emerged over open waters along the northern coast of Australia. The strengthening of a deep, persistent monsoon trough contributed to cyclogenesis, and a low pressure area formed. By 25 February, the low developed a banding feature in which the highest winds were located. Though the storm was located in an area of unfavorable wind shear, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) began to issue gale warnings on the system at 0100 UTC the next day, while the low was located several hundred miles north- northeast of Port Hedland. The disturbance was initially nearly stationary as it showed signs of organization due to relaxed shear, and at 0700 UTC on 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone Graham, as it had attained 80 km/h (50 mph) 10-minute maximum sustained winds. The first warning was issued on Graham later that day. Initially exhibiting characteristics of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge to the south of Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though at the same time the BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast. The storm made landfall at Western Australia's Eighty Mile Beach at 1400 UTC on 28 February, and began to weaken. The storm had dissipated on 1 March; the BoM issued their last advisory on the cyclone at 0400 UTC that day, while similarly, the JTWC issued their last advisory just two hours later. The storm's remnants died out in the country's desert. Impact In advance of the cyclone, the communities of Wallal, Sandfire, Punmu and Telfer were put on alert. A warning was issued for Bidyadanga, Pardoo and Cotton Creek. The storm's landfall in Western Australia brought heavy rainfall and high winds. The storm dropped of rain at Telfer in one night, over half the town's annual average; total rainfall reached there. The heavy rain caused flooding and road closures, and swelled a river passing through Fitzroy Crossing, though the river only topped its banks slightly. Near that town, at Blue Bush Creek, while a group of people attempted to cross floodwaters, two men were swept away. Both men were rescued, though one died before emergency services arrived. In addition to the flooding, a number of trees were downed. No significant damages were reported. Following the storm, the name Graham was retired from the Australian region basin.

It is a crepe-like dish made of thin buckwheat batter and napa cabbage. Along with other buckwheat dishes, it is a traditional local speciality of Gangwon Province, where buckwheat is extensively cultivated due to its cooler mountainous climate. Pyeongchang and Jeongseon counties are famous for buckwheat dishes such as memilmuk (buckwheat jelly) and memilguksu (buckwheat noodles). Pyeongchang's biggest local festival was called Memilbuchigi festival before it was renamed Pyeongchang Festival in 2015. (Memilbuchigi means memilbuchimgae in Gangwon dialect.) Numerous memilbuchimgae can be seen in Pyeongchang Market, a farmers' market held in Pyeongchang every five days. Preparation Memilbuchimgae The batter is prepared by mixing buckwheat flour and water to a thin consistency. Sometimes a small amount of wheat flour or starch can be added to it because buckwheat has less glutinous elements. In a traditional way, buckwheat mixed with water is ground by millstone and the batter is strained through a sieve. The filtered batter is cooked on a sodang (ÏÜåÎãπ) which is the lid of a sot (ÏÜ•, a traditional big pot) and used for pan-frying. Several pieces of vertically ripped salted napa cabbage and scallions are put on the heated sodang, and the batter is poured over them from their margin. Sour kimchi can be replaced with the cabbage. When making the memilbuchimgae, the batter should be poured thinly because thick memilbuchimgae is considered less delicious. Perilla oil is used to cook the dish. Foods made with memilbuchimgae Bingtteok, Jeju specialty. Memilbuchimgae can be an ingredient to make other dishes such as memil chongtteok (Î©îÎ∞ÄÏ¥ùÎñ°) or also called memil jeonbyeong (Î©îÎ∞ÄÏ†ÑÎ≥ë). The dish is formed like a dumpling or wrap stuffed with any available ingredient according to recipe, taste, or region. In the Jeju region, the dish is called bingtteok (ÎπôÎñ°) or Jejudo bindaetteok and stuffed with boiled shredded radish. The fillings commonly used in Gangwon Province are japchae (noodle salad), shredded sour kimchi, radish, scallions, garlic, and pork or squid which are seasoned and stir-fried together. In the Pyeongchang region, half transparent noodles called cheonsachae (Ï≤úÏÇ¨Ï±Ñ), which are made from kelp, are especially used. The dish is considered a good anju because the combination of the savoury and a bit blend taste from memilbuchimgae' and pungent taste from the inner makes a good companion for drinking alcoholic beverages.

It contains conference rooms and is used for state functions and receptions of foreign guests. It consists of several palace-like structures extending over . History King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) commissioned the Italian architect Annibale Rigotti to design the main building in 1923, although construction would remain incomplete as Rigotti returned to Italy after the king's death in 1925. The house was originally called Baan Norasingha (). Initially intended as a family residence for one of the king's favorite generals, General Chao Phraya Ram Rakop, the building became the prime minister's office in 1941. Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram then assigned Italian sculptor and artist Corrado Feroci to complete construction (also working on the building at this point was the architect Ercole Manfredi). The main building is crowned with a golden dome housing a statue of Phra Phrom (Brahma) and its fa√ßade resembles that of the Ca' d'Oro Palazzo in Venice. During the 2008 Thai political crisis, People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) protesters besieged Government House. After a court order, they had to move, but then attempted to block the government house once more and succeeded. The cabinet temporarily moved to Don Mueang International Airport. The protesters then besieged Don Mueang International Airport soon after that, giving the cabinet no place to work. On 1 December 2008, after protesting for three months, the protesters left Government House as there were constant attacks. Government House was again besieged in December 2013 during the 2013‚Äì2014 Thai political crisis.

The Phitsanulok Mansion nearby is the official residence of the prime minister. The building has two floors with a neo-Venetian Gothic architecture combined with Byzantine art and one staircase. On the roof there is a small shrine to Lord Brahma. Downstairs are three lounges. The first is the Golden Dome Room on the south side of the building for the prime minister's guests. The second is the Ivory Room which is in front of the Golden Dome Room and adjacent to the right, which is a lounge for official visitors of the prime minister. The third is the Purple Room, which is on the ground floor to the right-hand side of the building. This is a lounge for the visitors of the deputy prime minister and other cabinet ministers.

They numbered 8,512 as of the 2009 census and mainly live in Minsk.  History  The settlement of Armenians in Belarus in the 20th century was episodic and due mainly to the needs of trade. The most important of these transpired in the latter part of the 1980s when the Armenian population began to increase. In 1989, the census figures revealed that the ethnic group reached 4,933, accounting for 0.04 percent of the Belarusian population. A decade later, their population more than doubled, reaching 10,191 or 0.1 percent of the country's population.National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus: NATIONAL COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS, 1999 The uptick in the number of Armenians, however, has led to the consolidation and the emergence of an organized Armenian diaspora in the country. Particularly, the Armenian community has been characterized by high activity for the benefit of the state. Over the past decade, from among the Armenian diaspora came a large number of prominent scientific and creative intellectuals, government officials and business leaders. One notable characteristic of Armenians in Belarus in comparison to the Armenians living in other countries is that they are perceived to be allied with Russians. This is not the case with Armenians liking in countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and Kazakhstan where Armenians are perceived to side with titulars and hostile towards the Russians. The Chairman of Armenian diaspora in Belarus is Eghiazaryan George Anushavanovich.  Notable people  Many Armenians took part in the territory of Belarus during the establishment of Soviet power and the fighting in the Eastern Front of 1941-1945. Some Armenians fought for the Soviet Union during this time, and received awards for their service. These include the following: * Aleksandr Myasnikyan - one of the leaders of the struggle for Soviet power on the western front, the first chairman of the Central Election Commission of Belarus. * Hamazasp Babadzhanian - Chief Marshal of Armored Forces. Hero of the Soviet Union. * Gayk Bzhishkyan - The Soviet military leader, hero of the Civil War. Participated in the liberation of Belarus. * Ivan Yalibekov - one of the leaders of the struggle for Soviet power in Belarus. * Hovhannes Bagramyan - Marshal, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, the commander of the 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian fronts. * Sergey Sardarov - Colonel General of aviation. Commander of the 2nd Army Air Defense separate. He lived and died in Minsk. * Nvokyan Gozoros - Hero of the Soviet Union, made famous during the battle for the liberation of Belarus from Nazi invaders. Numerous streets were renamed after Armenian soldiers in Minsk, Belarus in order to commend them. In the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1989 there were 4,933 Armenians.Demoscope Weekly: All-Union census of 1989. National composition of population in the republics of the USSR The second wave of Armenian immigrants appeared in Belarus after the events of 1988 in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the 1988 Spitak earthquake and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. During the ten years from 1989 to 1999, the number of Armenians in Belarus doubled.  Bibliography  * A.

Carapezza, Date: 15 September 2004,, See Chapter: Counter-terrorism threat prediction architecture This framework has been developed by Leonid Perlovsky at the AFRL. NMF is interpreted as a mathematical description of mind‚Äôs mechanisms, including concepts, emotions, instincts, imagination, thinking, and understanding. NMF is a multi-level, hetero-hierarchical system. At each level in NMF there are concept-models encapsulating the knowledge; they generate so-called top-down signals, interacting with input, bottom-up signals. These interactions are governed by dynamic equations, which drive concept-model learning, adaptation, and formation of new concept-models for better correspondence to the input, bottom-up signals. Concept models and similarity measures In the general case, NMF system consists of multiple processing levels. At each level, output signals are the concepts recognized in (or formed from) input, bottom-up signals. Input signals are associated with (or recognized, or grouped into) concepts according to the models and at this level. In the process of learning the concept-models are adapted for better representation of the input signals so that similarity between the concept-models and signals increases. This increase in similarity can be interpreted as satisfaction of an instinct for knowledge, and is felt as aesthetic emotions. Each hierarchical level consists of N \\"neurons\\" enumerated by index n=1,2..N. These neurons receive input, bottom-up signals, X(n), from lower levels in the processing hierarchy. X(n) is a field of bottom-up neuronal synaptic activations, coming from neurons at a lower level. Each neuron has a number of synapses; for generality, each neuron activation is described as a set of numbers, : \\\\vec X(n) = \\\\\\\\{ X_d(n) \\\\\\\\}, d = 1..D. , where D is the number or dimensions necessary to describe individual neuron's activation. Top-down, or priming signals to these neurons are sent by concept-models, Mm(Sm,n) : \\\\vec M_m(\\\\vec S_m, n), m = 1..M. , where M is the number of models. Each model is characterized by its parameters, Sm; in the neuron structure of the brain they are encoded by strength of synaptic connections, mathematically, they are given by a set of numbers, : \\\\vec S_m = \\\\\\\\{ S_m^a \\\\\\\\}, a = 1..A. , where A is the number of dimensions necessary to describe individual model. Models represent signals in the following way. Suppose that signal X(n) is coming from sensory neurons n activated by object m, which is characterized by parameters Sm. These parameters may include position, orientation, or lighting of an object m. Model Mm(Sm,n) predicts a value X(n) of a signal at neuron n. For example, during visual perception, a neuron n in the visual cortex receives a signal X(n) from retina and a priming signal Mm(Sm,n) from an object-concept-model m. Neuron n is activated if both the bottom-up signal from lower-level-input and the top-down priming signal are strong. Various models compete for evidence in the bottom-up signals, while adapting their parameters for better match as described below. This is a simplified description of perception. The most benign everyday visual perception uses many levels from retina to object perception. The NMF premise is that the same laws describe the basic interaction dynamics at each level. Perception of minute features, or everyday objects, or cognition of complex abstract concepts is due to the same mechanism described below. Perception and cognition involve concept-models and learning. In perception, concept-models correspond to objects; in cognition models correspond to relationships and situations. Learning is an essential part of perception and cognition, and in NMF theory it is driven by the dynamics that increase a similarity measure between the sets of models and signals, L({X},{M}). The similarity measure is a function of model parameters and associations between the input bottom-up signals and top-down, concept- model signals. In constructing a mathematical description of the similarity measure, it is important to acknowledge two principles: :First, the visual field content is unknown before perception occurred :Second, it may contain any of a number of objects. Important information could be contained in any bottom-up signal; Therefore, the similarity measure is constructed so that it accounts for all bottom-up signals, X(n), : L( \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec X(n)\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec M_m( \\\\vec S_m, n)\\\\\\\\} ) = \\\\prod_{n=1}^N{l(\\\\vec X(n))}. (1) This expression contains a product of partial similarities, l(X(n)), over all bottom-up signals; therefore it forces the NMF system to account for every signal (even if one term in the product is zero, the product is zero, the similarity is low and the knowledge instinct is not satisfied); this is a reflection of the first principle. Second, before perception occurs, the mind does not know which object gave rise to a signal from a particular retinal neuron. Therefore a partial similarity measure is constructed so that it treats each model as an alternative (a sum over concept-models) for each input neuron signal. Its constituent elements are conditional partial similarities between signal X(n) and model Mm, l(X(n)m). This measure is ‚Äúconditional‚Äù on object m being present, therefore, when combining these quantities into the overall similarity measure, L, they are multiplied by r(m), which represent a probabilistic measure of object m actually being present. Combining these elements with the two principles noted above, a similarity measure is constructed as follows: : L( \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec X(n)\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{\\\\vec M_m( \\\\vec S_m, n)\\\\\\\\} ) = \\\\prod_{n=1}^N{ \\\\sum_{m=1}^M { r(m) l(\\\\vec X(n)  m) } }. (2) The structure of the expression above follows standard principles of the probability theory: a summation is taken over alternatives, m, and various pieces of evidence, n, are multiplied. This expression is not necessarily a probability, but it has a probabilistic structure. If learning is successful, it approximates probabilistic description and leads to near-optimal Bayesian decisions. The name ‚Äúconditional partial similarity‚Äù for l(X(n)m) (or simply l(nm)) follows the probabilistic terminology. If learning is successful, l(nm) becomes a conditional probability density function, a probabilistic measure that signal in neuron n originated from object m. Then L is a total likelihood of observing signals {X(n)} coming from objects described by concept-model {Mm}. Coefficients r(m), called priors in probability theory, contain preliminary biases or expectations, expected objects m have relatively high r(m) values; their true values are usually unknown and should be learned, like other parameters Sm. Note that in probability theory, a product of probabilities usually assumes that evidence is independent. Expression for L contains a product over n, but it does not assume independence among various signals X(n). There is a dependence among signals due to concept-models: each model Mm(Sm,n) predicts expected signal values in many neurons n. During the learning process, concept-models are constantly modified. Usually, the functional forms of models, Mm(Sm,n), are all fixed and learning-adaptation involves only model parameters, Sm. From time to time a system forms a new concept, while retaining an old one as well; alternatively, old concepts are sometimes merged or eliminated. This requires a modification of the similarity measure L; The reason is that more models always result in a better fit between the models and data. This is a well known problem, it is addressed by reducing similarity L using a ‚Äúskeptic penalty function,‚Äù (Penalty method) p(N,M) that grows with the number of models M, and this growth is steeper for a smaller amount of data N. For example, an asymptotically unbiased maximum likelihood estimation leads to multiplicative p(N,M) = exp(-Npar/2), where Npar is a total number of adaptive parameters in all models (this penalty function is known as Akaike information criterion, see (Perlovsky 2001) for further discussion and references). Learning in NMF using dynamic logic algorithm The learning process consists of estimating model parameters S and associating signals with concepts by maximizing the similarity L. Note that all possible combinations of signals and models are accounted for in expression (2) for L. This can be seen by expanding a sum and multiplying all the terms resulting in MN items, a huge number. This is the number of combinations between all signals (N) and all models (M). This is the source of Combinatorial Complexity, which is solved in NMF by utilizing the idea of dynamic logic,.Perlovsky, L.I. (1996). Mathematical Concepts of Intellect. Proc. World Congress on Neural Networks, San Diego, CA; Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, NJ, pp.1013-16Perlovsky, L.I.(1997). Physical Concepts of Intellect. Proc. Russian Academy of Sciences, 354(3), pp. 320-323. An important aspect of dynamic logic is matching vagueness or fuzziness of similarity measures to the uncertainty of models. Initially, parameter values are not known, and uncertainty of models is high; so is the fuzziness of the similarity measures. In the process of learning, models become more accurate, and the similarity measure more crisp, the value of the similarity increases. The maximization of similarity L is done as follows. First, the unknown parameters {Sm} are randomly initialized. Then the association variables f(mn) are computed, : f(mn) = \\\\frac{r(m) l( \\\\vec X(nm)) }{ \\\\sum_{m'=1}^M { r(m') l( \\\\vec X(nm')) } } (3). Equation for f(mn) looks like the Bayes formula for a posteriori probabilities; if l(nm) in the result of learning become conditional likelihoods, f(mn) become Bayesian probabilities for signal n originating from object m. The dynamic logic of the NMF is defined as follows: : \\\\frac{d \\\\vec S_m }{dt} = \\\\sum_{n=1}^N { f(mn) \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\ln l(nm)} }{\\\\partial{\\\\vec M_m} } \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\vec M_m}}{\\\\partial{\\\\vec S_m}} } (4). : \\\\frac{df(mn)}{dt} = f(mn)\\\\sum_{m'=1}^M { [\\\\delta_{mm'} - f(m'n)] \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\ln l(nm')}}{\\\\partial{\\\\vec M_{m'}}} } \\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\vec M_{m'}}}{\\\\partial{\\\\vec S_{m'}}} \\\\frac{d \\\\vec S_{m'}}{dt} (5) The following theorem has been proved (Perlovsky 2001): Theorem. Equations (3), (4), and (5) define a convergent dynamic NMF system with stationary states defined by max{Sm}L. It follows that the stationary states of an MF system are the maximum similarity states. When partial similarities are specified as probability density functions (pdf), or likelihoods, the stationary values of parameters {Sm} are asymptotically unbiased and efficient estimates of these parameters.Cramer, H. (1946). Mathematical Methods of Statistics, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ. The computational complexity of dynamic logic is linear in N. Practically, when solving the equations through successive iterations, f(mn) can be recomputed at every iteration using (3), as opposed to incremental formula (5). The proof of the above theorem contains a proof that similarity L increases at each iteration. This has a psychological interpretation that the instinct for increasing knowledge is satisfied at each step, resulting in the positive emotions: NMF-dynamic logic system emotionally enjoys learning. Example of dynamic logic operations Finding patterns below noise can be an exceedingly complex problem. If an exact pattern shape is not known and depends on unknown parameters, these parameters should be found by fitting the pattern model to the data. However, when the locations and orientations of patterns are not known, it is not clear which subset of the data points should be selected for fitting. A standard approach for solving this kind of problem is multiple hypothesis testing (Singer et al. 1974). Since all combinations of subsets and models are exhaustively searched, this method faces the problem of combinatorial complexity. In the current example, noisy ‚Äòsmile‚Äô and ‚Äòfrown‚Äô patterns are sought. They are shown in Fig.1a without noise, and in Fig.1b with the noise, as actually measured. The true number of patterns is 3, which is not known. Therefore, at least 4 patterns should be fit to the data, to decide that 3 patterns fit best. The image size in this example is 100x100 = 10,000 points. If one attempts to fit 4 models to all subsets of 10,000 data points, computation of complexity, MN ~ 106000. An alternative computation by searching through the parameter space, yields lower complexity: each pattern is characterized by a 3-parameter parabolic shape. Fitting 4x3=12 parameters to 100x100 grid by a brute-force testing would take about 1032 to 1040 operations, still a prohibitive computational complexity. To apply NMF and dynamic logic to this problem one needs to develop parametric adaptive models of expected patterns. The models and conditional partial similarities for this case are described in details in:Linnehan, R., Mutz, Perlovsky, L.I., C., Weijers, B., Schindler, J., Brockett, R. (2003). Detection of Patterns Below Clutter in Images. Int. Conf. On Integration of Knowledge Intensive Multi-Agent Systems, Cambridge, MA Oct.1-3, 2003. a uniform model for noise, Gaussian blobs for highly-fuzzy, poorly resolved patterns, and parabolic models for ‚Äòsmiles‚Äô and ‚Äòfrowns‚Äô. The number of computer operations in this example was about 1010. Thus, a problem that was not solvable due to combinatorial complexity becomes solvable using dynamic logic. During an adaptation process, initially fuzzy and uncertain models are associated with structures in the input signals, and fuzzy models become more definite and crisp with successive iterations. The type, shape, and number, of models are selected so that the internal representation within the system is similar to input signals: the NMF concept-models represent structure-objects in the signals. The figure below illustrates operations of dynamic logic. In Fig. 1(a) true ‚Äòsmile‚Äô and ‚Äòfrown‚Äô patterns are shown without noise; (b) actual image available for recognition (signal is below noise, signal-to-noise ratio is between ‚Äì2dB and ‚Äì0.7dB); (c) an initial fuzzy model, a large fuzziness corresponds to uncertainty of knowledge; (d) through (m) show improved models at various iteration stages (total of 22 iterations). Every five iterations the algorithm tried to increase or decrease the number of models. Between iterations (d) and (e) the algorithm decided, that it needs three Gaussian models for the ‚Äòbest‚Äô fit. There are several types of models: one uniform model describing noise (it is not shown) and a variable number of blob models and parabolic models; their number, location, and curvature are estimated from the data. Until about stage (g) the algorithm used simple blob models, at (g) and beyond, the algorithm decided that it needs more complex parabolic models to describe the data. Iterations stopped at (h), when similarity stopped increasing. Fig.1.

Between stages (d) and (e) the algorithm tried to fit the data with more than one model and decided, that it needs three blob- models to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô the content of the data. There are several types of models: one uniform model describing noise (it is not shown) and a variable number of blob-models and parabolic models, which number, location, and curvature are estimated from the data. Until about stage (g) the algorithm ‚Äòthought‚Äô in terms of simple blob models, at (g) and beyond, the algorithm decided that it needs more complex parabolic models to describe the data. Iterations stopped at (m), when similarity L stopped increasing. This example is discussed in more details in (Linnehan et al. 2003). Neural modeling fields hierarchical organization Above, a single processing level in a hierarchical NMF system was described. At each level of hierarchy there are input signals from lower levels, models, similarity measures (L), emotions, which are defined as changes in similarity, and actions; actions include adaptation, behavior satisfying the knowledge instinct ‚Äì maximization of similarity. An input to each level is a set of signals X(n), or in neural terminology, an input field of neuronal activations. The result of signal processing at a given level are activated models, or concepts m recognized in the input signals n; these models along with the corresponding instinctual signals and emotions may activate behavioral models and generate behavior at this level. The activated models initiate other actions. They serve as input signals to the next processing level, where more general concept-models are recognized or created. Output signals from a given level, serving as input to the next level, are the model activation signals, am, defined as am = ‚àën=1..N f(mn). The hierarchical NMF system is illustrated in Fig. 2. Within the hierarchy of the mind, each concept-model finds its ‚Äúmental‚Äù meaning and purpose at a higher level (in addition to other purposes). For example, consider a concept-model ‚Äúchair.‚Äù It has a ‚Äúbehavioral‚Äù purpose of initiating sitting behavior (if sitting is required by the body), this is the ‚Äúbodily‚Äù purpose at the same hierarchical level. In addition, it has a ‚Äúpurely mental‚Äù purpose at a higher level in the hierarchy, a purpose of helping to recognize a more general concept, say of a ‚Äúconcert hall,‚Äù a model of which contains rows of chairs. Fig.2. Hierarchical NMF system. At each level of a hierarchy there are models, similarity measures, and actions (including adaptation, maximizing the knowledge instinct - similarity). High levels of partial similarity measures correspond to concepts recognized at a given level. Concept activations are output signals at this level and they become input signals to the next level, propagating knowledge up the hierarchy. From time to time a system forms a new concept or eliminates an old one. At every level, the NMF system always keeps a reserve of vague (fuzzy) inactive concept- models. They are inactive in that their parameters are not adapted to the data; therefore their similarities to signals are low. Yet, because of a large vagueness (covariance) the similarities are not exactly zero. When a new signal does not fit well into any of the active models, its similarities to inactive models automatically increase (because first, every piece of data is accounted for, and second, inactive models are vague-fuzzy and potentially can ‚Äúgrab‚Äù every signal that does not fit into more specific, less fuzzy, active models. When the activation signal am for an inactive model, m, exceeds a certain threshold, the model is activated. Similarly, when an activation signal for a particular model falls below a threshold, the model is deactivated. Thresholds for activation and deactivation are set usually based on information existing at a higher hierarchical level (prior information, system resources, numbers of activated models of various types, etc.). Activation signals for active models at a particular level { am } form a ‚Äúneuronal field,‚Äù which serve as input signals to the next level, where more abstract and more general concepts are formed.

It allows the user to continuously zoom in or out of a fractal in real-time. XaoS is licensed under GPL. The program is cross-platform, and is available for a variety of operating systems, including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BeOS and others. XaoS can show the Mandelbrot set (power 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), the Octo fractal, three types of Barnsley's fractals, the Newton fractal (order 3 and 4), Phoenix fractal and Magnet (1 and 2). XaoS can display Julia sets from selected fractal parts. Xaos also allows users to enter custom formulas. XaoS is capable of displaying fractals as ASCII art using AAlib, which, in combination with being built on freely available GNU tools, allows it to run almost anywhere. An interactive help and an animated introduction to fractals are included. The introduction deals in ten chapters with different formulas presented in the software and their features. Hubiƒçka algorithm XaoS was originally just a \\"poorly written\\" Mandelbrot viewer until Jan Hubiƒçka added efficient zooming, using a technique sometimes called the XaoS algorithm or Hubiƒçka algorithm. At that time fractal zoom movies were produced by completely recalculating each frame, even though they naturally had much of their area in common with each other. This made interactive zooming impossible without very powerful computers. Furthermore, unless even more processing is used in order to do antialiasing, recalculating every frame produces a 'twinkle' effect as small bright areas hit and then disappear between pixels.. Yet allowing the user to zoom, rather than jump as in Fractint, seemed like the most natural way to interact with fractals. In order to create an interactive zoom, Hubiƒçka needed to find a way to save the calculations which were already made. It would take up too much memory to save every pixel ever calculated, so the Hubiƒçka algorithm only saves the previous frame, and rather than remembering the location of each pixel it can keep them aligned in rows and columns and remember those instead. The most difficult part of the XaoS algorithm was choosing which saved rows and columns to draw where. Doing this wrong results in distorted images, yet it must be done quickly to be useful. After several different heuristics were tried, eventually the problem was treated as an optimization problem. The remaining rows and columns are colored in the same as the closest row/column, and are freshly calculated as the CPU gets time to do so. This is a careful balance between keeping the zoom going and increasing the level of detail. Calculating areas where the image is being zoomed to is put at a higher priority since these will be on the screen the longest and this is likely where the user is looking anyway. Zooming out, the reverse occurs and the priority is on the edges. The Hubiƒçka algorithm can also be applied to zooming in on other images where the pixels are calculated, and has been used in other software such as the rtzme (\\"Real-Time Zooming Math Engine\\") complex function graphing program, and other fractal zoomers.

Œ±1-Chimerin is also able to regulate dendritic spinal density by binding to NMDA receptors at the NR2A subunit. Over expression of this protein in hippocampus tissue can inhibit the formation of new spines and remove existing spines.

The responsibility for assuring this capability lies with the OPSCEN/WKC (Watching Keeping Capacity) Branch of the EUMS Operations Directorate. Since 1 January 2007, the EU Operation Centre is ready for activation by the Council for the conduct of autonomous operations. EU OPCEN was first activated on 23 March 2012 by the Foreign Affairs Council in relation to three CSDP operations in the Horn of Africa.

Baingan ka bharta is a part of the cuisine of some nation states of the Indian subcontinent. It is a vegetarian dish that is prepared by mincing eggplant (baingan) that is grilled over charcoal or direct fire. This infuses the dish with a smoky flavour. The smoked and mashed eggplant is then mixed with cooked chopped tomato, browned onion, ginger, garlic, cumin, fresh cilantro (coriander leaves), chili pepper, and mustard oil or a neutral vegetable oil. Traditionally, the dish is often eaten with flatbread (specifically roti or paratha) and is also served with rice or raita, a yogurt salad. In states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it is served hot with litti or baati. In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, baingan bharta is part of popular cuisine. In India, it is made in various regional styles, with ingredients varying from one region to another.  Names  The dish has several regional names, such as: (, , (Punjabi), (), () or (), (), (), (), (), baingoin satni (Sylheti: Í†õÍ†£Í†ÅÍ†ãÍ†âÍ†ÇÍ†ò Í†åÍ†£Í†êÍ†òÍ†§) and (Gujarati). Variants Some non-Punjabi variants may omit the tomato and sometimes the onion as well. In Gujarat, it is called Ringan No Oro (), in which the eggplant is roasted, then mashed, and then saut√©ed with mustard and cumin seeds, turmeric, red chilli powder, ginger and garlic and salt. It is served with bajra no rotlo (), kadhi (a soup prepared by gram flour, curd and spices), khichadi and chhaash () (buttermilk). In Karnataka, it is called e·πá·πáegƒÅyi and prepared by boiling and frying whole eggplant usually served with akki rotti. In the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Tamils prepare a similar dish called kathrikai thayir kothsu, in which the eggplant is cooked, mashed, and saut√©ed with mustard, red chilis and sesame oil. The final step in the recipe involves adding yogurt (curds) to the mixture and dressing the dish with coriander leaves. In the Bhojpuri-speaking regions of India (such as eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar), it is known as baigan ka chokha; it is also popular within the Indo-Caribbean communities of Trinidad, Suriname, and Guyana, where many descendants of indentured labourers from northern India live. In Maharashtra, especially in the northern Khandesh region, vangyache bharit as they call it is served in social gatherings including wedding ceremonies. During harvest season, a special \\"bharit party\\" is organised. Bharit is usually served with puri. In the Vidarbha and Khandesh regions of Maharashtra, two variants are popular: (\\"raw\\") and (with ) . In , all the ingredients except for eggplant are used uncooked. Raw spring onion, tomato, green chillies, green coriander, and sometimes fresh fenugreek leaves are mixed with flame-roasted eggplant along with raw linseed oil or peanut oil. In , the above ingredients are first fried in oil with spices; then, mashed eggplants are mixed into it and cooked together. The similar process is followed in other Indian states and Pakistan with slight variations on ingredients. In Vidarbha and Khandesh, it is considered a delicacy when the eggplants are roasted on a dried cotton plant stems, a process which gives a distinct smokey flavour to the dish. The dish is served with dal, bhakri, and rice. Eggplant is popular in Afghanistan in the form of a traditional salad called \\"bonjan salad\\", which is usually served at room temperature (or cold) together with main dishes. The dish is served with a variety of breads and is similar to another Afghani dish called baingan ka raita (). There are many variations of preparing eggplant.

The organisation of the cup was changed from previous years, with early stages being run in three large zones (northern, central, and southern), rather than by individual associations as had previously been the case. National League teams received a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 103 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. The 1973 final The final was moved from the Basin Reserve for the first time since 1928, excluding replays. The 1973 final was - also excluding replays - the first to be held outside Wellington. Part of the reason for the move was because - for the first time ever - both finalists came from Auckland. This was only the second time (after 1971) that both finalists had come from the same urban area. The venue was to alternate between Auckland and Christchurch for several years from 1973. Mount Wellington made up for their narrow loss in the marathon final of the 1972 Chatham Cup by inflicting a sound defeat on their neighbours from across the WaitematƒÅ Harbour. Coach Ken Armstrong added to his impressive tally of cup victories both on and off the field. Shore's cause was not helped when keeper Turner had to be substituted early on after an injury, but even without this handicap the Mount would have proven the stronger side. All the goals came from Mount Wellington's players, with two from Dave Taylor and one from John Houghton. p. 76 Results Third Round * Won on penalties by Rangers (4-3), Manurewa (6-5), and North End (6-5) Fourth Round Fifth Round Sixth Round Semi-finals Final References *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1973 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1973 Chatham Cup page Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup September 1973 sports events in Oceania ","title":"1973 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19208959","text":"Scorpia may refer to: *Scorpia (comics), a fictional super villain in the Marvel Comics universe *Scorpia (journalist), pseudonym for a reviewer in Computer Gaming World *Scorpia (novel), a 2004 Alex Rider novel *Scorpia, a fictional planet in the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica *Scorpia (She-Ra), a character in the animated television series She-Ra: Princess of Power *Scorpia, a fictional criminal organization in the Phantom comic strip.

Foldvary, cellular democracy is a model of democracy based on multi-level bottom-up structures in either small neighborhood governmental districts or contractual communities. Councils In cellular democracy, a jurisdiction such as a county or city is divided into neighborhood districts with a population of about 500 people, with about 100 to 200 households. The voters in the district would elect a council. The small size of districts would allow for more informed voters at a smaller cost. Representatives, plus one alternate, would be elected to the council. This would be a \\"level-1 council\\". A region containing 10 to 20 neighborhood districts would then vote for a \\"level-2 council\\". Each level-1 council elects a regular representative and an alternate to the level-2 council from its own regular membership. A further region containing several level-2 councils would comprise a level-3 council, each level-2 council again electing a regular and an alternate representative to level 3. The level-2 representative sent up to the level-3 council would be replaced by his or her alternative. The hierarchy would continue indefinitely, depending on the size of the state, or even going on to the top of the world. Secession Councils could 'secede', creating a new branch of councils that would be incorporated back into the system. Taxation Each level 1 council would be able to select its source of revenue. Property taxes would be likely, and Foldvary favors the land value tax as the most efficient, just, and unintrusive option. Every council above council-1 gets its money from the council below it.

Biography  The exact year and circumstances of his birth and early years remain unknown. Kon, as a mature man, and his relatives living in Moscow appear to be affiliated with the Boldino Monastery near Dorogobuzh, as evidenced by records of their donations to the monastery. Thus, it is assumed that Kon's ancestors came to Moscow from the Dorogobuzh area. The architect used the nickname Kon (Russian for stallion) as early as in 1584, as evidenced by his written plea to Ivan the Terrible. According to this account, Kon ran away to a \\"foreign land\\" and learned construction crafts there, specifically emphasizing his skills in fortifications like city walls, dams, ponds, moats, and \\"secrets\\" (tunnels). Kon received a public beating for his defection but was soon assigned to lead the construction of Bely Gorod, a 10-kilometer outer ring of Moscow fortress that stood in the path of present-day Boulevard Ring. His best known project, the Kremlin of Smolensk, was launched by Boris Godunov in 1597. Fyodor Kon has been the subject of an eponymous poem by Dmitri Kedrin (1940).

In 2009 Ladies Special trains were introduced between New Delhi and Palwal and from New Delhi to Ghaziabad and Panipat. At present, EMUs in Delhi run with 12 coaches, of which ten are general compartments and two are ladies compartment. As per the Northern Railway estimates, there are more than 110 suburban trains, which ply on important sections.  Future development  With Delhi Metro growing at a rapid pace, there has been very little focus to improve the condition of the Delhi Suburban Railway. There have been reports of strengthening the services so that more commuters can avail themselves of the facility. Feasibility studies have also been done, and in deference to the commuter demand, there were also plans to start EMU services from Gurgaon. An integrated rail-bus transit (IRBT) system to connect Delhi with the satellite towns of Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, and Sahibabad is being promoted by the government. A feasibility study has already been completed, and a steering committee has been appointed to monitor the project. The IRBT will have two dedicated tracks.

After the war he was a politician and later resumed his engineering work. Early life and career Wharton was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, in the summer of 1824. He entered Virginia Military Institute in Lexington on September 1, 1845. Wharton graduated on July 5, 1847, finishing 2nd out of 12 cadets as a \\"distinguished graduate.\\" After leaving VMI he then became a civil engineer. Later Wharton moved to the Arizona Territory and took up work as a mining engineer.Eicher, p. 562. Civil War service At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Wharton chose to follow his home state of Virginia and the Confederate cause, and entered the Confederate Army. He was appointed a major in the 45th Virginia Infantry on July 1, and soon afterward was given command of the 51st Virginia Infantry on July 17, with the rank of colonel. 1864 Battle of New Market The 51st Virginia was part of Maj. Gen. John B. Floyd's operations in western Virginia, and escaped with Floyd on February 14, 1862, during the Battle of Fort Donelson.Warner, p. 331. Wharton was then sent to the Western Theater, and commanded several brigades in various Confederate departments from February to September 1864. During this time Wharton was promoted to brigadier general, effective July 8, 1863. Also during 1863 he married Nannie Radford, and they would have one child together, a son named William. In the winter of 1863, Wharton served in Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's operations against Knoxville, Tennessee, which were ultimately unsuccessful and ended in the spring of 1864. Wharton then returned to the Eastern Theater and was given divisional command in the Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Wharton also took part in the Battle of New Market on May 15. His brigade was part of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge's force, fighting on the left during the Confederate victory at New Market. 1865 Battle of Waynesboro In 1864 Wharton participated in the Overland Campaign, fighting in Breckinridge's division during the Confederate victory at Battle of Cold Harbor from May 31 - June 12. His brigade also participated in the Battle of Monocacy on July 9. Wharton was part of Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's operations in his Valley Campaigns, and he participated in the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19. He also fought in the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia on March 2, 1865, at the end of which his command was largely dispersed and Early's army virtually destroyed.Warner, p. 331. \\"His command was overwhelmed and dispersed at Waynesboro in March 1865.\\" Wharton led what was left of his division until May 2. He was paroled at the end of the war from Lynchburg, Virginia, on June 4. Postbellum Glencoe, postbellum home of Wharton Wharton became a legislator in the Virginia General Assembly and then returned to his pre-war career as a mining engineer. He was also instrumental in building the railroad in Southwest Virginia in New River Valley. Wharton married Nannie Radford, daughter of John B.

In the absorption bands of these molecules, he discovered large values of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), or variation of optical rotation as a function of wavelength (Cotton effect), as well as circular dichroism or differences of absorption between left and right circularly polarized light. Biography Aim√© Cotton was born in Bourg-en-Bresse, Ain on 9 October 1869. His grandfather was director of the √âcole normale (teachers' college) of Bourg, and his father, Eug√®ne Cotton, was a mathematics professor at the college of Bourg, the institution where physicist Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re began his career. His brother √âmile Cotton was a mathematician and academician. Aim√© Cotton attended a lyc√©e (high school) in Bourg and then the special mathematics program at the Lyc√©e Blaise Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand. He entered the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in 1889, and won the physical sciences prize on graduating in 1893. As a graduate student at the physics laboratory of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, he then prepared his doctoral thesis in physical sciences. In this thesis he studied the interactions of polarized light with optically active substances containing chiral molecules. In absorption bands of these substances, he found large variations of optical rotation as a function of wavelength, now known as optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) or as the Cotton effect. He also discovered the related phenomenon of circular dichroism, or unequal absorption of left and right circularly polarized light. Willard H.H., Merritt L.L., Dean J.A. and Settle F.A. \\"Instrumental Methods of Analysis\\" (van Nostrand, 6th edn 1981) p.415Cotton A., Compt. Rend. 120, 989, 1044(1895); Ann. Chim. Phys. 8, 347(1896) These two phenomena were later used to determine the stereochemistries of chiral molecules in organic chemistry and in biochemistry. He was appointed ma√Ætre de conf√©rences in the science faculty at Toulouse in 1895, and defended his doctoral thesis in 1896 before the science faculty of the University of Paris. His thesis was entitled \\"Research on the absorption and dispersion of light by substances capable of optical rotation\\". In 1900, he was appointed assistant professor as a temporary replacement for Jules Violle. In 1904 he was appointed instructor, and in 1910 assistant professor at the science faculty of the University of Paris, assigned to the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, where he remained until 1922. During this period his research dealt with the interactions of light and magnetism. He worked first with Pierre Weiss on the Zeeman effect, the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. For this work he invented the Cotton balance to measure the magnetic field intensity precisely. With Weiss he studied the magnetic splitting of the blue lines of the zinc atom and in 1907 they were able to determine the ratio of the electron's charge to its mass (e/m) with better precision than the method of J.J. Thomson. Cotton then became interested in the Faraday effect near absorption lines and demonstrated magnetic circular dichroism. At the same time, he worked with his former classmate Henri Mouton, a biologist at the Pasteur Institute, on magnetic birefringence in collo√Ødal solutions of magnetic particles. In 1907 the two discovered the Cotton-Mouton effect, an intense magnetic birefringence with optical axis perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. In 1913 he married Eug√©nie Feytis, also a physicist. They had three children. During World War I he and Pierre Weiss developed the Cotton- Weiss system - based on an acoustic method - for locating enemy artillery. He supervised the thesis work of Georges Bruhat on circular dichro√Øsm and optical rotatory dispersion (1914). In 1917 he helped to found the Institut d'optique th√©orique et appliqu√©e, now the √âcole sup√©rieure d'optique. In 1914, he proposed construction of a large electromagnet capable of producing intense magnetic fields. Work on the magnet finally started in 1924 in the Service des recherches et inventions at Bellevue, later the Laboratoire du magn√©tisme at Meudon-Bellevue, and finally the Laboratoire Aim√© Cotton in his honour. Magnetic fields as high as to 7 teslas were attained. In 1919, he became chairman of the physics committee of the Direction des Inventions int√©ressant la d√©fense nationale (Directorate of Inventions relevant to National Defense). In 1920 he was named professor of the new chair of theoretical physics and astrophysics at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris. In 1922 he succeeded Gabriel Lippmann in the chair of general physics, and at the same time became director of physics research in the faculty. In 1923 he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1938 he was elected its president. He retired in 1941 and was replaced by Jean Cabannes as professor and laboratory directory, although he retained the direction of the magneto- optics laboratory at Bellevue. Also in 1941 he was imprisoned by the German occupiers at Fresnes for one and a half months, and was later awarded the Rosette de la r√©sistance. At the age of 81 years, 6 months and 7 days, he died on April 16, 1951, at S√®vres. References External links * Bibliography (in French) of some 20th-century physicists.

She supported the end-of-war Navy effort. On 7 March 1946 Muskingum was placed in service under bareboat charter with the US Army under the Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine with a Japanese crew. In 1950 she was reactivated and placed into service with the Military Sea Transportation Service as USNS Muskingum (T-AK-198) until being struck from the Navy list in 1973. She was ultimately transferred to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) and the Republic of Palau. Construction Muskingum, a type C1-M-AV1 cargo ship was laid down under a MARCOM contract, MC hull 2152, by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Superior, Wisconsin, 26 January 1944, and launched on 30 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Larson. Muskingum was then completed at Samuelson Ship Yard, Beaumont, Texas. She was commissioned on 24 April 1945, at Houston, Texas, Lieutenant M. H. Bryant in command. Service history World War II-related service After shakedown, she departed Gulfport, Mississippi, 26 May 1945 with cargo for the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, 4 August 1945 via the Panama Canal and Manus, the Admiralty Islands. The next few months were spent in carrying passengers and freight between Philippine ports. She departed Tacloban, Leyte, 24 January 1946, arriving Yokohama 31 January. The ship was decommissioned 7 March 1946 and turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for transfer to the U.S. Army Transportation Corps on a bareboat charter basis. She was stricken from the Navy List 5 June 1946. Army service Muskingum was given the Army designation V-208 and operated between ports in Japan, Korea, and the Mariana Islands under control of the Shipping Control Authority for the Japanese Merchant Marine (SCAJAP) with overall control exercised by Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, Japan. Muskingum was operated by Japanese until 1 July 1950 when title was transferred to Navy. MSTS service Muskingum was reinstated on the Navy List for operations under Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) WesPac (Western Pacific). During the Korean War, she carried supplies between Japan and Korea. In 1951, Muskingum, designated T-AK-198, was under control of MSTS Far East, operating out of Japan. Besides providing logistical support for U.S. forces in Korea, Muskingum carried supplies to American and Allied forces in South Vietnam. Decommissioning Muskingum continued with service with the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) until she was struck from the Navy List on 15 June 1973. Merchant service On 4 October 1973 title was returned to the Maritime Administration, successor to the Maritime Commission and loaned to the United States Department of Interior for TTPI use. The ship was operated by the Palau Shipping Company, Inc., a Trust Territory entity, on a time charter basis with a Micronesian crew. On 7 April 1982 Muskingum was permanently transferred to the Republic of Palau. According to the ABC Shipping Guide the ship was operated by Carolineship with a route Palau - Jakarta - Kobe - Palau.

All eukaryotes appear to have cullins. They combine with RING proteins to form Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) that are highly diverse and play a role in myriad cellular processes, most notably protein degradation by ubiquitination. The human genome contains eight cullin genes * CUL1, part of SCF complex * CUL2, part of ECS complex (Elongin C - CUL2 - SOCS-box) * CUL3, part of CUL3-BTB complex * CUL4A * CUL4B * CUL5 * CUL7 * CUL9, also known as PARC There is also a more distant member called ANAPC2 (or APC2), part of the Anaphase-promoting complex. CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5 and 7 each form part of a multi-subunit ubiquitin complex. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), such as Cul1 (SCF) play an essential role in targeting proteins for ubiquitin-mediated destruction; as such, they are diverse in terms of composition and function, regulating many different processes from glucose sensing and DNA replication to limb patterning and circadian rhythms. The catalytic core of CRLs consists of a RING protein and a cullin family member. For Cul1, the C-terminal cullin- homology domain binds the RING protein. The RING protein appears to function as a docking site for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). Other proteins contain a cullin-homology domain, such as CUL9, also known as p53 cytoplasmic anchor PARC, and the ANAPC2 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; both CUL9 and ANAPC2 have ubiquitin ligase activity. The N-terminal region of cullins is more variable, and is used to interact with specific adaptor proteins. Modification by NEDD8 With the exception of ANAPC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process in which the 26S proteasome recognises and subsequently degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Nedd8/Rub1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein, which was originally found to be conjugated to Cdc53, a cullin component of the SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), and Nedd8 modification has now emerged as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle control and for embryogenesis in metazoans. The only identified Nedd8 substrates are cullins. Neddylation results in covalent conjugation of a Nedd8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine residue.

The lake has a public access with a boat ramp and picnic area. History of the Tunnel Dam The site for the tunnel dam was chosen because a long cave was found that extended ridge separating the upper and lower bents of the river. In 1911, the cave was then modified so the river flowed through it during dam construction. There is usually no water running between the dam and the lake's powerhouse. Hydroelectricity Hydroelectric engineers then placed a powerhouse at the upper end of the tunnel for hydroelectricity. In 1930, the powerhouse was moved to the lower end of the tunnel taking advantage of the drop. The powerhouse has two turbines. The hydroelectric equipment provides 3 megawatts of power for nearby residents. Geography of the Lake The lake is only a few feet deep so larger boats are not able to access this lake. To the north there is a steep ridge that is only a few hundred feet wide, this ridge makes the river go an extra four miles (6 km) between the dam and the powerhouse. The shoreline is almost entirely wooded around the lake.

He appointed two new editors, Phyllis Lee and Taylor Kelly, to take over the next year. At the 2007-2008 club fair, TechToday had approximately 150 people sign up to join the club. Throughout the year, it had six issues released. It went through a layout program change, from Microsoft Publisher to Apple Pages. It also went under a layout design change, which was well received across campus. At the 2008-2009 club fair, TechToday had 119 people sign up to join the club. It is planning on switching from Apple Pages to Adobe InDesign as its layout program. On September 16, 2008, TechToday changed its name to UC Juice. Because the name 'TechToday' did not fit the addition of the Academy for Performing Arts to the UCVTS campus, the name was decided to be changed. The other possible choices were: 'UCVTS Utopian', 'The Ubiquitarian', 'UC Inquirer', 'UCVTS United', and 'UC Juice', and were voted on. UC Juice won by a landslide. The name UC Juice was originated from the nickname of one of the freshman members, Juice. In 2010 the paper changed its name once again, becoming \\"The Campus Inquirer\\".

History During World War II, Treasure Island became part of the Treasure Island Naval Base, and served as an electronics and radio communications training school, and as the major Navy departure and receiving point for sailors in the Pacific aboard surface ships and submarines. The Naval Station also served as an Auxiliary Air Facility airfield for airships, blimps, dirigibles, planes, and seaplanes by Hangars / Bldgs. 2 & 3\\\\. The seaplanes landed in the Port of Trade Winds Harbor. For his dedicated service in developing the Treasure Island Naval Station and Auxiliary Air Facility from inception the US Navy honored Rear Admiral Hugo Wilson Osterhaus (1878‚Äì1972) by naming the square in front of the Administration Building (at Bldg 1 on 1 Avenue of the Palms) after him. On 9 December 1945, the three theatre complexes on the base were dedicated to World War II Naval heroes killed in action. Theatre One was named for Doris Miller, the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross; Theatre Two was named for Medal of Honor recipient Edward O'Hare; and Theatre Three (at Bldg 401 on Avenue I and 9th Street) was named for Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone USMC. Broadcast nationwide on the ABC radio series Orson Welles Commentaries, the ceremonies featured Commodore Robert W. Cary, commander of the center, and Orson Welles, who interviewed family members.\\"Treasure Island Theaters to Bear Names of 3 Navy Heroes\\". Oakland Tribune, 2 December 1945, page A13.

Oakland Tribune, 111 November 1945, page 20A. USS Pandemonium (PCDC-1) in 1957. After the war, a training center for nuclear decontamination was established on the island. A full size mockup of a navy ship dubbed the was constructed in July 1956. Radioactive materials were placed on the land-locked ship in order to train crews in radioactive detection and cleanup. The Pandemonium remained in use until July 1969. It was moved from its original site and then demolished in 1996. During the 1960s‚Äì1980s Treasure Island was used by the U.S. Navy for shipboard fire fighting and damage control training for Hull Maintenance Technicians and other sailors. Treasure Island housed the \\"USS Buttercup\\" (in Bldg. 341 on Avenue M and 4th Street) which was a static damage control trainer that was used for real time shipboard battle damage repair and control. The Auxiliary Air Facility airfield was limited to helicopter landing pad use at Naval Airship Square on the East side of Hangar/Bldg. 3 near the Naval firehouse at Bldg. 111. Additionally, the Hull Maintenance Technician Training School Phase \\"A\\" was trained at Treasure Island for Nuclear, Biological, Radiological and Chemical Warfare Training as part of their phase \\"A\\" and phase \\"B\\" training. Treasure Island was also the location for the (nominal) 42-week Electronics Technician (ET) 'A‚Äô-School and various Electronic Technician ‚ÄúB‚Äù Schools that provided specialized training on specific types of electronic equipment. In 1996, Treasure Island and the Presidio of San Francisco Army Post were decommissioned and opened to public control, under stipulations. Treasure Island is now part of District 6 of the City and County of San Francisco, though it is still owned by the Navy. In 1993, the naval station was selected for closure, and Navy operations ended there in 1997. Some of the property was transferred to the Federal Highway Administration, the Labor Department and the U.S. Coast Guard, and the rest is open for development. Problems have arisen over the determination of Treasure Island's fair-market value. The city's redevelopment agency, The Treasure Island Development Authority, valued the land at $13.8 million, and the city offered the Navy $40 million for the property. Two other estimates determined the fair market value at $250 million. However, in 2008 Congress offered the publicly held property to the city of San Francisco for nothing, under Section 2711 of HR 2647, drafted by Rep. Sam Farr. Names Although it was designated Naval Station (NAVSTA) Treasure Island for most of its existence, the naval base had other names during its history: * 1941-1947: Naval Training and Distribution Center (TADCEN) Treasure Island * 1947-1975: Naval Station (NAVSTA) Treasure Island * 1975-1980: Naval Support Activity (NSA) Treasure Island * 1980-1997: Naval Station (NAVSTA) Treasure Island Environmental issues After the Naval Station closed in 1997, Treasure Island was opened to residential and other uses, but according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Toxic Substances Control, the ground at various locations on the island is contaminated with toxic substances. Caesium-137 levels three times higher than previously recorded were found in April 2013. These are thought to date from the base's use by ships contaminated in post-war nuclear testing, and from a nuclear training facility previously based there.

In the 19th century it ranged from Senegal to Lake Chad, yet in 2011 this subspecies only survives in a few isolated pockets containing about 400 individuals in total. Its last self-sustaining herd is in southwest Niger, supported by a series of refuges in Dosso Region, and the tourist center at Kour√©, some 80 km southeast of Niamey.Niger : la population des girafes augmente de 24% en 2011 (officiel), Xinhua, 2012-03-01. All captive so-called \\"West African giraffe\\" are now known to be the Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum). Evolutionary history Older studies on giraffe subspecies have caused some researchers to question the separate status of G. c. peralta and the Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum). Genetic testing published in 2007 confirmed the distinctiveness of the West African giraffe.\\"Not one but 'six giraffe species'\\". BBC News (21 December 2007)\\"Giraffes and Frogs Provide More Evidence of New Species Hidden in Plain Sight\\". ScienceDaily (21 December 2007) Most captive giraffes from northwestern Africa are in French zoological parks, a result of the history of French colonialism in what was French West Africa. Those giraffes were formerly treated as G. c. peralta. However, since genetic analysis revealed that only giraffes to the west of Lake Chad belong to this subspecies, the populations in European zoos are in fact Kordofan giraffes (G. c. antiquorum). The West African giraffe is more closely related to the giraffes of East Africa than to those of Central Africa. Its ancestor may have migrated from East to North Africa during the Quaternary and then to West Africa with the development of the Sahara desert. At its largest, Lake Chad may have acted as a barrier between West African and Kordofan giraffes during the Holocene. Distribution and habitat The Nigerien giraffe population relies upon seasonal migration between the relatively drought-resistant lowlands of the Niger River valley and the drier highlands near Kour√©. In this area, Tiger bush habitat allows for bands of trees to thrive in climates which might otherwise become more typical desert. Former range Before World War I, at the time of European colonial administrations, West African giraffe lived in pockets right across the Sahel and savanna regions of West Africa. Population growth, involving more intensive farming and hunting, a series of dramatic droughts since the late 19th century, and environment destruction (both natural and human made) have all contributed to their dramatic decline. As late as the 1960s, prior to the Sahel drought that lasted right into the early 1980s, populations identified as G. c. peralta existed in Senegal, Niger, eastern Mali, northern Benin, northern Nigeria, southwest Chad and northern Cameroon. However, recent genetic research has shown that the populations from northern Cameroon and southern Chad actually are the Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum). Therefore, the giraffes that remain in Waza National Park (Cameroon) belong to the Kordofan giraffe, while the only remaining viable population of the West African giraffe is in Niger. In Niger, herds have been reported from the Agadez Region, and across the west and south of the country. Herds regularly traveled into the Gao Region of Mali as well and throughout the Niger River valley of Niger. Drought struck again in the 1980s and 1990s, and in 1991 there were less than 100 in the nation, with the largest herd in the western Dosso Region numbering less than 50, and scattered individuals along the Niger River valley moving from Benin to Mali, and clinging to the W National Park and nearby reserves. Ecology and behaviour The West African giraffe survive primarily on a diet of leaves from Acacia albida and Hyphaene thebaica as well as Annona senegalensis, Parinari macrophylla, Piliostigma reticulatum, and Balanites aegyptiaca. In the late 1990s, an anti-desertification project for the area around Niamey encouraged the development of woodcutting businesses. An unintended effect of this was the destruction of much Tiger bush and giraffe habitat within the region. The Nigerien government has since moved to limit woodcutting in the area.Geels, Jolijn (2006). Niger. Bradt UK/Globe Pequot Press US. Conservation West African giraffes near Kour√©, Niger Conservation efforts since the 1990s have led to a sizable growth in population, though largely limited to the single Dosso herd. From a low of 50 individuals, in 2007 there were some 175 wild individuals,Projet d‚Äô√©tude et de conservation des Girafes du Niger, Association pour la Sauvegarde des Girafes du Niger (2007). 250 in 2010, and 310 in the Nigerien government's 2011 count. There are now about 400 to 450 wild individuals as of 2016. Intensive efforts have been made within Niger, especially in the area just north of the Dosso Partial Faunal Reserve. From there, the largest existing herd migrate seasonally to the drier highlands along the Dallol Bosso valley, as far north as Kour√©, some 80 km southeast of Niamey. This area, though under little formal regulation, is the centre for Nigerien and international efforts to maintain habitat, smooth relations between the herd and area farmers, and provide opportunities for tourism, organised by the Association to Safeguard Giraffes in Niger.

Ardtornish House is famous for its gardens and the estate is the location of the ruined Ardtornish Castle and the still-inhabited Kinlochaline Castle. The old Factor's house at Achranich History In the mid-18th century the area occupied by the current estate was largely in the hands of Cameron of Glendessary, with some property to the east and south the lands of Maclean of Kingairloch and the Duke of Argyll. A small area near the head of Loch Aline was owned by Murray of Stanhope. By 1800 Cameron's lands were under the control of a variety of new superiors including Maclean of Inverscaddle, MacDonald of Borrodale and MacLachlan of Callart with Stanhope's land also being held by MacLachlan.Gaskell (1996) p. xxii By 1850 radical changes had occurred. In 1845 MacDonald's land to the east of Loch Aline had become the Achranich Estate owned by Octavius Smith, a Londoner whose father had made his money in grocery wholesaling and who was himself a successful distiller. To the west, part of Argyll's substantial holdings had been broken up with John Sinclair owning the Lochaline Estate and in the east Argyll's land was in the hands of the notorious Patrick Sellar, who had also purchased the holdings of MacLean and MacLachlan in 1844, which he named the Ardtornish Estate after the pre-existing castle.Gaskell (1996) p. xxiiiHunter (2000) p. 287Gaskell (1996) p. 57, 59 Octavius Smith and family At Whitsun 1860 Smith purchased Sellar's lands and immediately renamed the whole estate \\"Ardtornish\\",Gaskell (1996) p. 71 the name meaning \\"The headland of Thorir's (or Thora's) promontory\\". The clearances had by this time affected Morvern ‚Äì over 3,200 left the parish in the 19th century, 750 of them forcibly evicted ‚Äì and the bitter memories of the actions of Sellar and his neighbours lived long in the area.Gaskell (1996) p. 27 Ardtornish, however, seemed to strike a favourable chord with those fortunate enough to be entertained by the estate. Tennyson who missed the opportunity to visit Skye whilst staying there wrote: > :If he did not see Loch Coruisk :He ought to be forgiven; :For though he > miss'd a day in Skye, :He spent a day in Heaven!Gaskell (1996) p. 59 Ardtornish House from Lochaline Smith's holdings now ran to and employed a staff of thirty. He embarked on the construction of a substantial mansion house with a high clock tower, designed by Alexander Ross of Inverness, which was completed in 1866.Gaskell (1996) pp. 67, 71, 72, 76 However, Octavius did not enjoy his new summer home for long as he died in London in February 1871. Nor did his house long survive him. His son Valentine, who had inherited the estate and the distilling business, knocked it down and built a much larger version in 1884. Only the clock tower from the original remains.Gaskell (1996) pp. 82, 100‚Äì01 Valentine's new structure is on an heroic scale. At its height, construction employed 160 workers in 1888, and did much to improve local employment prospects at a time when agitation for land reform from the Highland Land League was at its height.Gaskell (1996) pp. 101‚Äì02 Valentine also bought the neighbouring Lochaline estate in 1880, adding another including Morvern's largest settlement, Lochaline. He died in 1906 on board his yacht Rannoch in Gourock Bay, having become something of a recluse in his old age. Latterly, he forbade trespassing on the estate and lived in fear of holidaymakers and tourists.Gaskell (1996) pp. 103, 108 Ardtornish was inherited by his sister Gertrude, who had married Alexander Craig Sellar, Patrick Sellar's son in 1870.Gaskell (1996) pp. 76, 108 Gertrude took on the management of the estate until 1909 when she handed it over to her unmarried son Gerard, then 38 years old. They continued to live in the new house until the winter of 1929 when they both died within a few weeks of one another. Within a year Ardtornish was sold to new owners.Gaskell (1996) p. 118 Smith- Raven family When Owen (1859‚Äì1958) and Emmeline Hugh Smith from Langham in Rutland bought Ardtornish in 1930, the extensive gardens may have been a significant part of the attraction. Valentine Smith had laid out of formal landscape including lawns, rockeries and walled herbaceous and kitchen gardens and employed up to 12 gardeners to maintain them.

This became obsolete some time after the second world war, but in the early 1990s the estate took advantage of a government renewable energy incentive scheme, the Scottish Renewables Order, and built a 700 kW run-of- river hydro scheme. In 2010, this was supplemented by a further similar-sized scheme in the same catchment (the Tearnait scheme), and the 1990s scheme was decommissioned and replaced with a larger, 1.5 mW turbine, commissioned in December 2012 ‚Äì the Rannoch Dam scheme.http://renewables- map.co.uk/listofgem.asp?pshowofgemtech=Hydro Three more hydropower plants have since been built, including a low-head Archimedes Turbine in the heart of the estate at Achranich ‚Äì giving a total of 3.3 mW of installed capacity. and The estate received planning permission in 2010 for a new \\"township\\" of 20 houses at Achabeag, two miles west of Lochaline.

It is a part of St. Bernard Parish Public Schools. Andrew Jackson was turned into an elementary school in 2010 then later into a middle school teaching grades 6-8. Currently still a middle school. History Andrew Jackson High School opened as an all-girls school in the fall of 1966, along with P.G.T. Beauregard High School, to meet the demands of more classrooms to house the growing population of St. Bernard Parish, the same year that both Chalmette High School and St. Bernard High School opened as all-boy schools. The solution to the problem of having four co-ed high schools was to segregate by sex. This would cut costs drastically since the parish would only have to build and maintain two stadiums instead of four. Andrew Jackson High School and P.G.T. Beauregard High School served girls for the next twenty two years, and they became the \\"sister\\" schools to Chalmette and St. Bernard respectively. The decision to go back to co-ed status in 1989 brought about a mild decline in the school. More students were choosing to attend Andrew Jackson, a magnet school that served the entire parish, rather than just the upper end. Unlike like Chalmette and St. Bernard high schools, Andrew Jackson required an entrance examination, interview, or audition. Like other magnet schools, Andrew Jackson selected all students who applied or used a lottery system, or a system combining some elements of competitive entrance and a lottery. Pre-Katrina (1965-2005) Andrew Jackson Fundamental Magnet High School formerly held a student capacity of about 1,075 students. The last graduating class before Hurricane Katrina took place at the Frederick J. Sigur Civic Center on May 19, 2005.  Athletics  Unlike Chalmette and St. Bernard high schools, Andrew Jackson focused more on academics than athletics, with the exception of the few listed below: * Cross Country * Golf * Soccer * Swim Team * Tennis * Volleyball * Wrestling * Cheerleading Post-Katrina (2006-present) Andrew Jackson was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and was closed during the 2005-2006 school year where the St. Bernard Unified School took place at the Chalmette High School in November of that year. The last official graduating ceremony for the class of 2006 took place at the Smoothie King Center in May 2006, along with Chalmette High School and St. Bernard High School to coincide with the time that was lost during the 2005-2006 school year. Plans of rebuilding another high school were blacklisted when the St. Bernard Parish School Board decided to open Chalmette High School as the base of the entire St. Bernard Parish community, that expanded its campus on the previous Lacoste Elementary School campus for the 9th Grade Academy building that opened in 2009. If an additional high school is needed in the future because of enrollment, both Andrew Jackson and St. Bernard High Schools would be refurbished and operational for necessary expansion. Andrew Jackson Elementary School The school opened as Andrew Jackson Elementary School for the 2006-2007 school year to balance the student capacity between both the Chalmette High School and Andrew Jackson campuses until more schools in the parish were opened again. Andrew Jackson housed grades Pre-K to 5th grade while Chalmette High School housed grades 6th grade to 12th grade. Andrew Jackson Middle School The school opened as Andrew Jackson Middle School for the 2010-2011 school year, and remains as the latter to this day. The elementary students who previously attended Andrew Jackson registered and transferred to the new Chalmette Elementary School (previously Chalmette Middle School) and Arabi Elementary School campuses.

Unlike Guitar Hero, it uses real instruments and teaches to read sheet music as well. History Founder and CEO Chris Salter entered Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU) in 1978 to study cinematography and began producing films about music. Shortly after, Salter met piano instructor Don Beattie, who came to the School of Music in 1979, and joined a group piano class. He was very inspired by Prof. Beattie's innovative work and approach, and began to take many other music classes, while studying directly with Prof. Beattie for the next 4 years. Parallel with this, he changed his major to Linguistics, and began to study French, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese languages. It was in this way he got his key insights about developmental linguistics, and became curious about the potential of learning music as if it were a native language. He eventually took so many music courses that he ended up earning a double degree in Music and Linguistics from SIU. Combining his two passions, he was able to enter the nationally recognized Ethnomusicology program at UCLA, win a two-year Organization of American States Fellowship to study abroad in Brazil to do his Master's thesis research, and then returned to get his Master‚Äôs in Musicology from UCLA in 1990. His insights on his thesis into the role visual cues have on teaching rhythm and guitar in Brazil led him to think about how that might facilitate learning to play other instruments like piano. Years before, Salter took classes to learn how to type, and failed pretty miserably at it, finding it boring and tedious. With the early Apple computers he played a typing game, and soon he was typing 40 words per minute. It was then that he first had the idea that a piano video game could have the same effect, with the added complexity of precision timing being much more important than with typing. Around this time the MIDI protocol for computers to deal with music was created, and the combination of the two concepts lead to the possibility of a game, with a twist. Salter's idea was to start with a simple game, but then transition to reading music notation, allowing even very young children to learn to play and read music without the traditional necessity of music theory and notation deciphering as a \\"prerequisite\\" to playing. After years of consideration, Salter decided to form a business to develop and manufacture the Piano Commando game (which went on to become Piano Wizard). Salter incorporated his new business in under the name Allegro Multimedia, although the company is better known under the DBA (Doing Business As) Music Wizard. Understanding how students can benefit from music education, Salter met with Don Beattie, his former piano teacher at the SIU school of music to see how piano teachers could best utilize the game in their classrooms. The plan was to introduce a short week-long summer boot camp at the school. After the success of the boot camp, in the fall of 2005, Don and his wife Delayna founded and directed the Piano Wizard Academy at SIU Carbondale. Over the next 3 years, their work as Academy Directors opened new horizons for young children and adult piano beginners, and they were challenged to \\"productize\\" their work, and create a self-sufficient package to allow maximum utility of the video game's potential. Don and Delayna finalized the 100 Song Lesson Series that is now the \\"Academy music curriculum\\" for the game. Music Wizard and the Beatties then collaborated in the development of a series of 50 Tutorial DVD and Songbook lessons for the Academy Music Library. These materials were meant to empower parents, non-music educators and piano teachers alike to leverage the compressed concrete learning engendered by the game with the icing of musical artistic technique, and music theory as needed. This has proven to be a dramatic success, with hundreds of positive reviews, and testimonials. In particular, homeschool families and special needs communities have embraced this warmly due to the ease, affordability and sometimes dramatic success possible using these tools. Products Piano Wizard Released in 2005, this educational software helps teach the student to play the piano through a patented 4-step learning approach.https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/jinnygudmundsen/2006-11-23-piano_x.htm While the software was available separately, a bundle was made available that included an M-Audio Keystation 49e keyboard. This software is no longer sold separately since the development of the full Piano Wizard Academy. Piano Wizard Academy The Piano Wizard Academy version is more popular as it introduces another critical level of music learning, i.e. \\"Step 5\\" where the student is helped to get off the game, and read sheet music at the piano. This allows many more musical elements of playing to be introduced by the parent or facilitator, ensuring a deeper more artistic experience rather than just playing a video game. In addition to the core software, it also includes over 50 video lessons and sheet music, to demonstrate how to move children, adults or themselves through the levels of the game, and then to transition off the game to playing a real piano and reading basic musical notation. The Academy version allows unlimited import of MIDI files. The concept is to allow the use of these files as a tool for the student to play (on piano) virtually any song written in Western notation once imported into the program. The game's engine automatically renders game objects and music notes from the imported MIDI file. Currently there are hundreds of thousands of MIDI files online, comprising one thousand years of classical music repertoire, available for free or low cost. The software allows almost any MIDI file to be opened, with the various tracks available for background play or to learn, and it adjusts to multiple common digital keyboard sized, making the software extremely versatile. The 100 song Easy Mode curriculum included is the equivalent of about 2 years children's piano lessons, though most go through this in less than six months or a year because of the game's ability to dramatically shorten and eliminate the normal practice times needed to master a song. They each have fingering indications built in for every note, an option useful for transitioning from the color coded phases to reading black music notation. The Piano Wizard Academy package includes another 100 song, and most are custom arranged to fit easily within a 4 octave keyboard. Imported MIDI files, however, are more like a \\"box of chocolates\\" in that these were designed by thousands of music enthusiasts over the last couple of decades and uploaded and shared without any filtering or quality control, so the quality of any MIDI file ranges dramatically. That said, this open source approach of Music Wizard allows for a much longer and more varied use of the product, making it potentially a music learning system for life. In 2007, Fisher Price licensed the 4-step method for use in their I Can Play Piano product. A touchscreen Piano Wizard app is currently in development for iPhone and Android platforms. Impact of music training on cognitive development A number of customers in the home school market tried the game to see if the simple, visual game like style of the system would allow even special needs children access to the benefits of music education. While not designed specifically for this market, a surprising number of sometimes dramatic stories of cognitive development have emerged spontaneously from customer testimonials . While these success stories with Piano Wizard are anecdotal, not scientific, they are compelling, and often very moving. There is significant scientific research on the effects of music training, especially piano, on the brain. The newest advances in neuroscience, especially the latest technologies like functional MRI, Petscans, diagnostic EKGs, etc. allow scientists to measure the \\"neuroplasticity\\" and impact of music on cognitive development. In fact, music training is emerging as a kind of supertonic, having a \\"metaplastic\\" effect on the brain, impacting many other areas of cognitive competence, with lifelong benefits. The company is exploring participating in more rigorous and formal neuroscience studies to test the hypothesis that the game system allows a much wider range of people to obtain these known music training benefits faster, easier and more cost effectively. In particular, they are looking not only at participating in studies of early cognitive development, but those with people affected by autism, Down's syndrome, other special needs, even seniors with dementia, Alzheimer's, stroke or other forms of brain trauma or damage. The company is currently seeking research partners and non-profits interested in engaging in these more formal kinds of studies. Guitar Wizard Guitar Wizard is intended to teach guitar skills. The software version is under development, but there was a toy version called Mattel's I Can Play Guitar,Official press release aimed at young children, which has now been discontinued. A package in development by the manufacturer will bundle the software with an acoustic guitar with a MIDI pickup or guitar controller.Engadget coverage Licensing See also *Guitar Rising References External links * Official site Music education video games Musical training software Software companies based in Colorado Music video games Music education organizations Piano Software companies of the United States ","title":"Music Wizard"},{"id":"19210032","text":"The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought is an award for the defense of human rights and freedom of thought established in 1988 by the European Parliament.

It is 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Beauly and 15 miles (24 km) west of Inverness, on the north bank of the River Beauly. Crask of Aigas is nearby, to the northeast. In the past, Aigas was divided into two parts, Easter and Wester Aigas. In 1580, King James VI granted both of these areas of land to Alexander Forbes of Pitsligo, a nobleman of Clan MacFarlane and great-great-grandfather of Alexander Forbes, 4th Lord Forbes of Pitsligo. In 1610 however, ownership of the lands was again transferred by King James to Simon Fraser, 6th Lord Lovat. The lands since passed down the male line of Clan Fraser of Lovat. Archaelogical evidence shows settlements around the area of Aigas dating back to the Bronze Age, with ancient dwellings made from local whinstone. Nowadays, Aigas is home to a popular, 9-hole golf course, established in 1993, and is served by Teanassie Primary School. There is also a nearby hydroelectric dam named after the hamlet, situated on the River Beauly. House of Aigas (Aigas Field Centre) The House of Aigas is a historic building within the hamlet, originally built as a tacksman's house during the Georgian era, sometime around 1760. In the 1870s it was sold to a wealthy family of Glaswegian shipping merchants, and used as a hunting lodge. During the Victorian era many additions were made in the Scottish baronial style, and a small arbotoreum was installed during the 1880s. Trees such as the giant sequia, nootka cypress, and western red cedar were planted in the gardens. The house was again sold in the 1950s, becoming a council-run old folks' home before being abandoned in 1971. Sir John Lister- Kaye bought the house in 1976, after finding it on the verge of demolition. For over 40 years the celebrated English author and conservationist has lived in and run the estate, providing many much-needed renovations. Under his direction, Aigas Estate has become an important conservation centre known as the Aigas Field Centre. The centre runs environmental education services, nature-based holidays, and a Scottish wildcat breeding programme. Aigas has also been home to a family of Eurasian beavers since 2006.

The club played at Fraser Field and was a member of the New England League (NEL). The Lynn Red Sox finished in first place during the regular seasons of 1946‚Äì47‚Äì48, but each year faltered during the playoffs, as the Nashua Dodgers won the NEL playoff championship for three consecutive seasons. Nashua was the first NEL team to break the baseball color line and, in 1946, ugly confrontations were reported between the Nashua and Lynn clubs. Future Brooklyn Dodger star starting pitcher Don Newcombe integrated the NEL in 1946, along with eventual Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella. \\"I remember one game against the Lynn Red Sox\\", Newcombe recalled in 2007. \\"Their manager, ‚ÄòPip‚Äô Kennedy, was all over us, yelling all kinds of [racial] things at us, and Mr. [Buzzie] Bavasi [the Nashua general manager and future Dodger executive] got him into the office and said, ‚ÄòThey can‚Äôt fight you, but I can.

On the left is the gravestone of his son Aharon. 2016 Kalonymus Kalman Halevi Epstein (; Nowy Korczyn (Neustadt), Poland, 1753‚Äì Krak√≥w, 1825), was a rabbi and Kabbalist, one of the great leaders of the Chassidic movement, known as the Maor Vashamesh (◊û◊ê◊ï◊® ◊ï◊©◊û◊©), after his sefer.  Biography  Born in 1753, Epstein, known as \\"Kalmish\\", was the son of Aaron Halevi Epstein, and an alleged descendant from the Prophet Samuel and King David. Epstein's early years were lived in abject poverty in Neustadt, Poland, one of 10 children, before his father moved the family to Krak√≥w to seek a better life when Epstein was five years old. In Krak√≥w he became known as an Illui (young prodigy). As a child, after selling bagels baked in the home of his parents to assist in his family's support, Epstein would sneak into the beth midrash and listen to the Torah sermons given by Krakow scholars, including Yitzchak Halevi, Chief Rabbi of Krak√≥w. One day following one of the sermons, Mordechai Gutgold, one of the wealthiest Jews in Krakow, asked Epstein in jest to repeat the sermon that he had just heard, which he did, word for word. In response, Gutgold agreed to support Epstein and fund his Yeshiva education, provided that his father agreed to the marriage of Epstein and Gutgold's daughter as soon as Epstein reached Bar Mitzvah. At the age of 13, Epstein married Gutgold's daughter, Milka Raidel. After being deeply impressed by the Hassidic leader Elimelech of Lizhensk during his visit to Krakow, Epstein traveled to Lizhensk hoping to study Torah and Chassidut under the direct tutelage of Elimelech, against his father-in-law's wishes but with the support of his wife. Upon Epstein's arrival in Lizhensk, Elimelech sent him to study under Yechiel Michel of Zlotchov. After less than two weeks at Yechiel Michel's home, Epstein returned to Lizhensk with a message from Yechiel Michel to Elimelech that \\"you will not find others like Kalmish\\". Epstein went on to become the most favored of Elimelech's students, also acting as the rabbi's personal \\"shamash\\" (assistant). In recognition of Epstein's aptitude, Elimelech sent him, in 1785, to assume the Chassidic leadership of Krakow. Upon his arrival in Krakow, Epstein was met with great opposition by the misnagdim, opponents of the Chassidic movement, but eventually they came to respect him. His reputation as a holy leader began to grow throughout Western Galicia, and Jews began visiting him over far distances to seek his counsel and guidance and to receive his blessings. Epstein managed to raise the profile of Chassidut throughout Western Galicia, and became a friend of Yitzchak Halevi. During a visit to Lizhensk, Elimelech, who was close to death, requested that Epstein succeed him and assume the mantle of leadership in the city of Lizhensk, which he declined. Among Epstein's contemporaries as leading students of Elimelech were the Chozeh of Lublin, the Maggid of Kozhnitz, Rebbe Menachem Mendel of Rimanov and the Apta Rebbe. Epstein referred to all of them as \\"Rebbe\\", as he called all of the Chassidic leaders of his generation, as a mark of respect. Toward the end of his life, Epstein instructed his younger son Aharon to gather together all of his writings and sermons, which was later published as the sefer Maor Vashemesh - the title by which he later became known. The kabbalistic commentary of the Maor Vashemesh is still studied by Chassidic and non-Chassidic Jews today, and some Chassidic leaders have referred to the Maor Vashemesh as the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" of Chassidut. Epstein died on the second day of Rosh Chodesh Tamuz in 1825 at the age of 72. Family Epstein and his wife had two sons and several daughters. His younger son Aharon became the Rebbe of the Krakow community when his father died and became known as \\"Reb Oron\\" after the Oron Hakodesh (Holy Ark). His older son Yosef Baruch became known as the \\"Guhter Yid\\" (the Good Jew), or the \\"miracle worker of Neustadt\\".

Biography Leslie was born in New York City to parents Lloyd Bertram Dunner and Audrey (Hemmings) Dunner. His father worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and later for the Brooklyn Department of Sanitation, while his mother was a social worker. Dunner grew up in Harlem and the South Bronx and developed an interest in jazz that was disapproved of by his high school teachers. He learned to play the clarinet and also acquired from his older sister a passion for African dance, a talent that led to him becoming the youngest performer at the 1964 New York World's Fair. He went on to the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, where he was awarded his bachelor's degree in 1978. He later attended Queens College in New York City, where he was awarded a master's degree in 1979, and the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, where he was awarded a D.M.A in 1982. Dunner's first professional appointment was an academic one. He became a professor of music at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, in 1982. He remained there until 1986, when he became the principal guest conductor at the Dance Theatre of Harlem and, in 1987, the assistant conductor at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO). Dunner's residency at the Detroit Symphony lasted until 1999 and provided the platform on which he built his subsequent career. Dunner's reputation as a conductor rests on his ability to communicate with the audience through a wide variety of musical styles, and through his willingness to experiment with tempo and presentation. He is a flamboyant performer whose conducting style owes almost as much to dance as to the more conservative classical music tradition. While he was with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, first as assistant, then associate, and finally as resident conductor, Dunner performed in concerts ranging from Pops to the major classical repertoire. He also led the DSO in developing their educational programs, concerts for young people, and touring programs. Above all, as Dunner told the New Bay Times (Annapolis) in 1998, he is interested in having his audiences feel the music as well as experience it intellectually. During his time with the DSO, Dunner's reputation as a charismatic and popular conductor grew quickly. In 1994 he was invited to work as assistant to veteran conductor Kurt Masur (1927--) with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, joining them on their 1995 European tour. His association with the New York Philharmonic ended in 2001. Also in the 1990s Dunner was involved with the Detroit Symphony Civic and Dearborn Symphony Orchestras and toured Europe, South America, and the United States with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. In 1992 he performed with the Dance Theatre of Harlem for Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who had been released from prison two years earlier. Dunner also took the Dance Theatre of Harlem to world-famous festivals, including the Salzburg Festival in Austria and the Tivoli Festival in Denmark, and led the company's command performance before Diana, Princess of Wales in London. In 1998, Dunner took up the post of music director of the Annapolis Symphony OrchestraGreenfield, Phil (5 February 1998). Candidate Dunner has trio of talents; Diversity: Leslie Dunner, who is vying for the directorship of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, is a talented conductor, composer and clarinetist, The Baltimore Sun, Retrieved November 22, 2010 with a promise to rejuvenate the orchestra with his own brand of flamboyant conducting and varied musical programming. He explained to the New Bay Times shortly before taking up the post that he hoped to make the audience react to the music: \\"I think the only promise I can make at this point is things won't be boring.... People have to make up their own minds as to whether they like something or not.\\" Although he began his residence at Annapolis with the conservative program inherited from his predecessor, in the six years he worked in Annapolis the orchestra developed a reputation for the accessibility of its concerts and the dynamism of its performances. Amid controversy regarding non- renewal of his contract, Dunner left Annapolis in 2003 moving to Chicago and took up the post of music director at the renowned Joffrey Ballet Company, pledging to ensure that the dancers never performed without live musical accompaniment. By the end of 2003, he had already made his mark on the ballet orchestra, the Chicago Sinfonietta. Hedy Weiss, dance critic of the Chicago Sun Times, called his Christmas 2003 performance of The Nutcracker \\"masterful,\\" praising the way he adjusted rhythm and tempo \\"to support, even inspire, the performer's perfect balance.\\" In 2014, Maestro Dunner became Music Director and Conductor of the South Shore Opera Company of Chicago after conducting their presentation of William Grant Still's opera, \\"Troubled Island.\\" That production was voted Chicago's best classical music/opera moments of 2013 by Chicago Sun Times critic Andrew Patner. Patner called the performance \\"The most history-making event of the year.\\" Since that performance, Dunner has led the company in numerous new operatic works, including Nkeiru Okoye's \\"Harriet Tubman: When I Crossed That Line To Freedom,\\" and two works of composer Steven M. Allen: \\"The Poet\\" and \\"Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadows.\\" Dunner has also stage Directed for the company Verdi's La Traviata, Kurt Weill's The Seven Deadly Sins, and Menotti's The Telephone. Dunner has conducted Michael Raphael's opera \\"Marcus Garvey\\" with Trilogy: An Opera Company, in Newark, New Jersey. Besides his long-term posts Dunner has performed as guest conductor with major orchestras around the world. These include the New York Philharmonic, the San Francisco and Seattle Symphony orchestras, the Symphony Orchestra of Madrid (Spain), and the Warsaw Sinfonia (Poland). Dunner makes regular trips to South Africa, where he has performed with that country's major orchestras. He has also performed with chamber orchestras, and with prestigious international dance companies, including the American Ballet Theatre, the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden (London, England), and the Birmingham Royal Ballet (Birmingham, England). Dunner has also received many awards and honors, including the Detroit Man of the Year and Spirit of Detroit awards, and commendations from the National Association of Negro Musicians. He was the first American winner of the Arturo Toscanini International Conducting Competition in 1986, and the recipient of the Distinguished Young Alumnus award from the University of Cincinnati in 1996. He was also honored by the NAACP in 1991 with the James Weldon Johnson Award. In 2018, Dunner became the Conductor for the Interlochen Arts Academy Orchestra.

From the beginning of his practice, he received a variety of high-profile commissions for both residential and non-residential structures, mainly in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. His buildings typically had historicist facades, with neoclassical or Italianate ornamentation covering a modern framework. It was only in the 1950s, toward the end of his career, that he created buildings that were purely modern in design. During the Great Depression, a particularly trying time for architects, he received the commission to design Norvelt, which was a new town created as part of President Roosevelt's New Deal policies. One of his commissions, the Citizens National Bank of Latrobe of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, designed with partner Brandon Smith, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Many of Bartholomew's works are contributing properties to the Greensburg Downtown Historic District and the Academy Hill Historic District. Biography Paul Batholomew was born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 25, 1883. His parents were the Rev. Amos H. Bartholomew, a Lutheran minister, and Rachael (Kuhns) Bartholomew. Most of Paul Bartholomew's childhood was spent in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College in 1905, and then studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received a second degree in 1908. After graduation, he worked under architects in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He eventually settled in Greensburg where he began his practice. Sources differ on the date he began his Greensburg practice; one source claims 1910 although his entry in an architects' directory states he began his practice in 1912. Throughout most of his career, his office was in the Coulter Building at 231 South Main Street in Greensburg. However, two 1929 publications list an office in the Keenan Building, Pittsburgh. Paul Bartholomew married Dorothy W. Lyon, a Greensburg resident, on November 1, 1916. Paul Bartholomew died on December 8, 1973, at the age of 90. Partnership with Smith Bartholomew formed a partnership with Brandon Smith (1889‚Äì1962), although sources differ on the year the partnership began. One source claims the partnership commenced in 1915, while Bartholomew's entry in an architects' directory states it began in 1920. In any event, the firm of Bartholomew & Smith was dissolved in 1928 when Smith left to form his own firm, Smith & Reif. Notable commissions Lynch Hall (1923, 1965) at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg Troutman's Department Store (1923) Greensburg YMCA (1912) Among Bartholomew's commissions were the following: * Houses in Academy Hill, Greensburg: The Academy Hill Historic District was created by the National Park Service, in part, to recognize the houses Bartholomew designed in this traditionally elite neighborhood. (Year of construction is in parentheses.) On North Main Street, he designed numbers 419 (1935), 431 (1920), 445 (1913), and 450 (1920). On North Maple Avenue, he designed numbers 528 (1913) and 552 (1922). On Walnut Avenue, he designed number 334 (1936). On Kenneth Street, he designed numbers 208 (1920) & 214 (1937). On Woodland Avenue he designed number 44 (1946). he designed 208 Was his residence from 1920 until his death in 1973. The remaining items are in chronological order: * Greensburg YMCA (1912): Located at 101 South Maple Avenue (corner of East Pittsburgh Street), in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, this 1912 structure is a four-story red brick building with Classical elements. This was Bartholomew's first major non-residential commission. The third and fourth floors consisted of rooms that could be rented, and that part of the building became a residence for elderly men of limited means. The second floor had meeting rooms, and the main floor had a lobby, gym, and residents' lounge. The basement had a swimming pool, weight room, and locker rooms. There was a sub-basement for mechanical equipment. Over the years, the building has undergone major renovations. Nonetheless, the exterior has hardly changed, except for a 1969 addition on the south side of the building to house a new pool. * Troutman's Department Store (1923): Located in Greensburg, this is a six-story Italianate structure with a limestone and terracotta facade built in 1923. The building still stands at 202-226 South Main Street. Although the interior has been gutted and converted into offices and seniors' housing, the exterior remains unchanged and in excellent condition. * Lynch Hall (1923): This Tudor-style mansion was built in 1923 for Charles McKenna Lynch (1884‚Äì1963), an executive of the H.C. Frick Coke Company. The house's original name was Starboard Light, in reference to Lynch's earlier career as a naval officer. Its current street address is 150 Finoli Drive, Greensburg, Pennsylvania (actually located in Hempfield Township), where it serves as the administrative building for University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. * First Commonwealth Bank (1924): Originally known as First National Bank and later as Southwest Bank, this seven-story red brick building is in a Classical Revival style, built in 1924 at 111 South Main Street, Greensburg. The firm of Bartholomew & Smith were the architects. * Citizens National Bank of Latrobe (1926): This is in nearby Latrobe, where it is the tallest building of that city. It is located at 816 Ligonier Street (corner of Main Street) in Latrobe. This six story, Classical Revival structure has a bank on the ground floor and offices on upper floors. It was later known as the Mellon Bank Building. The architects were the firm of Bartholomew & Smith, and the building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. * Fort Jackson Hotel (1926): This three-story, red brick structure at 19 South Washington Street in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania was designed by the firm of Bartholomew & Smith. It was originally a hotel and was later converted into offices. * Beta Theta Pi Fraternity House (1929): This 1929 building is still in use as a fraternity house at 220 North Burrowes Street, State College, Pennsylvania. * Community of Norvelt, Pennsylvania, originally Westmoreland Homesteads (1934‚Äì1937): This planned community in Mount Pleasant Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, was built by the federal government during the Great Depression as one of 92 \\"subsistence homesteads\\" intended to address rural poverty. Paul Bartholomew received the commission to lay out the plan of streets, which he did in a nontraditional pattern of circles and semicircles. The layout was quite spacious with large lots, and it was intended that laid-off mine workers would be able to raise their own food. He also designed over 200 Cape Cod style houses for the community, as well as its public buildings. Land acquisition began in 1934, and the formal dedication, attended by Eleanor Roosevelt, was held on May 21, 1937. The community's name was changed from Westmoreland Homesteads to Norvelt in her honor. Although the individual buildings have been remodeled over the intervening years, a visitor can still gain a good sense of what the community was like when it opened. * Zions Lutheran Church (Renovations) (1937 and 1951): This church is located at 146 South Pennsylvania Avenue (at West Second Street), Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The current structure dates from 1877, although Paul Bartholomew was responsible for renovations in 1937 and 1951. His father had once been pastor of this church. * Laufe House (1953): This was built at 949 Summit Drive in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, for Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. Laufe. Paul Bartholomew was listed as the architect and Herbert Walfish, later a partner of Bartholomew, was listed as \\"designer.\\" This is a very rare example of modern architecture of Paul Bartholomew, who almost always preferred facades with a historical flavor. This two-bedroom house is one story with basement, and has large windows across the back. The exterior consists of redwood and brick, and many interior walls consist of brick and polished wood. * Excela Westmoreland Hospital Addition (1953): Originally Westmoreland Hospital, the street address is 532 West Pittsburgh Street, Greensburg, Pennsylvania. This complex is a hodgepodge of various additions; Paul Bartholomew was responsible for the 1953 component of this building, with James H. Ritchie and Associates of Boston as associate architects.

It is a tract roughly bounded by Rondout Creek, Binnewater and Cottekill roads and Sawdust Avenue. NY 213 runs through the lower portion of the district, paralleling the dry bed of the Delaware and Hudson Canal. Within the district's bounds are 122 contributing properties representing what remains of five plants that produced Rosendale cement, and the homes and dependencies of the Snyder family, who originally owned the land. They range in age from the bed of the canal, where the cement was discovered in 1825 during construction, to some of the last factories built before production was ended in 1970. Included are not just homes, barns, and factories but mines, reservoirs, and a rail siding. After an aborted attempt to secure National Historic Landmark District status in 1978, the district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Geography The district is shaped like a letter \\"r\\", solidly bounded by the roads and creek on three of its sides, but with its eastern boundary mostly following old roads between Route 213, Binnewater and Sawdust. Physically, it is dominated by two large hills, foothills of the Shawangunk Ridge to the south, which rise to over 300 feet (91 m) in elevation, more than above the creek's waters to the south. Between them in a narrow valley sit the remains of one the largest cement plants in it. An old Wallkill Valley Railroad siding runs from there to the northeast corner near where it once joined the main line at today's Binnewater Historic District. Old mines and quarries are tunneled into the sides of both hills. The property is mostly wooded save for the developed areas. Some of the areas along the road are old fields, today meadows. History Natural cement production began almost immediately after its discovery inside district bounds by James McEntee, an engineer on the D&H; canal construction project in 1825.Howe, Dennis E. (2009) The Industrial Archaeology of a Rosendale Cement Works at Whiteport. Whiteport Press, Kingston, NY Production peaked by the end of the 19th century at about 4,000,000 barrels per year.Genero, Peter P. (2005) Thank Rosendale. Genero Press, Fort Pierce, FL Demand for natural cement fell during the 20th century due to competitive pressure from Portland cement. The final cement company closed its operations in 1970 after a valiant attempt to survive mounted by A. J. Snyder. 19th century The Snyder family owned and farmed the property since 1755. In 1809, Christopher and Deborah Snyder commissioned for their newlywed son, Jacob Lowe Snyder, a house with an accompanying gristmill on the creek. Known today as the Century House, it is the oldest extant building in the district whose age is precisely known. In 1825, Jacob ceded a portion of his land to John B. Jervis of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company so that a canal could be built across the property. As a condition of building the canal, Jacob required the company to build him a slip so he could ship his produce to market, and a bridge to reach his mill. Crews excavating the area a short while later found large deposits of dolostone containing an ideal amount of clay minerals that, once pulverized and mixed, could be turned into natural cement without additives. The company set up production facilities almost immediately, as similar cement was used to construct the Erie Canal. The presence of dolomite meant the canal could be built using this new cement and guaranteed another customer beside the anthracite coal miners the canal was built to serve. In 1830, Snyder leased the southeastern corner of his property to Watson Lawrence. Lawrence had already built a cement plant on adjacent land. Other mines and cement plants opened up in the area along the Rondout as well, creating a vibrant local industry. Snyder reinvested much of the Lawrence Cement Company's profits in improving its technical quality. He courted buyers for large, high-profile government projects like New York City's Croton Aqueduct and the Brooklyn Navy Yard docks. This helped create a reputation for quality that unwittingly resulted \\"Rosendale cement\\" becoming a generic term for any natural cement, regardless of where it was produced. The popularity ultimately strained the company's finances to the point of failure; the company closed in 1858. The Lawrenceville Cement plant, ca. 1875 Lawrence retained control of the new Lawrenceville Cement Company, but was ousted after three years when William Beach took over. Beach expanded the production facilities, in time for the rise in demand that occurred as the Gilded Age saw a rapid increase in demand after the lull caused by the Civil War. Beach died in 1881; control soon passed to his son William N. Beach II. The younger Beach took advantage of the recently constructed Wallkill Valley Railroad and its connections to the New York Central network as a way to get product to market, building a siding to the plant. In keeping with a general national trend, this began a shift away from the canal that had spawned the cement works, and within two decades the canal would carry its last loads. 20th century As the century ended, the natural-cement industry dominated the market. The Snyder family was proud that their cement had been used in the Brooklyn Bridge, an icon of the era. Beach built another new plant in the northeast corner of the property to handle demand. But the development of the cheaper Portland cement during that period eventually toppled the Rosendale variety, whose market share dropped 90% in the first decade of the 20th century. Local industrial magnate Samuel Coykendall eventually tried to salvage the Rosendale industry through mergers, combining all the local companies save the ones on the Snyder property into one. The Consolidated Rosendale Cement Company was no more successful than any of its component companies had been, and was in receivership by 1918. In 1911 an Ulster County court had forced the sale of the Snyder company from William Snyder to 21-year-old Andrew J. Snyder II after a disagreement over the sharing of profits. The younger Snyder dismantled one of the larger plants and built a smaller one in its place. He was able to continue production on a reduced scale through the 1920s, and later in that decade attracted the interest of an investor from Cleveland named Kling, who leased a portion of the property from Snyder and started the Interstate Cement Company. The Great Depression soon put an end to that venture, and by 1935 it had become the Century Cement Manufacturing Co., wholly owned by Snyder. He was able to keep the company going through the later 1930s when he allowed mushroom growers to set up shop in the abandoned Beach Mine. Eventually, that would produce five tons (4.5 tonnes) per day before it stopped in 1960. At the same time he also took advantage of a discovery that Portland cement could be made even more quickly and last longer when combined with natural cement in an 80:20 ratio. This blend was particularly suited to highways, then being built at a great pace everywhere due to the combination of New Deal public works projects and increasing automobile use. By the start of World War II production was again on the increase. It fell during the war years but rebounded afterward to even higher levels as highway construction picked up again with the development of the Interstate Highway System. In 1954 Rosendale cement was used for the nearby sections of the New York State Thruway. However, it would be the last major public project in which it was used. Snyder had been exploring the possibilities of making Portland cement as well. Geologists found that there were significant reserves in the Hudson Valley of the type of limestone needed, so in 1958 the company bought a plant from the Swiss company Van Roll. Three years later it was built next to the existing facilities and began turning out cement. Around the same time, chemists developed an additive to Portland cement which eliminated the need for the Rosendale mix, and cut costs even further. Snyder and the company's technical team tried to keep up with the changes, but they were as old as he was and had trouble getting the formula right. The market for the natural cement the property still produced was almost negligible, and in 1970 Snyder finally halted production almost a century and a half after Rosendale cement had first been discovered on the bed of the long-abandoned canal. He himself died five years later Preservation Recognizing its historic importance not just to the region but the country as a whole, two staffers at the American Association for State and Local History prepared an application to have the district designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978 that was never completed. The Century House Historical Society (CHHS) acquired the around the eponymous 1809 building where Jacob Lowe Snyder lived at the time of the canal's construction. It was chartered provisionally in 1992 and fully in 2000. It runs the property as a museum devoted to both the house and the American natural cement industry. In the plant's last years, one of the few markets it had left was the restoration of historic buildings that had originally used it or similar materials. The factory's closure left those builders without any source of authentic material. In 2004 Edison Coatings, Inc., of Plainville, Connecticut, trademarked the brand Rosendale Natural Cement Products and began offering an authentic, historically accurate replacement. Significant contributing properties Several of the many contributing resources to the district are notable in their own right. None have yet been separately listed on the Register, save the sections of canal bed, a National Historic Landmark. The Century House Historical Society(CHHS) operates the site as a museum that is open to the public on Sunday afternoons in the summer season. The museum is also known as the \\"Century House Historical Society Museum\\" and the \\"Snyder Estate Museum\\".http://www.catskillslive.org/QuadricentennialChallengeGeocaches/WidowJaneMine/index.htm Century House Jacob Lowe Snyder's 1809 frame house, renovated in the 1940s, is the core of the CHHS property and the oldest building in the district. The house features the Cement Industry Museum, with artifacts and photographs from the Rosendale cement industry. Rosendale Natural Cement was used in the building of many historic buildings and structures, including the Brooklyn Bridge, the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, the wings of the U.S. Capitol, the Washington Monument, Grand Central Terminal, the Croton Aqueduct, the Empire State Building (foundation) and dams and many other public works projects. There is also a display of horse-drawn carriages and sleighs. Andrew J. Snyder I House Known also as the Ceramic Brick House. Originally built in 1887 as a Second Empire-style mansion complete with mansard roof, in 1950 the windows and roof were converted to a more standard gable with dormers. It was also refaced in polychrome glazed brick imported from Leeds. This drastic exterior redesign did not cost the house its historic status as its original framing and interior layout remain intact. Canal infrastructure In addition to the canal bed, other aspects of the canal remain within the district. There is a waste weir next to it, and just west of Binnewater Road is a reservoir that was used to keep the canal full during dry stretches. The slip that the company built for Snyder is also intact, and is possibly the only remaining slip from the original construction along the entire length of the former canal. Widow Jane Mine Widow Jane Mine, a drift mine into one of the hillsides, is the oldest cement mine on the property. It was constructed using the room and pillar technique, where pillars of dolomite have been left to support the overlying rock. The largest of the mines, it has been likened to an underground pillared room. The deep mining operations are mostly flooded with groundwater, but the room and pillar entrance is available for visitors. Frequent events taking advantage of the unique acoustics are hosted in the summer.

Overbrowsing Overbrowsing occurs when overpopulated or densely concentrated herbivores exert extreme pressure on plants, reducing the carrying capacity and altering the ecological functions of their habitat.Pojar, J., Lewis, T., Roemer, H., and Wilford, D.J. 1980. Relationships between Introduced Black-tailed Deer and the Plant Life of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. Unpublished Manuscript, Ministry of Forests, Smithers, B.C. 63 p. Examples of overbrowsing herbivores around the world include Koala in Southern Australia, introduced mammals in New Zealand, and cervids in forests of North America and Europe. Overview Sign at long term moose exclosure experiment, Homer, Alaska Moose exclosures (fenced off areas) are used to determine the ecological impacts of cervids, allowing scientists to compare flora, fauna, and soil in areas inside and outside of exclosures. Changes in plant communities in response to herbivory reflect the differential palatability of plants to the overabundant herbivore as well as the variable ability of plants to tolerate high levels of browsing. Compositional and structural changes in forest vegetation can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem including impacts on soil quality and stability, micro- and macro- invertebrates, small mammals, songbirds, and perhaps even large predators. Causes There are several causes of overabundant herbivores and subsequent overbrowsing. Herbivores are introduced to landscapes in which native plants have not evolved to withstand browsing, and predators have not adapted to hunt the invading species. In other cases, populations of herbivores exceed historic levels due to reduced hunting or predation pressure. For example, carnivores declined in North America throughout the last century and hunting regulations became stricter, contributing to increased cervid populations across North America. Also, landscape changes due to human development, such as in agriculture and forestry, can create fragmented forest patches between which deer travel, browsing in early successional habitat at the periphery. Agricultural fields and young silvicultural stands provide deer with high quality food leading to overabundance and increased browsing pressure on forest understory plants. Impacts on plants Young Alaska moose browsing on aldersOverbrowsing impacts plants at individual, population, and community levels. The negative effects of browsing are greater among intolerant species, such as members of the genus Trillium, which have all photosynthetic tissues and reproductive organs at the apex of a singular stem. This means that a deer may eat all the reproductive and photosynthetic tissues at once, reducing the plant's height, photosynthetic capabilities, and reproductive output. This is one example of how overbrowsing can lead to the loss of reproductive individuals in a population, and a lack of recruitment of young plants. Plants also differ in their palatability to herbivores. At high densities of herbivores, plants that are highly selected as browse may be missing small and large individuals from the population. At the community level, intense browsing by deer in forests leads to reductions in the abundance of palatable understory herbaceous shrubs, and increases in graminoid and bryophyte abundance which are released from competition for light. Impacts on other animals Overbrowsing can change near-ground forest structure, plant species composition, vegetation density, and leaf litter, with consequences for other forest-dwelling animals. Many species of ground-dwelling invertebrates rely on near-ground vegetation cover and leaf litter layers for habitat; these invertebrates may be lost from areas with intense browsing. Further, preferential selection of certain plant species by herbivores can impact invertebrates closely associated with those plants. Migratory forest-dwelling songbirds depend on dense understory vegetation for nesting and foraging habitat and reductions in understory plant biomass caused by deer can lead to declines in forest songbird populations. Finally, loss of understory plant diversity associated with ungulate overbrowsing can impact small mammals that rely on this vegetation for cover and food. Management and recovery Overbrowsing can lead plant communities towards equilibrium states which are only reversible if herbivore numbers are greatly reduced for a sufficient period, and actions are taken to restore the original plant communities. Management to reduce deer populations takes a three-pronged approach: (1) large areas of contiguous old forest with closed canopies are set aside, (2) predator populations are increased, and (3) hunting of the overabundant herbivore is increased. Refugia in the form of windthrow mounds, rocky outcrops, or horizontal logs elevated above the forest floor can provide plants with substrate protected from browsing by cervids. These refugia can contain a proportion of the plant community that would exist without browsing pressure, and may differ significantly from the flora found in nearby browsed areas. If management efforts were to reduce cervid populations in the landscape, these refugia could serve as a model for understory recovery in the surrounding plant community.

The Maiden Queen was noteworthy as a vehicle for Nell Gwyn, who played the heroine Florimel. Pepys raved about her performance in his Diary -- \\"so great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before....\\" He returned to see the play eight more times. It was also a special favourite of the King, who reportedly called it \\"his play.\\" In addition to Nell Gwyn, the original cast included Nicholas Burt as Lysimantes, Michael Mohun as Philocles, and Charles Hart as Celadon; Anne Marshall as Candiope and her sister Rebecca Marshall as the Queen, Mary Knep as Asteria, and Katherine Corey as Melissa. A later production in 1672 was cast entirely by women.John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, London, 1706; Montague Summers, ed., London, Fortune Press [no date]; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1968; p. 100. Thomas Killigrew, manager of the King's Company, had developed this practice of all-female casts, starting with a 1664 staging of his own play The Parson's Wedding, as a way to capitalise on the Restoration innovation of actresses on the English stage. The Maiden Queen was first published in 1668 by Henry Herringman. Another edition followed in 1698. Dryden composed his play in a mixture of rhymed verse, blank verse, and prose. Gerard Langbaine noted in the 1690s that Dryden drew plot materials from two prose fictions by Madeleine de Scud√©ry, Le Grand Cyrus (for the main plot) and Ibrahim, ou l'Illustre Bassa (for the subplot). (Dryden returned to Scud√©ry's Ibrahim for inspiration for another play, An Evening's Love, the following year, 1668 -- though that venture proved much less successful.) Dryden also borrowed material from Shirley's Love in a Maze. By Dryden's own testimony, the unheroic Philocles was inspired by Magnus de la Garide, the royal favourite of Queen Christina of Sweden. The drama was revived in an adapted form in 1707; Colley Cibber mixed it with materials from Marriage √† la mode. The play remained in the repertory throughout the eighteenth century in various forms; a shortened version called Celadon and Florimel was acted as late as 1796. A London revival of The Maiden Queen occurred in 1886.Downes, pp. 111-12. References External links *Secret-love : or The maiden-queen: as it is acted by his majesties servants at the Theater-Royal.

It first aired on September 30, 2008. Breckin Meyer guest starred as an artist who has an unexplained visual problem.  Plot  Brandon (Breckin Meyer) is painting a portrait of a nude woman. Upon seeing the finished product, the woman's husband becomes angry and punches Brandon. The painting is horribly distorted, but the artist is seeing it as perfectly normal. At the hospital, Brandon protests that he is getting better and shows some quick sketches that he has done, which look normal. Kutner and Taub search his house, but find nothing significant. When Thirteen points out Brandon's reluctance to submit to tests, House deduces that the patient knows he's fine, and Brandon admits that he volunteered for clinical trials to make money. Foreman believes it is impossible to determine the interactions between the different drugs and suggests dialysis to clear out Brandon's blood. Brandon suffers another seizure with facial swelling after the dialysis is completed. House orders surgery to deal with Brandon's abnormal heart rhythm, but Taub suspects lingering toxins when Brandon presents distorted vision again. After investigating Brandon's storage, Taub finds that his paintings show distortion every other month. House discovers that whenever Brandon took the experimental antacid, undigested food caused a bezoar to grow bigger and absorb the pills. The heart surgery is cancelled and the bezoar is surgically removed. During the diagnosis, House is constantly fed information concerning his team from Lucas (Michael Weston), the private investigator he hired with hospital money. Taub is disturbed when he learns from House of a secret bank account that his wife set up. Taub confronts his wife (Jennifer Crystal Foley), but she reveals that she had been saving to buy him a new car. Cuddy catches Lucas in her office sorting through her desk for 'research'. As he is leaving, he offers to give her embarrassing information on House, in exchange for going out with him. Lucas has lunch with Cuddy and finds out she knows that she is being set up by House. Lucas later reports to House that Cuddy didn't fall for their trap. The two argue that using a photo-shopped picture of a younger House on the cheerleader team wasn't the best idea, before Lucas confesses he found out that the picture is real. Lucas states that it is too bad Cuddy didn't see him in a different light, even worse that she didn't even believe it is possible. House replies 'people hate people who have theories about people', and the episode ends with House and Lucas playing a blues song together.

Life Seedo was a son of Samuel Peter Sidow, a musician employed by the Elector of Brandenburg. By the mid-1720s, Seedo was working at the Little Theatre in London's Haymarket. On 27 September 1727 he married the singer Maria Manina, who had small parts in London‚Äôs Italian operas beginning in 1711, including Handel's Teseo. Between 1731 and 1734, Seedo worked on Drury Lane imitations. He wrote several successful stage works, of which his ballad opera The Devil to Pay was the most successful. When the work was first performed on stage it was a failure, but when the composer cut it significantly, from a full opera of 42 airs to an afterpiece of sixteen airs, it became a hit. Apart from The Beggar's Opera, The Devil to Pay was by far the most popular ballad opera of the 18th century. The work was given regular London performances until well into the 19th century and a translation by C. W. von Borcke made it popular in Austria and the German states as well. Borcke's translation was a major influence on the development of singspiel. \\"Mr Seedo\\" was also an organist and organ composer in London during the first part of the 18th century; some of his organ Voluntaries are preserved in the John Reading Manuscripts of Dulwich College, London,Robin Langley (editor), English Organ Music, Volume 3, The John Reading Manuscripts at Dulwich College, Novello & Co.

He and Maria Seedo were in Potsdam later that year where Seedo was the musical director to Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia. Seedo died in Potsdam about 1754, a date inferred from payments made to him.

He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and then in France. Settling in Powhatan County, Virginia, he was known for his paintings of the rural population of his neighborhood as well as for his murals. During World War II (1944) he lived in New York City and painted views of the port during the war. These paintings (4 full pages in color) were featured in LIFE magazine. In 1946 he was appointed professor of painting at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he worked until his retirement in 1971.  Youth  Julien Binford was born of an old southern family, on December 25, 1908 at Norwood Plantation in Powhatan County, Virginia, where he spent his childhood before moving to Atlanta, Georgia. After high school, he entered premedical school at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The director of the new Atlanta High Museum noticed his proficiency in rendering dissections and encouraged him to concentrate on developing his painting talent. Following this advice, Binford studied at the Art Institute of Chicago where he excelled. In 1932, he was awarded the Edward L. Ryerson Traveling Fellowship ($2,500) and spent three years studying in Paris. In France he met √âlisabeth Boll√©e de Vautibault (b. August 9, 1908), daughter of L√©on Boll√©e, a French automobile manufacturer before World War I. √âlisabeth had married Count Jean Maurice Gilbert de Vautibault in 1927 and had published several volumes of poems (under the name √âlisabeth de Vautibault), which were praised by well- known poets such as Jean Paulhan and L√©on-Paul Fargue. She divorced after meeting Julien Binford and continued writing poems both in French and in English. She converted from Greek Orthodox to the Baptist faith after moving to America before she married Julien.Mot de l'√©diteur sur \\"Les √©v√®nements visibles et autres po√®mes\\" de √âlisabeth de Vautibault  The early years  In 1935, Binford returned to Virginia and bought a small farm called The Foundry. The property had belonged to Thomas Jefferson's father. After having formally surrendered at Appomattox Court House, General Lee, while on his way to Richmond, spent his last night as a Confederate general on April 14, 1865, camping on the lawn of his brothers property which adjoined the property Julien had recently acquired. The original building of The Foundry was however in ruins and Binford and his wife, √âlisabeth, lived in a windy shack with no water, no lights, and no heat. In the first years they lived mainly by farming. After 1945, when their finances had improved, they undertook a massive reconstruction of the buildings.The Foundry The simple life-style influenced Binford's painting. His work, which in his one-man showings in Paris had been abstract, became more realistic. He relied on his neighbors and their environment for inspiration. Binford established a close relationship with his African-American neighbors, using them as the subject of his work on numerous occasions. Several of his paintings, presented in Manhattan's Midtown Galleries, look like a black-belt village on Saturday afternoon. One of his most famous works is the mural titled \\"The Lord Over Jordan\\" in Shiloh Baptist Church in Powhatan, Virginia. This is one of the rare occasions that a black congregation commissioned a white artist to decorate its church. The mural, a 12-foot x 12 foot painting, was unveiled with impressive ceremonies and forms the background to the church's baptismal pool. As the congregation was poor, he agreed to be paid in produce, two pick-up truck loads of chickens, corn, potatoes, and beets, which helped the Binfords tide over the winter.  The war years  In the 1940s he developed a relationship with a gallery in New York City. The success of his work allowed Julien and √âlisabeth Binford to move to Manhattan because Life Magazine had commissioned him to paint the activities going on in the harbor near the end of the Second World War. One of the New Deal programs for the economic recovery during Great Depression was designed to provide jobs, not only for manual laborers but for artists as well. The U.S. Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts commissioned the painting of murals on walls of post offices and other public buildings, which lead to a school known as \\"New Deal Art\\". One of these was the mural for the Post Office of Forest, Mississippi. The mural intended to illustrate both the name of the city and the lumber industry of the surrounding county. His oil on canvas mural, completed in April 1941, presents four loggers skidding logs out of the woods. The painting, displayed temporarily at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, N.C..Charlotte, North Carolina, was praised by the Charlotte Observer. An editor of the Progressive Farmer called it the best painting he had ever seen in a public building. The mural was the only one Binford did for the Fine Arts Section. In 1941 Binford was commissioned to paint a mural of the burning of Richmond (1865) for the Post Office of Saunders, Virginia. Intending to illustrate the suffering of the southerners during the last days of the Confederacy, Binford submitted a preliminary sketch showing a street scene with looters, a mother trying to escape with her baby over bodies of dead soldiers lying on the ground, a half-naked woman who had torn off her blouse to prevent herself from being scorched, a horseman riding roughshod over all. The sketch raised controversy. A former president-general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated: \\"It is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen.\\". Bishop James Cannon Jr. of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, who was very influential in Virginia politics, published a criticism in the Richmond Times-Dispatch indicating: \\"The woman's back and hips are poorly portrayed.\\". Though Julien Binford angrily retorted: \\"When and how did this bishop become an authority on the 'backs and hips' of nude women?\\", he never got the commission. Another post office mural, in Ahoskie, North Carolina, is reported as \\"missing\\".Park, Marlene and Gerald E. Markowitz, Democratic vistas: Post Offices and Public Art in the New Deal, Temple University Press, Philadelphia 1984 However, during 1942 his work received the attention of Time, Newsweek and Life, which presented reproductions of some of his paintings. During World War II, he worked on a series of paintings titled \\"New York Harbor at War\\" which were published in a special section of Life.University of Mary Washington ‚Äì  Teaching activity  In 1946 he was appointed professor of painting at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Among his students was the American artist Anne Everett. He was the organizer of regular meetings with a small group of friends, including Emil Schnellock, Matila Ghyka, and Milton Stansbury.Matila Ghyka ‚Äì The World Mine Oyster ‚Äì Heinemann, 1961 He was a faculty member for 25 years until 1971, when he retired to devote more time to his painting. Some of his works are in the Mary Washington University Galleries' permanent collection. Edward Alvey, Jr., dean of Mary Washington, wrote of Binford: > : He was a warm, friendly, natural person. He painted with a sensitivity and > devotion, establishing a feeling of rapport between the artist and the > viewer. His work has a freshness and originality that well exemplifies > Binford's own zest for life and his desire to share its beauty with others. His wife died on July 11, 1984. Julien lived alone for the next ten years and then moved to Charlotte to be with his sister, Eleanor Binford Booth at Southminster retirement center. He died in Charlotte on September 12, 1997, at the age of 88.

He was the third (second surviving) son of Emmanuel Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then, by his wife Gisela Agnes of Rath. Life In 1702, Augustus' father instituted primogeniture in his lands so that on his death in 1704 only the eldest surviving son, Leopold, inherited his father's titles and powers. When Leopold was declared of age in 1715, Augustus Louis tried to claim his rights under the old system, but finally Leopold forced him to renounce them. In exchange, Augustus Louis received the enclave of G√ºsten with its old Schloss built in 1547 by Prince George III and the town of Warmsdorf with all its revenues, as well as other concessions. After the death from smallpox of Leopold and his two sons in 1728, Augustus Louis inherited Anhalt-K√∂then, however he soon faced disputes with his sister- in-law, the Dowager Princess Charlotte Fredericka (who sought the payment of her widow dowry), and his niece Gisela Agnes (who made claims to her father's inheritance). In 1730 Charlotte Fredericka married Albert Wolfgang, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe, but until her death in 1785 she received the sum of 200,000 Thalers annually from Anhalt-K√∂then. For Gisela Agnes, the income from her inheritance rose to 335,000 Thalers a year. These payments left Anhalt-K√∂then deeply in debt. Augustus Louis tried to address the fiscal problems created by obligations to his brother's family members, but without success. Marriages and Issue About 1720, Augustus Louis fell in love with Agnes Wilhelmine von Wuthenau (b. Pl√∂tzkau, 4 December 1700 - d. K√∂then, 14 January 1725), of the old nobility of Anhalt and lady-in-waiting to his mother, the Dowager Princess Gisela Agnes. They were engaged on 18 November 1721 and she was created Countess of Warmsdorf (German: Gr√§fin von Warmsdorf) by the Emperor. The couple finally married in Dresden on 23 January 1722; this morganatic union produced only two daughters, who were recognized as princesses of Anhalt with all appertaining rights: #Gisela Henriette (b. Warmsdorf, 16 December 1722 - d. Warmsdorf, 16 December 1728). #Agnes Leopoldine (b. K√∂then, 31 May 1724 - d. K√∂then, 28 July 1766). In Sorau on 14 January 1726, a year after the death of his first wife, Augustus Louis married again to Christine Johanna Emilie (b. Sorau, 15 September 1708 - d. K√∂then, 20 February 1732), daughter of Erdmann II, Count of Promnitz-Pless. They had five children: #Christiane Anna Agnes (b. K√∂then, 5 December 1726 - d. Wernigerode, 2 October 1790), married on 12 July 1742 to Henry Ernest, Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode. #Frederick Augustus, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then (b. K√∂then, 1 November 1727 - d. Schloss Warmsdorf, 26 January 1729). #Johanna Wilhelmine (b. Warmsdorf, 4 November 1728 - d. Carolath, 17 January 1786), married on 17 December 1749 to Frederick, Prince of Carolath-Beuthen. #Karl George Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then (b. K√∂then, 15 August 1730 - d. Semlin, 17 October 1789). #Frederick Erdmann, Prince of Anhalt(-K√∂then)-Pless (b. K√∂then, 27 October 1731 - d. Pless, 12 December 1797). In Sorau on 21 November 1732 Augustus Louis married Anna Fredericka (b. Sorau, 30 May 1711 - d. K√∂then, 31 March 1750), also a daughter of Erdmann II, and the younger sister of his second wife, just nine months after the latter's death. They had two daughters: #Charlotte Sophie (b. K√∂then, 25 August 1733 - d. K√∂then, 6 September 1770). #Marie Magdalene Benedikte (b. K√∂then, 22 March 1735 - d. Massenheim, 7 November 1783).

He was one of the most prolific Italian authors before Dante: at least 122 sonnets and sixty-one canzoni by Chiaro are known, many of them in tenzone with other poets. Only Guittone d'Arezzo produced more lyrics in the thirteenth century. The Davanzati were an elite family in Florence. Chiaro participated in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. There is some disagreement as to which of two known Chiaro Davanzatis of Florence might be the poet. One, Chiarus f. Davanzati pp. scte Marie Sopr' Arno, of Santa Maria sopr' Arno, was dead by 1280. Another, Clarus F. Davanzati Banbakai, was a Guelph of San Frediano. He served as captain of Or San Michele in 1294 and died between August 1303 and the spring of 1304.Domenico B. Aliberti (1990), \\"La concezione dell'amore nella tenzone poetica tra Chiaro Davanzati e Pacino di Ser Filippo Angiulieri\\", Italica, 67:3 (Autumn), p. 319. Both Chiaros were married and had children.F. Novati (1885), \\"Notizie biografiche di rimatori italiani dei sec. XIII e XIV. -- Chiaro Davanzati\\", Giornale storico della letteratura italiana, 5, p. 404-5\\\\. The first left behind Domina Guida vidua f. et uxor quondam Clari Davanzati pp. Sancte Marie supra Arnum (Lady Guida, widow and former wife of Chiaro Davanzati of the popolo of Santa Maria sopr' Arno), two sons (Martinuccio and Bartolo), and two daughters (Lucia and Lori). A later reference to two sons, Bartolo and Lapo (not mentioned in the earlier document), who were citizens and merchants of Florence, suggests that Lapo had already attained his majority at his father's death. The poet could not have been dead by 1280, for he composed a tenzone that can be dated to 1283.H. Wayne Storey (2004), \\"Chiaro Davanzati\\", Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia, Christopher Kleinhenz, ed. (London: Routledge), pp. 214-15. Most of Chiaro's work is preserved in the chansonnier Vaticano latino 3793. Topically his poetry is in the Sicilian and Occitan traditions. The chief poets whose influence can be detected are the troubadour Rigaut de Berbezilh and of the Sicilians Giacomo da Lentini, Guido delle Colonne, and Stefano Protonotaro. His style is light and easy (trobar leu), and rich in simile. His use of simile, much of it drawn from the Occitan troubadours and medieval bestiaries,Kenneth McKenzie (1905), \\"Unpublished Manuscripts of Italian Bestiaries\\", Periodical of the Modern Languages Association, 20:2, pp. 384-86\\\\. Chiaro was also influenced by the fables Aesop and Phaedrus, containing elements of both, c.f. Kenneth McKenzie (1898), \\"A Sonnet Ascribed to Chiaro Davanzati and Its Place in Fable Literature\\", Periodical of the Modern Languages Association, 13:2, p. 214-20. has been criticised as dry, unpoetic, and overused. In the fourteenth century his reputation declined considerably, as his method of elaborating old lyrics fell out of favour.He is known to have modelled his poems on works by Guittone, Monte Andrea, and Sordello (McKenzie, p. 210). One of his images, however, that of a child at a mirror (come 'l fantin ca ne lo speglio smira), was used even in the Renaissance. Kenneth McKenzie describes Chiaro's \\"style\\" as developing over time and containing widely divergent elements under opposing influences: > . . . at one period of his activity Chiaro decked his verse in plumes > borrowed from the Proven√ßal and Sicilian poets and from Guittone d'Arezzo; > but there is great variety in his work; we find political poems, realistic > poems in popular style, attempts at philosophy, and finally indications of > the influence of Guinizelli and the dolce stil novo.McKenzie, p. 212. Though Chiaro has been placed with the guittoniani, followers of Guittone d'Arezzo, before, only in the canzone Valer voria s'io mai fui validore does Chiaro address Guittone directly. When deviating from the trobar leu into more difficult and complex construction he is usually conversing with guittoniani, such as Pallamidesse Bellindoti or Rinuccino, with Monte Andrea, his most common correspondent, or with Finfo del Buono. Chiaro had a correspondence with \\"Dante\\" according to the manuscripts, but this is regarded now as probably Dante da Maiano, in 1283. In Di penne di paone (\\"Of the peacock's feathers\\") Chiaro accused Bonagiunta Orbicciani of plagiarising Giacomo da Lentini. In 1267 Chario composed Ahi dolze e gaia terra fiorentina to reprimand his fellow Florentines on the occasion of their surrendering of power to Charles I of Sicily, whom they made podest√† while the Ghibellines were sent into exile.

Painting by Ilya Repin (1878) Valentina Semyonova Serova (maiden name Bergman) (1846 - June 26, 1924) was a Russian composer of German-Jewish descent. Her family had converted to Lutheranism before she was born. Early life Serova's parents were merchants who operated a shop that specialized in colonial wares. She studied briefly at the St. Petersburg Conservatory with Anton Rubinstein but left to study with the composer and critic Alexander Serov, known both for his writings and his successful first opera Judith. Introduced through a shared friend, she married Serov in 1863 and in January 1865 their son Valentin Serov was born. Valentin would grow up to become a famous painter, renowned for his portraits. The Power of the Fiend Alexander Serov died of a heart attack in January 1871, and Valentina completed the last act of his third and final opera, The Power of the Fiend. She used his sketches and her memory of what Alexander had played to her to finish the work. The composer N.F. Solovyov helped her with some of the instrumentation and editing. The opera premiered in April 1871. Initially unsuccessful, its revivals fared rather better and was the only opera by Serov to be performed in Soviet times. Second marriage After Serov's death she married a second time to a physician, Vasilii Nemchinov, who died in 1881. They had two children; a son who died in childhood and a daughter, Nadezhda, who married into the aristocratic Zhilinsky family. Serova's son-in-law and grandson from Nadezhda's marriage were both executed during Stalin's rule. One of her great-grandsons perished in World War II; the other was the painter Dmitry Zhilinsky. Composer The experience of finishing her first husband's opera inspired Serova to compose her own operas. Her first opera, Uriel Acosta, premiered in 1885 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. She had shown the score to Tchaikovsky earlier that year, and he had pointed out a number of faults. Valentina asked him if he would give her some lessons in harmony, but he recommended she seek out the guidance of Anton Arensky instead. Her second opera, Maria d'Orval, was never performed and is considered lost. Her third opera, Il'ya Muromets, was successfully staged in Moscow with Feodor Chaliapin in the title role in 1899. Serova's fourth and last opera has not been preserved and even the title is now unknown. She died in Moscow on June 26, 1924. Relatives Valentina Serova's sister, Adelaida, and brother-in-law, Yakov Simonovich, were early childhood pedagogues who, in 1863, founded Russia's first kindergarten. Her son, Valentin, married their adopted daughter, Olga Trubnikova, and had five children with descendants now living in Russia, France, Cyprus, and Lebanon.

It was constructed from 1971 to 1974 and designed by architects Johannes Krahn and Richard Heil. Today it is part of the headquarters of DZ Bank.  History  City-Haus is also known under the name Selmi-Hochhaus after the Persian owner Ali Selmi. The project was very controversial. On the night of 23 August 1973, a fire broke out in the upper floors of the building shell fire, which was widely visible throughout the city and attracted many onlookers. The fire was put out until eight hours later, as the Frankfurt Fire Department at that time was not yet equipped for fire fighting in this amount. Many onlookers cheered the fire (\\"Citizens for Fire\\"), students should even satirical songs ( \\"Today, we have to burn the Selmi be small cottages intoned\\"). Arson was later called, however, unlikely as the cause of the fire, apparently a defective welding was the woodwork of the 40th and 41 Floor set on fire. This fire was the starting point of modern fire protection for buildings in Germany and the start of the career of the chief fire fighter Ernst Achilles. In 1976, the DG Bank (today: DZ Bank) purchased the tower and set up their headquarters there. In 1985, a seven-storey building called City- Haus II was built on the adjoining property and in 1993 the DZ Bank also moved in the newly built Westend Tower.  Construction  The building has a reinforced concrete structural frame. It consists of a centrally arranged core group with external dimensions of 17.4 m √ó 14.2 m and two mutually offset storey wings, each 40 m long and 14.1 m wide. Apart from the core to bear in each tract four columns arranged inside the vertical loads. Rule projectiles have a height of 3.2 m. The floor slabs are T-beam construction. The plate thickness varies between 10 cm and 20 cm, the total construction height of 40 cm and 60 cm. The tower stands on a thick bottom plate up to 4.15 m, with 2000 m¬≤ of floor space.  Renovation  From October 2007 to December 2008, City- Haus was redesigned by Christoph M√§ckler fully rehabilitated and was thereby a new facade and an overall brighter appearance. During the conversion time could damage the renter will be minimized because the new facade was suspended during the week from outside the Altfassade and Altfassade was just on the weekends. The new facade of the building, reducing energy consumption by around 35 percent. The cost of the renovation were US$53 million.

Currently under the administration of the Ministry of Defense, it has also served as the civil aviation with Japan's first scheduled air service. Operations Currently the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's Camp Tachikawa occupies the western portion of the airfield. The main unit there is the GSDF Eastern Army Aviation Group. It operates helicopters, and also commands the anti-tank helicopter units at Camp Kisarazu. Equipment at Tachikawa includes the UH-1J Iroquois, and the Kawasaki OH-6D and OH-1. The Tachikawa Disaster- Preparedness Base sits on of land. In addition to the airfield, it includes emergency medical-treatment facilities and stores of emergency supplies. Agencies with a presence at Tachikawa include the Cabinet Office, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Japan Coast Guard, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Tokyo Metropolitan Police and Fire departments, National Hospital Organization (an Independent Administrative Institution), and Red Cross. Also in Tachikawa are Camp Higashi-Tachikawa of the Ground Self-Defense Force and the Tachikawa Depot of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. It is roughly southeast of Yokota Air Base. The alternate center for Japan's national government is located on a portion of what used to be Tachikawa Air Base. The center includes billeting, offices, communications and control centers, hospital and a full cafeteria. The center is for the national government to use if forced to relocate or as a command center to direct a response to a significant national disaster or emergency. Japan's National Emergency Response Center is located in a complex of underground bunkers and tunnels that were developed for the Japanese military for use during World War II to hide and protect airplanes from the US bombings. These tunnels were taken over by the US Military and used for storage while the base was in operation from 1945 to 1977, when the base was given back to the Japanese Government as well as the disposition of the bunker complex. The underground complex is located under what was the west Tachikawa Air Base housing, Military Barracks complex and the runway area. From November 1977 to present day the tunnel and bunker system have been enlarged to accommodate up to 5,000 people and to sustain them for a period of one year if necessary. History  Origins  Tachikawa was originally built at the direction of the Imperial Guard for the purpose of providing aerial defense for Tokyo. The Guard also considered sites in Sagamihara, Kawagoe and Kodaira, but chose Tachikawa for its proximity to central Tokyo, good rail connection (today's Chuo Main Line) and favorable geography (flat land with few residents). Tachikawa Airfield's origins begin on 14 March 1922 when a flying squadron of Farman III aircraft, one balloon squadron and a material depot unit moved to Tachikawa from Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. This small group was commanded by a Colonel Arikawa, Engineering Corps and the flying squadron commander was Captain Yoshitoshi Tokugawa. Civil aviation from the airfield commenced in 1929 with the inauguration of the scheduled commercial service by Japan Air Transport to Osaka. Japan's first scheduled air service linked Tokyo and Osaka with a three-hour flight. The airport also had scheduled flights to Dalian and Seoul. The operations continued until 1933, when it transferred to Tokyo Airfield, now Tokyo International Airport at Haneda. Tachikawa's next component was formed in November 1933 when the moved to the airfield. Six years later it was renamed the Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd. In addition, Hitachi, and Showa Aircraft Industry built plants in the vicinity. With the departure of the civil aviation in 1933, Tachikawa returned to being an Army airfield. Its warplanes were transferred to a base in Kashiwa in the northwestern corner of Chiba Prefecture in 1939. In 1937, two pilots, Masaaki Iinuma and Kenji Tsukagoshi departed Tachikawa with a Mitsubishi Ki-15, heading for London. Their mission was to congratulate King George VI on his coronation. The aircraft was named the Kamikaze.Keiko Itoh, The Japanese community in pre-war Britain, p. 179, Retrieved from Google Books on September 7, 2008 During the late 1930s and throughout World War II, Tachikawa Aircraft employed growing numbers of workers, it produced more than 6,000 aircraft. It produced fighters, troop carriers, and bombers. Prototypes were designed and developed at the manufacturing plant. The Imperial Japanese Army built technical schools at Tachikawa, one of which was the Tokorozawa Army Aviation Maintenance School, established in 1935. The school was moved to Tachikawa in April 1939 when the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Fifth Air Wing moved to the airfield. Cross-trainees, college graduates and Air Academy graduated went to this school to become aviation technical maintenance officers. It also co- existed with the Fourth Aviation Training Unit which provided basic training for Japanese Army Air Force flyers. Near the end of World War II, Tachikawa was subjected to intense bombing by United States Army Air Forces XXI Bomber Command 29th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortresses during April and June 1945. The Shintentai, an anti-aircraft kamikaze group, defended the airfield and its manufacturing facilities, however most of the airfield was rendered unserviceable by the bombing raids, along with most of the structures and support facilities of the airfield by the time the first United States Army forces moved in on 5 September 1945.

No. 59-0528 After the war, the United States occupied the base, with the airfield being a shambles. Given its proximity to Tokyo, Tachikawa Airfield was designated as a transport base, with a mission to provide transportation for priority passengers and cargo in and around the Tokyo Area; to support the Occupation Government in Japan, and provide strategic transport to the United States. Air Transport Command (ATC) was given the assignment to get the airfield cleaned up and operational. ATC established the 1503d Army Air Force Base Unit (AAFBU) to manage the cargo and personnel operations at the airfield, and by 1 January 1946 the base was ready enough to permit C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando aircraft to operate from the base. Larger C-54 Skymasters began using the base by April 1946, and a day/night lighting system was installed and in operation by November 1946. In 1947, Air Transport Command began to support the Seventh Air Force Service Command Japan Air Materiel Area (JAMA) at Tachikawa, which eventually became the major tenant unit at the base, and by 1948 was providing depot-level maintenance for aircraft in Far East Air Force and logistical support from Air Materiel Command. In July 1949, JAMA was redesignated Far East Air Materiel Command (FEAMCOM). The western sector became Tachikawa Air Base, while FEAMCOM took the eastern part. They became a single base again in 1956. With the inactivation of Air Transport Command in 1948, Military Air Transport Service redesignated the 1503d AAFBU the 540th Air Transport Wing, later 1503d Air Transport Wing. The wing became the host organization at Tachikawa Air Base upon activation. The 1503d ATW became the main MATS organization in the Western Pacific, supporting numerous tenant organizations such as the Air Rescue Service; Air Weather Service, and Far East Air Force theater Troop Carrier Groups (later Wings) which transshipped supplies and personnel from the MATS Aerial Port at Tachikawa throughout the 1950s. The first major mission by the 1503d was the evacuation of large numbers of Americans out of China in 1948 after the Communists defeated the Chinese Nationalist forces during the Chinese Civil War. In addition to the MATS operations, Far East Air Force operated numerous Troop Carrier units from Tachikawa, providing theater airlift within the command flying C-46 and C-47 transports during the late 1940s under the 6000th Support Wing. =Korean War= The Korean War saw operations increase, with Troop Carrier units carrying out the evacuation of American civilians and then transporting the torrent of Allied military men and material flowing into the war zone. Around the clock planes arrived and departed. A typical flight might carry 35,000 pounds of hand grenades to South Korea, with 80 wounded personnel arriving to be transported to the USAF Hospital on the base. For thousands of servicemen whose tours took them into, through or out of Tachikawa, the USAF hospital became the best barometer of American military activities in the Far East. =Cold War= After the Korean War, the Far East Air Force 6100th SW became the host unit at Tachikawa in 1953, with MATS and Air Materiel Command becoming tenant organizations. MATS flights arrived and departed 24 hours a day operating C-118, C-121, C-124 and C-133 from Hickam Field, Hawaii or being staged through Alaska. From Tachikawa, outbound MATS flights headed to Clark Air Base heading to Saigon, Bangkok, and on to Karachi Airport, Pakistan or to Guam, Wake or Midway Island in the Central Pacific Region. In the Tachikawa air disaster on June 18, 1953 when a U.S. Air Force Douglas C-124 Globemaster II transport experienced an engine failure after takeoff and crashed into a field near the base. The accident claimed the lives of 129 people, and was the deadliest air disaster in history at the time.Worst Crash - TIME Time Monday, Jun. 29, 1953 Retrieved September 7, 2008 With a runway only long, Tachikawa was not adequate for the largest aircraft, and the U.S. decided to extend the runway into the neighboring town of Sunagawa (now part of the city of Tachikawa).

In 1964, operations from Tachikawa began to phase down as its location in the urban area of Tokyo made heavy transport operations undesirable. In addition, Tachikawa's short runway made jet transport operations difficult. As a result, the Air Force chose to develop nearby Tama Airfield (the present-day Yokota Air Base) with more and more heavy transport operations going there. The 1503d was reduced to Group Level, and operations at Tachikawa focused more on Aeromedical Transport operations from the Philippines, and supporting MATS units at deployed locations in the Pacific. C-130E troop carrier units from Pacific Air Forces continued to operate from the airfield. With the inactivation of the Military Air Transport Service in 1966, the aerial port facilities were turned over to the Pacific Air Forces 6100th Support Wing (formerly 6000th), which had taken over base support duties from the 1503d ATW in 1953. Military Airlift Command operations were reassigned to Yokota Air Base. In the late 1960s, more and more transport operations were shifted to Yokota, and by 1969 the use of the airfield ended with the exception of light aircraft use. On 3 October 1969, Fifth Air Force announced that the flight activity at Tachikawa would be halted until the end of the year. During the 1970s Tachikawa's mission changed to being a support base, primarily USAF military housing for Tokyo and the large USAF hospital remained. On 23 January 1973, the Kanto Plain Consolidation Plan (KPCP) was endorsed by the 14th U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee, both the U.S. and Japanese Government agreed to return of Tachikawa Air Base.\\"Fourteenth Meeting of Japan-United States Security Consultative Committee\\" (Press Release w/translation) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Japan. Retrieved April 16, 2011 KPCP was a primary Fifth Air Force program which consolidates major USAF activities at five facilities in the Kanto Plain (Tachikawa, Fuchu Air Station, South Camp Drake, Kanto-Mura Dependent Housing Area, and Johnson Housing Annex) into Yokota Air Base. Following the completion of the USFJ Facilities and Areas Adjustment Program (1968 to 1971), the plan was developed through the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee and its Facilities Subcommittee. As the first implementation of the KPCP, Yamato Air Station (Tachikawa AB school annex and unaccompanied personnel dormitory area) was returned to the Japanese Government on 30 June 1973. After the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, plans were made to close Tachikawa for budgetary reasons. The base was officially closed on 30 September 1977 (Special Order GA-45, Headquarters, Pacific Air Forces, 27 September 1977); on 30 November 1977, Tachikawa Air Base was formally returned to the Japanese government. =Major USAF units assigned= * Japan Air Materiel Area (FEAF), c. 1946 :Far East Air Materiel Command (FEAF), 1 Jul 1949 : Far East Air Logistics Force (AMC), 1 Jul 1952 : Air Materiel Force, Pacific Area (AMC/AFLC), 1 Oct 1955 - 1 Jun 1957; 1 Apr 1960 - 1 Jul 1962 : Northern Air Materiel Area, Pacific (AMC), 1 June 1957 - 1 April 1960 * 13th Supply Group, Depot (the old 13th Air Depot Gp of WWII), bef.

Briggs was promoted from a shadow parliamentary secretary role to the outer ministry upon the 2013 election of the Abbott Government. He remained in the outer ministry, though with a change in portfolio in the Turnbull Government; however, he quit the ministry and moved to the backbench in late 2015 following inappropriate conduct during an official overseas trip. Briggs lost his seat in the 2016 federal election to Nick Xenophon Team candidate Rebekha Sharkie.  Background  Briggs grew up in the River Murray town of Mildura, where his father was a local bank teller and his mother volunteered in the canteen at the Sacred Heart Catholic primary school. He attended St Joseph's College where he excelled in cricket before moving to Adelaide to pursue his dreams of playing for Australia. Briggs became a member of the Liberal Party in 1999 and was on the Liberal Party State Council from 2000 to 2002. He was an employment relations adviser for Business SA from 2000 to 2002. In 2002, he started working for the then South Australian Treasurer, Rob Lucas, before moving to Canberra in 2003 to work for Kevin Andrews in the Howard Government. From 2004 to 2007 he was a senior advisor for WorkChoices to the Prime Minister, John Howard.  Political career  Briggs was pre-selected as the Liberal Party of Australia candidate for the 2008 Mayo by-election to replace former Liberal leader and minister Alexander Downer. In the absence of a Labor candidate, Briggs won the seat with a reduced 53.03 percent two-candidate vote against the Greens, in comparison to the 2007 election with a 57.1 percent two-party vote against Labor. The Liberal two-party vote was increased to 57.4 percent at the 2010 election and to 62.5 percent at the 2013 election. After the 2010 election Briggs was given the position of chair of the Coalition's Scrutiny of Government Waste Committee as part of the opposition led by Tony Abbott. In September 2012, Briggs was appointed to the Opposition frontbench as the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Supporting Families. As part of his role as the Chairman of the Coalition's Scrutiny of Government Committee, Briggs wrote The Little Book of Big Labor Waste with the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and the Shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey. It was published on 13 May 2013. Briggs has also pursued the Gillard Government over a Freedom of Information decision to refuse access to Greens policy costings. Ministry promotion and resignation After the 2013 election of the Abbott Government, Briggs, an Abbott loyalist, was appointed promoted from a shadow parliamentary secretary position to the outer ministry as Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Briggs was on crutches with an injured leg after a failed crash tackle on Abbott at a boisterous late-night party in Abbott's office on the night he was deposed as Prime Minister in September 2015. For the next two months, Briggs insisted that he had damaged his anterior cruciate ligament while jogging the following morning, and had not been not involved in shattering an expensive Italian marble table in Abbott's office. It was expected that the damage to the table would be repaired at the taxpayer's expense, but Abbott later said he would pay for it. On 20 September 2015, in the incoming Turnbull Government, Briggs' portfolio in the outer ministry was changed to Minister for Cities and the Built Environment. Turnbull had initially dumped Briggs from the ministry, but when Bruce Billson declined to remain, Briggs was reinstated. Following a late- night incident in a Hong Kong bar, involving Briggs and a female DFAT staffer, during an official visit in November, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull asked Briggs to \\"consider his position\\". On 29 December 2015, Briggs quit the First Turnbull Ministry and moved to the backbench. Briggs acknowledged that his behaviour had not met the \\"particularly high standards required of ministers\\", although he said that nothing illegal had occurred. According to The Australian Financial Review, \\"government sources\\" claimed Briggs was accused of sexual harassment. According to The Adelaide Advertiser: \\"It is understood Mr Briggs told her she had piercing eyes, then later put his arm around her. As the trio was leaving, Mr Briggs gave the female public servant a kiss on the cheek\\". Other reports suggested the kiss was on the neck. Briggs' wife Est√©e, a former Liberal staffer, responded hours later on Facebook by posting a family picture of the two along with their three young children, and reportedly said the scandal was a \\"complete exaggeration and over-reaction\\". With Turnbull becoming aware of the incident on 5 December, questions were raised over the \\"unusually long time\\" between the complaint and the resignation, as well as the timing of the announcement during the holiday period. Minutes after Briggs' press conference, Mal Brough also stood aside from the First Turnbull Ministry due to an investigation by the Australian Federal Police over the alleged copying of the diary of former speaker Peter Slipper. The two resignations led to a ministerial re-shuffle. Briggs announced that he intended to re-contest the Liberal seat of Mayo at the 2016 federal election and to return to the ministry one day. Following the announcement of his resignation, despite claiming that he would not identify her, Briggs distributed a photograph of the complainant to some colleagues. The photograph later appeared in a national newspaper, along with sufficient detail to identify the woman. In April 2016, Briggs supported calls from two state Liberal parliamentarians for seal culling in South Australia, after witnessing a \\"massacre\\" of dozens of fairy penguins on Kangaroo Island. 2016 election Briggs was beaten at the 2016 federal election by his former staffer Rebekha Sharkie, who successfully contested Mayo for the Nick Xenophon Team. He lost over 16 percent of his primary vote from 2013, and finished just three percent ahead of Sharkie on the first count. Ultimately, Sharkie defeated Briggs after the distribution of preferences.

Hooker wrote the libretto that the opera \\" Fairyland\\", conducted by Alfred Hertz, was based. Hooker co-wrote the libretto and lyrics for Rudolf Friml's 1925 operetta The Vagabond King, and is noted for his 1923 English translation of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, especially prepared for actor Walter Hampden. The translation, written in blank verse rather than the Alexandrines of the original play, was highly acclaimed as being one of the finest translations of a play in verse into English, and for many years, until Anthony Burgess' translation was published, was virtually the only English rendition of the play used. An unusual aspect of Hooker's translation is that it never uses the word panache at all, perhaps because Hooker realized that its double meaning in the play's final scene is untranslatable into English - the word means plume in French in addition to its usual definition, which is, roughly, bravery or daring. Jos√© Ferrer played Cyrano in a highly acclaimed 1946 Broadway version of the play which used this translation, winning a Tony Award for his performance. At the same time, Ralph Richardson was also appearing as Cyrano in a London production of the play, again using this translation. Ferrer then won an Oscar as Best Actor for the 1950 film adaptation, which used the same translation.

For example, the number of times a given polynomial equation has a root at a given point is the multiplicity of that root. The notion of multiplicity is important to be able to count correctly without specifying exceptions (for example, double roots counted twice). Hence the expression, \\"counted with multiplicity\\". If multiplicity is ignored, this may be emphasized by counting the number of distinct elements, as in \\"the number of distinct roots\\". However, whenever a set (as opposed to multiset) is formed, multiplicity is automatically ignored, without requiring use of the term \\"distinct\\". Multiplicity of a prime factor In the prime factorization, for example, : the multiplicity of the prime factor 2 is 2, while the multiplicity of each of the prime factors 3 and 5 is 1. Thus, 60 has four prime factors allowing for multiplicities, but only three distinct prime factors. Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial Let F be a field and p(x) be a polynomial in one variable and coefficients in F. An element a ‚àà F is a root of multiplicity k of p(x) if there is a polynomial s(x) such that s(a) ‚â† 0 and p(x) = (x ‚àí a)ks(x). If k = 1, then a is called a simple root. If k ‚â• 2, then a is called a multiple root. For instance, the polynomial p(x) = x3 + 2x2 ‚àí 7x + 4 has 1 and ‚àí4 as roots, and can be written as p(x) = (x + 4)(x ‚àí 1)2. This means that 1 is a root of multiplicity 2, and ‚àí4 is a 'simple' root (of multiplicity 1). The multiplicity of a root is the number of occurrences of this root in the complete factorization of the polynomial, by means of the fundamental theorem of algebra. If a is a root of multiplicity k of a polynomial, then it is a root of multiplicity k ‚Äì 1 of its derivative. The discriminant of a polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root.  Behavior of a polynomial function near a multiple root  upright The graph of a polynomial function y = f(x) intersects the x-axis at the real roots of the polynomial. The graph is tangent to this axis at the multiple roots of f and not tangent at the simple roots. The graph crosses the x-axis at roots of odd multiplicity and bounces off (not goes through) the x-axis at roots of even multiplicity. A non-zero polynomial function is always non-negative if and only if all its roots have an even multiplicity and there exists x0 such that . Intersection multiplicity In algebraic geometry, the intersection of two sub-varieties of an algebraic variety is a finite union of irreducible varieties. To each component of such an intersection is attached an intersection multiplicity. This notion is local in the sense that it may be defined by looking at what occurs in a neighborhood of any generic point of this component. It follows that without loss of generality, we may consider, in order to define the intersection multiplicity, the intersection of two affines varieties (sub-varieties of an affine space). Thus, given two affine varieties V1 and V2, consider an irreducible component W of the intersection of V1 and V2. Let d be the dimension of W, and P be any generic point of W. The intersection of W with d hyperplanes in general position passing through P has an irreducible component that is reduced to the single point P. Therefore, the local ring at this component of the coordinate ring of the intersection has only one prime ideal, and is therefore an Artinian ring. This ring is thus a finite dimensional vector space over the ground field. Its dimension is the intersection multiplicity of V1 and V2 at W. This definition allows us to state B√©zout's theorem and its generalizations precisely. This definition generalizes the multiplicity of a root of a polynomial in the following way. The roots of a polynomial f are points on the affine line, which are the components of the algebraic set defined by the polynomial. The coordinate ring of this affine set is R=K[X]/\\\\langle f\\\\rangle, where K is an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of f. If f(X)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^k (X-\\\\alpha_i)^{m_i} is the factorization of f, then the local ring of R at the prime ideal \\\\langle X-\\\\alpha_i\\\\rangle is K[X]/\\\\langle (X-\\\\alpha)^{m_i}\\\\rangle. This is a vector space over K, which has the multiplicity m_i of the root as a dimension. This definition of intersection multiplicity, which is essentially due to Jean-Pierre Serre in his book Local Algebra, works only for the set theoretic components (also called isolated components) of the intersection, not for the embedded components. Theories have been developed for handling the embedded case (see Intersection theory for details). In complex analysis Let z0 be a root of a holomorphic function f, and let n be the least positive integer such that, the nth derivative of f evaluated at z0 differs from zero. Then the power series of f about z0 begins with the nth term, and f is said to have a root of multiplicity (or ‚Äúorder‚Äù) n. If n = 1, the root is called a simple root.(Krantz 1999, p. 70) We can also define the multiplicity of the zeroes and poles of a meromorphic function thus: If we have a meromorphic function f = g/h, take the Taylor expansions of g and h about a point z0, and find the first non-zero term in each (denote the order of the terms m and n respectively). if m = n, then the point has non-zero value. If m > n, then the point is a zero of multiplicity m ‚àí n. If m < n, then the point has a pole of multiplicity n ‚àí m. References *Krantz, S. G. Handbook of Complex Variables.

It is a near pristine floodplain with an area of that may expand to by the end of the wet season, making it the largest wooded swamp in the Northern Territory and, possibly, in Australia. It has a strong seasonal variation in depth of water. The area is of great cultural significance to the Yolngu people, in particular the Ramingining community.Australian Nature Conservation Agency. (1996). A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia (Second Edition). ANCA: Canberra. pp. 154-155\\\\. It was the filming location for the film Ten Canoes.Ten Canoes Press Kit Geography and climate The Arafura Swamp is a large and irregular floodplain surrounded by a low plateau in height, with prominent scarps to the east and west. The eastern scarp contains the Arafura Jungles site. It is laced with drainage channels and billabongs and forms a major flood-control and sedimentation basin for the Goyder-Glyde river system, with the main inflow coming from the Goyder and Gulbuwangay Rivers in the south, and with discharge northwards through the Glyde River into the Arafura Sea. It has a monsoonal tropical savanna climate with a mean annual rainfall of over , falling mostly from December to April. In dry years much of the swamp lacks free standing water during the dry season. The average annual increase in water depth over the wet season is nearly two metres, with refilling starting in January and reaching its greatest depth in April. Flora and fauna The Arafura Swamp contains 25 distinct plant communities, with over 100 species of grasses, herbs, aquatics, sedges and trees recorded. Most of the swamp is covered by low forest and woodland over grassland, with the dominant tree species being the paperbarks Melaleuca cajuputi and Melaleuca leucadendra. The swamp is classified as an Important Bird Area. It is a major breeding area for magpie geese. Other abundant waterbirds include wandering whistling ducks, Pacific black ducks and green pygmy geese. There are breeding colonies of royal spoonbills, little pied and little black cormorants, and darters. Land adjacent to the swamp supports one of the largest breeding populations of the hooded parrot outside the Katherine area.

The threadfin rainbowfish, once known only from New Guinea and the Cape York Peninsula, has been discovered in the swamp. It is also an important breeding site for freshwater and saltwater crocodiles. Cultural use Aboriginal people from the Ramingining community use the swamp for fishing, hunting and gathering, including harvesting the eggs of geese and crocodiles. The margins of the swamp are used for grazing livestock. The swamp is one of very few tropical wetlands in Australia continuing to be managed by Aboriginal people using traditional land management practices, including formal burning regimes. Traditional use of the swamp was studied by anthropologist Donald Thomson in the 1930s. Much of the 2006 film Ten Canoes was filmed on location in the swamp with many of the actors deriving from the local community and speaking in Yol≈ãu Matha.

As a composer Seymour is best known for his operas, which have \\"complex orchestral textures and italianate lyricism\\". Early life and education John Laurence Seymour was born on January 18, 1893, in Los Angeles, California. His parents were John L. Symour and Rose Anna La Pointe. He grew up in Sacramento, California. He attended Polytechnic High. Seymour graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1917 with a degree in Letters and Sciences. While in school he became a member of Phi Beta Kappa Society. He also obtained a degree in Russian in 1919. Seymour had a great interest in music. He played the violin. In 1922, he traveled to Europe. From 1923 to 1928, Seymour studied composition in Italy with Ildebrando Pizzetti and Felice Boghen. He also studied with Vincent d'Indy in France. In 1932, he traveled to Japan. Career Seymour initially became a teacher, and was part of the faculty at Berkeley where he lectured mostly on opera and drama from 1928 to 1936. During this time, he also served as the head of the drama department at the Sacramento Junior College, a position he held until 1950. In 1940 he earned his PhD in English literature from Berkeley. His dissertation was called Drama and Libretto and was an adaptation of two of Shakespeare plays. That same year, he became a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He later became a librarian at Southern Utah College in Cedar City, Utah from 1969 to 1985. Compositions One of Seymour's operas, In the Pasha's Garden, received the Bispham Memorial Medal Award. The opera was based on a story from H. G. Dwight. It was first performed on January 24, 1935, at the Metropolitan Opera under the baton of Ettore Panizza, with Lawrence Tibbett in the title role. The performance was not well received. In fact, it was called \\"just plain silly.\\" The production was fifty- five minutes long and only one act. The score was published by Tin Pan Alley, and was originally called The Eunuch. At the time the opera was published, Seymour was 41 years old. The opening premiere of the opera's matinee performance was a fundraiser for the Southern Woman's Educational Alliance. The opera was performed three times total between its premiere and February 13, 1935. After the performance, Seymour was given the Bispham Memorial Medal Award. After receiving negative criticism for set design and composition, Seymour returned to California. He would not compose for years to come. He wrote another opera, Ollanta, el Jefe Kolla, that received awards in the cultural division of the Bolivarian Games in La Paz in 1977. Seymour was also skilled in learning languages, and translated several dramas from French and Russian into English. Later life Seymour was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. No other Mormon composer has had their work performed at the Metropolitan Opera. He was given an honorary Doctor of Letters from Southern Utah State College (now Southern Utah University). Before his death in 1986, he wrote a short autobiography which is now held in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections at Brigham Young University.

Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States. The decision upheld the constitutionality of a state law, giving hiring preference to veterans over nonveterans. The law was challenged as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by a woman, who argued that the law discriminated on the basis of sex because so few women were veterans. Background A federal district court had struck down the law as unconstitutional based on its discriminatory impact: \\"The District Court found that the absolute preference afforded by Massachusetts to veterans has a devastating impact upon the employment opportunities of women. Although it found that the goals of the preference were worthy and legitimate and that the legislation had not been enacted for the purpose of discriminating against women, the court reasoned that its exclusionary impact upon women was nonetheless so severe as to require the State to further its goals through a more limited form of preference.\\" \\"Upon remand, the District Court... concluded that a veterans' hiring preference is inherently nonneutral because it favors a class from which women have traditionally been excluded....\\" Decision Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Byron White, Harry Blackmun, William Rehnquist, and John Paul Stevens. The Court declared the law was constitutional, pointing out the law's gender-neutral language, \\"legitimate and worthy purposes,\\" and legislative history. Stewart recognized the need for intermediate scrutiny in gender-based discrimination cases: \\"any state law overtly or covertly designed to prefer males over females in public employment would require an exceedingly persuasive justification to withstand a constitutional challenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" He also recognized that \\"when a neutral law has a disparate impact upon a group that has historically been the victim of discrimination, an unconstitutional purpose may still be at work.\\" The Court cited Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. to apply a heightened form of review, a two-part test: \\"When a statute gender-neutral on its face is challenged on the ground that its effects upon women are disproportionably adverse, a twofold inquiry is thus appropriate. The first question is whether the statutory classification is indeed neutral in the sense that it is not gender-based. If the classification itself, covert or overt, is not based upon gender, the second question is whether the adverse effect reflects invidious gender-based discrimination... [which is] 'the condition that offends the Constitution.'\\" The Court reversed the District Court after determining that there was no discriminatory purpose at work behind the law: \\"The appellee... has simply failed to demonstrate that the law in any way reflects a purpose to discriminate on the basis of sex.\\" Dissent Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.. Marshall saw the law as unconstitutional based on implied motivation from its discriminatory impact. \\"Where there is 'proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, . . . judicial deference is no longer justified.'\\" Marshall further states that \\"[t]o discern the purposes underlying facially neutral policies, this Court has therefore considered the degree, inevitability, and foreseeability of any disproportionate impact, as well as the alternatives reasonably available.\\" \\"In the instant case, the impact of the Massachusetts statute on women is undisputed. Any veteran with a passing grade on the civil service exam must be placed ahead of a nonveteran, regardless of their respective scores. The District Court found that, as a practical matter, this preference supplants test results as the determinant of upper level civil service appointments. Because less than 2% of the women in Massachusetts are veterans, the absolute preference formula has rendered desirable state civil service employment an almost exclusively male prerogative.\\" Marshall pointed out the practical result of the preference law: \\"In practice, this exemption, coupled with the absolute preference for veterans, has created a gender-based civil service hierarchy, with women occupying low-grade clerical and secretarial jobs and men holding more responsible and remunerative positions.\\" Justice Marshall's dissent called for shifting the burden of proof from the individual to the state: \\"Where the foreseeable impact of a facially neutral policy is so disproportionate, the burden should rest on the State to establish that sex-based considerations played no part in the choice of the particular legislative scheme.\\" See also *Gender equality *List of gender equality lawsuits *List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Burger Court *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 442 References External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States equal protection case law 1979 in United States case law Gender discrimination lawsuits United States public employment case law United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v.

It can be \\"a short length of rope with an eye loop at one end and a metal hook at the other\\" or a piece of \\"flat nylon webbing sewn into a four-foot loop\\". Such a tool is routinely carried by firefighters in their structural turnout gear as a standard piece of personal equipment. While the variety with a metal hook may be more versatile, the nylon loop weighs less, is less expensive, and can be safely carried in a pocket. The hose strap has been a firefighting tool in common use since at least 1918, and appears as early as 1898 in an inventory list of Seattle, Washington municipal firefighting equipment. A nylon loop hose strap, folded for storage While the terms may be used for a family of similar tools, they share a wide variety of established uses, including carrying un-charged fire hose, opening doors, closing doors, securing hoselines, dragging victims, and even carrying boots. The use that gives the tool its name, however, is securing a charged hoseline, allowing a firefighter to better control and maneuver the line while flowing water. To use a hose strap in that manner, a firefighter secures the tool to the hoseline three to five feet behind the nozzle, using either the hook or a girth hitch, and loops the other end of the tool around his or her opposite side shoulder. Since the tool is attached several feet behind the firefighter, its use will not hinder a firefighter wearing a Self-contained breathing apparatus. For larger attack lines, such as a hand line, second or third firefighters can use additional hose straps to secure the hose farther behind the nozzle operator, to provide additional leverage against the water pressure. Since multiple hose straps will typically be available to a team of firefighters, they can be used in combination to handle a variety of other tasks. For example, if a task requires greater length than that of a single hose strap, two hose straps may be connected via girth hitch.

Her film Peter and the Wolf has won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2008. Early life Raised at Highfield in Southampton, she began work as an animator as a child with her older brother. The two children created special effects for her brother's home films. Having only a slight interest in animation as a child, Suzie graduated with a degree in the sciences from University College London. She spent many years travelling the world and doing odd jobs. However, believing not to be skilled enough in science, she switched to the humanities and began work as an English teacher at an Indian woman's shelter and orphanage in her mid- twenties. Templeton was given an image of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit by her mother, which inspired her to begin work with sculpture, models, and puppets for stop motion animation. Career Templeton began her professional career in animation after attempting enrolment at the Surrey Institute of Art and Design (now known as the University for the Creative Arts in Farnham) at the age of 28. After finishing with a BA in animation there, she moved on to the Royal College of Art (RCA), graduating in 2001. Templeton was attracted to the model making and creative process of stop motion due to the solitary and slow process of the medium. At the RCA, she was able to craft her abilities in three dimensional work and story telling. Not only did she build on her technical abilities, but she also found her own voice and tone in the medium. She began with the impression that she'd work on cartoons (such as Wallace and Gromit) to appeal to commercial interests for jobs and work. However, her films have taken a dark and difficult approach. Animation had become an outlet for her darker emotions, rather than appealing to the masses. Templeton completed two projects at RCA, her first short film Stanley (1999) and her graduate project Dog (2001) both winning numerous awards. After graduating from RCA, Templeton began work on a modern interpretation of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Templeton was approached by film maker and producer Hugh Welchman and conductor Mark Stephenson asking her to create an animated sequence to be played during a live orchestral performance. Templeton began work on the film alone in her own home. After understanding how large of a piece the film actually was, she moved to a Polish studio. The production of the film took over two hundred people and over five years to complete. The film was released in 2006 and is the winner of multiple awards, including the Academy Award for Best Short Film in 2008. In October 2008 Templeton has joined the roster of animation directors at Tandem Films. Templeton has also mentioned that her next project may be another short film based on Lauren Child's children's book The Pesky Rat. She is also currently working on a feature film, however she declines to disclaim any information regarding the subject or producer. She is also writing a feature film.Don't Panic > Magazine > Suzie Templeton  Arts. Dontpaniconline.com (29 January 2010). Retrieved on 17 March 2012.

The square had always existed as a \\"largo\\" since Roman times, as the road to Bergamo would cross the walls of the Roman city. In medieval times as the city expanded beyond its Roman walls the homonymous basilica was founded, and the largo became an important crossroad in the city's intricated road network. Corsia dei Servi (now Corso Vittorio Emanuele II), corsia di san Damiano (now Corso Monforte), corso di Porta Orientale (now Corso Venezia), Contrada del Durino (now via Durini), Contrada del monte (now Corso di Montenapoleone) all used to cross here. Subsequently, from 1931 to 1948 the largo was widened and officially became a \\"Piazza\\", the old buildings were demolished and new ones were built in their place. The only building that survived the radical renovation of the largo was the basilica, which still stands today. New streets were opened such as Corso Matteotti in 1927 and Corso Europa in the 1960s. Nowadays the streets meeting in San Babila and the contiguous Largo Arturo Toscanini are, anticlockwise from the bottom, Corso Europa, via Durini, via Borgogna, Corso Monforte, Corso Venezia, via Bagutta, Corso Matteotti and finally Corso Vittorio Emanuele II.

He founded the Magnetical- Spiritual School of Universal Commune in 1911 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The academy is based on the study of \\"eternal and continuous life\\" using its \\"Light and Truth Spiritism\\". According to his philosophy, Magnetic-Spiritual School of Universal Commune is the direct continuation of the Hesen School founded by Moses. Early life Mateo was born on August 19, 1866, in the Spanish city of Cintruenigo (province of Navarra). He was the son of \\"working class\\" parents, Ignacio Trincado Alfaro and Romualda Mateo de Ayala. He was a student for about eighteen months at a Jesuit school and later studied to be an electrician.  Career   Escuela Magnetico-Espiritual de la Comuna Universal  In 1912, Mateo traveled to East Jerusalem, where he was received by the guardians of the school of the Essenes K√°bala; he received the order to open a school, intended as a continuation of the K√°bala. The new school he founded, Escuela Magnetico-Espiritual de la Comuna Universal (EMECU), became popular. In its first twenty-four years, 184 branches opened in several Spanish provinces, as well as Cuba, El Salvador, the United States (US), Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, Uruguay and Venezuela. For administrative operations, the schools established a rigid discipline, governed by a document entitled, \\"Rules of Procedure, Statutes, Circulars and Articles\\", from its official magazine, La Balanza (\\"The Balance\\"). The document describes a \\"personality\\", whereby the Civil School is an educational institution for philanthropic and cultural studies, with own metaphysical and scientific methods.  Unity for Spanish speakers  In addition to writing on spiritism, Mateo promoted the progress and unity of Spanish-speaking people. On October 12, 1921, he developed the Hispanic- American-Oceanic Union (UHAO), symbolized by a flag with the seven colors of the rainbow and the Basque Oak tree of Guernica. In 1925, he founded the Organization Templo Azul Racionalista (Otar), for scientists and intellectuals, and then the \\"Circle Master's Advocate\\", a secular education program, whereby teachers would instruct other teachers. Nicaraguan revolutionary and politician, Augusto C√©sar Sandino, was one of the best-known followers of Mateo's \\"Luz y Verdad\\" (\\"Light and Truth\\") manifesto of 1931. The Colony Jaime (Santiago del Estero) On July 25, 1931, Mateo directed the founding of Colony Jaime (), located in Robles in the northern province of Santiago del Estero, Argentina; the Colony remained in existence as of 2012. In 2012, twenty-five families, consisting of seventy-nine children, teenagers and adults, are the Colony's residents. It is located near the city of Santiago del Estero (capital of the province). Since 1952, Colony Jaime collaborates with the Cologne Provincial Public School No. 667 Pedro Juricich (primary and secondary EGB3 initial level), which works with many children from the area who attend the association. Mateo also created the Colonia Los Libertadores. Death and administration At the time of Mateo's death on December 6, 1935, it was revealed that he had left directorship duties of the school to his wife, Maria Mercedes Riglos Cosis. She delegated this authority to their eldest son, Juan Trincado Donato, who died in 1992. Work Some of Mateo's most representative texts are: * Con√≥cete a ti mismo * Extremes Meet * Philosophy Rational Austere * Spiritist Questionnaire * Speech by Bishop Strossmayer * Searching for God * Five Loves * Prophylaxis of Life * Jesus Man not God * Magnetism in its Origin * First Ray of Light * The True Life of Mary of jerico * Philosophy Universal Encyclopedic * Alfaqui Vademecum * Spiritism Studied He wrote 42 works; including books and pamphlets, of which only 14 were printed, 32 are in the hands of their children. These include the continuation of the Code of Universal Love and his Autobiography.

The company was founded in 2001 by J. Lloyd Tomer, Scott Tomer and Kim Sorensen. The company is currently owned by U.S. businessman Sam Hathi of Jamraval, Inc. Other YTB subsidiaries include YTB Travel Network, Inc., Zamzuu, Inc., and REZconnect Technologies, Inc (2004‚Äì2009). YTB is based in Wood River, Illinois. International subsidiaries operate in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Bermuda and Canada.SEC Info - YTB International/Inc - 8-K - For 1/12/08 - EX-99.1 Between 2006 and 2009 the company was the subject of several lawsuits and investigations in California, Illinois, and Rhode Island, alleging the company to be a pyramid scheme and usage of deceptive marketing. Declining revenues following this led to the company's bankruptcy in 2013, after which it was purchased by Jamraval, Inc. and reorganized under the name YTB Global Travel. Business model YTB reports having thousands of representatives in the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas and Canada who have sold over $3 billion in travel in the company's first 10 years. In 2012, YTB was listed as the 52nd largest travel agency in Travel Weekly's yearly \\"Power List\\". YTB Global Travel Inc has two separate companies that operate under the YTB Global Travel Inc. corporate umbrella: YTB Travel Network and YTB Marketing. Representatives can participate in one or both programs. In YTB Travel Network, representatives participate by purchasing an \\"online travel agency\\" website from which they can be paid a sales commission. After paying a set up fee and monthly maintenance-fee, representatives can sell travel-packages online to others, as well as utilize the website for their own travel purposes. In YTB Marketing, representatives (referred to as \\"Independent Marketing Representative\\" or Reps) market YTB's representative programs to others. YTB does not charge a fee to participate in the marketing arm of YTB Global Travel. YTB pays a commission or referral fee and tiered compensation to those who participate in the Rep marketing program. History J. Lloyd \\"Coach\\" Tomer, his son Scott Tomer, and Kim Sorensen launched YTB in 2001 in Alton, Illinois. Growth was slow until 2004, when YTB's creators bought controlling interest in a related company, REZconnect Technologies, increased their marketing budget, and aggressively recruited new members with videos of successful salespeople. By years end, the company employed 23 employees with total travel sales reaching $20 million. In 2007, Royal Caribbean stopped doing business with YTB, describing the company as a \\"card mill\\"; an industry term for a business that provides perks that are intended for a limited number of travel agents to the general public. In 2008 the company was sued by California Attorney General Jerry Brown. An out-of- court settlement required changes to the company's business model, and generated a decrease in membership attributed to bad publicity. In late 2008, YTB laid off 17 employees, a move that was part of a reorganization. In 2008 the company's revenues were $44.8 million. YTB said its independent audit at the end of 2008 expressed \\"substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern\\", a sentiment the company itself later echoed. In 2009 the company was operating at a loss of $1.9 million for the first three months of the year. Revenue in that quarter dropped 49% to $21.8 million and then to $18 million in the second quarter. The company's paying members also declined substantially in number, from a high in April 2008 of 138,000 to 60,414 in mid-2009. The decline in revenue led the company to sell several commercial properties it owned in 2009, including the company's Learjet. That year YTB also sold RezConnect, by then its technology and booking arm, to two of RezConnect's officers. Under the terms of the sale, YTB would indemnify the new owners for any YTB-related liabilities. In 2011 the company sold its headquarters building and adjoining property for $7.6 million. In October 2011, a newly formed company, Sixth Scott LLC began purchasing YTB Travel Network from YTB International. The company was relaunched as First Alliance Travel one year later. On February 1, 2012 founder J. Kim Sorenson died at the age of 62. In March 2012 the YTB announced a plan to merge with LTS Nutraceutical, another MLM firm. In May the company began a major restructuring, and stated that the President and CEO, Robert Van Patton, had submitted his resignation. In September YTB called off the merger, and announced that founder and chairman Scott Tomer was also resigning. On March 1, 2013 YTB International filed for Chapter 11 protection in federal court in St. Louis. The last quarterly earnings report the company filed was for the third quarter of 2011, although the company later announced that the report contained errors.SEC filing w.r.t. to Chapter 11 protection On October 11, 2013 YTB completed the sale of its assets to a Chicago-based businessman Sam Hathi of Jamraval, Inc. \\"We believe the YTB franchise can be turned around and that it can regain the leadership position that it once held in the travel services industry,\\" said Hathi in a statement. YTB has operated as YTB Global Travel since being acquired. Lawsuits In August 2008 California Attorney General Jerry Brown sued the company for $25 million, alleging it to be a pyramid scheme, among other claims. The Illinois Better Business Bureau and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan joined Brown in investigating the company. Brown's lawsuit indicates that 45,000 sales reps earned an average of about $90 in 2007 and of their 200,000 total agents, some 125,000 earned nothing and 37,000 earned less than $39. On May 14, 2009, California authorities settled their suit with YTB for $1 million. As part of the settlement, YTB agreed to restructure, possibly hastening a transition to a franchise system. That same day, Madigan filed a similar suit in Illinois. Brown said the agreement would put an end to the $450, $50 per month unprofitable personalized websites. Around the same time, several former agents filed a class-action lawsuit alleging the company to be an illegal pyramid scheme. The lawsuit says that the company \\"claims to sell travel services, but said company's main business is inducing others to become travel agents\\".Kelsey Volkmann (August 11, 2008). Former agents sue YTB International. St. Louis Business Journal. YTB responded by stating that it intends to \\"vigorously defend the case,\\" and the case was dismissed in July 2009 on the grounds that non-residents of Illinois could not pursue the matter under Illinois law. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, after her office and the Illinois Better Business Bureau received more than 150 complaints about the company, partnered with Brown's office in his state's investigation of the company. The BBB indicated that 80% of YTB revenue came from new agent recruitment, with agents earning an average of $111 per year, almost $400 less than the initial $499 sign-up price.Kelsey Volkman (August 8, 2008). UPDATED: BBB received 90 complaints about YTB, Ill. AG received 70. St. Louis Business Journal. In May 2011 it was announced that YTB had reached a settlement with the state of Illinois, paying $150,000 in restitution. No admission nor denial of guilt was made in the settlement. In 2007, YTB was also investigated for similar allegations in Rhode Island. In the defense of YTB, chief executive Scott Tomer said \\"We [are] are wholly confident that our business model will withstand scrutiny, and look forward to setting the record straight in court.\\" References External links * Companies based in Madison County, Illinois Online travel agencies Multi-level marketing companies ","title":"YTB International"},{"id":"19213132","text":"Kaumahina State Wayside Park Kaumahina State Wayside Park or Kaumahina State Park, is located in Maui County, Hawaii, East of Kahului and West of Hana along the Hana Highway.

Initial release left The magazine was originally sent as an insert with September 6, 2008 weekend home delivery in the seventeen largest United States The Wall Street Journal subscription markets as well as the September 5 editions of the Wall Street Journal Europe and Wall Street Journal Asia. By selecting these markets, it began with a readership of 960,000 (800,000 domestic). The magazine is also available with newsstand purchases of the newspaper in the selected domestic markets, and its content is available for free online at www.wsj.com. In addition, this readership has greater wealth (average household assets of US$2.9 million), higher income ($265,000 per-household income), and takes more than twice as many international leisure trips than the readership of the newspaper. This is notable because the readership of the newspaper spent more on women's apparel than the readers of Vogue and more on leisure travel than the readers of Travel & Leisure. The launch press release was sent in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. The September 6 debut had been announced nearly a year earlier. The magazine was officially unveiled at the Pierpont Morgan Library on September 3, 2008. The unveiling was led by Ellen Asmodeo-Giglio, its publisher; Michael Rooney, Dow Jones chief revenue officer; Tina Gaudoin, WSJ. editor in chief (and former launch editor of The Times of London‚Äôs Luxx); and Robert J. Thomson, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. It has been compared to How To Spend It, the weekend magazine of the Financial Times, T magazine, a New York Times offshoot, Style & Design, a spinoff of Time, and Departures, a magazine distributed for free to American Express platinum and black cardholders. Gaudoin had also previously worked for Tatler, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue and helped to launch the women's magazine Frank. Strategy In 2008, luxury magazines had become the new wave of print media. These aforementioned similar magazines have generally succeeded at both giving free luxury magazine subscriptions to a selected elite audience and hoping that they would read them so that the magazine could sell advertising. This magazine is considered to be a similar bet on the viability for the luxury advertising revenues market. Nearly half of the advertiser bought globally in the United States, Europe and Asia and many advertisers committed to advertising deals for all of next year. Some advertisers committed for two years. The Wall Street Journal launched its weekend newspaper edition, which its publisher, Dow Jones & Company, described as the first and only Saturday morning national weekend newspaper, on September 17, 2005. When the weekend newspaper was launched, it had the highest circulation of any national newspaper published on Saturday. Prior to the launch of the weekend edition, The Wall Street Journal had commonly only been delivered to business addresses. With the home delivery aspect of the weekend edition, the possibility of supplemental weekend luxury magazine arose. The original name Pursuits had been widely publicized as a section of the newly launched weekend edition of the magazine. Expanded launch In December 2009, WSJ. announced plans to expand domestic circulation beyond the 17 largest domestic markets to the entire domestic subscription base, which nearly doubled its domestic circulation from 800,000 to 1.5 million. In addition the frequency of distribution was expanded from 4 to 6 times per year. In order to increase the frequency a May and an October edition were added to the March, June, September and December 2010 distribution schedule. At the time of the expansion, the magazine claimed its first fifteen months of its first six issues had been a success during which the magazine attracted 64 new subscribers to the Journal's franchise. Deborah Needleman replaced Tina Gaudoin in 2010. After Needleman left for T in 2012, she was replaced by Kristina O‚ÄôNeill. Kristina O‚ÄôNeill named editor of WSJ. Magazine In 2012, 2013 and 2014, the magazine increased its publication frequency to 10, 11 and 12 times per year, respectively. When Pursuits initially was marketed, the plan was for it to be a monthly magazine. Design and layout The magazine is oversized to be as large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal. Its specs are trim size and a 50-50 ad-to- edit ratio on a paper stock. The premiere issue of WSJ. had 104 pages in the U.S. and 80 pages in the Europe and Asia editions. It included 51 advertisers of which 19 are new to The Wall Street Journal franchise. The initial cover featured Diana Dondoe in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design, which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue. Critical review The November 2013 cover featuring Gisele Bundchen and Daft Punk won the Clio Award for top magazine cover of the year. Some media experts consider that pursuit of luxury retail advertising an effective strategy, but whether the magazine becomes a success is an open issue. Immediate speculation commented on the likelihood for success given the demographics of the initial subscription base. Others ascribed their great expectations to the brand. Some skeptics claim that since Journal readers are financial information seekers giving them a free magazine of luxury ads may be a waste of time. Others note the magazine's launch despite a market with declining advertising and a world economy suffering from the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Some advertisers expressed appreciation for an opportunity to present to The Wall Street Journal's readers in a different format. The content is slightly less focussed on consumption than How To Spend It. Gaudoin stated her intention was to make a publication that was less about how to spend it and more about \\"how to live it.\\" She also intends to differentiate her magazine via wit and irreverence in order to make WSJ. less urban and less gritty\\" than T. The magazine claims to have planned to feature Sarah Palin in its inaugural issue even before she became John McCain's running mate in the 2008 United States presidential election. In 2013, Adweek named WSJ. \\"Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year\\" for its annual Hot List. The November 2013 cover featuring Gisele Bundchen and Daft Punk won the Clio Award for Top Magazine cover of the year. Notes *U.S. Circulation: Each issue of WSJ.

The park, maintained by Snohomish County, encompasses of wilderness area along the Stillaguamish River and features railroad tunnels, river beaches, and hiking trails. History Robe Canyon was chosen as a part of the railway to transport gold and silver ore mined at Monte Cristo located in the Cascade Mountains to Everett. In 1892, the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway was built. Although the canyon section of the railway had six tunnels, since much of the route was constructed on wooden frameworks at the edge of the bubbling stream, the structures were often swept away in floods, requiring constant repair. During the 19th century, the railway enjoyed good reputations for a scenic trip to the mountains. Starting in 1995, , including a portion of the historical railway segment, has been acquired by Snohomish County from John Hancock Corporation and Trillium Corporation. Since 1995 when Snohomish County acquired the first phase of Robe Canyon, volunteers have maintained the Old Robe Trail. In 2002, volunteers continued the tradition, led by Volunteers for Outdoor Washington, performing annual maintenance, installing log-railings, and relocating a section of trail lost to the river's winter rampages. Yet, the major volunteer effort was reserved for construction of the new Lime Kiln Trail at the west end of the park.
