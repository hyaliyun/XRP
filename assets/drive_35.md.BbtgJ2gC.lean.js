Historically it was long disputed between the towns of Caudete and Villena. A large solar thermal power plant has recently been built in the valley. The lesser kestrel was re- introduced in 1997. Conservation measures have been taken to minimize impact of the power plant on the birds. Location The Alhorines is one of the best cereal-growing areas in the province of Alicante. The level of insolation in the area is among the highest in the Valencia region, at 1,900 kWh/m2 annually. It is a relatively dry agricultural valley, but is of interest due to its unique layout. This includes small plots alternating between grain crops, vineyards and orchards, separated by fences and natural banks, with some sandy area colonized by pines. This makes it an appropriate habitat for numerous species of wildlife, especially small predators. The Bodegas Los Pinos winery in Fontanars dels Alforins, above sea level, was founded at the end of the 19th century and in 1990 became the first organic winery in the Valencian Community and the second in Spain. History The valley was inhabited in Roman times, and later was populated by the Arabs of Villena. At the time of the Christian conquest by the troops of James I of Aragon its ownership was disputed between the towns of Caudete and Villena. The valley was given to Caudete and the kingdom of Aragon in 1240, but under the 1244 Treaty of Almizra between James I and the future Alfonso X of Castile the castle and town of Villena were transferred to Castile. In 1304 Villena became the property of the Marquis of Villena. In 1355 the Viceroy of Valencia try to buy the western part of the valley, leaving the Ontinyent portion the property of Caudete. But Villena never allowed the sale of its part. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) Caudate supported the Archduke Charles of Austria while Villena supported Philip of Bourbon. After the Bourbon victory, Villena accused Caudete of treason and claimed the valley of Alhorines. Philip V of Spain confirmed the transfer and made Caudete part of Villena. In 1736 Caudete regained its independence, but became part of Murcia. The dispute over the valley continued to simmer. In 1836 Villena was attached to the province of Alicante and Caudete to Albacete. North-East part Alhorines remained under the control of Ontinyent until 5 August 1927, when it was separated to form a new municipality. This was officially called Fontanars dels Alforins since 1992. Solar power project Pe√±√≥n del Roc√≠n from Camino de la Reina Bastida de les Alcusses Sunflowers in the protected area of the Alhorines Valley Starting the year with mists in the Alhorines Valley A solar thermal power plant project was formally launched in November 2006 in the valley. It was due to come into operation in September 2013 beside the Villena prison at the southern end of the valley in the Villena municipality. The plant covers and is located between the A-31, N-344 and CV-656 roads. Heat is focused by parabolic mirrors onto a central tower, and used to drive steam turbines. The plant's installed capacity is 50 MW with an annual output of 110,000 MWh. This provides power to 40,000‚Äì50,000 people, and replaces emission into the atmosphere of about 40,000 tons of CO2 each year. The project involved an investment of 240 million euros, and was expected to generate 750 new jobs, 300 directly and 450 indirectly. The environmental impact assessment for the power plant was approved before all the official objections had been addressed. The question of water use does not seem to have been raised. The plant would consume about annually. There were conflicts between the company building the power plant and the Salvatierra collective of Villena, but they seemed to have ended with the draft environmental plan developed by Enestar. This included rehabilitating the old Ermita-Casa Conejo and providing an educational facility to provide information on renewable energy and the environment. Four nature routes would also be established. Construction began in May 2012. Conservation In 1997 the Department of Environment began a project to reintroduce the lesser kestrel, a small raptor that had been made locally extinct due to human action. In February 2014 the Department of the Environment stated it was adding to an existing wildlife reserve in the valley. Both were established in response to construction of the solar-thermal power plant. The aim was to ensure the survival of the unusual grassland ecosystem of Valencia that is home to the lesser kestrel, Montagu's harrier and little bustard. Changes to land use are prohibited within the reservation, as is the use of pesticides or other harmful chemicals.

Established in 1980, it is a family-owned company located near Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The company provides luxury tour buses to an extensive list of celebrities and politicians, including Aerosmith, Beyonc√©, Garth Brooks, Van Halen, Justin Timberlake, Korn, and Lady Gaga. History The company was started in 1980 by Joey and Trent Hemphill. They began with two ‚Äò65 model Silver Eagle buses. The company received a big break in 1982 when Van Halen contracted Hemphill Brothers Coach Company to supply transportation for a four-month tour. The experience ended up becoming a learning opportunity for the young company. At this time, they wrote their own single-page contracts. A spelling error ended up costing the company thousands of dollars, which led to a higher focus on attention paid to their contracts. The first ten years of operation ran alongside the brothers‚Äô musical career which began back in the 1960s. Their mother, LaBreeska Hemphill, grew up as a member of gospel musicians the Happy Goodman Family. She went on to continue playing music with her husband, Joel W. Hemphill, Sr. her two sons, Joey and Trent, and their daughter Candy Hemphill Christmas, under the name The Hemphills. They continued to tour together until 1990. After retiring from touring, the brothers were able to further focus on expanding their business. The company now operates out of a 15-acre campus just outside of Nashville, TN with a fleet of over 115 motor coaches. Their list of top-tier clients continues to grow. Joey and Trent have appeared on Oprah, VH1‚Äôs The Fabulous Life of Pop Stars, HGTV, and are regularly featured on the Travel Channel series, Extreme RVs. Features on the company include Fox Business, Good Morning America, Travel + Leisure, Lonely Planet, MSNBC Your Business, Worldwide Business with Kathy Ireland, and American Profile Magazine.  Services  Hemphill Brothers Coach Company is a full-service motor coach provider. The majority of their business revolves around leasing high-end motor coaches to touring artists with award-winning professional drivers. They also offer motor coach sales and customization. = Leasing = Their leasing service allows the option to select a previously-built and road-ready bus, or a customized bus. Their facility features a 12-bay maintenance shop and two 6-bay conversion shops, and is used to provide services for the Hemphill lease fleet as well as for select external customers. = Customization = Their expert team of electricians, mechanics, woodworkers, custom paint and bodywork specialists, and upholsterers can specialize every aspect of the interior and exterior of the buses to fit their clients‚Äô needs. The conversion operation provides a full range of customizing services to client specifications. For new custom conversions, the operation uses bare coaches from Prevost Car, a manufacturer of touring coach shells for specialty conversions which is located in Quebec, Canada. The operation is a Prevost-authorized maintenance facility. They have performed many unique customizations such as installing an upright piano for Harry Connick Jr. and a treadmill for Taylor Swift. They have also installed amenities such as full recording studios, an indoor fireplace, tanning beds, and more. = Sales = New and used bus sales are also available. Used buses come pre-fabricated and offer a lower bottom line. New buses are able to be customized to the client‚Äôs specific wants and needs. They sell used buses in addition to the new bus sales. = Drivers and Support = The company employs over 150 drivers, many of which have won awards for their services. [3] Each driver is supplied with an assortment of extra parts in case the bus experiences any technical difficulties while on the road. An on-call technician, alongside the maintenance shop in Nashville, assists the drivers should something go wrong, and has a network of garages throughout the country to quickly fix anything that can‚Äôt be taken care of by the driver.  Presidential Services  = Bush Administration = Texas governor George W. Bush‚Äôs campaign contacted Hemphill Brothers Coach Company to supply motor coaches for the presidential bid for the 2000 election. The campaign continued to use the company through inauguration. The Bush campaign again called on Hemphill Brothers Coach Company to supply motor coaches during the 2004 re-election campaign. The campaign/RNC leased 16 buses despite the standard protocol of the Secret Service sourcing their own vehicles. Hemphill‚Äôs technicians worked alongside the Secret Service to fortify the buses to bring them to the heightened security protocols for presidential transportation. = Obama Administration = Hemphill Brothers Coach Company customized the buses that were used by President Barack Obama for a trip to Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois during the week of August 15, 2011. Although the trip had the appearance of a presidential campaign event, it was designated an official trip by the Obama administration and was thus federally financed. = US Secret Service = The two customized Secret Service buses built during the Obama presidency are still being used to this day as part of the presidential detail.

Education and early career Gamon, descended from a family originally resident at Padstow in Cornwall, was the eldest son of Hannibal Gamon, who married Frances Galis of Windsor, and settled as a goldsmith in London. He matriculated from Broadgates Hall, Oxford, on 12 October 1599, at the age 17, when he was described as the son of a gentleman; and he took the degrees of B.A. on 12 May 1603 and M.A. on 27 February 1607. Gamon was instituted to the rectory of Mawgan-in-Pyder, on the north coast of Cornwall, on 11 February 1619, on presentation of Elizabeth Peter, the patroness for that turn, on the assignment of Sir John Arundell, knight, the owner of the advowson. He was also nominated a chaplain to the first Lord Robartes, whom he aided in collecting the library, mainly of divinity and philosophy, that was preserved at Lanhydrock, near Bodmin. Many of the books have Gamon's autograph on the title. The collection includes several manuscript volumes in his handwriting, containing theological and medical notes and prescriptions. Later ministry Gamon's ministry, says Anthony Wood, was \\"much frequented by the puritanical party for his edifying and practical way of preaching\\". On 20 April 1642 he was designated, with Gaspar Hickes (1605-1677) of Landrake, as the representative of Cornwall in the Westminster Assembly of divines. Gamon does not seem to have taken his place in the assembly, possibly on account of the remoteness of his residence, and his absence from its proceedings appears to have given offence. John Walker, in his Sufferings of the Clergy (ii. 249), professes to have been informed that Gamon was \\"so miserably harass'd that it broke his heart\\". There is a gap in the parish registers from 1646 to 1660, but it is generally believed that he died around 1651.

It was painted as a pendant to the Portrait of Laura Dianti of the same year (Laura Dianti was Alfonso I d'Este's lover) and is now known through copies, one of which is by Rubens and another of which is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Others are held in the collections of the countess of Vog√ºe Commarin at Dijon and the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen - the latter is the oldest but only shows the head and shoulders. The painting showed its subject with his right hand on the muzzle of a cannon and his left hand on the hilt of his sword, underlining his martial prowess during a tense time in his relations with the papacy. It was an influence on Dosso Dossi's later portrait of the duke in a similar pose, leaning on a cannon. The original was seen by Vasari and admired by Michelangelo on the latter's visit to Ferrara in 1529. It was later given to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who kept it for a time in Bologna before taking it to Spain. It is mentioned in the 1666 and 1686 inventories of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, but disappeared during the 18th century.

The TUC338 gene was first identified as uc.338, along with 480 other ultra-conserved elements in the human genome. Expression of this RNA gene has been found to dramatically increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The TUC338 RNA gene is 590 base-pairs long, and partially overlaps the gene encoding Poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), a protein involved in mRNA processing. Despite this overlap, PCBP2 and TUC388 were found to be independently expressed. TUC338 is predicted to function in cell growth, possibly at the interface between G1 phase and S phase, and could potentially present a therapeutic target to treat HCC cells. Experimental evidence shows knocking out TUC338 using siRNA reduced the growth rate of both mouse and human HCC cells.

While featuring a more modern design, the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in a number of civil and military variants. Although reduced in numbers through attrition, the \\"Convairliners\\" in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century. Accidents and incidents Like every other major type in long service and operation, accidents and incidents have been recorded that have substantially reduced the numbers flying. The following list is typical of such a record of operational use. =Convair CV-240/CV-300/T-29/C-131= * January 22, 1952: American Airlines Flight 6780, a CV-240-0, crashed in downtown Elizabeth, New Jersey in the first fatal accident after a record 840,000 safe flying hours.

One of the first studies of UCEs showed that certain human DNA sequences of length 200 nucleotides or greater were entirely conserved (identical nucleic acid sequence) in human, rats, and mice. Despite often being noncoding DNA, some ultra-conserved elements have been found to be transcriptionally active, giving non-coding RNA molecules. Evolution Perfect conservation of these long stretches of DNA is thought to imply evolutionary importance as these regions appear to have experienced strong negative (purifying) selection for 300-400 million years. The probability of finding ultra-conserved elements by chance (under neutral evolution) has been estimated at less than 10‚àí22 in 2.9 billion bases. Functions 481 ultra- conserved elements have been identified in the human genome. A database collecting genomic information about ultra-conserved elements (UCbase) that share 100% identity among human, mouse and rat is available at http://ucbase.unimore.it. A small number of those which are transcribed have been connected with human carcinomas and leukemias. For example, TUC338 is strongly upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Indeed, UCEs are often affected by copy number variation in cancer cells, much more than in healthy contexts, suggesting that altering the copy number of ultraconserved elements may be deleterious and associated with cancer. A study comparing ultra-conserved elements between humans and the Japanese puffer fish Takifugu rubripes proposed an importance in vertebrate development.

Although it was first published in 1914 with other Frost poetry in the North of Boston collection, critic Harold Bloom notes that the poem was written in 1905 or 1906. Overview \\"The Death of the Hired Man\\" is a long poem primarily concerning a conversation, over a short time period in a single evening, between a farmer (Warren) and his wife (Mary) about what to do with an ex-employee named Silas, who helped with haymaking and left the farm at an inappropriate time after being offered \\"pocket money\\", now making his return during winter looking like \\"a miserable sight\\" having \\"changed\\". The dialogue occurs whilst Silas is \\"asleep beside the stove. / When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, / Huddled against the barn door fast asleep, / a miserable sight, and frightening, too - / You needn't smile ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt recognize him - / I wasn‚Äôt looking for him ‚Äì and he's changed. / Wait till you see.\\" Despite his obvious poor health, Silas wants to help Warren and Mary with the next haymaking season. Warren is displeased with him during his return and wants him to leave: \\"But I'll not have the fellow back\\". Mary wishes Warren to \\"Be kind\\" and is generally warm to Silas. Questions arise for the motivation of his homecoming ‚Äì an important theme in the poem. There is mention of Harold Wilson, a boy who helped with the haymaking \\"four years since\\" during his school days, who Silas declares must be brought back to help again with the next season. It is not completely revealed why Silas would like Harold‚Äôs return but we do learn that they did not get along well: \\"you know how they fought / All through July under the blazing sun, / Silas up on the cart to build the load, / Harold along beside to pitch it on.\\" It is revealed that \\"those days trouble Silas like a dream\\" and Silas's indignation at Harold's studious manner towards school, and particularly Latin purely \\"Because he liked it‚Äîthat an argument!\\" Upon returning however, Mary recites that Silas would like to teach him more about haymaking: \\"He thinks if he could teach him that, he‚Äôd be / Some good perhaps to someone in the world. / He hates to see a boy the fool of books.\\" Tension is built in the poem as we learn that not only did Silas leave Warren at a dire time: \\"Off he goes always when I need him most\\", but that he also has a wealthy brother who lives just \\"Thirteen little miles\\" away: \\"Silas has better claim on us you think / Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles / As the road winds would bring him to his door. / Silas has walked that far no doubt today. / Why doesn't he go there? His brother's rich, / A somebody ‚Äì director in the bank.\\" When Warren wonders \\"what's between them\\", Mary states: \\"Worthless though he is, / He won't be made ashamed to please his brother.\\" Following this Mary urges Warren to go and see Silas. Warren returns to Mary in a short time informing her that Silas has died: \\"Warren returned ‚Äì too soon, it seemed to her - / Slipped to her side, caught up in her hand and waited. / 'Warren?' she questioned. / 'Dead'‚Äô was all he answered.\\" Themes Several themes are touched upon by Frost in this poem including family, power, justice, mercy, age, death, friendship, redemption, guilt and belonging. A major theme in the poem is that of the ‚Äòhome‚Äô or homecoming. Despite the fact that Silas‚Äô brother should seemingly be the natural home for Silas to die, he has chosen Warren and Mary‚Äôs farm. Warren wrestles with the idea that ‚ÄúHome is the place where, when you have to go there, / They have to take you in.‚Äù (Presumably he says this bitterly or sarcastically.) By saying this he is highlighting, at least at that point in the poem, that he does not feel obliged to put a roof over Silas‚Äô head because of his betrayal of leaving the farm. Mary replies, more charitably: ‚ÄúI should have called it / Something you somehow haven‚Äôt to deserve.‚Äù Silas has evidently returned ‚Äòhome‚Äô to the farm to try to reaffirm some meaning in his life before he dies by helping with the next season, and trying to redeem his relationship with Harold ‚Äì neither of these pursuits are fulfilled. The poem does not blatantly imply that Warren and Mary have had children of their own. Childless marriage is a theme that Frost often addressed. The poem shines light on Warren‚Äôs progressive moral slide from resistance to acceptance of his responsibility of providing a home for Silas‚Äô death despite his wrongdoings. Should Silas be given a home that he perhaps does not deserve? Mary states that ‚Äúhe has come home to die: / You needn‚Äôt be afraid he‚Äôll leave you this time.‚Äù Continuing on her theme of Silas‚Äô worth she empathizes: ‚ÄúHis working days are done; I‚Äôm sure of it.‚Äù Perhaps an also interesting side note is Frost's choice for Mary's name and her moral values. Through the obvious moral dichotomy at the start of the poem between Warren and Mary, it can be interpreted that Mary has slowly convinced Warren to offer Silas a room at the house; obviously his offering comes too late with Silas having died, arguably alone, beside the stove.

It is a painting made for display in a home rather than a church.Jaff√©, 74; Brown, 56, 58 It is close to compositions by Titian's former master Giovanni Bellini, especially, when reversed, one of 1509 in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and has been seen as a challenge to the much older master, by taking on a characteristic compositional formula of his.Brown, 31; Hale, 64 The style is much indebted to Giorgione, and it was often attributed to him in the earlier 20th century. This is especially so in the \\"harmonious fullness and slow gravity of form\\" of the figure of the Virgin, which uses a type of figure Titian did not repeat in later Madonnas.Freedburg, 145, quoted; Jaff√©, 74; Hale, 64 The landscape is virtually identical to the left-most section of the background of the Dresden Venus, traditionally thought to have been begun by Giorgione, but with the landscape done after his death in 1510 by Titian.Jaff√©, 74; Hale, 64 The right background is occupied with a cloth of honour, painted with careful attention to its folds (they were often stored folded up).Jaff√©, 74; Hale, 64 These were hung behind thrones, as in very many paintings of enthroned Madonnas, and here it implies that an unoccupied throne is out of sight to the right. The Bellini in Detroit uses the same device. The composition is therefore a half-way stage between the older more formal enthroned Madonnas and newer compositions with the Virgin and Child shown informally in a landscape setting. Madonnas by Bellini and his followers had for some time been showing small glimpses of landscape to the sides of the painting, usually cut off by a parapet lower down, and the formula here, using a horizontal \\"landscape\\" format, develops this.Brown, 58 Appreciation The \\"Gypsy Madonna\\" is a 19th-century name for the painting, because of the Virgin's supposed \\"dusky complexion and her dark hair and eyes\\". She seems young even by the standards of Madonnas, and the hands of the Child are unusually engaged, respectively with his mother's fingers and her dress (this is a difference to the Bellini).Jaff√©, 74 According to Sidney J. Freedburg, > the effect of sensuous existence Titian makes by his command of optical > device is of an extreme virtuosity. No picture before this attains a > comparable sense of presences existing palpably within an atmosphere, > reflecting coloured light but also absorbing it to saturation point, so that > each pore of flesh or drapery makes texture.Freedburg, 145 Despite the debts to Bellini and Giorgione, the painting shows Titian, who was then around twenty-one, developing his own independent character and style.Freedburg, 144‚Äì146; Hale, 64; Jaff√©, 74 Technical Technical examinations show that it was originally even closer to the Bellini in Detroit, and that many changes were made in the course of painting. Unlike Bellini's usual careful underdrawing, Titian \\"used as his guidelines only summary strokes made with a fairly wide brush with thin wash shading\\".Hale, 64 Among several other changes, the head of the Child originally looked out at the viewer. Provenance Like several other important early Venetian paintings in Vienna, the work was (very likely) in the Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave and in 1636 sold in Venice to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. In 1659, after Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in Brussels, whose collection soon passed to the imperial collection in Vienna.KM; see Bartolomeo della Nave for a fuller account.

They were strongly influenced by Kristian Zahrtmann who taught at the Artists Studio School in Copenhagen from 1885 to 1908. Like Zahrtmann, they abandoned the traditions of the Danish Academy and ventured into Naturalism and Realism.\\"The Funish Art Colony\\" , Johannes Larsen Museet. Retrieved 12 August 2011. History The close-knit core members of the group were Johannes Larsen (1867‚Äì1961) from Kerteminde in the northeastern corner of Funen and Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen, both from the southern port of Faaborg. Alhed Larsen, Larsen's wife, Anna Syberg, Hansen's sister and Syberg's wife, and Christine Larsen, Larsen's younger sister, all of whom were artists, were also deeply associated with the group although they did not receive the same level of recognition as the men. Christine married Sigurd Swane who also moved to Kerteminde to establish their family home. M√∏llebakken, also near Kerteminde, became the home of Johannes and Alhed Larsen and soon developed into a meeting place for the Funen Artists at the beginning of the 20th century. They were joined by Harald Giersing, who married Syberg's sister Besse, and other young artists including Olaf Rude, Harald Leth and Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen who came to M√∏llebakken for inspiration. Another artist associated with the group was Poul S. Christiansen who came from the north of Funen and became a close friend of Zahrtmann after he joined his school in 1885. It was there that he met Johannes Larsen.Hans- Edvard N√∏rreg√•rd-Nielsen, \\"Dansk kunst\\", Copenhagen, Guldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag, 2006. Page 405 et seq. . As a result of their paintings of everyday country life, the Funen Painters were sometimes disparagingly called bondemalerne or the peasant painters. In 1907, there was a heated debate in the Danish press between Gudmund Hentze and Harald Slott-M√∏ller and his wife, who stood up for the more intellectually oriented cultural movement in Copenhagen, and Peter Hansen who defended the Funen Painters together with Jens Birkholm, Poul S. Christiansen and Karl Schou.\\"Fynboerne\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 12 August 2011. Similarities and differences The three main artists among the Funen Painters had much in common. They had all studied under Kristian Zahrtmann and were later all strongly influenced by Theodor Philipsen whose approach to outdoor painting and use of light and shade was often reflected in their work. As in Philipsen's artwork, the influence of Paul Gauguin and Impressionism can also be seen in their paintings. Zahrtmann had however encouraged the artists to develop their own style although all three emulated his use of strong colour. Indeed, Johannes Larsen refused to be identified with a so-called \\"Funen School\\", preferring to ascribe their relationship to a common background and their close friendship.\\"De mandlige Fynbomalere\\" , Johannes Larsen Museet.

Life Flinter, an Irishman by birth, entered the British Army in 1811 as an ensign in the 7th West India regiment of foot, and was advanced to the rank of lieutenant on 22 July 1813. He was sent with his regiment to Cura√ßao in the West Indies in 1812, and in 1815 visited Caracas, then in the throes of an unusually bloody and exasperating civil war. Here he acted as interpreter to the British Embassy. In the following year he was placed on the half-pay list, and seeing no prospect of promotion in the British service, he fixed his residence at Caracas. He was treated with great distinction by the Spanish Captain-General Juan Manuel Cajigal, and he obtained employment as interpreter between the Spaniards, English and Americans. He afterwards travelled through most of the European colonies in the West Indies and on the continent of America, married a Spanish American lady through whom he acquired ownership of land and slaves and obtained a commission in the Spanish Army. Though he remained on the British half-pay list until 1832, he had for some years before that date held the position of a staff officer in the Spanish service. On the outbreak of the First Carlist War in 1833 he declared for Isabella, and in 1834-1835 he served under Mina and Valdez in their unsuccessful operations against Zumalac√°rregui in the Basque provinces. In 1836, while engaged in organising the militia in Estremadura, he was surprised by some of the troops of Gomez and Cabrera, taken prisoner, and thrown into a loathsome dungeon, from which by the connivance of his gaoler he contrived to escape, and made his way to Madrid. He was then placed in command of Toledo, whence on 18 February 1838 he made a sortie, inflicting a severe defeat on the Carlists who were in great force in the neighbourhood. In this action he served nearly 1800 hours of enemy combat without having a single man killed or wounded. Flinter was a knight of the Order of Isabella the Catholic. Death On his return to Toledo on the 20 February, he was saluted by the municipal authorities as the liberator of the province, and two days later the Cortes recognised his services with a vote of thanks. On 16 March, though outnumbered by two to one, he drove Basilio Garc√≠a out of Valdepe√±as, but was prevented by lack of reinforcements from improving his advantage. His conduct on this occasion was severely censured by the Spanish government, and he was removed from his command. Maddened by disappointment and disgust, he committed suicide at Madrid by cutting his throat on 9 September 1838.

From there he learned bass guitar and piano, and he began composing music that has appeared on both his studio albums. Epignosis' music is best described as symphonic rock, as it heavily relies on Hammond organ as well as Mellotron to make a minimalist and symphonic blend of progressive rock.

He was a Member of the Irish Parliament from 1776 until 1801, and then later a Member of the Parliament from 1801 until 1818. Although Flood opposed the Act of Union 1801 that merged the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain, he sat as a member of the united Parliament in London until his retirement. Family and early life Flood was the younger son of John Flood of Farmley, County Kilkenny, and nephew of Warden Flood, chief justice of the court of king's bench in Ireland, the father of the Right Hon. Henry Flood. He was born in 1741, and was educated at Kilkenny College and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he proceeded B.A. in 1761, M.A. in 1764, LL.B. in 1766, and LL.D. in 1772. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1763, soon attained considerable legal practice, and in the social circles of Dublin was immensely popular from his wit and oddity. He married twice; firstly Lady Juliana Annesley, the daughter of Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey and secondly Frances, the daughter of Sir Henry Cavendish, 1st Baronet of Doveridge, with whom he had an only surviving daughter Frances, who married Richard Solly of Walthamstow and York Place, London, whose son Frederick became Sir Fredericks's heir. He succeeded to handsome estates, including Ballynaslaney House, County Wexford from both his parents, and in 1776 was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Enniscorthy. Political career He sat for Enniscorthy until 1783. From 1783 to 1790 he was M.P. for Ardfert, and in 1796‚Äì7 for Carlow Borough. His relationship to Henry Flood did more for his reputation then his own abilities, and he consistently followed in his cousin's footsteps. In 1778 he was made a King's Counsel and was elected a bencher of the King's Inns. He was the Custos Rotulorum of County Wexford. On 3 June 1780 he was created a baronet in the Baronetage of Ireland of Newton Ormonde on the County of Kilkenny and of Banna Lodge in the County of Wexford. Two years later he married Lady Juliana Annesley, daughter of Arthur Annesley, 5th Earl of Anglesey, and he took a prominent part in the volunteer movement, being elected colonel of the Wexford regiment. In many debates which preceded the abolition of the Irish parliament Flood was a frequent speaker. Sir Jonah Barrington calls him an ostentatious blunderer, whose ‚Äòbulls‚Äô did not contain the pith of sound sense which underlay the mistakes of Sir Boyle Roche. He adds that Flood would rashly accept any suggestions made to him while speaking, and one day, just after he had declared ‚Äòthat the magistrates of Wexford deserved the thanks of the lord-lieutenant,‚Äô he added, on some wit's suggestion, ‚Äòand should be whipped at the cart's tail‚Äô.(Barrington, Personal Sketches, i. 111). He steadily opposed the Act of Union, but when that measure was carried he did not retire from politics, but sat in the united House of Commons for County Wexford from 1812 to 1818. He made no particular impression there. Later life His only son died unmarried in 1800, and it was proposed to perpetuate Flood's title by creating him a baronet of the United Kingdom, with remainder to his only daughter Frances, who was married to Richard Solly, esq. He died on 1 February 1824, before the patent for this new honour had passed the great seal, and left his estates to his grandson, Frederick, who took the name of Flood in addition to his own.

Edward Fordham Flower in old age with his wife Celina Origins Born at Marden Hill in Hertfordshire on 31 January 1805, he was the younger surviving son of Richard Flower and nephew of both Benjamin Flower and John Clayton. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Fordham and sister of Edward King Fordham. Life When Edward was aged 12, his father Richard Flower took his family to live in the newly created community of Albion in Illinois. The settlement included free Negroes, who were abducted by a gang of kidnappers to sell into slavery. Edward led a party that captured the gang at rifle point, freed their captives and saw the leaders tried and punished. Threatened with death by their supporters, Edward was sitting at home when a bullet shattered the mirror above his head. His father sent him back to England and in 1824 he settled at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he joined a business. In 1827 he married Celina Greaves (1804‚Äì84); they had four sons: Richard Fordham (who died as a young child), then Charles Edward Flower, who became a partner in his father's brewery, followed by William Henry Flower, a much-decorated military surgeon, Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy, in succession to Huxley, and Director of the Natural History Museum in Kensington, and fourthly Edgar Flower who also became a partner in the brewery. In 1831 Edward built his own brewery in Stratford with a canal frontage for delivery and distribution. The enterprise flourished, becoming Flower and Sons Ltd; when larger premises using latest technology were opened in 1870, the original brewery was used for offices with reduced production. The first tied public house had been linked to the firm in 1836 and their inn holdings increased gradually. Export trade, particularly India pale ale, was always a large sector of the business. As a major employer in the area, he was influential in local affairs, serving four times as mayor of Stratford and sitting as a justice of the peace for Warwickshire. He attempted to enter national politics, standing as Liberal candidate for Coventry in 1865 and for North Warwickshire in 1868, but was not successful. Perhaps his greatest legacy is his involvement in the celebrations, to which he was a major financial contributor, marking the tercentenary of Shakespeare's birth in 1864, and the impetus they gave to create a permanent memorial in the town. Fund raising began to erect a theatre, which opened in 1879 as the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. In 1873 he retired and moved to London where, being a great lover of horses, he spent the rest of his life campaigning to reduce the suffering caused by inappropriate harness, in particular tight bearing reins (also criticised in the 1877 novel Black Beauty) and gag bits. He died in London on 26 March 1883, followed by his widow on 2 March 1884. Writings Works he authored were: * A Few Words about Bearing Reins, 1875. * Bits and Bearing Reins, 1875, illustrated by John Paget. * Horses and Harness, 1876. * The Stones of London, or Macadam v. Vestries, 1880. Family In 1827 he married Celina, eldest daughter of John Greaves (1774-1849), later a banker living at Radford Semele, and his wife Mary Whitehead (1779-1864).

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Early years Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Marie Wegman had her first contact with baseball at the age of three when her father taught her how to throw and hit a ball. The oldest of seven children, she grew up playing scrub baseball with her brothers and the neighborhood boys. She did not play organized softball until she was 14. At the time, softball was not offered at school for girls, so she joined an industrial league and played on several traveling teams.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Early career Wegman was in a drugstore when she was spotted by a scout of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She was offered a contract, but turned it down. Nevertheless, when Wegman found out she would train in Havana, Cuba and that the pay was more than she was making in a factory, she reconsidered. All the AAGPBL teams stayed at the Seville Biltmore Hotel and were filmed for Fox Movietone News going down the steps at the University of Havana, while their exhibition games were played at Estadio Latinoamericano. Wegman moved around for a while over a period of four years, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed to help teams stay afloat. She started the 1947 season with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them one year before joining the Fort Wayne Daisies (1948) and then found herself on the move again, this time to the Muskegon Lassies (1949), and then the Grand Rapids Chicks (1950). During her first season with the Peaches, Wegman got homesick, although she loved baseball. ‚Ä≥Blackie‚Ä≥, as she was called, played primarily at third base and second base. Eventually, she also played in the outfield and as a relief pitcher. She considered herself more of a defensive player. \\"I had problems with curveballs\\", she explained. Career Wegman was used sparingly in her first three years. Her most productive came in 1950, her final season, when she posted a career-high .234 batting average in 94 games, driving in 27 runs and scoring 26 times while stealing 22 bases, also career numbers. She was added to the All-Star Team as a replacement player.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000.

Career after baseball Following her baseball career, Wegman returned home to help out her family. She regretted her father's absence, because he died in 1945 and was not able to see her play professional baseball. She attended classes at the University of Cincinnati while working as a designer of packaging equipment and machinery. She later worked for Lodge & Shipley company until her retirement in 1988. Late in the year, she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities.

Early life Moorhead was born on 28 August 1869 in Maidstone, Kent. She was one of six children of Brigadier Surgeon George Alexander Moorhead, an army surgeon of Irish birth, and his wife, Margaret Humphrys (18331902), an Irish woman of French-Huguenot ancestry. Her older sister Alice Moorhead (1868-1910) was a pioneer of female medicine, trained as a surgeon and physician.Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women Her father was posted with the Berkshire Regiment to Afghanistan as army surgeon in 1870, and she would have seen little of him in her early years.. Her father settled in Dundee in 1902Dundee Post Office Directory 1902 to be closer to Alice and her newly created Dundee Women's Hospital. After training as an artist in Paris under Mucha and in Whistler's studio, Ethel returned to care for him from 1908 (after Alice married). After her father died in 1911, Ethel moved to Edinburgh.  Suffragette campaigning  Moorhead made her maiden speech at a Dundee Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union (WSPU) meeting in March 1910, in December she threw an egg at Winston Churchill when he was holding a meeting in Dundee. In 1911 the Dundee branch of the Women's Freedom League congratulated her on becoming Dundee's first tax-resister. Moorhead used a string of aliases (Mary Humphreys, Edith Johnston, Margaret Morrison), and carried out various acts of militancy both north and south of the border. They included smashing two windows in London, attacking a showcase at the Wallace Monument near Stirling, and throwing cayenne pepper at a police constable, as well as wrecking police cells, and carrying out several arson attacks. In October 1912 after being ejected from a meeting in Synod Hall, Edinburgh Moorhead returned to attack the male lecturer with a dog whip for ejecting her. She was arrested under her own name and was fined ¬£1, this fine was paid so Moorhead never went to prison for this act. Early in 1913, she tried to write to Arabella Scott about an incident of an amorous approach by inebriated prison doctor, which she feared would be used as propaganda. The Dundee Gaol governor did not release it. On 23 July 1913, with Dorothea Chalmers Smith, Moorhead (in the alias Margaret Morrison) attempted to set fire to a house at 6 Park Gardens in Glasgow, but they were caught at the scene and the firefighters found flammable materials and a postcard bearing the words: 'A protest against Mrs Pankhurst's re-arrest'. She held no formal position in the WSPU, but achieved great personal notoriety. Cat and Mouse Act Poster 1914 Moorhead was imprisoned several times and released under the \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\" of 1913. She became the first Scottish suffragette to be forcibly fed, while imprisoned in Calton Jail, Edinburgh under the care of Dr Hugh Ferguson Watson. Having become seriously ill with double pneumonia, she was released into the care of Dr Grace Cadell, a fellow activist in the suffrage movement. Her experienceduly related to the presscaused much protest at the cruelty involved. Moorhead had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. This did not stop her activity, however, and along with her friend Fanny Parker she was arrested in July 1914, for trying to blow up the Burns Cottage in Alloway.  Other campaigning and later life  During the First World War, Moorhead took on additional organisational responsibilities. Together with Fanny Parker, she helped run the Women's Freedom League (WFL) National Service Organisation, encouraging women to find appropriate work. In the 1920s, she traveled in Europe and edited a quarterly arts journal, which published work by, among others, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Ernest Hemingway. . She died in Dublin in 1955.

Instead, the client represents his or herself pro se. Purpose The growth of pro se litigants can be attributed to the high cost of litigation, anti-lawyer sentiment, and the advent of do-it-yourself law services. However, self-represented litigants may still need legal representation in order and to navigate the litigation process. Legal ghostwriting is one way in which clients can receive legal counsel while maintaining control of their case and avoiding higher legal costs. Attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services often charge a flat fee rather than billing by the hour as is typical for full-service attorneys.http://www.legalghostwriting.com American Bar Association The ABA formally endorsed the delivery of legal ghostwriting services by attorneys to pro se clients in 2007. In a formal opinion, the ABA deemed the practice consistent with Rule 1.2(c) of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct which allows lawyers to unbundle their services to clients. According to the ABA opinion paper, lawyers should generally disclose the fact that papers were prepared by an attorney, but need not disclose their name of firm. New York The New York County Law Association agreed with the ABA approach to legal ghostwriting in a 2010 ethics opinion paper. In that decision, NYCLA found that ‚Äú‚Ä¶it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litigant without disclosing the lawyer‚Äôs participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‚Äòwhere necessary.‚Äù The Second Circuit court in 2011 ruled that it was not improper for an attorney to ghostwrite legal pleadings on behalf of a self-represented litigant. Criticism Ethical concerns may arise for attorneys offering legal ghostwriting services to clients. A common criticism of legal ghostwriting is that it gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage because judges often grant pro se litigants leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (‚ÄúIt is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.‚Äù) Critics argue that when clients employ an attorney ghostwriter, they should not be entitled to that privilege. For this reason, the New York State Bar Association requires attorneys to disclose their assistance in papers submitted to the court. Attorneys are not, however, required to disclose their name or firm. Other critics are concerned that when an attorney provides legal ghostwriting services to a client without disclosing his or her name, the attorney might be misleading the court, or seeking to avoid malpractice lawsuits or court rules against frivolous lawsuits. However, the ABA in its 2007 opinion paper claimed that these ethical concerns were overstated. It concluded that: \\"[b]ecause there is no reasonable concern that a litigant appearing pro se will receive an unfair benefit from a tribunal as a result of behind-the-scenes legal assistance, the nature or extent of such assistance is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Similarly, we do not believe that nondisclosure of the fact of legal assistance is dishonest so as to be prohibited by Rule 8.4(c). Whether it is dishonest for the lawyer to provide undisclosed assistance to a pro se litigant turns on whether the court would be misled by failure to disclose such assistance. The lawyer is making no statement at all to the forum regarding the nature or scope of the representation, and indeed, may be obliged under Rules 1.210 and 1.611 not to reveal the fact of the representation. Absent an affirmative statement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the documents were prepared without legal assistance, the lawyer has not been dishonest within the meaning of Rule 8.4(c). For the same reason, we reject the contention that a lawyer who does not appear in the action circumvents court rules requiring the assumption of responsibility for their pleadings. Such rules apply only if a lawyer signs the pleading and thereby makes an affirmative statement to the tribunal concerning the matter. Where a pro se litigant is assisted, no such duty is assumed. We conclude that there is no prohibition in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct against undisclosed assistance to pro se litigants, as long as the lawyer does not do so in a manner that violates rules that otherwise would apply to the lawyer‚Äôs conduct.\\" See also *eLawyering *Ghostwriting *Unbundled legal services References Practice of law Ghostwriting ","title":"Legal ghostwriting"},{"id":"32779536","text":"Ace (from Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor) is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript.

Born in London, he served in World War I and graduated from the Royal College of Art before moving to Grimsby. He is remembered for a series of paintings depicting the impact of World War II on the town. His work was exhibited in the Royal Academy fourteen times, and has more recently been displayed in the National Memorial Arboretum in Lichfield in response to a successful exhibition in a centre in Cleethorpes. Biography Worrall was born in London in 1898. He served as a machine gunner during World War I. Having been captured by German forces in 1917, he escaped in the following year prior to the end of the war. In 1931 he graduated from the Royal College of Art. He moved to Grimsby in 1932, working as a teacher at Wintringham Grammar School. During World War II Worrall was a member of the Home Guard. In 1943 he was commissioned by Grimsby Borough Council to record the impact of the conflict on the town in paintings. During 1943 and 1944 he created a series of over 20 works depicting a range of scenes in Grimsby. Worrall continued to teach at Wintringham after the war, retiring in the 1960s. He died in 1972. Personal life Ernest Worrall was the oldest of seven children. He married Mollie Wood in 1932, shortly before moving to Grimsby. After his retirement he moved to Sussex, where he died in 1972. He had a son, Richard Worrall, who in 2009 helped to organise an exhibition of his father's work at the National Memorial Arboretum. Exhibitions Worrall's work was exhibited at the Royal Academy on 14 occasions during his life. Of the 22 works he painted during World War II, 18 are now owned by the local council and four by the Imperial War Museum. In October 2008 a free exhibition of Worrall's wartime paintings, titled Grimsby at War: The Works of Ernest Worrall, was opened at the Cleethorpes Discovery Centre, with an intended closing date of 30 November. It became the most popular exhibition ever to be displayed at the centre, attracting over 2,500 visitors, and was extended to run until 4 January 2009. Later in 2009 Worrall's son Richard, who saw the pictures for the first time at the Cleethorpes exhibition, helped to arrange another display of the paintings, at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas in Staffordshire.

Fonnereau was the second and posthumous son of Thomas Fonnereau (1745‚Äì1788), son of Margaret Fonnereau n√©e Martyn (1717‚Äì1778) and Zachary Philip Fonnereau (1706‚Äì1778), the descendant of an ancient family from the neighbourhood of La Rochelle, which settled in England at the Edict of Nantes and realised a fortune in the linen trade; and of Harriet, daughter of John Hanson of Reading, Berkshire. His father died at Topsham, Devonshire, on 26 December 1788; his mother survived until 2 February 1832. Thomas George Fonnereau was born at Reading on 25 August 1789. After practising as an attorney in partnership with John Gregson at 8 Angel Court, Throgmorton Street, from 1816 to 1834, he succeeded, by the death of a relation, into property and devoted himself for the rest of his life to his books and his friends. His political opinions leaned to conservatism, and he published in 1831 a 'Practical View of the Question of Parliamentary Reform,' which was subsequently printed in two editions. It was written mainly to prove that a purely democratic government is inappropriate to the circumstances of England, and that the existing system was 'founded on a concentration of the various interests of the country in the House of Commons'. While still a lawyer he occupied chambers in The Albany, and as a 'great lover and liberal patron of art' entertained a distinguished set of artists and wits at 'choice little dinners,' which are recorded in the pages of Planch√©'s 'Recollections'. With one of these friends he travelled in Italy circa 1840 and, on his return, there were printed for private distribution a few copies of 'Mems. of a Tour in Italy, from Sketches by T. G. F., inspired by his friend and fellow-traveller, C. S., esq., R.A.' (probably Clarkson Stanfield), containing thirteen sketches of scenery. Printing was at the expense of D. Colnaghi. On inheriting his fortune he realised a long held ambition, building 'a bachelor's kennel', with the assistance of his friend, Decimus Burton. It was his own design of 'an Italian villa with colonnade and campanile', which arose at Haydon Hill, near Bushey, Hertfordshire. Fonnereau died in this building on 13 November 1850, and was buried in a vault in Aldenham churchyard, with many members of the Hibbert family, his nearest relatives. His was later remembered because of his work for private circulation, printed in 1849, called 'The Diary of a Dutiful Son, by H. E. O.' (the second letters of his three names). A copy accidentally came into the hands of Lockhart, who inserted numerous extracts from its pages into the 'Quarterly Review', lxxxvi. 449‚Äì63 (1850). The introduction to the volume sets out that his father urged him to keep a diary of the remarks which he heard in the house of a distant relation, 'a literary man in affluent circumstances,' and that some little time afterwards he showed the diary as a proof that he had adopted the suggestion A concluding paragraph reveals that this was an imposition, as the conversations were the product of his own inventive powers. They contained many original and acute observations, from a thinker not dissatisfied with the world, and not anxious for much change, on poetry, philosophy, and political economy, and they present in style and substance an accurate representation of his talk. Lockhart suggested its publication to the world, and a copy, evidently prepared for the press, was found among Fonnereau's papers after his death. This was published by John Murray in 1864.

From the hill, the Germans could also prevent movement by both the 1st Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Terry Allen, to the south and the 9th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Manton Eddy, to the north. Hill 609 was deemed one of the most difficult objectives in Tunisia, not only protected by steep slopes and artillery but also by fire from nearby high grounds, which gave the Germans a cross fire on the slopes leading up to it.

Life Ford, born at Up Park, in the parish of Harting, Sussex, was the eldest son of Sir William Ford, knight, of Harting, by Anna, daughter of Sir Edmund Carell, knight, of West Harting. He became a gentleman-commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1621, but left the university without taking a degree. Charles I gave him a colonel's commission on the outbreak of the war, and in 1642 made him High Sheriff of Sussex. According to Vicars he offered his majesty \\"a thousand men, and to undertake the conquest of Sussex, though sixty miles in length.\\" He began to raise forces accordingly, and on 18 November 1642 the House of Commons ordered him to be apprehended. After previously capturing the city of Chichester for the King, on the first week of December 1642 on Muster Green in Haywards Heath in Sussex, Ford was the leader of the Royalist army at the Battle of Muster Green, and lost the battle, whereupon he retreated back through Sussex to Chichester. Sir William Waller, after taking Winchester and Arundel Castle, besieged Chichester, which Ford surrendered eight days later (29 December) Ford soon afterwards obtained his release by the interest of his wife, Sarah, with her brother, General Henry Ireton. On 4 October 1643 he was knighted by Charles I at Oxford. Ford commanded a regiment of horse under Lord Hopton, to whom he proposed the recapture of Arundel Castle. Hopton took it after three days' siege (19 December 1643). Ford was left in command by Hopton, with a garrison of above two hundred men and many good officers, but, Clarendon says, he had insufficient experience, although \\"a man of honour and courage\\". After a siege of seventeen days the garrison surrendered \\"at mercy\\", Ford and Sir Edward Bishop presenting themselves to Sir William Waller on 6 January 1643‚Äì4 as hostages for the delivery of the castle, both thus becoming his prisoners for the second time. They were declared by parliament on 9 October 1644 to be incapable of any employment. Ford was imprisoned in the Tower of London, from which in December he escaped. He then retired to the continent. In 1647 the queen, knowing his relationship with Ireton, sent him to England to join Sir John Berkeley in a futile negotiation with the army. On 12 November 1647 Ford with others was ordered by the House of Commons into safe custody upon suspicion of being privy to the king's escape from Hampton Court. On 21 March 1648/9 parliament ordered that he should pay for his delinquency one full third of the value of his estate. On 9 July 1649 the house made an order for remitting the remainder of his fine and discharging his sequestration. In 1656 Ford was employed, with Oliver Cromwell's encouragement, and at the request of the citizens of London, in devising an engine for raising the River Thames water into all the higher streets of the city, a height of ninety-three feet. This he accomplished in a year's time, and at his own expense; and the same \\"rare engine\\" was later employed for draining mines and lands. He later, with Thomas Toogood, constructed the water-engine near the Strand Bridge for the neighbourhood. As it obstructed the view from Somerset House, Catherine of Braganza caused it to be demolished; but Ford and Toogood obtained a royal licence to erect other waterworks at Wapping, Marylebone, and between Temple Bar and Charing Cross. After the Restoration he invented a mode of coining farthings. Each piece was to differ minutely from another to prevent forgery.

Mary McLeod Bethune, George Washington Carver, Joe Louis, and Thurgood Marshall were among her sitters.  Early life  Reyneau was raised in Detroit, and although discouraged by her father from becoming an artist on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a woman, she broke ties with the family to pursue that career, and as a young woman attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. She later lived in France for a time before returning to the United States and becoming active in civil rights causes. She was later selected by the Circuit Court of Detroit, unbeknownst to her family, to paint a portrait of her grandfather, Michigan Supreme Court Justice Benjamin F. Graves. Reyneau was also a suffragette; she became, in 1917, one of the first women to be arrested and imprisoned for protesting Woodrow Wilson's stance on women's voting rights.  Legacy  Many of Reyneau's portraits are currently in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.

Parallel Kingdom was the first location-based RPG for the iOS and Android platforms. The game was developed by PerBlue, a privately held mobile and social gaming software company founded in 2008 and based in Madison, Wisconsin. In 2011, the game's user base surpassed 1,000,000 players worldwide. The game closed on November 1, 2016. The game was set in a virtual world or \\"Parallel Kingdom\\" where users claimed their territories based on their GPS location or by making friends who could invite them to travel to new places. Parallel Kingdom was a freemium game, meaning it was free to download and play, but players had the option of purchasing premium content.  Overview  = Gameplay = Parallel Kingdom is a territorial RPG with a diverse range of ways to play. In order to travel around the world, a player has the option of using GPS to relocate through their phone or to build in- game flags on unclaimed areas. It has many features that allow for players to focus on various types of gameplay or to choose a unique combination of styles, such as PvE, PvP, Merchant, and Socialite. The PvE side of PK has many different features to it. Players can find a diverse range of NPCs to interact with. NPCs have many behaviours: some are docile, while others will attack you (or anything that happens to get too close) on sight. Some can only be found alone, while others are always in packs. NPC difficulty is determined by a player's equipment level, meaning a player should be able to fight against monsters tailored to their equipment level. However, some enemies may have been spawned by another player in the area; these spawns may potentially be unsuitable for some players. Players choosing to play PvE have the choice trying their luck at exploring Dungeons. Dungeons are challenging themed areas that require a player to go through each and slay the boss(es), which in turn will give them a special reward. Some PvE-oriented players can even choose to avoid fighting altogether, choosing instead to explore or harvest and gather materials, such as wood and stone. PK's PvP gameplay has many styles to enjoy. Players can choose to duel one another, either in controlled city duelling arenas or anywhere outside in the world. Fighting in the open has some risks, though, as players lose a backpack and 3% of their experience upon death in addition to waiting 15 seconds before they are respawned. Players may also build a variety of buildings, such as Kingdoms and Flags, and can also claim limited resources such as Stone Mines. The nature of limited resources, including land, makes land a commodity, which is often the subject of trade and warfare throughout the game. There are many ways to fight one another, such as kingdom warfare, flag burning, and brawls. Players can also choose to focus on Merchant or Socialite gameplay. PK has a large number of items available to gather and collect in-game, with features such as Trade Posts that allow players to buy and sell their items for currency. In addition, players have the ability to communicate through a variety of ways such as Map Chat, Kingdom Chat, Private Messages, and Global Chat. = Revisions = Parallel Kingdom has gone through five major iterations, known as \\"Ages\\", each of which introduced new features and gameplay mechanics. The final Age, Age of Ascension, was released on February 12, 2013, and featured the introduction of an immersive Sky Realm.  Reception  Parallel Kingdom was nominated for four categories in the 2009 Best App Ever Awards: Best MMO, Best Augmented Reality Game, Most Creative Use of iPhone Hardware, and Best Use of Location Services. Parallel Kingdom was a finalist in the Mashable Awards 2011, under the category of Best Mobile Game.  Charitable contributions  In 2011, Parallel Kingdom partnered with PlayMob in \\"Food For Good\\". PK players could use the in-game currency, Food, to purchase real food for children suffering from droughts in Kenya. The initiative resulted in 2500 meal vouchers for SOS Children, said to be the world's largest charity for orphaned and abandoned children. In June 2012, Parallel Kingdom partnered with PlayMob in \\"Save a dog, Feed a cat, Buy a hat\\". PK players used in-game currency, Food, to purchase in-game limited edition hats. Each hat purchased resulted in a cash donation made to cat and dog charities. In November 2012, Parallel Kingdom partnered with PlayMob, again, in the event \\"HELP USA\\". PK players used in- game currency, Food, to purchase in-game limited edition turkey hats. The Parallel Kingdom community raised enough for 500 meals to be distributed by HELP USA.  Decline and closing  The final content update of Parallel Kingdom arrived on December 16, 2014, bringing a winter event and the final set of in-game \\"swag\\". The game was then left with minimal developer support for the next two years. On September 30, 2016, the developers announced that Parallel Kingdom would be going down for the final time after its eighth anniversary, at noon CST on November first. The article, in part, stated, \\"After 8 amazing years, we must say goodbye to an incredible world full of incredible people that kept it alive much longer than we ever thought was possible. Like you, a lot of us at PerBlue knew that closing Parallel Kingdom was an inevitability, but we all hoped in the back of our minds that the day wouldn't come.\\"  References   External links  *Parallel Kingdom *PerBlue *Marquette Golden Angels Network 2008 video games Android (operating system) games IOS games Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Parallel Kingdom"},{"id":"32779718","text":"Dimitra Tsiliaskopoulos, better known as Dimi Poulos is an Australian football goalkeeper who last played for Western Sydney Wanderers in the W-League,Western Sydney Wanderers profile as an injury replacement for Young Matildas goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold.http://thewomensgame.com/2013/12/dimi- poulos-and-the-wanderers-keeping-positive/ She has also played in the American W-League and the Spanish league.

Marc Hogan from Spin wrote: \\"After three-plus years without fresh Sigur R√≥s material, though, the real treat is the contemplatively buzzing, ambient finale \\"L√∫ppulagid\\" -- an honest-to- goodness new song.\\" Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly commented that \\"the DVD captures the 75-minute buildup of guitars, xylophones, piccolos, and frontman J√≥nsi's cherubic voice, until it reaches its epic finale on the ethereal new swooner L√∫ppulagid.\\" Kevin Liedel from Slant Magazine awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote: \\"Inni is beautiful and alluring, yes, but ultimately a recycled bit of nostalgia likely to please very few.\\"  Motion picture track listing  # \\"N√Ω batter√≠\\" # \\"Svefn-g-englar\\" # \\"Flj√≥tav√≠k\\" # \\"Inn√≠ m√©r syngur vitleysingur\\" # \\"S√¶gl√≥pur\\" # \\"Festival\\" # \\"E-Bow\\" # \\"Popplagi√∞\\" # \\"L√∫ppulagi√∞\\"  CD track listing  * English translations not official.

His parents were from Tunisia. Biography Roni Bohobza grew up in Dimona, Israel. He is the youngest of seven children and one of two born after the family emigrated from Tunisia in 1955. His surname was legally changed to Ben-Hur via ritual at age 10. When he was eleven, he started playing guitar. He learned about jazz from a high school's friend's record collection. In Israel he performed in clubs and at weddings and bar mitzvahs until he had enough money to move to the U.S. He arrived in New York City in 1985, spending time at Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater. He took lessons from Harris, then became a member of his band. Ben-Hur's experience as an educator dates back to 1981 in Israel. In the U.S. he started jazz music programs at Professional Performing Arts School, the Coalition School for Social Change, and at the Lucy Moses School. At the request of Bette Midler, he started a jazz program for New York City high schools. Ben-Hur began a jazz camp in Saint-C√©zaire-sur-Siagne, France, with Santi Debriano. With Nilson Matta, he began a jazz and Brazilian music camp in Bar Harbor, Maine, both intended for adult jazz amateurs. He is the founding director of the jazz program at the Lucy Moses School at Kaufman Center in Manhattan where he teaches.

The first Executive Director was Hamish Sandison, who was a recent graduate of Boalt Hall at University of California, Berkeley and is now a solicitor in London, England, specializing in law and technology. In 1987, Bay Area Lawyers for the Arts (BALA) joined forces with Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts-Los Angeles (VLA) to form California Lawyers for the Arts as a statewide organization. CLA is part of an informal network of ‚ÄúVolunteer Lawyers for the Arts‚Äù programs that serve artists through state-based organizations throughout the United States.‚ÄúA pro bono party for helpful lawyers‚Äù by Melody Hanatani for Santa Monica Daily Press (article dated March 1‚Äì2, 2008) CLA has offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, and the organization serves more than 11,000 artists annually. CLA has nearly 1,800 paid members, including artists and arts organizations of all disciplines and cultural backgrounds, attorneys, accountants, and teachers. History In its early history, C.L.A. board members and staff worked with state legislators to promulgate artists' rights legislation in California, including the State's Resale Royalty Act (1976) and the California Art Preservation Act (1980). In 1993, with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Advancement grant, CLA expanded its mission to include articulating ‚Äúa role for the arts in community development.‚Äù Following this, CLA received the first art-related grant from the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and Families. In the mid-1990s, CLA began its statewide planning efforts, including a planning retreat with local arts agencies to include the arts in military base conversion. This work led to both a national conference funded by the NEA Design Arts Program and subsequent projects in Marin, San Francisco, Monterey and San Diego. Legislation CLA has played a major role in enacting legislation for artists‚Äô rights. In 1976, CLA collaborated with Senator Alan Sieroty of Los Angeles to enact the California Resale Royalties Act, which provides artists with a royalty on the resale price of any work of art. California remains the only state in the United States with this legislation.Legislative Masterpieces (p 4) Although the law has been under controversy since its inception, the United States District Court upheld the law in 1978 in an opinion written by Judge Robert Takasugi.Id. at 6. The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court‚Äôs decision in Moreseberg v. Balyon, 621. F. 2d. 972 (9th Cir,), cert denied, 449 U.S. 983 (1980), stating that the Act is ‚Äúan economic regulation to promote artistic endeavors generally.‚Äù Id. at 20 CLA also helped with the enactment of California Art Preservation Act (CAPA), California Civil Code Section 987. CAPA took effect on January 1, 1980 and granted artists the right of integrity, and the right of authorship. The right of integrity gives an artist the right to sue to prevent a work of his or her art from suffering injury, or to collect damages for an injury already suffered. The right of authorship provides an artist with the right to claim or disclaim authorship of a work of art.Id. at 9. Programs =Lawyer referral service = CLA has a lawyer referral services for creative artists, arts organizations, and those with arts-related matters. The referral service handles arts and non-arts-related issues such as copyright, contract drafting, review, and negotiation, non- profit organization issues, landlord/tenant, organizational tax, employee or independent contractor, mediation and arbitration. CLA has a panel of attorneys that specialize in various arts-related and other issues who then help each artist with the particular legal issue with which he or she is faced. =Arts arbitration and mediation services= AAMS was started in 1980 and provides alternative dispute resolution to artists, entertainers, and other members of the creative arts community. CLA‚Äôs AAMS program was the first alternative dispute resolution program in the United States to tailor its services for the arts and entertainment communities. AAMS provides counseling, conciliation, mediation, arbitration, neutral evaluation and meeting facilitation. The service has neutral program coordinators who help artists throughout the state. AAMS coordinators also offer conciliation assistance, coordinate mediations with trained mediators, or coordinate arbitrations or early neutral evaluations. =Sacramento Mediation Center= The Sacramento Mediation Center (SMC) became a program of California Lawyers for the Arts in 2008 and is administered in CLA's Sacramento office. SMC provides mediation services to anyone in the Sacramento region on a wide range of topics and is not limited to arts-related cases. =Arts and community development= CLA launched The Arts and Community Development Project in 1993, which provides summer and year-round job and intern experiences in the arts to deserving young people. Spotlight on the Arts is a program of The Arts and Community Development Project specifically aimed at deserving teens interested in the arts. These teenagers are provided with paid summer internships, workshops on conflict resolution, college preparation and career development, and trips to live cultural events. This Project is funded by public and private agencies and individuals. Publications The Art of Deduction has been published by CLA annually since the 1980s to serve as a tax preparation guide for creative artists. This publication offers a detailed explanation of tax preparation issues including money-saving tax filing tips specifically geared toward the creative community. CLA published the first edition of Legislative Masterpieces in 1980, in response to the need for a comprehensive resource on California Legislative initiatives to protect artists and their works. This publication is updated periodically as the California Legislation emerges. Legislative Masterpieces is designed to serve as a useful tool for the California arts community and others nationwide. Artistic License Awards Recent advocacy efforts have focused on restoring state funding for the arts in California, starting with a series of three symposia on California Arts and Healthy Communities, held in Los Angeles, Walnut Creek and San Jose from 2006-08. The Arts and Environmental Initiative was begun in 2008 with a Dialogue in San Francisco, followed by a second Dialogue in Los Angeles in 2011. An effort to restore Arts-in-Corrections programs was begun in early 2011. In 2008, the organization began its Artistic License Awards in order to recognize leaders in government, law and the arts or arts organizations who have made a positive impact on the arts in California. 2011 recipients include: *Attorney Jay L.

The lessons focus on 12 evidence-based healthy eating and physical activity behaviors for weight management. Published data were used to identify key weight loss and weight maintenance strategies. These include eating fewer calories; eating more fruits and vegetables; eating more whole grains; eating breakfast regularly; controlling/decreasing portion sizes; eating more meals at home; drinking fewer calorie-containing beverages; keeping a food/physical activity record; increasing physical activity; and watching less television. In addition, methods for planning and tracking lifestyle behaviors along with mindful eating concepts are included in each lesson. Mindfulness and tracking behaviors have both been shown in the professional literature to be associated with better weight loss success. The curriculum uses the theory of planned behavior to motivate participants to make behavior change. Collaborators Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less is conducted in collaboration with NC Cooperative Extension, NC State University and the Physical Activity and Nutrition Branch, NC Division of Public Health. Other collaborating organizations include East Carolina University Brody School of Medicine and the State Health Plan in North Carolina for Teachers and State Employees. Scope *Statewide Program - Local infrastructure of Cooperative Extension Agents and Health Promotion Coordinators offer the program as onsite classes within North Carolina in their local communities. *Plan-Funded Program - Grant funding from the State Health Plan in North Carolina for Teachers and State Employees (Plan) provides for onsite classes in five North Carolina counties (Wake, Guilford, Orange, Pitt, and Mecklenburg) for Plan members. Plan members in all North Carolina counties also have the option to participate in online classes. *Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less Online Program - Online classes available within and outside of North Carolina using synchronous distance education technology. Research Research has been conducted on participant outcomes for Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less. Participants who completed the statewide program (n=1,162) (offered by Cooperative Extension Agents and Health Promotion Coordinators) between January 2008 and May 2009 had an average weight loss of 8.4 pounds (range, 0.1- 44 lb), and most (87%) program participants reported at least some weight loss. The means for Body mass index, weight, waist circumference, confidence in ability to be physically active, and confidence in ability to eat healthfully improved significantly after participation. Approximately 92% of participants reported an increase in confidence in their ability to eat healthy. Increased confidence in ability to be physically activity was reported by 82% of participants. Over 90% of participants reported being more mindful of what and how much they ate and over 70% of participants reported improvements in calorie consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, and fast food intake. Approximately 60% of participants reported a lifelong struggle with their weight; this was the first weight-loss class for approximately 33% of participants. Preprogram body mass index was highest among those who had struggled with their weight and been in courses before. Change in confidence in ability to eat healthfully was significant and was greatest among participants who had struggled with their weight most of their lives and who were taking their first course.

He was best known for his term as head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission between 2016 and 2018. Liu previously served as President of the Agricultural Bank of China from 2014 to 2016. He turned himself into the authorities for disciplinary violations in 2019, and was demoted given a party membership suspension. At the time, he was serving as Chairman of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. Biography Liu was born in Guanyun County, Jiangsu. He graduated from Tsinghua University initially in hydraulic engineering, then and received a master's combined degree in engineering and management, and a doctorate in economics. Between 1987 and 1996, he worked for the Shanghai municipal economic structural reform office, then the National Office of Structural Reform, before being transferred to the China Construction Bank (CCB). At CCB, Liu was rapidly promoted to more senior roles, working in its Banking Supervision Department. In 2002 he began heading the administrative office of the People's Bank of China , and in July 2004, was named Assistant to the Governor, finally being promoted to Deputy Governor in June 2006. In October 2014, he became the Communist Party Secretary (i.e. top leader) of the Agricultural Bank of China. In February 2016, he was named chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. He was tapped for the role upon the dismissal of Xiao Gang, after a tumultuous year in the Chinese stock market that led to huge investor losses. At the CSRC, Liu was known to have decreased the backlog of approvals for companies awaiting IPO on China's stock markets. In January 2019, he was named Chairman of All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, replacing Wang Xia.

The most clinically relevant anti-thyroid autoantibodies are anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO antibodies, TPOAb), thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). TRAb's are subdivided into activating, blocking and neutral antibodies, depending on their effect on the TSH receptor. Anti-sodium/Iodide (Anti‚ÄìNa+/I‚àí) symporter antibodies are a more recent discovery and their clinical relevance is still unknown. Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are commonly associated with the presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Although there is overlap, anti-TPO antibodies are most commonly associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and activating TRAb's are most commonly associated with Graves' disease. Thyroid microsomal antibodies were a group of anti-thyroid antibodies; they were renamed after the identification of their target antigen (TPO). Subtypes Anti-thyroid antibodies can be subdivided into groups according to their target antigen. =Anti-TPO antibodies= Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are specific for the autoantigen TPO, a 105kDa glycoprotein that catalyses iodine oxidation and thyroglobulin tyrosyl iodination reactions in the thyroid gland. Most antibodies produced are directed to conformational epitopes of the immunogenic carboxyl-terminal region of the TPO protein, although antibodies to linear epitopes have been seen. Anti-TPO antibodies are the most common anti-thyroid autoantibody, present in approximately 90% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 75% of Graves' disease and 10-20% of nodular goiter or thyroid carcinoma. Also, 10-15% of normal individuals can have high level anti-TPO antibody titres. High serum antibodies are found in active phase chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Thus, an antibody titer can be used to assess disease activity in patients that have developed such antibodies. The majority of anti-TPO antibodies are produced by thyroid infiltrating lymphocytes, with minor contributions from lymph nodes and the bone marrow. They cause thyroid cell damage by complement activation and antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity. However, anti-TPO antibodies are not believed to contribute to the destruction of the thyroid. =TSH receptor antibodies= The thyrotropin receptor (TSH receptor) is the antigen for TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs). It is a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in thyroid hormone signalling. TRAbs are grouped depending on their effects on receptor signalling; activating antibodies (associated with hyperthyroidism), blocking antibodies (associated with thyroiditis) and neutral antibodies (no effect on receptor). Activating and blocking antibodies mostly bind to conformational epitopes, whereas neutral antibodies bind to linear epitopes. Binding of the antibody to the amino terminus of the TSH receptor shows stimulatory activity, whereas binding to residues 261-370 or 388-403 block the activity. TRAbs are present in 70-100% of Graves' disease (85-100% for activating antibodies and 75-96% for blocking antibodies) and 1-2% of normal individuals. Activating TRAbs are characteristic of Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism). TPO antibody is measured more easily than the TSH receptor antibody, and so is often used as a surrogate in the diagnosis of Graves' disease. These antibodies activate adenylate cyclase by binding to the TSH receptor. This causes the production of thyroid hormones and subsequent growth and vascularisation of the thyroid. TRAbs are also useful in the diagnosis of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Although the exact mechanism of how TRAbs induce Graves' ophthalmopathy is unknown, it is likely that the antibodies bind to TSH receptors in retro-orbital tissues, causing infiltration of lymphocytes. This inflammatory response leads to cytokine production that causes fibroblasts to produce glycosaminoglycans, leading to ophthalmopathy. Blocking TRAbs (also known as Thyrotropin Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins (TBII)) competitively block the activity of TSH on the receptor. This can cause hypothyroidism by reducing the thyrotropic effects of TSH. They are found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease and may be cause of fluctuation of thyroid function in the latter. During treatment of Graves' disease they may also become the predominant antibody, which can cause hypothyroidism. The clinical and physiological relevance of neutral antibodies remains unclear. However, they may be involved in prolonging the TSH receptor halflife. =Thyroglobulin (TG) antibodies= Thyroglobulin antibodies are specific for thyroglobulin, a 660kDa matrix protein involved in the process of thyroid hormone production. They are found in 70% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 60% of idiopathic hypothyroidism, 30% of Graves' disease, a small proportion of thyroid carcinoma and 3% of normal individuals. Anti-TPO antibodies are present in 99% of cases where thyroglobulin antibodies are present, however only 35% of anti-TPO antibody positive cases also demonstrate thyroglobulin antibodies. =Anti‚ÄìNa+/ I‚àí symporter= Anti-Na+/I‚àí symporter antibodies are a more recent discovery of possible thyroid autoantibodies and their role in thyroid disease remains uncertain. They are present in approximately 20% of Graves' disease and 24% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Pathogenesis The production of antibodies in Graves' disease is thought to arise by activation of CD4+ T-cells, followed by B-cell recruitment into the thyroid. These B-cells produce antibodies specific to the thyroid antigens. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, activated CD4+ T-cells produce interferon-Œ≥, causing the thyroid cells to display MHC class II molecules. This expands the autoreactive T-cell repertoire and prolongs the inflammatory response. While anti-thyroid antibodies are used to track the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis, they are generally not considered to contribute directly to the destruction of the thyroid. Effect on human reproduction The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk of unexplained subfertility (odds ratio 1.5 and 95% confidence interval 1.1‚Äì2.0), miscarriage (odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.8‚Äì7.6), recurrent miscarriage (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5‚Äì3.5), preterm birth (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1‚Äì3.5) and maternal postpartum thyroiditis (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 5.6‚Äì24). History In 1912 Hakaru Hashimoto described hypothyroidism and goiter associated with thyroid lymphoid infiltration. In 1956 the anti-Tg antibody was detected in similar cases, elucidating the autoimmune cause of these characteristics. Later the same year, activating TSH receptor antibodies were discovered. Thyroid microsomal antibodies were discovered in 1964, which were subsequently renamed anti-TPO antibodies due to the identification of their autoantigen.

In 1344, Paduan chronicles confirmed an entirely new technology ‚Äì a clock in a tower at the Paduan palace which automatically struck the hours (24h). The clock tower has not survived, and its exact location is undetermined, although it is believed to have been located at or near the Spasskaya Tower (formerly known as Frolovskaya). The clock was for a long time the only one in Moscow and Russia, and worked for more than two centuries without failure. It was then replaced by another clock which was destroyed in a fire. A miniature from the 16th- century Ostermanovskij manuscript (of the Litsevoy Collection of Chronicles, Ancient Chronicle, sheet 587, drawing 1175) exists which depicts the monk Lazar showing Vasily and two of his vassals the finished clock tower. Although the tower is gone, the illustration of the clock tower and monastery can be seen in the Polytechnical Museum in Moscow as of 2006. A 16th-century chronicle says that Lazar was paid 150 rubles for his work (\\"sta bole polutorasta rublev\\").: Legacy The Spasskaya Tower, which was possibly built on or near the location of the clock tower. The Serbian Orthodox Church decided to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the monk Lazar's invention and construction of the great clock tower in the Moscow Kremlin on the feast of the Presentation of Mary (–í–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ—ö–µ) on 4 December 2004. The liturgies of the churches in Belgrade and Moscow, the Hilandar (where the brotherhood had their krsna slava) and the Monastery of the Holy Archangels, mentioned Lazar. A memorial sundial was placed on the Academy of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. The Serbian mathematician Dr. Dragan Trifunoviƒá noted Lazar and his invention as part of Serbian mathematics of the Middle Ages, saying that \\"as a mathematician it was interesting how Lazar forged the clock. He had to have knowledge of Archimedes' division of circuit tracks and estimation of the extent to forge three types of gear wheels.

The mansion is currently the residence of their great-grandson Archduke Markus Emanuel Salvator.  History  Originally the palace was a Biedermeier villa belonging to a Viennese notary named Josef August Eltz. In 1850 it was purchased by Dr Eduard Mastalier. After Franz Joseph's engagement to Princess Elisabeth of Bavaria in 1853, Franz Joseph's mother, Princess Sophie of Bavaria, purchased the villa as a wedding present for the couple. In subsequent years, the villa was altered and expanded in a Neoclassical style by Antonio Legrenzi. The extant central portion was expanded towards the park and the originally posterior portion of the house was converted to form the entrance with Classical columns and tympana. Two additional wings were constructed, giving the building the overall shape of an \\"E\\". The villa is surrounded by a large park in the \\"English Style\\". The architectural ensemble in its contemporary form was completed in 1860. Construction was significantly slowed by the fact that it could not proceed during the summer months due to the presence of the royal family. Today, the mansion is home to the Archduke Markus, but also offers grounds tours to the public.

The monastery is located on a peninsula in Lake Kozhozero, in Onezhsky District in the north-west of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Kozheozersky Monastery is one of the most remote monasteries in Russia; there are no roads leading to Kozhozero, and the only way to get to the monastery is by traversing on foot. History In the 16th century the valley of the Onega River was already populated, and the ascetic monks were looking for remote places to get away from people. Niphont of Kozheozero, a monk in the Syryinsky Monastery close to the selo of Chekuyevo, in the lower course of the Onega, arrived to Lake Kozhozero. According to the tradition, this occurred in 1552. In 1557, Sergey, a baptized Tatar prince, arrived to Lalke Kozhozero and became a monk, taking the name Serapion. He later became the first hegumen of the monastery. Since the lands around Lake Kozhozero were not suitable for agriculture, the monastery was initially poor. In 1585, Tsar Feodor Ivanovich transferred lands around the lake to the monastery, and two churches were built. Serapion died in 1611. The next hegumen was Avraamy, who was the disciple of Serapion and died in 1634. The only saint ever living in the monastery was Nikodim of Khozyuga, who came to Kozhozero in 1607, and in 1609 left for a remote location from Kozheozersky Monastery. Nikon, the future patriarch of Moscow and reformer of Russian Orthodox Church, arrived to the monastery in 1641 and was the hegumen from 1643 to 1646. During his period, he solicited considerable investments from two tsars. In 1646, he left for Moscow for some business related to the monastery, and never returned, getting a new appointment. In 1670, the monastery served as a place for political exile. In the 17th century, it was growing and became rich, however, in the 18th century the financial state of the monastery deteriorated. In 1722 the last hegumen, Georgy, died, and subsequently the monastery was headed by a \\"builder\\" (). The first builder was Korniliy (1722-1738). In the beginning of the 1730s, a disastrous fire destroyed all wooden buildings of the monastery, and it was never able to recover. In 1758, the monastery was subordinated to Spaso-Kargopolsky Monastery in Kargopol, and in 1764, it was shut down. Between the 1650s and 1764, 346 monks in total lived in the monastery. Kozheozersky monastery was reopened in 1853. In 1764, former monastery buildings were turned into a village, and the village population was forcibly resettled in 1853. Until the 1880s, the monastery was poorly managed and remained in a difficult financial situation. The situation improved when Pitirim, formerly a monk in Solovetsky Monastery, became a hegumen in 1885. He renewed the monastery buildings and built a road to the monastery. During the Civil War in Russia, Kozheozersky Monastery was on the front line between Red and White armies. For some time, it remained on the territory subject to the White government in Arkhangelsk, and a White Army detachment was stationed in the monastery. The front line was close to the selo of Chekuyevo. In the winter 1919/1920, the Red Army underwent a massive attack an, in particular, took the monastery over. The monastery was closed, the fate of the monks is unknown. For some time, the ruins of Kozheozersky monastery hosted resettled peasants. This settlement was known as Kozhposyolok. In 1954, Kozhposyolok was abandoned, and the monastery was repopulated in 1997 and consecrated in 1999. The only monk permanently residing in the monastery is the hegumen.

Its creation was associated with the Portuguese Viceroy of India, D. Jo√£o de Castro, and his family, but became a pious community of reclusive clergy that continued to occupy cramp humble spaces in the complex, until the religious orders were abolished in Portugal.  History  An engraving of life within the confines of the convent The view from the Sintra Mountains towards the Atlantic coast alongside the convent The courtyard as it looks, showing the natural weathering and symbiosis with the environment =16th century= The convent was founded in 1560, consisting of eight monks that arrived from the Convent of Arr√°bida under the authority of D. √Ålvaro de Castro, counsellor of state and administrator for King Sebastian of Portugal. This sanctuary was established to the invocation of Santa Cruz (Holy Cross), and was originally the inspiration of √Ålvaro de Castro's father, the former fourth Viceroy of India, D. Jo√£o de Castro (1500 - 1548). According to a legend, Jo√£o de Castro was hunting in the mountains of Sintra, and chasing a deer, he found himself lost. Tired from his search, he fell asleep against a rock, and in a dream, he received a divine revelation to erect a Christian temple on the site. The convent followed the Franciscan rule and belonged to the Order of Friars Minor or Capuchins. In 1564, from an inscription found on site, indulgences were granted by Pope Pius IV, who offered requested that prayers be said for the Christian princes, the Church and the soul of deceased Jo√£o de Castro. Between 1578 and 1580, the Chapel of Santo Ant√≥nio was constructed, along with the erection of a wall around the convent, under the orders of Cardinal Henry. The following year (around October) the convent was visited by King Phillip II of Spain, newly installed King of Portugal and Spain. The primitive community of the convent was composed of eight friars, being the most famous of them Friar Hon√≥rio, who, according to the book Mirror of Penitents, composed by one of the friars, lived to be 100 years old, despite having spent the last three decades of his life in penance, living inside a small hole inside the convent, which still exists today. In 1596, friar Hon√≥rio, who lived in a grotto alongside the convent for 30 years, died. The story of Hon√≥rio impressed later English Romantic poets, like Robert SoutheyRobert Southey, For the Cell of Honorius, at the Cork Convent Near Cintra. poem and Lord Byron (\\"Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell/In hope to merit heaven, by making earth a hell.\\")Lord Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, 1.20) =17th century= In the 17th century, a painting/panel of S√£o Pascoal Bail√£o, by Vicente Carducho, was completed, while in 1610 several mural paintings on the exterior of the Chapel of Senhor Morto. In 1650 a marker was erected to identify the road to the convent. In October 1654, King John IV of Portugal visited the convent, ordering the sheriff of Cascais should send the friars six dozen fish and dried meat, as well as all the fish necessary to support the festival of S√£o Francisco. At the same time, D. Lu√≠sa de Gusm√£o provides the order a moio of wheat, and an arroba of cereals from annual harvests. By the second half of the 17th century, King Peter II of Portugal doubled the gift of D. Lu√≠sa de Gusm√£o. By 1684, the widow of √Ålvaro de Castro (the third patron of the convent), the lady Maria de Noronha was buried at the door of the convent (as was the tradition at the time). Similar royal patronage was conceded by King John V of Portugal in the 18th century, who offered a pipa of olive oil to the convent per year, as well as an azulejo tiles. =18th & 19th centuries= By 1728, the convent was described by friar Ant√≥nio da Piedade as secluded \\"between dense fields, high boulders, and while trees, that in this refuge produces the mountains that are so many...\\". Similarly, the convent was still inhabited by members of the religious community in 1787. Between 1830 and 1837, William Burnett completed a carving on the steps leading to the Chapel of Santo Ant√≥nio, flanked by a low wall. As a result of the extinction of the religious orders in Portugal, in 1834, the convent was acquired by the second Count of Penamacor, D. Ant√≥nio de Saldanha Albuquerque e Castro Ribafria (1815-1864), descendant of Jo√£o de Castro. It remained in the possession of this generation until 1873, when it was acquired by Sir Francis Cook, first Viscount of Monserrate. In 1889, the convent was described as \\"situated in the centre of a sad solitude, encircled by a dryness and whipped by gales...this small monastery, open to the rocks and containing a dozen cells, in which can barely move the disgraceful inhabitants\\". =20th century= In the first half of the 20th century, the site was acquired by the State, although little was done until the middle of that century. It was bought by the Portuguese State in 1949.Parques de Sintra: Monte da Lua The DGEMN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate of Buildings and National Monuments) began a series of public projects to preserve the site starting in the 1950s: in 1952, the construction of the roofing in the chapel, farmhouse and latrines; in 1954 and 1955, repairs to the water-pipes and guardhouse; in 1958, repair of the roofing; in 1961, repair of the farmhouse roof; in 1963, repair of the roofing and interiors; in 1967, the replacement of two doors covered in cork, ceilings, pipes and cleaning of the spaces. These projects continued with the Institute Florestal (Forestry Institute) and the Direc√ß√£o- Geral das Florestas (General Directorate of Forests) which were responsible for conservation, cleaning and maintenance of the buildings and grounds in 1971, 1983-1985 and 1994. During the 1920s, an image of Santa Maria Madalena still existed in a niche near the gate, but eventually collected by the state and stored in the Pena National Palace. Much later, images of Santo Ant√≥nio and S√£o Francisco, located in the retable in the church, and two candelabras were stolen from the site. For this reason, security and a degradation of the site, the property was closed to the public in 1998. Yet, in August 1998, the site was assaulted and robbed of several images and sculptures. These events and the continued degradation of the site resulted in the creation of the Associa√ß√£o dos Amigos do Convento dos Capuchos (Association of the Friends of the Convent of the Capuchos). The Capuchos Convent became part of the Cultural Landscape of Sintra World Heritage Site, classified by UNESCO in 1995. =21st century= On 1 June 2001, the convent was re-opened to the public, after fears of its degradation, under the concession of the Parques de Sintra Monte da Lua S.A. Between 2000 and 2001, public works, conservation and restoration of many of the buildings. In 2011, the film This Side of Resurrection, directed by Joaquim Sapinho, was shot inside the walls of the convent.

Due to the slopes, many of the dependencies are constructed on the slopes, each level used to identify the ascendency and purification of the spirit.Jos√© Cardim Ribeiro (1998), p.215 The hall of retreat, which is further elevated then other spaces, is reached from a passage from thehall of penitence. The church is integrated into the complex, with little indications from the exterior. Researchers have suggest that the composition of buildings and spaces were influenced by the number 8 (evident in the number of cells and stairs between rooms), and which symbolized infinity. A comparable metaphor exists in the different roads/paths, which symbolized the dichotomy between good and bad roads to be taken in spiritual fulfillment. Poverty was the central notion which ruled the construction of the Convent of the Capuchos. The whole building is small. Its windows and doors are coated with cork, the traditional material of Portugal, the last being smaller than a man's height, to induce genuflection. Decoration is scarce and minimal. After visiting the convent in 1581, Philip I of Portugal said \\"Of all my kingdoms, there are two places I estimate especially, El Escorial for being so rich, and the Convent of the Holy Cross for being so poor\\". The site is located in the rural part of Sintra, along the northeastern flank of the Sintra Mountains, approximately 325 metres above sea level, in a location marked by dense vegetation and accentuated slopes, near King Ferdinand II's hunting grounds (Tapada D. Fernando II). The convent, surrounded by a forest of oak and shrubbing species of trees, is walled into an area of rocks and exposed boulders. Along Sintra's old road connecting the village to Colares, and near the Palace of Monserrate, there is a road that heads towards this religious retreat, indicated by a 17th-century marker: \\"CAMINHO PARA O CONVENTO DE SANTA CRUZ DA SERRA, VULGO CAPUCHOS\\"; \\"1650\\". The access to the grounds is made by a portal (in the southeast corner of the site), or by the Terreiro das Cruzes (Terrace of Crosses), an irregularly-walled enclosure with a calvary located in the southwest corner and visitor's centre. To the left of the cross in the Terrace of Crosses, is the principal entrance or P√≥rtico das Fragas (Portico of the Rocks), with an access-way comprising two large boulders, one of which is surmounted by a bell-gable. From the walled enclosure, a small flight of stairs leads into the Terreiro do Campan√°rio (Terrace of the Belfry), a small irregular patio with cross, which leads to the buildings. The southeast entrance, located a further distance from the visitors centre, comprises a gate and ancillary building, which leads directly to the much larger Terreiro do Fonte (Terrace of the Fountain) with the religious site. So named because of the large octagonal water fountain, the Terrace is a principal square within the retreat, with bunk seating in rock around its edges. Legend suggests that King Sebastian would eat his meals around this fountain when he visited the convent. The fountain, itself, shows vestiges of 17th century azulejo tile. The plan of the site is irregular, composed of various spaces at different slope heights, incorporated into the local rock and cliffs. The church, integrated into the complex, has a longitudinal plan, with a nave and presbytery into the rock. Its simple facades, with no decoration, are uncommonly utilitarian, with a lack of ostentation typical of the period of its construction. The principal entrance, across the southeastern portal to the elevated Terreiro da Fonte, is made from two steps. The stone patio has vestiges of two tombs, while the roof is covered in cork. In the centre wall, the cut backrests are decorated with pebbles and ceramic fragments, with a conch-like arched niche, decorated with ceramic fragments. On the wall fascia, accessed by stairs on two sides converging onto a level platform, there are two door frames covered with cork, to corresponding quarters of pilgrims. Between these, a large wooden cross, inscribed muraria box, framed with pebbles and shells, with traces of a painting depicting a crucified monk. The right-side wall is embossed with a representation of Virgin with the Childand the founder of the convent, D. √Ålvaro de Castro, topped by a triangular pediment, the tympanum with Christ Pantocrator. On the opposite wall, the lintel is surmounted by cross of rubble, flanked by two small openings, with access to the Chapel of Senhor dos Passos. This chapel interior is covered in monochromatic azulejos (blue-on-white tiles), with a rounded niche on the main wall, with panels showing scenes from the Flagellation of Christ and Crowning with Thorns on opposite sides of the wall. On the vaulted ceiling there are also symbols from the Passion and stars. On the left wall, a relief of the Virgin with Child framed by a canopy held by angels. On the right wall, surmounted by a cross of shells over a skull and crossbones, is the old entranceway for novices (and represented the transition between the spiritual and terrestrial lives), leading from the P√°tio do Tanque (Patio of the Tank) across a corridor with busts of friars minor. On the left wall, and surmounted by a cross of rubble, shells and fragments of ceramics, is an epigraphic inscription, and doorway to the church. The church interior consists of a small nave, covered with a vaulted ceiling and paved with stone slabs. The walls show remnants of plaster with some exposure to the rock face. On the pulpit side there is a framed inscription, surmounted by a carved stone of the coat-of-arms of the Castro family (the patrons of the convent). The inscription reads: > D.

The church walls include fascia inscribed on the rocks and a concave retable in marble, crowned by cornices. The central axis includes three panels: the central panel, includes the tabernacle framed by pilasters and flanked by two niches, and the lateral oblique panels, which also have a niche. The main altar, in polychromatic marble front, is designed with organic composition. On the pulpit side, there is a small staircase in rock, with access to the choir, itself covered in cork. The space is illuminated by two small windows, with two bunks of seating, also covered in cork, where the friars participated in masses. The interior dependencies are aligned along several corridors within the complex, and broken by small steps formed by the slopes on which the convent was built. Many of the spaces are covered in cork, which acted as an insulator (protecting the clergy from the cold humid environment); many of the doors, windows are covered in cork, while the austere floor is composed of stone slabs. The personal quarters of the friars, eight in total, are small in size with small entrance-ways and access to the main corridor. Friar Ant√≥nio da Piedade, writing in 1728, described the cells as so small that a few of the monks carved portions of the wall, in order to accommodate their feet. The refectory included a large slab that was ordered extracted from the mountains by Henry, King of Portugal and used as a table by the monks, and small cupboard. The relatively small space was connected to the kitchen, with stone and chimney, rock bunks for counters and spaces carved into the rock. The Casa das √Åguas (House of the Waters) accessible through an exterior corridor to a cistern and spring, was the collection and distribution space for water into the convent, and included a water tank, latrines and urinal. In addition, the complex included a space for the novice; an old library with roof covered in cork; an infirmary; hall of penitence; two cells covered in wood; a space for solitude/retreat (located at the highest point in the complex); and the circular Casa do Cap√≠tulo, whose access door and walls are decorated in cork, interrupted by a niche. The Casa do Cap√≠tulo fronts the octagonal Patio do Tanque and the Chapel of Santo Ant√≥nio (or Senhor do Horto), a rectangular single nave chapel covered in tiles with patio. This main porch oriented towards the fountain, is accessible by a staircase, and includes a painted mural with Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony. The interior is paved in tiles with remnants of wall murals towards the vaulted ceiling. The fascia, consisting of a false retable, includes a niche carved into the wall, moulded into an arch, over an altar covered in azulejo tile. The azulejos (monochromatic blue-on-white) include representations of two angels holdings scrolls, with a central inscription. The Chapel of Senhor Crucificado (or Chapel of the Ecce Homo), with rectangular plan is covered in tiles. Its interior is decorated with murals, with a friezes in monochromatic azulejos (blue-on-white) and elevated central niche on the wall. In the most elevated zone of the complex is the grotto of Hon√≥rio de Santa Maria, with an inscription along the path, stating \\"HIC. HONORIVS. / VITAM. FINIVIT. ET. IDEO. CVM DEO. / VITAM. REVIVIT / OBIIT ANNO / DE 1596\\". The old vegetable gardens, located below the P√°tio do Tanque, are accessed from this space or the main portal, while several tanks and water channels criss-cross the spaces from the convent.

Morphology  Phage f1 is a filamentous (rod-shaped) ssDNA phage, with a molecular mass of about 1.6 Da; by weight it is 11.3 percent DNA. The flexible phages are about 850 nm long and 4.3 or 6.3 nm wide. The thousands of identical major coat proteins that make up the sheath are arranged in a fishcale-like Œ±-helix. The ends of the filament are sealed with protein caps; the blunt end contains 3‚Äì5 copies of each VII and IX, while the terminally extruded bead-like end contains about 5 copies each of III and VI.  Genome Organization  f1 has a circular, 6407 bp genome of ss-DNA. There are 11 genes encoded on the genome; two are overlapping in-frame genes. Five of the encoded proteins make up the viron, three are needed for synthesis and the rest are for assembly. The genes are generally referred to by Roman numerals I-XI, and are in the order II(X), V, VII, IX, VIII, III, VI, I(XI), IV, intergenic region (IG or IGR). The IGR contains the packing signal (PS) as well as sequences that dictate termination, nicking for replication, and the binding of II and IHF.  Life cycle  = Adsorption and Injection = f1 is male specific; it only infects Hfr or F+ strains of E. coli. Several host proteins are required for infection and depolymerization of the coat proteins of the phage. A domain of III binds to the primary receptor, the tip of the F pilus, and retraction of the pilus by an unknown mechanism brings another domain of III close enough to the membrane to bind the coreceptor, host tolA. The removal of the cap proteins and release of the ssDNA into the cytoplasm are both mediated by the interactions of tolA and III. A hydrophobic portion of III inserts itself into the inner membrane, fastening the phage particle to the host and distributing the coat proteins into the host membrane. It is the degradation of the major coat protein that causes the genome to be released into the cytoplasm of the host. = DNA replication = The ssDNA genome is replicated and translated with host enzymes after it is inserted into the cytoplasm. RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase III, and host gyrase form a supercoiled RF template used for replication. Phage II specifically cuts the (+) strand at the origin, and host Rep helicase aids rolling circle replication. II is necessary for ligation of the newly isolated (+) strand, and more host enzymes are necessary for translation. Phage proteins can be detected in the supernatant about 10 minutes after infection (37¬∞). = Packaging = DNA-V complexes form in the hundreds and prevent further copies of the complement strand from being made while also \\"pre-packaging\\" and stabilize the ssDNA into an almost linear form. About 1500 copies of V form a flexible, semi-enclosed left-handed helix that encapsulate the DNA. The ssDNA does not interact with itself inside the capsule, and remains untwisted and unpaired except for the extremely stable packing signal. The PS exists as an imperfect hairpin and is responsible for the attachment and orientation of the genome in the phage. Proper packing can be accomplished if and only if the PS is present; even after the genome has been covered it remains partially exposed at the blunt end of the complex. = Lysis = This phage does not lyse its host, but can secrete many copies of itself throughout the life of the host cell. The cell can continue to divide even while infected, and cell metabolism is minimally affected by the phage. The phages are secreted as they are assembled, and once the DNA-V complex is formed all further assembly and secretion steps take place in or at a membrane. The proteins depolymerized upon phage entry can be reused for the packaging of new phage, and as with newly synthesized coat proteins, the proteins remain as integral membrane proteins until needed. The host-encoded thioredoxin is the only known host protein required for assembly of nascent phage and likely confers processivity. The presence of a properly presented ssDNA in an adhesion zone with thioredoxin and the coat proteins allows for the elongation and secretion of phages. The phage is elongated by continually removing dimers of V and replacing them with the major coat protein. The phage coat consists of about 2700 copies of VIII. The end of the DNA signals the cell to add the end cap proteins, which are likely already associated with VIII. As with most filamentous phages, there is no defined limit on the amount of DNA that can be packaged into the phage coat. Excessive copies of the phage genome can be packaged, called \\"polyphage\\"; although these are due to improper termination of extrusion about 5% of the phage produced in the presence of termination signals are twice the normal length. Even larger inserts are naturally selected against. The non-terminated phage will remain anchored to the host, and attachment of another V-DNA complex will continue the elongation process. The PS site is only needed to initiate elongation, not for the attachment of additional genomes. Phage can be assembled and released at a very high rate, with up to 1000 progeny released within an hour of infection of the host.

The Yankees Ball Finder, a touch-screen computer in the museum, allows the viewer to look for Yankees alphabetically to find the location of their ball on the \\"Ball Wall\\". The centerpiece of the museum is a tribute to Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, with a commemorative home plate in the floor and statues of Larsen pitching to Yogi Berra. Along with a facsimile of a current locker from the Yankees' clubhouse, fans can view the locker of the late Thurman Munson, which sat unoccupied in the previous stadium's Yankee clubhouse in honor of Munson. The final pitcher's plate and home plate used at the old stadium was the first at the new stadium; following its use, it was moved to the museum. For the 2011 season, the Yankees added a showcase of World Series rings. During the season they opened an exhibit to honor George Steinbrenner.

Battements are typically performed in multiples, quickly and in rapid succession so that the working foot appears to be fluttering or vibrating. They are usually executed in front (en avant or √† la quatrieme devant), to the side (√† la seconde) or in back (en arri√®re or √† la quatrieme derri√®re). The word battement is of French origin, meaning \\"beat\\". Variations Battements are performed or executed in a variety of modes or configurations, for example: * battement d√©velopp√© is usually a slow battement in which the leg is first lifted to retir√© position, then fully extended (or \\"unfolded\\") passing through attitude position. *battement fondu is a battement (usually slower) from fondu (both knees bent, working foot on the cou-de-pied of the supporting leg) position and extends until both legs are straight. Upon completion, the working leg may be √† terre or en l'air (touching the floor or raised). * battement frapp√© is a battement in which the foot moves from a flexed or 'cou-de-pied' position next to the ankle of the supporting leg, and extends out to a straight position quickly and forcefully, and by doing so hitting the floor (the so-called frapp√©). In the Russian school the foot is wrapped around the ankle, rather than flexed and does not strike the floor. In this case, the frapp√© comprises the working foot striking the ankle of the supporting leg. Battements frapp√©s can be executed double, with beats alternating front and back of the standing leg's ankle before striking out. * battement gliss√© (French school, Royal Academy of Dance UK), also known as battement d√©gag√© (Italian School, Cecchetti) or battement jet√© (Russian school, Vaganova), is a rapid battement where the toes are normally raised to just a few centimeters above the floor (literally a \\"sliding\\" battement). * battement lent is a slow battement, normally taken as high as possible, which involves considerable control and strength. Both legs remain straight for the whole duration of the movement. Grand battement with pirouettes * battement tendu is a battement where the extended foot never leaves the floor. The working foot slides forward or sideways or backwards from the fifth or first position to reach the fourth or second position, lifting the heel off the floor and stretching the instep. It forms the preparation for many other positions, such as the ronds de jambe and pirouette positions. (stretched beating) * battement tendu jet√© (Russian school), also known as battement d√©gag√© (Cecchetti) or battement gliss√© (French school), is executed a few centimeters off of the floor with the raised leg oriented upwards at angles of up to 45 degrees. * grand battement is a powerful battement action in which the dancer passes through d√©gag√© and \\"throws\\" the working leg as high as possible, with both legs held straight. * grand battement en cloche is a grand battement that alternates forwards and backwards, passing through the first position of the feet (literally: large battement with pendulum movement). * petit battement is a battement in which the knee angle changes while the upper leg and thigh remain still. The working foot quickly alternates from the cou-de-pied position in the front to the cou- de-pied position in the back, slightly opening to the side.

The stable was formed after Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel and Wade Barrett left The Nexus and allied with Ezekiel Jackson.  History  = Formation = After Wade Barrett was kicked out of The Nexus by new leader CM Punk, he moved from Raw to SmackDown. While under CM Punk, Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel refused to perform their initiation to stay in the group and left The Nexus. On the January 14 episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater interfered during Barrett's match with Big Show, attacking Show. They were joined by Ezekiel Jackson who continued the attack by performing a body slam on Big Show. Big Show continued to feud with the group throughout its existence and on the January 21 episode of SmackDown, the group named themselves The Corre, while also announcing that The Corre would be leaderless as all the members were equals. They all competed in the Royal Rumble on January 30, but were all eliminated by different wrestlers (in order: Gabriel by Daniel Bryan, Slater by John Cena, Jackson by Kane, and Barrett by Randy Orton) with Jackson eliminating Big Show and Barrett eliminating Rey Mysterio and Diesel, and making it to the final four. = Championship wins = Throughout its tenure, the Corre often employed interference during matches and frequent post-match attacks. Tensions between the members of The Corre and The Nexus led to two brawls between the groups on Raw and before the Royal Rumble match. At Elimination Chamber on February 20, Gabriel and Slater became the first to gain a championship within The Corre, as they won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov. This began Gabriel and Slater's second reign as WWE Tag Team Champions after their first reign as part of The Nexus. At the same event, Barrett received his first opportunity at the World Heavyweight Championship when he took part in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, but failed to win the championship when being eliminated by The Corre's nemesis, Big Show. The following night on Raw, Gabriel and Slater lost the championship to John Cena and WWE Champion The Miz. However, Gabriel and Slater immediately invoked their rematch clause and won the rematch and the championship to start their third reign as WWE Tag Team Champions. On the March 25 episode of SmackDown, Barrett added to The Corre another championship when he defeated Kofi Kingston to win his first singles title, the Intercontinental Championship. = Downturn and breakup = The four members of The Corre using their superior numbers for an in-ring attack on John Cena and The Rock Things took a turn for the worse for The Corre when the group was soundly beaten at WrestleMania XXVII in an eight-man tag team match against Big Show, Kane, Kofi Kingston, and Santino Marella in under two minutes. The following night on Raw, hoping to make a statement, The Corre attacked John Cena and The Rock, but the duo overwhelmed them. On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, The Corre endured further misery when Big Show and Kane won the championship from Gabriel and Slater. The Corre failed to regain the tag team titles despite Gabriel and Slater, as well as Barrett and Jackson challenging Big Show and Kane on the April 29 episode of SmackDown and at Extreme Rules on May 1, respectively. Tensions within the group began to flare due to failed interference in each other's matches. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Jackson refused to celebrate with the rest of The Corre when he defeated Big Show, instead choosing to walk out on them after his match, thus leading to Barrett, Gabriel and Slater attacking him backstage and removing him from the group. This started a feud between Barrett and Jackson, who challenged Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship twice, but failed to win the title since he won the bouts on May 22 at Over the Limit by disqualification and on the June 3 episode of SmackDown by countout instead of a pinfall or a submission. On the June 10 episode of SmackDown, Barrett, fleeing from Jackson, walked out on Gabriel and Slater in a six-man tag team match against Jackson and The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso), leaving them handicapped and causing them to lose the match, after which Gabriel and Slater confronted Barrett and declared the dissolution of the faction, and The Corre was no more.

During the reign of George Albert, he led a relatively unrestricted government and tried to establish in East Frisia a system of religiously inspired absolutism. This, however, was bound to deepen the existing tensions between the prince and the East Frisian Estates. In 1726 and 1727, the conflict escalated to the Appeal War. The Prince won this conflict and even the unruly city of Emden had to surrender to him. Ironically, Brenneysen then became the Count's chief negotiator. His poor negotiation skills thwarted a peaceful settlement. Although Chancellor and Prince called for strict punishment of the unruly Estates, they were pardoned in 1732 by the Emperor. Among Brenneysen's merits are his book on the Frisian history and a constitution, written in the early 18th century. Legacy When Prince George Albert died on 11 June 1734, Charles Edzard, the only surviving descendant of George Albert, took office at the age of 18, took office as. However, he, too, could not resolve the conflicts with the estates. Around this time a smooth transition to Prussian control was being prepared. An important factor was the position of the city of Emden, which had been politically isolated by the Appeal War. Emden was trying to regain its position as the economic capital and in 1740 requested Prussian help. Emden proposed a treaty in which the city's privileges and economic position were guaranteed and in return the Estates would recognize Prussia's claim on East Frisia. On 14 March 1744, the agreement was finalized in the form of two treaties. The Prussian claim was additionally based on a decision made by Emperor Leopold I in 1694, acknowledging Prussias right to inherit East Frisia in the event of a lack of a male heir. Despite the opposition of the Kingdom of Hanover, Prussia would prevail. After the death of the last ruler of the House of Cirksena in 1744, Frederick the Great took over East Frisia.

The first and most popular version in Italy was by Tony Dallara (Antonio Lardera) in 1957. A recording by the Marino Marini Quartet made the United Kingdom charts in 1958. That same year, the song was also recorded by Domenico Modugno, Nicola Arigliano and Armando Trovajoli's orchestra with singer Miranda Martino. \\"Come prima\\" was Tony Dallara's first and breakthrough single. Although it was rejected for admission to the Sanremo Festival, it was an instant success and sold 300,000 copies, becoming the biggest selling single in Italy up to that point. The melody was used for a French language song entitled \\"Tu me donnes\\", a hit for Dalida in 1959. It was also used for an English language song, \\"More Than Ever\\" (lyrics by Mary Bond), recorded in the United Kingdom by Malcolm Vaughan with the Michael Sammes Singers (HMV catalogue number POP 538) (14 weeks on the UK chart, peaking at #5UK chart listing for Malcolm Vaughan's version), Robert Earl (4 weeks on the UK chart, peaking at #26UK chart listing for Robert Earl's version), Eve Boswell, and others.

Biography  Guy Ben-Ner received a Bachelor of Arts in Education in 1997 from Hamidrasha School of Art and a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in New York City in 2003. At Columbia, he studied under the critic Jerry Saltz. He is Dean of Hamidrasha School of Art at Beit Berl College . Art career Since the early 1990s, Ben-Ner has filmed a series of short videos starring himself and his family, often using the intimate spaces of their home as ad hoc set, studio, and fantastical playroom.Guy Ben-Ner. Adaptation, January 31 ‚Äì May 4, 2008 Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago His works are often exhibited with the simple sets and props created for the videos.Guy Ben-Ner: Thursday the 12th, May 23, 2009 ‚Äì April 25, 2019 MASS MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts. A recurring theme in Ben-Ner‚Äôs early videos is the tedium and isolation experienced by a stay-at-home parent. Ben- Ner‚Äôs first narrative video, Berkeley‚Äôs Island (1999), based on Daniel Defoe‚Äôs Robinson Crusoe (1719), depicts the solitary life of a castaway. Set in the family kitchen, it opens with a scene of the artist lying on his back in a bathing suit on a meter-wide pile of sand from which a lone palm tree grows, with a steering wheel across his bare, sunburned chest. The 15-minute video features several vignettes about life on the island, which Ben-Ner narrates in a voice-over. The plot does not follow Defoe‚Äôs exactly, though notable moments in the book are re-created, such as the castaway discovering a footprint and training a parrot (played by the family cat) to say his name. The castaway has delusions; he sees himself levitating and losing a limb‚Äîsimplistic magic tricks that Ben-Ner stages using mirrors. To depict a raging gale, Ben-Ner rigs the palm tree with ropes that are pulled by someone offscreen. Wild Boy (2004), an adaptation of Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1970 film L'enfant sauvage (The Wild Child), can be shown in two forms: alone, or incorporated into an installation that re-creates a woodland set that the artist built in his kitchen, complete with a tree and a carpeted hill on which visitors may sit to watch the video. In Stealing Beauty (2007), the artist's family staged guerrilla theater in IKEA showrooms: Moving among the displays, they conduct a reasonable facsimile of family life; dishes are done, discipline imposed, discussions held (private property is a topic), and everyone tucks in for the night ‚Äî in numerous beds ‚Äî as IKEA's other customers wander through. In Foreign Names (2012), Ben Ner visited nearly 100 Aroma Espresso Bar locations, left a fake name in English that would be called out at the counter when his beverage was ready, then edited all the videotaped segments to create an \\"ode\\" lamenting the disappearance of waiters. Soundtrack (2013) takes an eleven- minute scene from Steven Spielberg's 2005 movie War of the Worlds as a \\"ready- made\\" soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in Ben Ner's kitchen in Tel Aviv, with smashing plates and combusting appliances. Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin, exhibited Soundtrack (2013) and archived an essay dedicated to Ben-Ner and his work on their website. Ben- Ner‚Äôs 2016 video, Escape artists, was acquired by The Israel Museum, Jerusalem in March of 2019. The work consists of two years of weekly video lessons that Ben-Ner gave to Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers at the Holot Detention Center in the Negev desert. He uses the medium of film to mirror the refugees' difficult reality, and uses that same reality to reveal cinematic tricks and illusions. Because of this style, the film viewer learns about the lives and circumstances of the refugees in addition to learning lessons about filmmaking.https://www.imj.org.il/en/exhibitions/new-collection-7 He is represented by Postmasters Gallery in New York, and Aspect/Ratio in Chicago.

Several studies have found evidence of differential diagnosis for patients with similar ailments but of different sexes. Female patients face discrimination through the denial of treatment or misclassification of diagnosis as a result of not being taken seriously due to stereotypes and gender bias. According to traditional medical studies, most of these medical studies were done on men thus overlooking many issues that were related to women's health. This topic alone sparked controversy and brought about question to the medical standard of our time. Popular media has illuminated the issue of gender bias in recent years. Research that was done on diseases that affected women more were less funded than those diseases that affected men and women equally.  History  The earliest traces of gender-biased diagnosing could be found within the disproportionate diagnosis of women with hysteria as early as 4000 years ago. Hysteria was earlier defined as excessive emotions. Within a medical setting, this hysteria translated to the over exaggeration of symptoms and ailments. Because traditional gender roles usually place women at a subordinate position compared to men, the medical industry has historically been dominated by men. This has caused for a misdiagnosis within females due to the large number male workers in the industry holding on to believes regarding gender stereotypes. These gender roles and gender biases may have also contributed to why pain associated with experiences unique to women, like childbirth and menstruation, were dismissed or mistreated. In 1948 some women volunteered to take part in an experiment designed to quantify pain in laboring women. During their labor, their hands were burned in order to try to measure their pain threshold with the option to quit at any time and to receive treatment. During childbirth and as it kept progressing, the females were unable to feel an increase in pain insomuch as many of them received second degree burns without realizing. In a 1979 observational study, 104 women and men gave responses to their health in 5 areas: ‚Äúback pain, headaches, dizziness, chest pain, and fatigue\\". When receiving these complaints, it was seen that doctors gave extensive checkups to men more often than women with similar complaints, supporting that female patients tend to be taken less seriously than their male counterparts with regard to receiving medical illnesses.Armitage, K. J., L. J. Schneiderman, and R. A. Bass. ‚ÄúResponse of Physicians to Medical Complaints in Men and Women.‚Äù JAMA 241, no. 20 (May 18, 1979): 2186‚Äì87. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health recognized the disparities in research of disease in men and women. At this time, the Office of Research on Women‚Äôs Health was created, primarily to raise awareness of how sex affects disease and treatments. In 1991 and 1992, recognition that a \\"glass ceiling\\" existed showcased that it was preventing female clinicians from being promoted. In 1994, the FDA created an Office of Women‚Äôs Health by congressional mandate. The Women's Health Equity Act, passed in 1993, gave women the chance to participate in medical studies and examine the gender differences.WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1993. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1993. Before the act was introduced, there had been no research done on infertility, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, which are conditions prevalent to women's health.THE WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1991. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1991.  Clinical trials and research  The approach to women shifted from paternalistic protection to access in the early 1980s as AIDS activists like ACT UP and women's groups challenged ways that drugs were developed. The NIH responded with policy changes in 1986, but a Government Accountability Office report in 1990 found that women were still being excluded from clinical research. That report, the appointment of Bernadine Healy as the first woman to lead the NIH, and the realization that important clinical trials had excluded women led to the creation of the Women's Health Initiative at the NIH and to the federal legislation, the 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, which mandated that women and minorities be included in NIH-funded research. The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women. In 1993 the FDA reversed its 1977 guidance, and included in the new guidance a statement that the former restriction was ‚Äúrigid and paternalistic, leaving virtually no room for the exercise of judgment by responsible research subjects, physician investigators, and investigational review boards (IRBs)‚Äù. The National Academy of Medicine published a report called \\"Women and Health Research: Ethical and Legal Issues of Including Women in Clinical Studies\\" in 1994 and another report in 2001 called \\"Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?‚Äù which each urged including women in clinical trials and running analyses on subpopulations by sex. Although guidelines have been introduced, sex bias remains an issue. A 2001 meta-analysis found that of 120 trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine, on average just 24.6 percent of participants enrolled were women. In addition, the same 2001 meta- analysis found that 14 percent of the trials included sex specific data analysis A 2005 review by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use found that regulation in the US, Europe, and Japan required that clinical trials should reflect the population to whom an intervention will be given, and found that clinical trials that had been submitted to agencies were generally complying with those regulations. A review of NIH-funded studies (not necessarily submitted to regulatory agencies) published between 1995 and 2010 found that they had an \\"average enrollment of 37% (¬±6% standard deviation [SD]) women, at an increasing rate over the years. Only 28% of the publications either made some reference to sex/gender-specific results in the text or provided detailed results including sex/gender-specific estimates of effect or tests of interaction.\\" The FDA published a study of the 30 sets of clinical trial data submitted after 2011, and found that for all of them, information by sex was available in public documents, and that almost all of them included sub- analyses by sex. As of 2015, recruiting women to participate in clinical trials remained a challenge. In 2018 the US FDA released draft guidelines for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials. In a 2019 meta-analysis it was reported that 36.41 percent of participants in 40 trials for anti-psychotic drugs were women.  Medical diagnosis  The possibility of gender differences in experiences of pain has led to a discrepancy in treating female patients' pain over that of male patients. The phenomenon may affect physical diagnosis. Women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of psychosomatic nature for a physical ailment than men, despite presenting with similar symptoms. Women sometimes have trouble being taken seriously by physicians when suffering from medically unexplained illness, and report difficulty receiving appropriate medical care for their illnesses because doctors repeatedly diagnose their physical complaints as related to psychiatric problems or simply related to female's menstrual cycle. Clinical offices that rely on healthcare routines become less distinct due to biased medical knowledge of gender. There is a distinct differentiation between gender and sex in the medical sense. Because gender is the societal construction of what femininity and masculinity is, whereas, sex is the biological aspect that defines the dichotomy of female and male. The way of lifestyle and the place in society are often considered when diagnosing patients. Men and women are biologically different. They differ in the mechanical workings of their hearts and in their lung capacities, resulting in women being 20-70% more likely to develop lung cancer. The differences between men and women are also seen at the cellular level. For example, the ways immune cells convey pain signals are different in men and women. As a result of these biological differences, men and women react to certain drugs and medical treatments differently. One example is opioids. When using opioids for pain relief, women and men have different reactions. Surveys of the literature also conclude that there is a need for more clinical trials that study the gender specific response to opioids. Although there is evidence pointing to the biological difference between men and women, historically women have been excluded from clinical trials and men have been used as the standard. This male standard has its roots in ancient Greece, where the female body was viewed as a mutilated version of the male body. However, the male bias was furthered in the United States in the 1950s and 60s after the FDA issued guidelines excluding women of childbearing potential from trials to avoid any risk to a potential fetus. Additionally, the thalidomide tragedy led the FDA to issue regulations in 1977 recommending that women should be excluded from participating in Phase I and Phase II studies in the US. Studies also excluded women for other reasons including that women were more expensive to use as test subjects because of fluctuating hormone levels. The assumption that women would have the same reaction to the treatments as men was also used to justify excluding women from clinical trials. However, more recent studies have shown that women respond differently yo a variety of common drugs than men, including sleeping pills, antihistamines, aspirin and anesthesia. As a result, many drugs may actually pose health risks to women. For example, a 2001 study conducted by the Government Accountability Office about drugs removed from the market between 1997 and 2000 showed that \\"Eight of the 10 prescription drugs posed greater health risks for women than for men.\\" = Pain bias = In recent decades, the disparity between female pain treatment and male pain treatment has been receiving more attention. Chronic pain is more prevalent in women than in men, and women report more severe, frequent, and prolonged cases of pain; however, they are less likely to receive adequate health treatment. Studies show that physicians often perceive women's complaints as emotional responses rather than physiological pain. Women are less likely to be prescribed painkillers after surgeries, according to several studies conducted in the 1980's. For example, after undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, women received more sedatives rather than pain treatment. Studies from the 2000's showed that physicians dismissed women's pain as inexplicable because they refused to believe the complaints; some physicians even blamed the female patients for their pain.  Western cultural recognition of pain bias  As the issue of pain bias becomes more popular, media coverage of the topic has also increased. In 2014, the National Pain Report conducted an online national survey of almost 2,600 women with a variety of chronic pain conditions. 65% felt that their pain was being given inadequate attention because of they were female, and 91% believed that the health-care system discriminated against women. Nearly half of the women were told that their pain was psychological, and 75% were told they must learn to deal with the pain. In 2015, The Atlantic published an article about a woman's experience with acute abdominal pain. She had to wait almost two hours at the emergency room before receiving treatment, but she endured the pain longer than necessary due to a misdiagnosis. In the United States, women wait an average of 65 minutes before receiving an analgesic for acute abdominal pain, while men only wait 49 minutes. A 2019 article published by The Washington Post references a 2008 study that supports the statements made in 2015 The Atlantic article.  Psychological diagnosis  There was an example of gender bias in the psychiatric field as well, Hamberg notes that, \\"psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume that women were more depressed than men due to the fact that the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists were women and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study.\\" There is a suggestion that assumptions regarding gender specific behavioural characteristics can lead to a diagnostic system which is biased. Retrieved November 2011 The issue of gender bias with regard to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) personality disorder criteria has been controversial and widely debated. The fourth DSM (4th ed., text revision; DSM‚ÄìIV‚ÄìTR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) makes no explicit statement regarding gender bias among the ten personality disorders (PDs), but it does state that six PDs (antisocial, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) are more frequently found in men. Three others (borderline, histrionic, dependent) are more frequent in women. Avoidant is equally common in men and women. There are many ways to interpret differential prevalence rates as a function of gender. Some critics have argued that they are an artifact of gender bias. In other words, the PD criteria assume unfairly that stereotypical female characteristics are pathological. The results of this study conclude with no indication of gender-biased criteria in the borderline, histrionic, and dependent PDs. This is in contrast with what is predicted by critics of these disorders, who suggest they are biased against women. It is possible, however, that other sources of bias, including assessment and clinical bias, are still at work in relation to these disorders. The results do show that the group means are higher in women than in men, an expected result considering the higher prevalence rate of these disorders for women. The original purpose of the DSM‚ÄìIV was to provide an accurate classification of psychopathology, not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a personality disorder as women. However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder for both men and women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM‚ÄìIV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four personality disorders and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and histrionic personality disorders), although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for avoidant, schizotypal, or obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorders. Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research. the signs and symptoms of ptsd Considerable evidence indicates a prominent role for trauma-related cognitions in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized regression analysis to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame subscales of the PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity. Distinguishing between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often challenging, especially when the client has experienced a trauma such as childhood sexual abuse (CSA), which is strongly linked to both disorders. Although the individual diagnostic criteria for these two disorders do not overlap substantially, patients with either of these disorders can display similar clinical pictures. Both patients with BPD and PTSD may present as aggressive toward self or others, irritable, unable to tolerate emotional extremes, dysphoric, feeling empty or dead, and highly reactive to mild stressors. Despite having similar clinical pictures, PTSD and BPD are regarded differently by many clinicians. Results from a 2009 study concluded that patient gender does not affect diagnosis. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that women are not more likely to be given the BPD diagnosis, all else being equal, though it contradicts other findings from studies that have used similar case vignettes. Nor did the data support an effect of clinician gender or age on diagnosis. A 2012 study examined gender- specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol- related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and alcohol dependence (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was collected from participants about PTSD- related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. Gender differences were examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.  Female patients  Women have been described in studies and in narratives as hysterical and neurotic, and many feel that physicians take their pain less seriously. Historically, women's health was only associated with reproductive health, and thus has often been called \\"bikini medicine\\" because the field largely focused on the anatomy covered by a bathing suit. Until recently, clinical research mainly used male subjects, male cells, and male mice, and many women were excluded from research because they were considered too weak, too variable, and in need of protection from the harms associated with medical research studies. Results from these all- male studies, including studies important in understanding how certain drugs behave in the body, were applied to female patients as well, despite biological differences in the way disease presents in females and males and that women are more likely to have adverse reactions to medication. Modern research on human subjects are made up of approximately an equal distribution of female and male subjects, but female subjects in research are largely still underrepresented in specific areas of medical research, like cardiovascular research and drug studies. Narrative from physicians include reporting that women's complaints are considered exaggerated and may be assumed to be invalid. Women have been historically considered less stable than men, and their physical ailments are often considered by physicians to be a result of emotions. Women's symptoms are often not taken seriously, and women experience high rates of misdiagnosis, unrecognized symptoms, or are assumed to be experiencing a psychosomatic disorder. There has also been a reported difference between treatment of physically attractive patients versus physically unattractive patients, a bias that exists in both male and female patients, but is more pronounced in female patients. Female patients who are considered conventionally attractive are thought to be experiencing less pain than unattractive female patients. Female patients have also been considered more demanding patients, and are considered to be a greater burden than male patients. One observer has stated that, \\"different forms of female suffering are minimized, mocked, coaxed into silence.\\" In the medical community, women are perceived as having to \\"prove they are as sick as male patients,\\" what the medical community has deemed \\"Yentyl Syndrome.\\" There are those that disagree with this characterization, stating that chronic pain specifically is hard to treat in all people, and that there is a greater bias against young people than against genders. Generally, women are treated less aggressively than men for pain, and over 90% of women with chronic pain believe that they are treated differently by healthcare professionals because of their gender. Women are often referred to psychiatrists for treatment, and are more likely to be prescribed sedatives than pain medicine. This can cause complications if a psychiatric condition is diagnosed, often incorrectly, and can be especially detrimental if drugs are prescribed because antidepressants and psychiatric drugs \\"are absorbed differently in women and vary in effectiveness\\" and can have unwanted side effects. Research has indicated that women metabolize drugs differently than men. However, drug dosage is rarely broken down by sex, and this can lead to highly detrimental effects. A specific example of how misdiagnosis effects women is the care of female heart-attacks. Women who are experiencing a heart attack are seven times more likely to be misdiagnosed and released from the hospital during the heart attack. This is often due to the fact that women generally experience different heart-attack symptoms than men, including flu-like symptoms. Specifically, black women and women of color are at an even greater disadvantage. Black women are twice as likely to have strokes, and their chances for survival are even lower than white women. Black women also face greater challenges when it comes to breast cancer, and are more likely to be misdiagnosed and more likely to die. In her book, The Cancer Journals, Audre Lorde speaks about her unpleasant experiences as a black female breast cancer patient, her troubling experiences with physicians and caretakers, and her struggle to find strength after undergoing a mastectomy. Although many women still face gender bias in their experiences with the healthcare system, progress has been made toward a more equitable system. The Laura W. Bush Institute for Women's Health at Texas Tech University was founded in 2007, and has been a leader in the integration of \\"sex-specific instruction in medical education.\\" The team at Texas Tech created a curriculum for medical schools to include sex-differences in medical education, and ten schools are currently using the curriculum. It is likely that bias against females patients will continue to exist in medicine, but medical schools and institutions are working toward addressing the problem, and will likely continue addressing it for a long time. Medical research is slow to move into the practice stage, so even as more research is done on bias against women and how to better treat women, it will be a long time before these effects are seen.  Avoiding gender bias  In order to avoid gender bias in medical diagnosing, researchers should conduct all studies with both male and female subjects in their samples. Healthcare workers should not assume all men and women are the same, even if they display similar symptoms. In a study done to analyze gender bias, a physician in the research sample stated, '\\"I am solely a professional, neutral and genderless\\"'. While a seemingly positive statement, this kind of thought process can ultimately lead to gender biasing because it fails to note the real differences between men and women that must be taken into account when diagnosing a patient. Other ways to avoid gender bias includes diagnostic checklists which help to increase accuracy, evidenced-based assessments and facilitation of informed choices.

Hardman was one of the mainstays of the Manchester folk scene in the 1960s, Guinness Who's Who of Folk Music (1993) by Colin Larkin, A Gathering of Folk (2003) by Mark Leightley, and performed extensively in both the UK and internationally until 1991. Career =Early life= Rosemary Hardman was born in and grew up in Manchester, England. She was educated at the nearby Urmston Grammar School for Girls. Before turning professional as a singer in 1968, she worked at a variety of jobs in her early career, including as a horse riding instructor, assistant in a bookstore, hairdresser, and secretary for the MSG artiste booking agency. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and made her first folk club appearance in 1965, at the Manchester Sports Guild. Over the next three years, she established herself as resident singer and organiser of a number of folk clubs. =1960s: Early years= After three years of playing amateur and semi-professional gigs on the folk scene, Hardman turned professional in December 1968. That month she released her first album, Queen of Hearts, on the Folk Heritage label. It contained a mixture of traditional and contemporary material. The album was recorded live on 29 December 1968 at the Bate Hall Hotel, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK. Six months later she teamed up with south London guitarist Bob Axford, and they performed mainly original material. =1970s: Success= Rosie Hardman and Bob Axford released a joint album, Second Season Came(1970), on the Trailer Records label. This album included her most popular and covered song \\"Lady for Today\\". They released a second album together (her third) Firebird in 1971, also on the Trailer Records label. In 1971 Hardman married Rob Ixeron 17 April. Many of their friends from the music scene attended. Her matron of honor was Toni Arthur (a folk singer who later became known on children's TV). For their informal evening reception, they gathered at the Manchester Sports Guild, where Hardman had been a compere and guest artist. That night the hall had already booked Barbara Dickson. left In the early/mid 1970s, Hardman toured with singer/songwriter Andy Caven as her road manager/sound engineer. They recorded a version of her song \\"Fiddler Man\\" together before Caven followed his independent career. In 1974, Hardman played the Cambridge Folk Festival and in 1975 she released her next album, Jerseyburger and also a cassette of a live recording ‚Äì For My Part. In 1978, Hardman signed to the Plant Life label, with which she made three albums (see Discography). The backing musicians on these recordings included Dave Cousins, Maddy Prior, Nigel Pegrum, Rick Kemp, Brian Willoughby, Jon Gillaspie, Mike Silver and B. J. Cole. In 1977 she performed a series of gigs with Bristol-based guitarist Steve Payne. From 1979, she toured briefly with a band which comprised Nigel Pegrum (drums), Jon Gillaspie (Keyboards), Pat Tate (guitar/vocals) and Rick Kemp (bass). This tour was notable for its finale, in which an eagle (one of a trained pair known as Wally and Pegasus) flew over the heads of the audience to land on Hardman's arm. Wally had a penchant for beer and at times would detour and land on the table of an unsuspecting audience member. Hardman and Gillaspie performed together regularly as a duo over the next few years, collaborating on albums as well as gigs. =1980s: More success and awards= In 1981, Hardman recorded \\"The Man From Brooklyn\\" and \\"Just One Time\\", two songs about American popular singer Barry Manilow. She led the Birmingham branch of his British fan club. Hardman's support for his music was controversial in some folk clubs, but she has always supported him and said that he was a major influence on her music. In 1984, Hardman took over running the Whitesnake Fan Club for the heavy rock band of that name. (She worked with Mel Galley, the lead guitarist of the band, for a series of gigs in 1985‚Äì86). In 1985, Hardman co-wrote the theme music for the children's television programme Talk, Write and Read. The programme won the Royal Television Society award for the best primary school television programme of 1986/87. Around that time, she joined up with Isaac Guillory for a number of concerts; they would each perform solo sets and then a set together. Hardman suffered from a variety of throat problems during the mid-1980s, requiring a long course of hospital treatment. The clubs were full of secondhand smoke and she had strained her voice with inadequate sound systems. While some clubs agreed to ban smoking for her performances, others did not. Due to these conditions, she retired in 1991. But the following year she played one-off farewell gigs in Germany and Jersey. =1990s: New directions= Hardman learned to swim in 1986. Finding she was good at teaching nervous adult beginners, she took the Preliminary and Full Teachers' Examinations with the Amateur Swimming Association in 1988. She taught part- time from that date. Following her retirement from music, she followed teaching full-time. =2000s: Comeback concerts = Hardman released Lost Leader (2000) and established an official website (RosieHardman.com). This helped revive interest among her long-term fans and the media, and to attract new fans. In 2006, 2007, and 2009, Hardman was supported by Graham Cooper in three comeback concerts.

The early recorded history of the region is liked with Western Tibet and as vessel chiefs of the rulers of Leh, India. The region appears to be part of the Tibetan Empire, with Buddhism flourishing in the region. However, by the 12th-13th century, the region came under Islamic influence. This resulted in the separation of the Balti people from the Buddhist Ladakhi neighbors. The Baltis increasingly converted from Buddhism to Islam, resulting in increased interaction and conflict with their Kashmiri Muslim neighbours. Muslim rule in the area ended with the expansion of the Sikh Empire. After the British defeat of the Sikhs in the Anglo-Sikh wars, the region was ruled by the Hindu Dogras under British paramountcy. With the partition of India, the region was annexed by the newly formed state of Pakistan. Rock art and petroglyphs There are more than 50,000 pieces of rock art (petroglyphs) and inscriptions all along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit Baltistan, concentrated at ten major sites between Hunza and Shatial. The carvings were left by various invaders, traders, and pilgrims who passed along the trade route, as well as by locals. The earliest date back to between 5000 and 1000 BCE, showing single animals, triangular men and hunting scenes in which the animals are larger than the hunters. These carvings were pecked into the rock with stone tools and are covered with a thick patina that proves their age. The ethnologist Karl Jettmar has pieced together the history of the area from various inscriptions and recorded his findings in Rock Carvings and Inscriptions in the Northern Areas of Pakistan and the later released Between Gandhara and the Silk Roads - Rock Carvings Along the Karakoram Highway.  Early history  The rock carvings found in various places in Gilgit- Baltistan, especially those found in the Passu village of Hunza, suggest a human presence since 2000 BC. Within the next few centuries after human settlement in the Tibetan plateau, this region became inhabited by Tibetans, who preceded the Balti people of Baltistan. Today Baltistan bears similarity to Ladakh physically and culturally (although not religiously). Dards are found mainly in the western areas. These people are the Shina-speaking peoples of Gilgit, Chilas, Astore and Diamir while in Hunza and in the upper regions Burushaski and Khowar speakers dominate. The Dards find mention in the works of Herodotus, Nearchus, Megasthenes, Pliny, Ptolemy, and the geographical lists of the Puranas. In the 1st century, the people of these regions were followers of the Bon religion while in the 2nd century, they followed Buddhism.

Sport  Polo  90px } Between 399 and 414, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Faxian visited Gilgit-Baltistan, while in the 6th century Somana Palola (greater Gilgit-Chilas) was ruled by an unknown king. Between 627 and 645, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang travelled through this region on his pilgrimage to India. According to Chinese records from the Tang dynasty, between the 600s and the 700s, the region was governed by a Buddhist dynasty referred to as Bol√º (), also transliterated as Palola, Patola, Balur. They are believed to be the Palola SƒÅhi dynasty mentioned in a Brahmi inscription, and are devout adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism. At the time, Little Palola () was used to refer to Gilgit, while Great Palola () was used to refer to Baltistan. However, the records do not consistently disambiguate the two. In mid-600s, Gilgit came under Chinese suzerainty after the fall of Western Turkic Khaganate due to Tang military campaigns in the region. In the late 600s CE, the rising Tibetan Empire wrestled control of the region from the Chinese. However, faced with growing influence of the Umayyad Caliphate and then the Abbasid Caliphate to the west, the Tibetans were forced to ally themselves with the Islamic caliphates. The region was then contested by Chinese and Tibetan forces, and their respective vassal states, until the mid-700s. Rulers of Gilgit formed an alliance with the Tang Chinese and held back the Arabs with their help. Between 644 and 655, NavasurendrƒÅditya-nandin became king of Palola SƒÅhi dynasty in Gilgit. Numerous Sanskrit inscriptions, including the Danyor Rock Inscriptions, were discovered to be from his reign. In the late 600s and early 700s, Jayama·πÖgalavikramƒÅditya-nandin was king of Gilgit. According to Chinese court records, in 717 and 719 respectively, delegations of a ruler of Great Palola (Baltistan) named Su-fu-she-li-ji-li-ni () reached the Chinese imperial court. By at least 719/720, Ladakh (Mard) became part of the Tibetan Empire. By that time, Buddhism was practiced in Baltistan, and Sanskrit was the written language. Buddhism became firmly established in the region. Great monasteries were established, with education in Sanskrit language regarding Indian religions and philosophy. Trade expanded between Ladakh in India and Gilgit-Baltistan. The rulers of Leh in Ladakh, India became increasingly influential in Balti culture and customs, and the chiefs of the region became vassals to the Ladakhis and Tibetan paramountcy. In 720, the delegation of SurendrƒÅditya () reached the Chinese imperial court. He was referred to by the Chinese records as the king of Great Palola; however, it is unknown if Baltistan was under Gilgit rule at the time. The Chinese emperor also granted the ruler of Cashmere, ChandrƒÅpƒ´·∏ça (\\"Tchen-fo-lo- pi-li\\"), the title of \\"King of Cashmere\\". By 721/722, Baltistan had come under the influence of the Tibetan Empire. In 721‚Äì722, Tibetan army attempted but failed to capture Gilgit or Bruzha (Yasin valley). By this time, according to Chinese records, the king of Little Palola was Mo-ching-mang (). He had visited Tang court requesting military assistance against the Tibetans. Between 723‚Äì728, the Korean Buddhist pilgrim Hyecho passed through this area. In 737/738, Tibetan troops under the leadership of Minister Bel Kyesang Dongtsab of Emperor Me Agtsom took control of Little Palola. By 747, the Chinese army under the leadership of the ethnic-Korean commander Gao Xianzhi had recaptured Little Palola. Great Palola was subsequently captured by the Chinese army in 753 under the military Governor Feng Changqing. However, by 755, due to the An Lushan rebellion, the Tang Chinese forces withdrew and was no longer able to exert influence in Central Asia and in the regions around Gilgit-Baltistan. The control of the region was left to the Tibetan Empire. They referred to the region as Bruzha, a toponym that is consistent with the ethnonym \\"Burusho\\" used today. Tibetan control of the region lasted until late-800s CE. Turkic tribes practicing Zoroastrianism arrived in Gilgit during the 7th century, and founded the Trakhan dynasty in Gilgit.  Medieval history  In the 14th century, Sufi Muslim preachers from Persia and Central Asia introduced Islam in Baltistan. Famous amongst them was Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani who came via Kashmir while in the Gilgit region Islam entered in the same century through Turkic Tarkhan rulers. Gilgit-Baltistan was ruled by many local rulers, amongst whom the Maqpon dynasty of Skardu and the Rajas of Hunza were famous. The Maqpons of Skardu unified Gilgit-Baltistan with Chitral and Ladakh, especially in the era of Ali Sher Khan Anchan who had friendly relations with the Mughal court. Anchan reign brought prosperity and entertained art, sport, and variety in architecture. He introduced polo to the Gilgit region and from Chitral, he sent a group of musicians to Delhi to learn Indian music; the Mughal architecture influenced the architecture of the region as well. Later Anchan in his successors Abdal Khan had great influence though in the popular literature of Baltistan he is still alive as a dark figure by the nickname \\"Mizos\\" \\"man-eater\\". The last Maqpons Raja, Ahmed Shah, ruled all of Baltistan between 1811‚Äì1840. The areas of Gilgit, Chitral and Hunza had already become independent of the Maqpons. Before the demise of Shribadat, a group of Shin people migrated from Gilgit Dardistan and settled in the Dras and Kharmang areas. The descendants of those Dardic people can be still found today, and are believed to have maintained their Dardic culture and Shina language up to the present time. British Indian Empire It took a long time for the Maharajahs Ghulab Singh and Ranbir Singh to extend their writ over Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, and not until 1870 did they assert their authority over Gilgit town. The grip of the Jammu and Kashmir government over this area was tenuous. One of the first British officials to visit the region was G. T. Vinge. The region was practically independent of British influence. However, Vinge secured the confidence of the local duke of Baltistan, and received valuable antiquity and manuscripts during his mission. The Indian government undertook administrative reforms in 1885 and created Gilgit Agency in 1889 as a way for the British to secure the region as a buffer from the Russians. As a result of this Great Game, with British fear of Russian activities in Chinese Sinkiang increasing, in 1935 the Gilgit Agency was expanded by the Maharajah Hari Singh leasing the Gilgit Wazarat to the government of India for a period of sixty years and for an amount of 75,000Rs. This gave the British political agent complete control of defence, communications and foreign relations while the Kashmiri state retained civil administration and the British retained control of defence and foreign affairs.Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 121, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 After World War II British influence started declining. British despite decline in its rule, handled the situation cleverly and gave two options to the states in British Raj under their rule to join any of the two emerging states, India and Pakistan. In 1947, Mountbatten decided to terminate the lease of Gilgit by Kashmir to the British. Scholar Yaqoob Khan Bangash opines that the motive for this is unclear.Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 124, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 The people of Gilgit thought themselves to be ethnically different from the Kashmiris and resented being under Kashmir state rule. Gilgit was also one of the most backward areas of the Kashmir state. Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts, believed that the British handover of Gilgit to Kashmir was a huge mistake.Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 125-126, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 > Brown recounts that when he met the scouts they indirectly made it clear how > they despised and hated Kashmir and everything connected with it, how happy > and content they had been under the British rule, and how they considered > they had been betrayed by the British in the unconditional handing over of > their country to Kashmir. Taking advantage of the situation the populace of Gilgit-Baltistan started revolting, the people of Ghizer were first to raise the flag of revolution, and gradually the masses of entire region stood up against the rule of Maharaja, again British played an important role in war of independence of Gilgit-Baltistan. End of the princely state On 26 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, faced with a tribal invasion from Pakistan due to 1947 Jammu masscres along with 1947 Poonch rebellion , signed the Instrument of Accession, joining India. Gilgit's population did not favour the State's accession to India. According to Bangash, Muzzaffar, the raja orderly in Chilas, represented the views of the region's people when he said: > The whole of Gilgit Agency is pro-Pakistan ... we could never swear > allegiance to Hindustan. Apart from religion, the Gilgit Agency is really a > part of the NWFP and is therefore a part of Pakistan. If Kashmir remains > independent, well and good ... .But if the Maharaja through pig headedness > and bad advice, political pressure or attractive remunerations accedes to > Hindustan, then there will be trouble here!Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three > Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and > Commonwealth History, 38:1, 127, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 Sensing their discontent, Brown mutinied on 1 November 1947, overthrowing the Governor Ghansara Singh. The bloodless coup d'etat was planned by Brown to the last detail under the code name \`Datta Khel'. On the morning of 2 November 1947, after the Pakistan Ô¨Çag had been raised in scout lines, a provisional government (Aburi Hakoomat) was established with Shah Rais Khan as president, Mirza Hassan khan as commander in chief and Major Brown as the chief military advisor. However, Major Brown had already telegraphed Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan asking Pakistan to take over. The Pakistani political agent, Khan Mohammad Alam Khan, arrived on 16 November and took over the administration of Gilgit. On 18 November 1947, the provisional government requested to see the political agent asserting that he should take all decisions in consultation with them. They demanded that both British ofÔ¨Åcers be relieved of their duties and they should be appointed in their place. According to Brown, The provisional government lasted 16 days. The provisional government lacked sway over the population. The Gilgit rebellion did not have civilian involvement and was solely the work of military leaders, not all of whom had been in favor of joining Pakistan, at least in the short term. Dani mentions that although there was lack of public participation in the rebellion, pro-Pakistan sentiments were intense in the civilian population and their anti-Kashmiri sentiments were also clear.Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 132, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 Scholar Yaqoob Khan Bangash states that the people of Gilgit as well as those of Chilas, Koh Ghizr, Ishkoman, Yasin, Punial, Hunza and Nagar joined Pakistan by choice.Yaqoob Khan Bangash (2010) Three Forgotten Accessions: Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, 38:1, 137, DOI: 10.1080/03086530903538269 After taking control of Gilgit, the Gilgit Scouts along with Azad irregulars moved towards Baltistan and Ladakh and captured Skardu by May 1948. They successfully blocked the Indian reinforcements and subsequently captured Dras and Kargill as well, cutting off the Indian communications to Leh in Ladakh. The Indian forces mounted an offensive in Autumn 1948 and recaptured all of Kargil district. Baltistan region, however, came under Gilgit control. On 1 January 1948, India took the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to the United Nations Security Council. In April 1948, the Council passed a resolution calling for Pakistan to withdraw from all of Jammu and Kashmir and then India was to reduce its forces to the minimum level, following which a plebiscite would be held to ascertain the people's wishes. However, no withdrawal was ever carried out, India insisting that Pakistan had to withdraw first and Pakistan contending that there was no guarantee that India would withdraw afterwards. Gilgit-Baltistan and a western portion of the state called Azad Jammu and Kashmir) have remained under the control of Pakistan since then. Part of Pakistan 1947 to 1970 Government of Pakistan established Gilgit Agency and Baltistan Agency. In 1970 Northern areas council established by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Gilgit Baltistan was directly administrated by federal government and it was called FANA(Federal administrated northern areas). In 1963, Pakistan ceded a part of Hunza-Gilgit called Raskam and the Shaksgam Valley of Baltistan region to the China pending settlement of the dispute over Kashmir. This ceded area is also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract. The Pakistani parts of Kashmir to the north and west of the cease-fire line established at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, or the Line of Control as it later came to be called, were divided into the Northern Areas (72,971 km¬≤) in the north and the Pakistani state of Azad Kashmir (13,297 km¬≤) in the south. The name \\"Northern Areas\\" was first used by the United Nations to refer to the northern areas of Kashmir. Gilgit Baltistan, which was most recently known as the Northern Areas, presently consists of ten districts,Dividing governance: Three new districts notified in G-B, The Express Tribune, 5 February 2017. has a population approaching two million, has an area of approximately , and shares borders with China, Afghanistan, and India. The local Northern Light Infantry is the army unit that participated in the 1999 Kargil conflict. More than 500 soldiers were believed to have been killed and buried in the Northern Areas in that action. Special Report on Kargil\\", The Herald (Pakistan) Lalak Jan, a soldier from Yasin Valley, was awarded Pakistan's most prestigious medal, the Nishan-e- Haider, for his courageous actions during the Kargil conflict. Self- governing status and present-day Gilgit Baltistan On 29 August 2009, the Gilgit Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order, 2009, was passed by the Pakistani cabinet and later signed by the President of Pakistan. The order granted self-rule to the people of the former Northern Areas, now renamed Gilgit Baltistan, by creating, among other things, an elected legislative assembly. There has been an uplift in the self-identification of this territory's inhabitants through the name change but it has still left the region's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined. People of Gilgit Baltistan although have Pakistani passports and Identity Cards, yet they are not represented in the Parliament of Pakistan. Similarly Gilgit Baltistan is neither a member of the cCI nor the NFC, both being constitutional bodies. However the Supreme Court of Pakistan has time and again asked for determination of the constitutional status of Gilgit Baltistan. In this regard the 1999 Supreme Court judgement is landmark declaring people of Northern Areas as Pakistani citizens with all fundamental rights. (Citation: Ehsan Mehmood Khan in Constitutional Status of Gilgit Baltistan: An Issue of Human Security) A seven-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan was told in November 2018 that the Federal Government has had appointed a high level committee to examine the constitutional reforms of Gilgit Baltistan. ( Citation: Dawn 16 November 2018) According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the 2009 Governance Order was the Pakistani government's compromise between its official stand on Kashmir and demands of a territory where the majority of people may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.Antia Mato Bouzas (2012) Mixed Legacies in Contested Borderlands: Skardu and the Kashmir Dispute, Geopolitics, 17:4, 874, DOI: 10.1080/14650045.2012.660577 There has been some criticism and opposition to this move in India and Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan.Gilgit-Baltistan package termed an eyewash, Dawn, 2009-08-30 Gilgit Baltistan United Movement while rejecting the new package demanded that an independent and autonomous legislative assembly for Gilgit Baltistan should be formed with the installation of local authoritative government as per the UNCIP resolutions, where the people of Gilgit Baltistan will elect their president and the prime minister. In early September 2009, Pakistan signed an agreement with the People's Republic of China for a mega energy project in Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan which includes the construction of a 7,000-megawatt dam at Bunji in the Astore District. This also resulted in protest from India, although Indian concerns were immediately rejected by Pakistan, which claimed that the Government of India has no locus standi in the matter, effectively ignoring the validity of the princely state's Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947. On 29 September 2009, the Prime Minister, while addressing a huge gathering in Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan, announced a multi-billion rupee development package aimed at the socio-economic uplifting of people in the area. Development projects will include the areas of education, health, agriculture, tourism and the basic needs of life.

Retrieved on 24 March 2020. Barlow was born in 1806 in Granville, Massachusetts and died in Bountiful, Utah Territory.\\"Nauvoo Founder Celebrated in Monument Dedication\\", LDS Church, September 15, 2006. Barlow was baptized by Brigham Young into the Church of Christ, the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith, in Mendon, New York. In 1835, he was ordained a seventy by Sidney Rigdon and was one of the inaugural members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Barlow was also a member of Zion's Camp in 1834 and was a missionary in New Hampshire in 1844. Israel Barlow was once told by the Prophet, Joseph Smith to give a message to a certain man who lived in a neighborhood, known to be unfriendly to the Mormons. Smith gave him explicit instructions, which Barlow followed. While going back, Barlow heard a booming voice that said, \\"Ride faster.\\" He immediately sped up. He heard the voice again and quickened his horse's riding pace. He then heard, \\"Ride for your life.\\" He then ushered his horse to ride as fast as it possibly could. While crossing a bridge, he could hear a mob, which was hiding in the brush, planning to intercept him swear loudly. After had had passed them, the Spirit told him to turn off the road and into the forest, as the mob would try to chase him down. He did so and stayed quiet, and sure enough, the mob came pounding down the trail chasing him-not knowing that he was hiding in the bushes. As he made his way home, in the shelter of the forest, he finally got back to Joseph Smith's mansion house at dawn. Smith was pacing back and forth in front. Coming up to Smith, Barlow began to tell the story of which he just lived and Smith stopped him, telling him, \\"I saw it all; you have no need to tell me.\\" Smith proceeded to give Israel a blessing, saying, \\"Thee and thine shall never want.\\"Ride Faster In Nauvoo, Barlow was one of the bodyguards of Joseph Smith. After Smith's death, Barlow was a Mormon pioneer and traveled with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1848; he settled in Bountiful. He was a missionary in England in 1853‚Äì55, where he was president of the Birmingham Conference of the LDS Church, where he met his third wife, Lucy Heap. With four wives and twenty-one children, Barlow today has more than 10,000 descendants. When his first wife, Elizabeth Haven, was nine years old, her mother died. She learned to braid straw hats, pin-laces, and other delicate trimmings to earn money to pay for her education. Elizabeth graduated from Amherst College as a teacher in 1836. Soon afterward, her cousins, Brigham Young and Willard Richards came to Holliston, Massachusetts, on their mission for the new LDS Church. She and her brother, Jesse, were converted and baptized members of the Church. She and Jess moved to Quincy, Illinois, where she met Israel Barlow. They were married in Feb. 1840. They soon moved to their new home in Nauvoo. Elizabeth taught school in Nauvoo having among her students the children of Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and Brigham Young. The Prophet Joseph Smith was aware of Elizabeth's ability of writing and knew she was corresponding with her cousin Elizabeth Bullock. He asked her to save all of her letters. She did, and her writings of those early days of the Church, their operations, movements, and missionaries have been preserved in the family book, 'The Israel Barlow Story and Mormon Mom [Mores].' Elizabeth and Israel were driven from Nauvoo. She carried on alone while Israel was away on missions. She consented to the practice of polygamy and shared her husband with three other women. Their family came west in June, 1848 with the Brigham Young Company. After their arrival in Salt Lake Valley, they spent their first winter in the old Pioneer Fort. Later, they lived in West Bountiful. One of his wives, Lucy Heap, was British and came from Lichfield, Staffordshire.

Each annual data set can be used to examine the disease burden and access to care that individuals and families are currently experiencing in the United States. NHIS is designed by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) ‚Äì the government agency tasked to monitor the population's health status and behavior ‚Äì and administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. NHIS has been administered since 1957, although the core content and questionnaires undergo major revisions every 10‚Äì15 years. NHIS allows both governmental and outside researchers to obtain estimates on a variety of health-related topics among either the entire nation or specific demographic groups of the population. Also, since the survey design is cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, health information can be trended for demographic groups and the country as a whole, but not for individuals or families.  History  Authorized by the National Health Survey Act of 1956, the U.S. Public Health Service was tasked with implementing an annual survey to collect information on morbidities ‚Äì physical or mental conditions related to any illness or injury ‚Äì and medical service and medical facility utilization. The most recent re-design of the survey questionnaire was implemented in 1997.  Research topics  Percentages of persons in families with selected financial burdens of medical care: United States, January‚ÄìJune 2011. Chart from \\"Financial Burden of Medical Care: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey\\". NHIS data contain information on health, influences on health, and health outcomes, as well as common demographic indicators to give users the ability to examine health status, behavior, and risk factors within and across subsets of the population (such as racial and ethnic health disparities). The major health topics covered in the Core questionnaires include health status, insurance coverage, complementary and alternative medicine, use of health services, immunizations, health behaviors, injuries, occupational health, cancer screening, ability to perform daily activities, and conditions such as asthma, diabetes, mental health. NCHS continually produces chart books, statistical briefs, and fact sheets using NHIS data which shed light on these various facets of morbidities and how the American populace behaves in response. Periodically, the NHIS includes supplemental questionnaires regarding a focused topic that might be of particular current interest. For example, a cancer supplement was fielded in 1987, 1992, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2010, and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention. This supplement included questions about cancer screenings, diet, exercise, smoking, sun exposure, and family history. Occupational supplement were fielded in 2010 and 2015, and sponsored by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These supplement included questions about work-related health conditions, work organization factors, and occupational psychosocial and physical/chemical exposures. A full list of supplements can be found on the NHIS website.  Publications  The National Health Interview Survey is commonly the subject of analysis in articles on health status and health behaviors in research journals such as Obesity, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Health Services Research, and the American Journal of Public Health. A number of CDC reports, including Healthy People, rely on NHIS to monitor health estimates. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) tracks health insurance coverage in the United States using the NHIS. The National Center for Health Statistics publishes periodical statistical summaries, compiling the results of the most recent NHIS and trending those statistics over time for certain groups. NCHS/CDC also publish statistical reports on current topics of interest, and shorter data briefs. For example, NIOSH has published several peer-reviewed journal articles from the 2010 and 2015 NHIS Occupational Health Supplement results.  Methodology  = Survey design = Noninstitutional civilian Americans (both citizens and non-citizens) are sampled by household, allowing for analysis of medical behavior at the familial-level. After a household has been sampled, one adult and one child (if any are present) is selected to complete the Sample Adult and Sample Child components of the survey. In years without budget cuts, approximately 35,000 households containing 87,500 individuals are included. NHIS follows a multi-stage area probability design, meaning that geographic areas ‚Äì rather than unique households ‚Äì are sampled first, and then within those selected areas, residences are sampled. Unlike surveys with a panel or longitudinal design, the entirety of data collected from each household occurs from a single interview lasting about an hour. The complex survey design must be analyzed with software capable of handling survey data that was not obtained from a simple random sample, such as R, SUDAAN, SAS, Stata, SPSS, and VPLX. In addition to appropriately weighting households that might have been over-represented in the raw data (due to oversampling of populations of interest), survey analysis packages are needed to employ the Taylor-series linearization technique to correctly calculate the standard errors and confidence intervals. = Linkage to other health surveys = The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses the NHIS sampled population to form its own sampling frame (ultimately sampling one-half of NHIS respondent households for its own publicly available complete survey). After filling out a confidentiality agreement, AHRQ provides a crosswalk to merge these data. NHIS data can also be linked to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).  Data Available  NHIS data are freely downloadable by the public, and generally become available in June or July for the preceding year's data set. Certain variables that might make survey respondents easily identifiable (such as geographic locations, exact dates of events and procedures) are not available from the publicly available data, but can be accessed and analyzed by applying for access to the NCHS Research Data Center. The current publicly available annual National Health Interview Survey data release consists of four files which describe the demographics and health-related characteristics of the survey population at the household, family, and person-level, as well as two files designed to capture information on any injuries experienced during the year. = Core =  Household File  With one record per household in the sample, this file mainly contains descriptors necessary to determine the number of individuals and families within each sampled household, and allows researchers to link families or other unrelated individuals captured in any of the other Core files based on household of residence (using the HHX variable). This file also contains basic information on non-response and a household-level final weight.  Family File  This file contains one record per family in the sample, with general information on identifiers (such as family member age, race, family structure, family income), health status and limitations, injuries and poisonings, access to care and utilization, and health insurance. The family file can be linked to other files containing information on adults and children within each family (using the HHX and FMX variables).  Person File  This file contains information on every individual within every family within every household selected for participation in the NHIS. Survey data about individuals who were either not available at the time of the interview or under 18 were provided by an available adult in the household. This person- level file contains information on health status and limitation of activity, health care access and utilization, health insurance, socio-demographics, and income and assets. Examining this file using the final weight variable (WTFA) generalizes to the entire noninstitutional, civilian United States population.  Sample Adult and Sample Child Files  These two files contain information obtained from the survey response of one adult and one child (if one exists) sampled from each family contained in the family file, and can be linked up to household and family information (using the HHX and FMX variables). These two sample person files contain much more in-depth information about health conditions, physical and mental health status, health limitations, behaviors, and utilization than the family file. Their question topics are specific to either adults or children, but not both (such as occupational demographic questions in the adult file and childhood immunization questions in the child file). Much like the Person file, these two files can be used to create national estimates of all adults and children in the United States (using WTFA_SA to generalize to all adults and WTFA_SC to generalize to all children). Individuals can be matched between the Person and Sample Adult/Child files using the HHX (household), FMX (family), and FPX (person) fields.  Injury and Poisoning Files  The Injury and Poisoning Episode file contains event-level information about any injury event experienced by an individual within the household in the three months leading up to the interview. For each reported injury or poisoning event, a number of questions examining the severity and effect of the event were asked, such as whether a physician was consulted and what kind of injury was experienced. This episode file can be used to generalize about the frequency of all injuries experienced by Americans over a defined window of time. The final weight (WTFA) generalizes to the number of injuries that occur among the U.S. population. This file can be merged on to any of the other data files using the HHX (household), FMX (family), and FPX (person) merge fields. The Injury and Poisoning Verbatim file contains un-categorized, open-ended data provided by the respondent. This file can be linked to the cleaned Episode file using the HHX, FMX, FPX, and IPEPNO (Injury/Poisoning Episode Number) fields. = Supplemental = Supplemental data are available whenever funding and sponsorship allow. The topics of non-core questionnaires generally relate to a matter of current importance to policymakers or the research community. Occupational Health Supplement ''' In 2010 and 2015, supplemental data were collected that relate to the impacts of work on health. Known as the Occupational Health Supplements, these data are available to chart using the Worker Health Charts tool. Worker Health Charts is a tool NIOSH uses to allow the public to visualize NHIS data, along with other work-related data sources. See the CDC Feature on Worker Health Charts and the NIOSH Science Blog to learn more about the tool and how it works.

He was one of founders of the Anya Nya Military Wing of the Liberation of Southern Sudan, fighting for the independence of Southern Sudan. He was ambushed and killed by Sudan's army on 9 May 1968 at Cueibet, on his way from Rumbek to Tonj. He was elected unopposed. The Sudan government denied to have authorised the assassination. No investigation was conducted. Though eyewitnesses at Cueibet village and SANU investigation committee confirmed the assassins to be the Sudan army. Background William Deng was of Dinka origin, and was born in Tonj, then in Bahr al-Ghazal Provinc. He joined the government as an administrator. William Deng believed in PanAfrican Democratic Socialism, and in solidarity with African Sudanese in resistance to Arab colonialism. He aimed for political partnership with indigenous African Sudanese people of Nuba, Fur, Beja, Nubia, Ingesenia and other parts of northern Sudan. These African groups formed the Congress of New Forces,CNF, in the Constituent Assembly in 1967/68, to oppose the Government of the then Prime Minister, Mohamed Ahmed Mahagoup of the Umma party. Exile Some time after the army took power in 1958, William Deng fled into exile, as did other southern politicians including Fr. Saturnino Ohure, Joseph Oduho and Alexis Bakumba. Saturnino Ohure and Joseph Oduho moved from Uganda to Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where they were joined by William Deng and founded the Sudan African Closed Districts National Union (SACDNU). William Deng was appointed Secretary-General of SACNDU in 1962. William Deng and Joseph Oduho co-authored the first book ever in 1962: \\"The Problem of the Southern Sudan.\\" In that book, they declared arms struggle for independence of Southern Sudan from the minority Arab dominated, colonial government of Khartoum/Sudan. The exiles moved back to Kampala in Uganda in 1963, with the movement renamed the Sudan African National Union (SANU). The new name was designed to show solidarity with other African nationalist movements of the period. In Kampala SANU became the voice of the 60,000 refugees who had fled to camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, but was unable to establish a political presence in Sudan. The SANU leaders did manage to organize the military Wing of SANU, the Anya Nya, which began operating in Southern Sudan in 1963, conducting gorrila raids and largely responsible for military operations and targets. William Deng was responsible for the Bahr al-Ghazal insurgents, that launched heavy military attacked on Sudan's military garrison at Wau in January 1964. That Anya Nya force was led commanded by Col. Bernadino Mou Mou. In that operations, over twelve Sudan's army soldiers were killed, and many automatic weapons were captured. Those military activities posed a serious security threat and putting its weight behind the civilian demonstrations which were steadily challenging and eroding the alreading crumbling military government. In response to mounting pressure, the military ruler Major General Ibrahim Abboud, announced his resignation and opened way to civilian rule, beginning from 21 October 1964. The new civilian provional government, led by Prime Minister, Al Sir Al Khatim Al Khalifa, backed all political parties, North and South, declared freedom of speech and association, thus allowing political parties to operate. The government called for peaceful solution to the \\"problem of Southern Sudan.\\"  Return to Sudan In February 1965, William Deng decided to return to Khartoum and register SANU. The other SANU leaders, led by Aggrey Jadien, rejected Deng's proposal and instead decided to continue outside Khartoum until total \\"independence is achieved.\\" Thus causing a split of SANU into two factions, one inside Sudan and the other outside Sudan. William Deng organised and registered SANU inside Sudan, after which he became its President. Aggrey Jadein, on the other hand, became the leader of SANU outside. SANU was formally registered as a political party in Sudan following a rally in Omdurman on 11 April 1965, which was heavily attended by 20,000 Southern and Northern Sudanese in the Capital. The SANU and Southern Front, an organization which was formed in Khartoum by Southern Sudanese and led by Stanislaus Paysama, was not formally registered, but was politically operative. SANU was an active force in Sudanese politics for the next four years, advocating Federal system of government within united Sudan. The SANU in exile rejected Deng's moderated approach, and opted for separate independent Southern Sudan. The Southern Front, on their own, wanted a plebiscite to choose between autonomous rule, unity, federatl arrangement or secession. The provisional government, led Prime Minister, Sir Al Khatim Al Khalifa, from 24 October 1964 to 15 June 1965, did hold the Round Table Peace Conference on the \\"problem of Southern Sudan.\\" The Conference was attended by the Northern political parties of the Umma, National Unionist Party, NUP, Islamic Charter Front (NIF), Sudan Communist Party, SCP, and others. For Southern Sudan political parties, the attendees were: SANU Inside, SANU outside, led by William Deng and Aggrey Jaddien,respectively, and the Southern Front, led by Clement Mboro. The Conference was also attended by African observers from Egypt, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. The conference failed. Northern parties, as they did in 1946 conference on the South, 1956 declaration of Sudan's independence and 1958 inside the Constituent Assembly (Sudan's parliament), rejected various demands proposed by the Southern parties. To face safe the conference, the North and South agreed to continue consultations by forming a twelve-man committee to consider and study what they called \\"local autonomy.\\" It couldn't work. Thus making Northern parties to call for general elections for May 1965. The optimism in the south for return to democracy, was quickly aborted. Provision Prime Minister Sir Al Khatim Al Khalifa called elections to be conducted in May‚ÄìJune 1965 as demanded by the Northern political parties. The Southern parties, then SANU inside and Southern Front boycotted the elections. Nevertheless, the North went for partial elections, an exclusion of the South, which had become a political practice from 1946 to independence and beyond. Elections, despite the Southern boycott, was held in the North on time scheduled. The Umma and the NUP won. The two parties opted for coalition government headed by the NUP President, Ismail Alzahry as president of the Supreme Council (five men's head of state membership) and Umm Prime Minister, Mohamed Ahmed Mahgoub, whose policy was to make war with Southern Sudan arms movement, the Anya Nya, and their supporters inside the country. The policy was approved by the Northern Constituent Assembly to proceed with war and persecution of educated Southern Sudanese in Southern Sudan and the North. As a result, Prime Minister Mahgoub committed massive massacre of educated and Chiefs in Wau, Juba and other towns on 9‚Äì15 July 1965. Despite this, William Deng invested considerable time and efforts, trying to convince government leaders of the benefits of solving the north-south conflict. He pointed out the unwanted truth that the northern soldiers stationed in the south were in charge at daytime, brutal killers at night. If the stalemate were ended, military costs would drop and the south could supply the north with food, with surplus for export. He was not successful in his arguments. Assassination In the 1968 election, William Deng won his seat by a landslide, but was assassinated just as the results were announced. Deng and others in his party were killed on 9 May 1968 in Cueibet County, Lakes State in a place that is now called William Bridge. There was little doubt that the army was responsible, although the government accused the rebels. The government ordered an investigation, but never issued a report on what had happened. According to Muhammad Omar Bashir, \\"The murder of William Deng represented a great setback in North-South relations. Deng's decision to return to the Sudan in 1965 to attend the Round Table Conference and his participation in that event, in the Twelve-Man Committee, in the Political Parties Conference and in the National Constitution Commission had all made a positive contribution to the search for a solution of the Southern problem. After his death, William Deng was buried in his home town in Tonj South County. Deng is now considered a national hero. However, his grave fell into disrepair, partly used as a garbage site, partly for local breweries. In May 2011 residents in the immediate area of the grave were given one month's notice to leave so that the site could be cleaned up. His son Nhial Deng Nhial later became a leading politician in the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, and in December 2008 was appointed Minister for SPLA Affairs, or Defense Minister.

It consists of all parts of the city that lie west of the Merrimack River and includes the neighborhoods of Northwest Manchester, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame, Piscataquog, Wolfe Park, and Mast Road. It lies just to the east of the community of Pinardville in the neighboring town of Goffstown. While much of the West Side was historically dominated by French Canadian neighborhoods like Notre Dame and Rimmon Heights, the area was also home to other ethnic groups, including the city's largest German neighborhood in Piscataquog. It has become increasingly diverse, but is still largely associated with the city's French Canadian heritage. Most of the developed areas of the West Side are high density urban neighborhoods, but the outer neighborhoods of Northwest Manchester, Wolfe Park, and Mast Road are medium to suburban. History West Side neighborhood - closeup from Rock Rimmon The lower area of Notre Dame, immediately west of present-day downtown Manchester, was originally known as McGregorville, after the McGregor family that built the first bridge in the city in 1792. The area later grew into a dense neighborhood called the Flat Iron District beneath Rimmon Heights and adjacent to the western side of the Amoskeag millyard.http://www.stmarysbank.com/uploads/images/news/RimHeigtPster.jpg Pisctaquog was originally part of the neighboring town of Bedford, and developed as an industrial area around the confluence of the Piscataquog and Merrimack rivers in the early nineteenth century. The contrast between the urban area, then known as 'Sqoug Village, and the otherwise rural town of Bedford led local residents to request annexation by the city of Manchester, which the General Court granted in 1853. Rimmon Heights developed later in the nineteenth century when a streetcar line extended up the hill and along Kelley Street, which remains the center of economic activity in the neighborhood today. Mast Road and Wolfe Park also developed as more typical streetcar suburbs along the lines extending to Goffstown Village and the Bedford town line. The two major economic centers on the West Side, Granite Square and the Flat Iron District, were entirely demolished between the 1960s and early 1980s as part of urban renewal projects.http://www.stmarysbank.com/uploads/images/news/RimHeigtPster.jpg The much larger Flat Iron District was replaced with a suburban-style shopping center, which is now mostly vacant, an elderly housing high-rise and an expansion of Catholic Medical Center. A second elderly housing high-rise and semi-urban shopping center followed a fire, road widening and the construction of a highway interchange in the Granite Square area.http://www.manchesterhousing.org/current.php The West Side has begun to rebound from the effects of urban renewal in recent years. Rimmon Heights became the pilot neighborhood for the city's Neighborhood Initiatives in 2006. Around the same time, neighborhood centers in Wolfe Park and Rimmon Heights were rezoned to encourage traditional neighborhood development, and new landscaping and pedestrian amenities were provided along the Granite Street gateway to downtown and the West Side. The Piscataquog Trail, a recreational rail trail that opened in 2006, crosses much of the West Side and connects to downtown Manchester via a pedestrian bridge over the Merrimack River. Recent private development has included the expansion of Catholic Medical Center along both sides of McGregor Street, the planned new headquarters of St. Mary's Bankhttp://livablemht.org/2011/07/10/livable-st-marys-bank-re- urbanizing-mcgregor-street/ and conversion of a former Amoskeag mill into high-end housing in the Notre Dame area, as well as several smaller projects in Rimmon Heights.

Foulis was the son and heir of James de Foulis of Edinburgh (a skinner) and his wife Margaret, who was herself the daughter of Sir James Henderson of Fordell, Fife, Lord Advocate to James IV of Scotland. On his father's side, Foulis was the grandson of William Foulis, Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland under James I of Scotland.Thomas Murray, Biographical Annals of the Parish of Colinton (1863), pp. 29‚Äì30. In 1519, Foulis acquired from the Master of Glencairn the lands of Colinton. Thereafter his family would incorporate Colinton into their names. He was chosen a lord of session 12 November 1526, being then member of parliament for Edinburgh, and was admitted as a member of Court of Session on 27 May 1532 shortly after it was instituted. From 1527 onwards Foulis served as Lord Advocate alongside but subordinate to Sir Adam Otterburn. In 1529 he had briefly been private secretary to James V of Scotland. From the first he was clerk register of the college, and as such was present in parliament in most years from 1535 to 1546. As such officer he was charged by license of parliament to cause the acts of the parliament to be printed by any person he wanted. From 1532 to 1546 he was a commissioner for holding parliament, and was a member of the Privy Council of Scotland in 1542. In 1543 he was a commissioner to negotiate a marriage between the infant Queen Mary and Prince Edward of England.

Rioting broke out on 24 April and continued for three days, widely supported by the local population, who were sympathetic to the weavers' plight. The rioting ended after 20 or so of the ringleaders were arrested. Some local manufacturers subsequently attempted to introduce a minimum wage for weavers, but were unable to obtain the support of the UK government to enforce it. Background England suffered economically in the years immediately following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, and in the textile towns of the industrial north wages fell sharply as the factory system was developed. In Bolton alone, 1500 of the town's 6000 handloom weavers were out of work in 1826, and 1500 were on half work. A weaver who in 1792 could have expected to earn six shillings a day was by 1826 earning less than six shillings a week for a sixteen-hour day, in a period when the price of staples such as bread, cheese and meat had almost doubled. Course of events Rioting broke out in the east of Lancashire on 24 April 1826. The first of 21 mills to be attacked was the Higher Grange Lane Factory in Accrington. The rioters marched on to Blackburn on the second day. On the third and final day of rioting the military were called upon to defend a mill in Chatterton against 3000 rioters, six of whom were shot and killed when the crowd refused to disperse after the Riot Act had been read to them. Popular support The rioters were widely supported locally, and not only by fellow handloom weavers. Amongst those arrested in Blackburn, for instance, were labourers, a farmer, a confectioner, a butcher and even power-loom weavers. An eye-witness to the rioting in Chorley noted that \\"there can be no doubt that a great multitude of the townspeople were their friends. The women supplied the rioters with stones, concealing the missiles under their aprons.\\" Some of the soldiers sent to confront the rioters seemed sympathetic to their plight. One 16-year-old handloom weaver from Haslingden, Thomas Duckworth, records that on the first day of rioting the group he was marching with encountered a number of mounted soldiers approaching them with drawn swords. The officers in charge appealed to the mob to disperse, warning of the consequences if they did not. In Duckworth's own words: Suppression and aftermath The riots ended after local magistrates swore in a large number of special constables to arrest about 20 of the ringleaders \\"in the dead of night\\". During the course of the rioting more than 1000 power looms were destroyed. A number of manufacturers subsequently agreed to pay a standard rate to the weavers, but on their own admission it was a \\"starvation\\" wage. The manufacturers who stuck to the agreement found it difficult to compete with those who did not, and could therefore undercut them, prompting an appeal to William Huskisson, the President of the Board of Trade, to introduce a legally binding minimum wage. Huskisson's response was dismissive, expressing his view that to introduce such a measure would be \\"a vain and hazardous attempt to impose the authority of the law between the labourer and his employer in regulating the demand for labour and the price to be paid for it\\".

For more than a hundred years, he was confused with his son, Henry Joseph Fradelle (1805‚Äì1872), who was trained as an artist but had several professions, including infirmary supervisor. It was only in the first decade of the 21st century that this mistake was identified and that biographies, lists, and auction houses gave Fradelle his rightful name.  Life  Fradelle was born in Lille on 15 June 1778. His father was Joseph Guillaume Fradelle, a musician, and his mother was Adelaide Genevi√®ve Valla, both from Paris. Fradelle studied under Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He left for Italy in 1808 and lived there until 1816. He then moved to London, which became his home, apart from a few years spent in Paris between 1830 and 1837. Over a period of about 30 years in England, Fradelle exhibited 36 pictures at the British Institution, including The Cloister of the Carthusians at Rome Built by Michael Angelo; The Porch of St. Ambrose at Milan; Chatelar Playing the Lute to Mary Queen of Scots; Belinda at Her Toilette; The Earl of Leicester's Visit to Amy Robsart at Cumnor Place; Ivanhoe, Queen Elizabeth and Lady Paget; Origin of Painting; Souvenirs d'Italie‚ÄîIl Sospiro, an Italian Dance; and Othello and Desdemona. Fradelle also exhibited 11 works at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, including Milton Dictating Paradise Lost to His Daughter, The Death of Adelaide, Othello Relating the Story of His Life to Brabantio and Desdemona, and Olivia and Viola. In addition, he presented works at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Old Water-Colour Society, and the Paris Salon, where he won a medal in 1834. Fradelle also painted and exhibited portraits, such as those of Mrs. Jeffery, Mr. Thomas H. Johnston, and Captain Basset, R.A., as well as miniature portraits like Miss Stephens as Susanna in Marriage of Figaro. Fradelle died at 36 Weymouth Street, Portland Place, London, on 14 March 1865 and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He was 86.  Works  right Fradelle's works were bought by such notables as Lord Holland (Holland House), the Earl of Egremont (Petworth House), Lord Northwick, Wynn Ellis, J. Marshall of Leeds, and the Duke of Leuchtenberg of Munich. The Earl of Leicester's Visit to Amy Robsart at Cumnor Place is exhibited at Petworth House (the preparatory drawing for the latter is in the British Museum, London), and Fradelle's Othello Relating the Story of His Life to Brabantio and Desdemona is now part of the Royal Shakespeare Company Collection in Stratford upon Avon. Drawings by Fradelle can be found at the Mus√©e des Beaux- Arts in Bordeaux, France. Many of Fradelle's works were engraved by artists such as Charles Turner (for example, The Earl of Leicester's Visit to Amy Robsart at Cumnor Place), William Say (Queen Elizabeth and Lady Paget and Belinda at Her Toilette, as well as The Interview Between Lady Jane Grey and Dr. Roger Ascham), R. Smart (Princess Elizabeth at Woodstock), J. Jazet (Chatelar Playing the Lute to Mary Queen of Scots), V. Rogers and A. Duncan (both of whom engraved Mary Queen of Scots and Her Secretary Chatelar), and U. Denis (Belinda at Her Toilette). Some of the engravings can be found at the National Portrait Gallery and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris. Manuscript letters by Fradelle to Baron Darnay, Mr and Mrs Ogle, and Mrs Herving are at the Princeton University Library and at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. In recent years, paintings by Fradelle have been sold by Lawsons (Sydney), Bonhams (London), Ritchies (Toronto), Christies (London) and Bart Wouters Kunsthandel (Brasschaat, Belgium), among others. The paintings concerned are Queen Elizabeth and Lady Paget; Interior Scene Depicting a Shakespearian Man Reciting Poetry to a Lady; Origin of Painting; Milton Dictating Paradise Lost to His Daughter; A Dance in La Campagna; Portrait of a Lady in a Blue Dress Playing the Harp, a Landscape Beyond; and Scene from Othello.

Life Fraizer was born in Scotland about 1610, and graduated M.D. at Montpellier on 1 Oct. 1635. He was incorporated at Cambridge 9 March 1637, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 23 November 1641. He was a faithful royalist, followed Charles II abroad, and became his physician. The king placed confidence in him, and he was in turn courted and abused by the factions which grew up among the English exiles on the continent. He was once friendly with Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and at another time avoided communication with him. Fraizer was declared by the king to be excellent as a physician, and was employed in court affairs. There was probably some resemblance of character which sustained the confidential relation; but the conclusion stated by some contemporary writers, that the physician was as unprincipled as his royal patient, is unsupported by evidence, and no weight attaches to the abuse of Sir John Denham and of Samuel Pepys. Denham's attacks are founded on personal enmity, of which the cause is not now known. Pepys's informant was Pierce, a groom of the privy chamber, who repeated backstairs' gossip. The respect with which Fraizer is mentioned by Dr. Edward Browne, and the fact that on 26 July 1666 he was chosen an elect at the College of Physicians of London, a distinction which his being king's physician would not have obtained for him had his professional character been low, are evidences of his general uprightness. Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, who dealt in wood, arrested Fraizer for a wood bill of about ¬£30. The bailiffs were beaten by the king's order, but this was not due to any misconduct on the physician's part, but to royal indignation at a supposed breach of a prerogative. Few records of Fraizer's practice remain. He attended Mary, Princess of Orange in the attack of small-pox which ended fatally on Christmas Eve, 1660, and the young James, Duke of Cambridge and Charles, Duke of Kendal in the illness which killed both in 1667, and he superintended the successful trepanning of Prince Rupert's skull on Sunday, 3 February 1666. At Cologne Mr. Elburg was his apothecary. Soon after the Restoration of Charles II, Fraizer was knighted and in 1663 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His wife was made a dresser to the queen. He died 3 May 1681. He had a son, Charles, who became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was physician in ordinary to Charles II, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1684.

Between five hundred and two thousand eggs are produced and fertilisation is external. The eggs are pelagic and include a large oil drop. The newly hatched fry feed get their nourishment from the yolk sac and grow rapidly. Juveniles feed on zooplankton at first and then benthic organisms. Males are mature at three years while females are mature in four. The adults are detrivores sand also eat algae and vegetable matter.

Bakke Corp., \\"956 P.2d 219\\", 226 (Or. Ct. App. 1998).  History and purpose  The practice of retainage dates back to the construction of the United Kingdom railway system in the 1840s.Bausman, Dennis C. \\"Retainage Practice in the Construction Industry\\" 1 (Foundation of the American Subcontractors Association, Inc. 2004). The size of the railway project increased demand for contractors, which led to the entrance of new contractors into the labor market. These new contractors were inexperienced, unqualified and unable to successfully complete the project. Consequently, the railway companies began to withhold as much as 20% of contractors' payments to ensure performance and offset completion costs should the contractor default. The point was to withhold the contractor's profit only, not to make the contractor and its subcontractors finance the project. Given the often large- scale, complexity, cost and length of construction projects, the risk of something not going according to plan is almost certain. Accordingly, a common approach that contracting parties take in order to mitigate this risk is to include retainage provisions within their agreements. The concept of retainage is unique to the construction industry and attempts to do two things: provide an incentive to the contractor or subcontractor to complete the project and protect the owner against any liens, claims or defaults, which may surface as the project nears completion.Ridge Sheet Metal Co. v. Morrell. \\"517 A.2d 1133\\" Md. 1986. Incidentally, owners and contractors use retainage as a source of financing for the project, contractors in turn withhold retainage from subcontractors, frequently at a greater percentage than is being withheld from them.Skrabak, C. Kelly ; Jones, and Heather A. \\"The State of Retainage\\". Construction Briefings. 2005. 4. April 2005.  Creation and enforcement  If there is to be retainage on the construction project, it is set forth in the construction contract.See McDevitt & Street Co. v. Marriott Corp., \\"713 F. Supp. 906\\" E.D. Va. 1989. aff'd in part without opinion and rev'd in part without opinion, 948 F.2d 1281 (4th Cir. 1991). Retainage provisions are applicable to subcontracts as well as prime contracts. The amount withheld from the contractor or subcontractor should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the parties negotiating the contract, usually based upon such factors as past performance and the likelihood that the contractor or subcontractor will perform well under the contract. One can structure retainage arrangements in any number of ways. Subject to state statutory requirements, 10% is the retainage amount most often used by contracting parties. Another approach is to start off with a 10% retainage and to reduce it to 5% once the project is 50% complete.AIA Document A511, \\"Guide for Supplementary Conditions\\" at ¬∂ 9.3.1 A third approach is to carve out material costs from a withholding requirement on the theory that suppliers, unlike subcontractors, may not accept retainage provisions in their purchase orders. Retainage clauses are usually found within the contract terms outlining the procedure for submitting payment applications. A typical retainage clause parallels the following language: \\"Owner shall pay the amount due on the Payment Application less retainage of [a specific percentage].\\"C. Kelly Skrabak and Heather A. Jones, The State of Retainage, Construction Briefings No. 2005-4, April 2005, at *2.  \\"Substantially Complete\\"  Retainage is generally due to the contractor or subcontractor once his work is substantially complete. Disputes often arise regarding just when substantial completion occurs. The standard analysis finds the event triggered when the owner can occupy a structure and use it for its intended purpose.Bruner, Philip L.; O'Connor, Jr., Patrick J. Payment Process: Financing, Securing and Making Payment, 3 Bruner & O'Connor Construction Law ¬ß 8:18. June 2011.  Retainage abuse  Subcontractors tend to bear the brunt of retainage provisions, especially subcontractors performing work early on in the construction process. The main reason for this, is because many contractors pass down the owner's right to withhold retainage to the subcontractor, but frequently withhold more than is being withheld from them. For example, a subcontractor performing site work may complete its work in the first few months of the construction project, but generally is not allowed to recover the amount withheld from the owner and contractor until the project is \\"substantially complete\\", which could take a few years depending on the size of the project. Coupled with a contingent payment clause, the retainage can cause significant financial distress to a subcontractor. Another problem arises when the contractor withholds from its subcontractors at a greater percentage than the owner has withheld from them. The owner is to pay retainage to the contractor when substantial completion has occurred, however, in this abusive, over-withholding scenario, the contractor will already have been paid a portion of the subcontractors' funds, meaning that the contractor will have to fund the balance of the payment from its own cash flow. This could cause a delay in the project closeout. The contractor may feel that it is more advantageous to keep the project incomplete, than by never being paid its retainage and making the argument that the subcontractors are therefore not due their portion of the retainage.  Federal retainage policy  In 1974, Congress established the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to provide a uniform government-wide procurement policy.Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, Pub. L. No. 93-400, Section 5, 88 Stat. 796 (codified at \\"41 U.S.C. ¬ß 404\\"). Enacted August 20, 1974. Since the mid-1970s, there has been an overall trend in the reduction of percentage withheld on federal construction projects.Bruner, Philip L.; O'Connor, Jr., Patrick J. Payment Process: Financing, Securing and Making Payment. 3. Bruner & O'Connor Construction Law ¬ß 8:18. June 2011. The current Federal Acquisition Regulation (F.A.R.) continues to support this trend. Paragraph 32.103 of the regulation states, \\" . . . Retainage should not be used as a substitute for good contract management, and the contracting officer should not withhold funds without cause. Determinations to retain and the specific amount to be withheld shall be made by the contracting officers on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions will be based on the contracting officer's assessment of past performance and the likelihood that such performance will continue.\\"\\"FAR 32.103\\" (2011). Currently, federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the US Department of Transportation have 'zero' retainage policies.  Alternatives to retainage  Several alternatives exist to standard retainage provisions that provide the same benefits and protections. For example, parties can agree to establish a trust account. A trust account provides the contractor with some control over its money, even if it is being held by the owner. In a trust account, retainage is withheld by the owner, placed in a trust account with a trustee that has a fiduciary relationship to the contractor. The trustee can invest the retainage at the contractor's direction, thereby allowing the contractor to \\"use\\" the retained funds that normally would sit idle in an escrow account. Other alternatives to retainage are to allow the contractor to supply substitute security to the owner in the form of a performance bond, bank letter of credit, or a security of, or guaranteed by, the United States, such as bills, certificates, notes or bonds.

Life Franklyn was born at Bledlow, Buckinghamshire, probably about 1460, and educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.C.L. in 1504. He took holy orders, and in 1514 was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Durham and receiver of the bishop's revenues. In 1515 he became archdeacon of Durham and master of the Hospital of St. Giles at Kepyer, County Durham. In this and the following years Franklyn was active in directing measures in border warfare with the Scotch. His headquarters was at Norham, and it was probably about this period that a grant of arms was made him in consideration of the recovery of the castle at that place by his prowess and policy. In February 1518 he was installed prebendary of Heydour- cum-Walton in the diocese of Lincoln, and before 1522 he was rector of Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, and held the prebend of Eveston, in the collegiate church of Lanchester, in the same county. On Thomas Wolsey's accession to the see of Durham he confirmed Franklyn in the chancellorship, with power of appointing justices of the peace, coroners, stewards, bailiffs, and other officers; and the chancellor made himself useful to the bishop in devising plans for increasing the revenues of the diocese. He was still chancellor under Cuthbert Tunstall, Wolsey's successor at Durham, but he already enjoyed marked proofs of Wolsey's favour. He received a salaried appointment as counsellor resident with Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond, natural son of Henry VIII; was presented to the prebend of Stillington, Yorkshire, in February 1526, and in the same year became President of Queens' College, Cambridge, an office he held only a year and nine months. His name appears in the commission formed, October 1528, to treat for peace with James V of Scotland, and he had a hand in the negotiations which led to the peace concluded 31 July 1534 at Holyrood. In May 1535 he was one of the council in the north executing the royal commission for assessing and taxing spiritual proceedings. On 17 December 1536 Franklyn was by patent appointed dean of Windsor, and in 1540 he exchanged his Lincolnshire prebend for the rectory of Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, the parsonage attaching to which he afterwards let to John Storie. As dean of Windsor he assisted at the christening of Edward VI and the funeral of Lady Jane Dudley, and his signature is affixed to the decree declaring the invalidity of the marriage of Henry VIII with Anne of Cleves. On 14 January 1545 he surrendered to the crown his hospital of Kepyer and most of his benefices, and he also alienated the revenues of his deanery, some temporarily, others in perpetuity. The complaints against him on this score were so loud that after the accession of Edward VI he was compelled to resign. He retired to Chalfont St. Giles, where he died in January 1556, and was buried in the church. His will met with disapproval, for a grant was made to one J. Glynne of so much as he could recover of goods, chattels, and money, devised by Franklyn for superstitious purposes. A large number of letters addressed by Franklyn to Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, and others were preserved, in the Public Record Office and the British Museum.

Raised near Berkeley, she started hanging around the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory when she was in high school. She enrolled at Berkeley for her first degree, and published her first article, on nuclear fusion, while still an undergraduate. Kaiser writes that she was the only woman in her class; at that time women in America earned only five and two percent of physics undergraduate degrees and PhDs respectively. He writes that she coped with it by wearing tweedy dresses and keeping her hair short, though she experienced some intimidation. She obtained her masters in nuclear physics in 1965.Kaiser 2011, pp. 49‚Äì51. From 1975 to 1978, she was a researcher at the Stanford Research Institute's Radio Physics Laboratory. She married and had a son, and when she became their sole provider took a job as a staff scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. When her son was old enough, she returned to Berkeley to begin her PhD under Glenn Seaborg, the nuclear chemist. She continued by working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and additionally started and chaired the Livermore Philosophy Group, offering classes on the relationship between science and society at Berkeley, and later at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

Fundamental Fysiks Group At Berkeley in May 1975, she and George Weissmann co-founded the Fundamental Fysiks Group, an informal group of physicists who met for Friday afternoon brainstorming sessions to explore the philosophical problems posed by quantum physics, particularly the relationship between physics and consciousness. She named and chaired this group. The group included Fritjof Capra, John Clauser, Nick Herbert, Jack Sarfatti, Henry Stapp, and Fred Alan Wolf. According to Kaiser, Rauscher and Weissman started the meetings in a fit of pique and frustration, saddened by the absence of a philosophical perspective in their physics classes.

Jeffrey John Kripal writes that Rauscher broadened the group to include non-physicists, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s the group's members met annually at the Esalen Institute to continue their exchange of ideas, exerting a major influence on alternative religious thought in the United States.Kripal, Jeffrey John.

Later research Starting in the early 1980s with her husband‚ÄîWilliam van Bise, an engineer‚Äîshe researched the effects of electromagnetic fields on biological systems to enhance health. In the 1990s, Rauscher and van Bise, moved to an estate in Devotion, North Carolina, owned by Richard J. Reynolds III, grandson of R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco magnate. Until his death in 1994, Reynolds allowed them to live there to conduct research into the effects of electromagnetic fields on brain waves. A third scientist, physician Andrija Puharich, had been living and conducting research on the estate since 1980.

Development dates to a British Army request from 1944, but the work was taken over by the Royal Navy as a potential counter to the Kamikaze threat. Development was not complete when the war ended, but the Ministry of Supply funded further development and numerous test launches into 1947, assisting in the development of more advanced successor missiles. Development During World War II a number of efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance. While the Germans developed a number of systems in an attempt to deter Allied bombing,Ford 2000, p.101 the overwhelming air superiority held by the Allies meant that the prospect of developing similar weapons was largely ignored as unnecessary. This changed when the Kamikaze threat spread in the later half of 1944. This led to the British Stooge and Brakemine efforts, and the US Navy's SAM-N-2 Lark.Parsch 2003 The British Army had already ordered early studies on these weapons.Flight 1947, p.345 According to a common account of its development, possibly apocryphal,Taylor 1975, p.45 Fairey was asked to carry out some basic research on these plans by a Royal Navy request, but instead presented a revised design of some depth. The Ministry of Supply (MoS) signed a contract for development of the system in 1944. The ending of the war in August 1945 led to a lower level of urgency, but the MoS continued funding as a development project. Description The Stooge was essentially a small subsonic aircraft with straight wings and a conventional tail layout. The missile looked substantially similar to the V-1, shrunken down and with the engine removed from the top. The missile fuselage was long and in diameter, with a main wingspan of , and a tail span of . Ready for launch, it weighed .Flight 1947, p.344 The rear part of the fuselage was taken up by four air-to- ground \\"Swallow\\" solid fuel rockets. The thrust and burning time could be controlled by varying the size of a venturi nozzle. At the missile reached speeds of ,Flight 1947, p.344-345 but was normally tested at a thrust level of which gave a much slower cruising speed. For launch, four rocket motors (from the RP-3 \\"3-inch\\" rocket weapon) were strapped in pairs to either side of the fuselage, under the horizontal stabilizer. These produced for 1.6 seconds, launching the missile off the long launching rail at an acceleration of 8g. As the booster rockets gave the missile a tail-heavy center of gravity, a cup- shaped counterweight was fitted to the nose. At booster burnout, the missile having reached a speed of over , the boosters and counterweight were ejected and the main rockets fired. Like many early missiles of the era, the Stooge was boosted to the approximate altitude of the attacker and then flown onto an intercept course. Flares located in fairings on the wing tips provided a bright source for the operator to track visually. After launch the missile levelled off and a simple gyroscope-controlled autopilot, located in the forwards portion of the fuselage, kept the Stooge flying in a straight line. Control of first the elevators and then, 3 seconds later, the ailerons were released to the operator - the delay necessary for the gyro control to stabilise first. Using radio control, the operator would fly the missile into a position in front of the target, and then adjust the path in order to collide with the target.

Davis grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and attended Olney High School for his first three years of prep school. He then transferred to Willingboro High School in Willingboro Township, New Jersey for his senior year. When it came time to choose which college to attend, Davis wanted to stay relatively close to home and not \\"get lost in the shuffle\\" of a big time athletics program. He and his friend (and fellow high school teammate) Paul Newman decided to attend whichever NCAA Division I program recruited both of them first, and that ended up being Delaware State. A power forward, Davis became the most statistically accomplished player in program history by the time he graduated in 1991. He scored a then-Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 2,275 points (surpassed in 2019‚Äì20) and also grabbed 1,013 rebounds. The list of those who achieved both 2000 points and 1000 rebounds is a small one. As a sophomore in 1988‚Äì89, Davis was named the MEAC Player of the Year, and he was twice selected to the all-conference team. Davis once scored 47 points in a game against UTEP and had a 29-point, 13-rebound performance against Ohio State. Despite his lauded collegiate career, Davis did not get selected in the 1991 NBA draft, nor was he ever signed by an NBA team.

Although the Spanish language title refers to (fishing) nets, the English language title is The Wave (apparently referring to imagery at the end of the film). Redes was made with a mainly non-professional cast and has been seen as anticipating Italian neorealism. It concerns the struggle of poor fishermen to overcome exploitation. The making of the film Paul Strand began work on the project, which was originally conceived as a documentary, in 1933. He had come to Mexico at the invitation of the Mexican composer Carlos Ch√°vez, who had a government job promoting the arts under the socialist education minister Narciso Bassols.Paul Strand in Mexico by James Krippner, Aperture Foundation, New York, 2010 pp. 69-100 The film developed into a work of fiction with a scenario by Strand and Agust√≠n Ch√°vez, nephew of the composer. Towards the end of 1933, Henwar Rodakiewicz, a friend of Strand's from the Camera Club of New York, arrived to assist in the production. Rodakiewicz determined that the scenario was ragged and incoherent.Letter, Henwar Rodakiewicz to Ned Scott, November 8, 1933:http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/redesfilm/redes-film- letters.html Before returning to the USA for a few months, he wrote a shooting script for the film and made arrangements for his friend, Fred Zinnemann, to travel to Alvarado to take on the role of director.Letter from Henwar Rodakiewicz to Ned Scott, 17 December 1933: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/redesfilm/redes-film-letters.html#l3 Zinnemann did not speak Spanish, while his co-director Emilio G√≥mez Muriel worked directly with the actors. The crew included still photographer Ned Scott. Filming was done on location in Alvarado, and the sound was added later. Strand had left-wing views and was influenced by Eisenstein (whose Battleship Potemkin includes imagery of waves). Zinnemann cited Robert Flaherty as an influence. The production was affected by political developments in 1934. Bassols resigned as minister of education in May and Carlos Ch√°vez was replaced. Work on Redes continued under Ch√°vez' successor, Antonio Castro Leal. However, Strand was warned that funding could not be guaranteed beyond the end of the year, when a new president was due to take office. He left Mexico early in 1935 with the film still unreleased. Film music The Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas, who had not previously written film music, was commissioned to provide the score in 1934. Revueltas was a proteg√© of Carlos Ch√°vez, who had appointed him as assistant conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico: however, the two men fell out around the time of the commission (possibly because Ch√°vez had expected to write the music). Revueltas visited Alvarado during the shooting, and composed quickly. The score is considered a classic of film music. As the music rarely overlaps with dialogue, it has been possible to show the film with live orchestral accompaniment. Redes is one of the few pieces of Mexican film music to have entered the concert repertory. Revueltas made an orchestral suite from the Redes score, which he premiered in 1936. However, in concert performance the music is usually heard in an arrangement by Erich Kleiber, made in the 1940s after the composer's death. Kleiber's version is in two parts and lasts about 16 minutes. The release of the film Despite the problems making the film, it appears to have been more or less finished in 1935. More editing was done before its release in Mexico in 1936. The film was released in France and the USA in 1937. It was restored in 2009 by the World Cinema Foundation. Critical reception The New York Times' film reviewer was dismissive of the quality of the narrative, but acknowledged the merits of the photography and music.Frank S. Nugent (April 21, 1937), The Wave (1937), The New York Times The New York Times also published an article by Aaron Copland praising Revueltas' music. Copland said that for the Mexican Government to choose Revueltas to supply the music for The Wave is very much like the U.S.S.R. asking Shostakovich to supply sound for its best pictures.

The injury occurred when he was engaged with Bills' defensive tackle Marcell Dareus and had his teammate, offensive tackle Marcus Gilbert, accidentally fell on his right leg. It was discovered that he had suffered a torn collateral lateral ligament and a dislocated kneecap. On November 26, DeCastro was returned to the active roster, while Gilbert was placed on injured reserve. On December 9, 2012, he made his professional regular-season debut in a 24‚Äì34 loss at the San Diego Chargers. The next week, he earned his first career start during a Week 15 contest against the Dallas Cowboys. He finished his rookie year starting the last three games of the 2012 NFL season. =2013= With the departure of Willie Colon and Trai Essex, DeCastro entered the season as the Pittsburgh Steelers' de facto starter at right guard. He earned the start for the Steelers' season-opening 16‚Äì9 loss to the Tennessee Titans. During the tenth play of the game, DeCastro accidentally whiffed during a cut block and fell down onto the back of Maurkice Pouncey's right knee. Pouncey tore his ACL and was placed on injured-reserve for the remainder of the season. He was replaced by Guy Whimper during the Steelers' Week 9 matchup with the New England Patriots after suffering an ankle injury. He finished the season starting 15 games and was ranked the fifth best right guard by Pro Football Focus, as the Steelers finished 8‚Äì8 for the second year in a row. =2014= DeCastro returned in 2014 to complete his first full season after starting all 16 games of the regular season as the Pittsburgh Steelers finished 11‚Äì5. On January 3, 2014, he played in his first career postseason game as the Steelers lost in the AFC Wildcard to the Baltimore Ravens. =2015= On April 9, 2015, the Pittsburgh Steelers exercised the fifth-year option on DeCastro's rookie contract, paying him a salary of $8.07 million for 2016. He also received a $3.20 million signing bonus for 2016. In his fourth season with the Steelers in 2015, DeCastro started in all 16 regular-season games and was elected to his first Pro Bowl. Pro Football Focus gave him an overall grade of 83.4 and ranked him the 15th-best offensive guard in 2015. He was ranked the ninth best offensive guard by Sports Illustrated after he surrendered only 1.5 sacks in 590 pass blocking attempts and was flagged for three penalties (all false starts) all season. =2016= On September 8, 2016, the Steelers signed DeCastro to an additional five-year, $50 million extension. The contract includes a signing bonus of $16 million. Together, both extensions bring his present contract to a six-year, $58.07 million deal including a total signing bonus of $16.00 million and signs him throughout 2021. He started all 16 regular season games and brought his consecutive games played streak to 56 in-a-row. The Pittsburgh Steelers finished first in the AFC North after achieving an 11-5 record in 2016. They went on to defeat the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Wildcard, the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional, and lost the AFC Championship to the New England Patriots. The Pittsburgh Steelers offensive line was ranked the third best by Pro Football Focus, with DeCastro being ranked as the Steelers' top run blocker. He was named to his second-straight Pro Bowl for the 2016 season. He was also ranked 97th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017. =2017= On December 19, 2017, DeCastro was named to his third-straight Pro Bowl along with fellow Steeler offensive linemen Alejandro Villanueva and Maurkice Pouncey. He was ranked 44th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.NFL Top 100 Players of 2018 - No. 44 David DeCastro DeCastro started and played in the first 15 games of the season and skipped week 17's game against the Cleveland Browns because the Steelers' had clinched a playoff berth. =2018= In week 1 against the Cleveland Browns, DeCastro fractured his right hand and was forced to miss the next two games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was able to play again in week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens. DeCastro started and played in 14 games during the regular season. On December 18, 2018, DeCastro was selected to play in his fourth straight Pro Bowl. He received an overall grade of 71.7 from Pro Football Focus in 2018, which ranked as the 11th highest grade among all qualifying offensive guards. =2019= David DeCastro in a game against the Cleveland Browns In week 11 against the Cleveland Browns, Browns' defensive end Myles Garrett hit Steelers' quarterback Mason Rudolph on the head with Rudolph's helmet. Afterwards, DeCastro grabbed Garrett, pushed him onto the ground, and laid on top of him to prevent an even larger fight from escalating. After the game, Garrett himself praised DeCastro for his actions. The next day, it was announced that DeCastro would not be suspended for his actions in the brawl. DeCastro started and played in all 16 games during the regular season. On December 17, 2019, DeCastro was selected to play in his fifth straight Pro Bowl.

OutHistory comprises elements of an almanac, archive, article, bibliography, book, encyclopedia, library, and museum. OutHistory.org was produced in its first four years by the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (CLAGS), located at the City University of New York Graduate Center. The site was founded and is co-directed by Jonathan Ned Katz. The site was designed originally by Cidamon, a New York-based web design and development company, using Open-source MediaWiki software. The content of OutHistory.org is provided by volunteers. While the site went live in 2004, the official launch of the current OutHistory.org took place October 21, 2008. Site Producer OutHistory is produced by University of Illinois at Chicago, under the direction of John D'Emilio. The site was previously produced by The Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (CLAGS), under the guidance of its director, James Wilson. CLAGS is an institute at the City University of New York Graduate Center. The site's Director and initiator is Jonathan Ned Katz. The site's Coordinator was Lauren Gutterman. Content This first prototype of OutHistory.org focused on a number of featured Exhibits on LGBTQ history in the United States, and included a variety of other content. The site's founder, Jonathan Ned Katz, dreams \\"that this site will eventually contain the largest, freely accessible, annotated bibliography on the subject of LGBTQ and heterosexual history\\". Contributors The content of this site is collected from authors, curators, editors, researchers, collectors, and both independent and institutionally- based scholars. Inspired by Wikipedia, OutHistory.org also encourages all its users to discuss the site. Collaborations OutHistory has collaborated with other LGBTQH history sites, archives, newspapers, magazines, museum projects, and art galleries, as well as interested researchers. The site collaborates with The Windy City Times and ChicagoGayHistory.org. OutHistory has also partnered with the Arcus Foundation to award recipients of the LGBTQ Local Histories Contest for excellent contributions to OutHistory on local history topics. Governance =Staff= OutHistory has a group of staff, mostly volunteer, overseeing fiscal and support operations. =Board of Advisors At Large= The Advisory Board's primary responsibilities are advising on the site's content, contributing, as time permits, to that content, editing content, and suggesting and encouraging contributors. The board makes macro policy decisions (for example, about what kinds of materials the site should solicit and publish, and about the overall structure of the site). Like editorial boards and boards of directors, the Advisory Board does not make executive decisions about site production, budgeting, staffing, or the day-to- day running of the site. History of OutHistory.org In the 1980s, while working as secretary to the contract director of a major educational publisher, Jonathan Ned Katz first learned to use a computer, and fantasized that this huge, multi-floor office was actually a \\"gay history factory,\\" and that hundreds of people were researching LGBTQ history. In 2003, a friend of Katz's, Barbara Todd Kerr, who worked as a producer at Mediapolis, a website development company, introduced him to Mediapolis founder and director Carl Pritzkat. Katz asked Pritizkat if his company would create, pro bono, a website on LGBTQ history. Prtizkat suggested the name OutHistory.org and began developing the site, to which Katz began to add content. In 2004, while Katz was teaching at Yale University, the first version of OutHistory.org went on line, featuring a detailed, original biography of a Yale major donor, the lawyer John William Sterling and his live-in companion of 40 years, James Bloss. (That biography now appears on the present OutHistory.org.) In 2005, a grant of $5,000 from the Zebra Fund via the Funding Exchange, facilitated by program officer Marcia Gallo through the generosity of the late Joan R. Heller and her partner, Dr. L. Diane Bernard, encouraged Katz to investigate the various commercial and non-commercial ways to go about funding a much more complex site and supporting it over time. The grant also encouraged Katz to formulate an agenda to discuss the development of the site and to call a meeting of interested people. About a dozen people, mostly archivists, met at his house on February 4, 2006. Richard Wandell, founder and director of the National Museum and Archive of Lesbian and Gay History, in New York City, ended the discussion by suggesting that Katz needed to draft a complete vision statement for the website. Katz wrote a vision statement and submitted it to the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies, then directed by Paisely Currah. The CLAGS board voted to support the project for two years if funding for it could be secured. Before the CLAGS board voted, Katz met with Urvashi Vaid, then- director of the Arcus Foundation, discussed the website proposal, and received an encouraging response. Katz drafted a proposal to Arcus and Sara Ganter, then the development director of CLAGS redrafted it and submitted it to Arcus. At the end of 2006, that foundation approved a grant of $50,000 a year for two years (2007-2008) to develop the site. CLAGS hired a first Project CoordinatorIn for the site, James Arnette, and in June 2007 an OutHistory advisors meeting was attended by about twenty women and men. Other advisors agreed to join an email advisory committee. After investigating various website development companies CLAGS hired Cidamon.com to do that work, and the present prototype is the result. After Arnett, Lynley Wheaton was hired as Project Coordinator and in June 2008 Lauren Gutterman took over the position. OutHistory.org officially went on line on October 21, 2008, and was celebrated at a party at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center in New York City. A second OutHistory Advisors' Meeting was held on February 4, 2009, during the annual conference of the American Historical Association, in New York City. Awards and recognition OutHistory was awarded the 2010 Allan Berube Prize in Public History by the Committee on LGBT History of the American Historical Association. Funding =Past Support= In 2005, a grant of $5,000 from the Zebra Fund via the Funding Exchange, through the generosity of the late Joan R. Heller and her partner, Dr. L. Diane Bernard, encouraged Jonathan Ned Katz to investigate how to go about funding and establishing a complex LGBTQ history site and supporting it over the long run. The development of OutHistory.org by CLAGS was funded by a two-year grant (2007-2008: $50,000 a year) from the Arcus Foundation. The Arcus Foundation agreed to support OutHistory's \\"Since Stonewall Local Histories Contest\\" from March 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, with a grant of $55,000. The Mulberry Group, Inc., contributed $1,500 in 2008. A number of individuals have also contributed financially.

Backus and James Freeman Gilbert. It is a regularization method for obtaining meaningful solutions to ill-posed inverse problems. Where other regularization methods, such as the frequently used Tikhonov regularization method, seek to impose smoothness constraints on the solution, Backus‚ÄìGilbert instead seeks to impose stability constraints, so that the solution would vary as little as possible if the input data were resampled multiple times. In practice, and to the extent that is justified by the data, smoothness results from this. Given a data array X, the basic Backus-Gilbert inverse is: :mathbf{H}_theta = frac{mathbf{C}^{-1}mathbf{G}_theta}{mathbf{G}_theta^Tmathbf{C}^{-1}mathbf{G}_theta} where C is the covariance matrix of the data, and GŒ∏ is an a priori constraint representing the source Œ∏ for which a solution is sought. Regularization is implemented by \\"whitening\\" the covariance matrix: :mathbf{C}^{'} = mathbf{C} + lambda mathbf{I} with C‚Ä≤ replacing C in the equation for HŒ∏. Then, :mathbf{H}_theta^Tmathbf{X} is an estimate of the activity of the source Œ∏.

The album has a far more synth-heavy approach than any of his previous albums, though the songs are mostly in the same aggressive rock/pop vein that Capaldi had long been associated with. This synth-heavy pop sound was exactly what 1980s audiences were looking for, and the songs \\"That's Love\\" which broke the top 40 in the USA at number 28, and \\"Living on the Edge\\" at number 75, became hit singles. The album itself reached number 91 on the Billboard 200. Capaldi was not as fond of Fierce Heart as his other works, and as little as five years after its release he was publicly professing that he thought it fell too much into the adult alternative vein.(November 19, 1988). Radio interview with Jim Capaldi , Wolfgang's Vault. The album is dedicated to the memory of Rebop Kwaku Baah, Jim Capaldi's former bandmate in Traffic, who died in January of the year the album was released. Background As with Capaldi's two previous albums, The Sweet Smell of... Success and Let the Thunder Cry, a significant portion of Fierce Heart drew inspiration from his new second home, Brazil. At least three of the songs (\\"Tonight You're Mine\\", \\"Back at My Place\\", and \\"That's Love\\") were mostly composed in Brazil and finished in England, and \\"Don't Let Them Control You\\" is actually a cover of a Brazilian song originally recorded by Sandra Ca, with new lyrics by Capaldi. In addition, the lyrics to \\"Gifts of Unknown Things\\" were inspired by the book of the same name, which in Capaldi's words \\"deals with the mysteries of life in Brazil.\\" The minor hit \\"Living on the Edge\\" was written while on tour in Germany, with a lyric based on the Nagual Don Juan. \\"I'll Always be Your Fool\\" dates back to Capaldi's time with Traffic. He says that the original idea for the song was \\"laid down with rhythm box and piano in 1972.\\" Recording Capaldi and Steve Winwood had maintained a working partnership since Traffic's dissolution; Winwood played on at least one track on all of Capaldi's albums save Electric Nights. With Fierce Heart, Capaldi enlisted his old partner as a major collaborator. Winwood co-produced the album with Capaldi, co-engineered it, played on every track (including solos on four of the tracks), and even arranged three of the songs: \\"Back at my Place\\", \\"Don't Let Them Control You\\", and the hit single \\"Living on the Edge\\". In a press release, Capaldi claimed that Winwood also co-wrote the music to \\"Living on the Edge\\",Capaldi, Jim (1983). Song details, Fierce Heart press kit. though the song is officially credited as solely written by Capaldi.\\"Living on the Edge\\" publication info, ASCAP database. Retrieved August 18, 2011. Fierce Heart was the first solo album by Jim Capaldi on which he played most of the drums himself. It was recorded at five different studios, with some of the songs containing tracks recorded at three different studios. Capaldi used two songs (\\"Runaway\\" and \\"Bad Breaks\\") from the 1982 album Runaway by the Dutch band Solution, for which he wrote most of the lyrics. Most of the tracks were mixed to place emphasis on the synthesizers. Only \\"Runaway\\" was recorded without synthesizers, though \\"I'll Always be Your Fool\\" and \\"Gifts of Unknown Things\\" use them sparingly.

She often created works that studied the human form and light, and many of her works were inspired by events in her life. Cleary studied and received her bachelor's at Washington University, in her hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. She then went to Temple University, where she received her master's degree from the Tyler School of Art. Shortly after, Cleary moved to Washington D.C in 1970 where she would work at the University of the District of Columbia as a professor for thirty years. Cleary also used her role as professor to support local artists. Cleary's style of art is highly realistic (it is said that she would often win awards for her work in the photography category by mistake) and unique. To create many of her images, she worked in a reductive fashion by using graphite powder, tissues, and erasers. This style allowed her to create works that were softer and more personal, but still realistic. Cleary passed away in 2011 at the age of 69. She suffered for many years from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was survived by her husband, F. Steven Kijek and her twin sister, Shirley Cleary-Cooper. Her work is held by many museums all over the country, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Brooklyn Museum. She has held numerous solo exhibitions and been a part of many exhibitions worldwide. Her work is represented by Addison/Ripley Fine Art Gallery in Washington, DC.  Biography  Manon Cleary was born on November 14, 1942 in St. Louis, Missouri with her identical twin sister, Shirley Cleary-Cooper. Cleary and her twin were very similar growing up and Cleary stated in an interview that they were even dressed alike by their mother until adulthood. Cleary's father was a doctor and it was because of this that she and her sister drew an affinity towards art. Her father was a general practitioner in St. Louis, and thus brought home almost every disease and epidemic that hit the city. This meant that Cleary and her sister were at home sick for a lot of their childhood, away from other children. It was during this time at home that they both turned to art. They fed this love of art by associating with the art museum and majoring in art in high school. Cleary went to undergraduate school at Washington University in St. Louis and received her degree in 1964. Cleary's education there was very mechanical and traditional, as she was only taught about technique, not content. Cleary struggled at first with the teaching style and she was one of the few artists drawing figures regularly. Cleary took to drawing highly erotic images; the images gave her confidence and left her professors struggling to critique. After graduating Cleary applied late to graduate programs and happened upon an opportunity to spend her first year of graduate school in Rome, for the Tyler School of Art. While in Rome, Cleary studied the work of Caravaggio and was remained inspired by his work for much of her career. After a year in Rome, Cleary finished her graduate studies and received her MFA in 1968, at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cleary moved to upstate New York, where she briefly taught at a state university in Oswego. The experience there was not one to remember, so she moved to Washington, D.C. in 1970, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Cleary taught at the University of the District of Columbia for 30 years. She was beloved by her students and by many of the local artists in Washington, D.C. She was a collector of local art and supporter of local artists. After a couple years in Washington, D.C., she moved into Beverly Court Apartments‚Äînow Beverly Court Cooperative. It was the epicenter of art in the 1970s for Washington, D.C. and Cleary was the star. Beverly Court housed artists such as Allan Bridge, Yuri Schwebler, Jonathan Meader, and Angelo Hodick. Cleary would host dinner parties for the building and a communal living of sorts took place. The doors to apartments were often open and artists collaborated on art together. Beverly Court was bought by its residents in 1979, after most of the artists had left, and it became the first cooperative in Washington, D.C. It was during this time, in 1981, that Cleary was briefly married to a man named Tommy, who was an young art student from Denmark. They were divorced about a year later. In 1996, Cleary experience a traumatic event while traveling abroad. Cleary visited Kazakhstan that year on a good-will art trip and was there to lecture about art. Cleary was attacked by a Kazakh artist, with whom she had only a brief meeting. The attack shook Cleary and she left the country quickly in a state of denial. It took Cleary several months to start to examine her feelings and work through them. She ended up creating an evocative series titled, \\"The Rape Series\\" after the event. The series features paintings of Cleary's face, shaped in horror and pain, with red paint splatterd over the canvas. The paintings are the most physical of Cleary's portfolio, with some of the canvases burned or slashed. Cleary's attacker was invited to Washington, D.C. for a show on Kazakhstan art in 1998, but was luckily denied entry into the United States. The news was hard to take for Cleary, but she believes because of an affidavit she signed with the State Department upon returning from Kazakhstan, he was turned away. Cleary met her second husband, F. Steven Kijek, a dancer, in Baltimore at a party after a gallery opening. When they met, he supposedly stripped naked in the middle of a crowd and asked if she would like to paint him; they were married in 2001. Cleary was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 1999 and was experiencing pulmonary failure. This was brought on by a smoking habit and inhaling toxic fumes from her paint. Her doctor gave her just two years to live in 2001. The disease forced Cleary to retire and her weight dropped to just 80 pounds. She would need to use an oxygen tank and breathing tube for the remainder of her life. Even with all of these challenges, Cleary still found a way to create new art; she created a series titled \\"Breathless\\" that featured her face, with breathing tubes, pressed up against the glass of a copy machine. Cleary passed away in 2011, shortly after her 69th birthday. She died her apartment at Beverly Court, where she had lived for 40 years.  Work  Cleary mastered many different mediums throughout her career. She is most known for her paintings and her drawings. Cleary also went through some notable phases with her subject matter, but her figures are what set her apart from other artists. = Style = Cleary is known for her photo-realism; The Washington Post called her the best figure painter of her generation. Cleary's style developed during her undergraduate days. Her watercolor professor taught her how to mix graphite powder and alcohol to create a more painterly style of drawing. Cleary didn't like the painterly style, and said the graphite tended to \\"chalk up.\\" When she went back to drawing a few years later, it was leftover graphite from that period she turned to, not charcoal. Cleary was drawn to the glow that only graphite can provide. This time though, Cleary developed her own style. Cleary worked in a reductive, layered fashion, covering the whole paper in graphite and then using erasers to flesh out the image. This allowed the image to come into focus slowly, as then Cleary would layer the graphite with the aid of tissues and blending stomps. Cleary created her images from multiple photos, taken from different angles, a habit she developed during college when models weren't readily available. This is partly why she is identified as a photo- realist. This process was a challenge for Cleary, as there was no precedent or guide to help her with her style. There was a lot of trial and error to figure out not only what erasers worked best, but also how much stress the paper could take. Cleary developed this style out of a fear of white paper; she also found it easier to cover a mistake by working this way, as it was easier to add more graphite instead of erase a line. By working in this reductive fashion, Cleary created an image that was original and unique. Without the harsh pencil lines, her drawings had a softness and ethereal quality. While her work is considered photo-realism, it stands out from other artists of the time. Cleary's mastery of drawing flowed over into other mediums as well, such as pastels. Cleary was also known as a painter. Cleary was drawn to the wide range of colors that were available in painting compared to the rather limited number of colors available in pastels. Her painting style has been described as \\"not painterly.\\" This is because Cleary tries to hide her brush strokes and remove any evidence of her technique. = Themes and subjects = Cleary was best known for her nude figure drawings and her most common subject was herself. Cleary was considered by many to be the best figure painter in Washington, D.C. and maybe in the country. Early in her career Cleary painted idealized images of her subjects, including herself. Cleary acknowledged in her mid-thirties that she hadn't accepted her aging and was removing blemishes from her paintings. Cleary explained that she doesn't \\"paint the grotesque\\" and that is why she paints the ideal. As her career and portfolio developed, Cleary's nudes would become more honest and frank. Her self-portraits would become a study of aging and reflect Cleary more openly. If nudes were Cleary's most common subject, her most beloved subject would be rats. Cleary was given a rat as a gift in the 1970s and from that point on they became a recurring subject for her (she would also keep rats as pets for the rest of her life). The rats were often drawn in pastels, and Cleary had truly mastered their likeness. In one memorable piece Untitled, Cleary painted two life-size rats (green and soft pink) serving her as she reclined nude on a divan, smoking. Another theme that is very apparent in Cleary's work is sexuality. Cleary had been studying nudes since college and she found a subject that captivated her. Her exploration of sexuality has varied over her career. In some of her art it is frank and bold, like her series of large oil paintings from the early 1990s that studied male genitalia. (In 1997, one of her paintings at an erotic art auction was featured on an episode of HBO's Real Sex.) Other studies of sexuality are more subtle and abstract. Cleary painted many flowers that were said to be in the vein of Georgia O'Keeffe. Cleary's open exploration of sexuality creates a distraction for the viewer. The more flagrant the sexuality, the more Cleary conceals herself in her work.

It stars Hugh Dancy and Maggie Gyllenhaal, with Felicity Jones, Jonathan Pryce, and Rupert Everett appearing in key supporting roles. The film, set in the Victorian era, shows how the medical management of hysteria led to the invention of the vibrator. Plot Set at the end of 1880, the film depicts the invention of the vibrator. Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) is a young physician who has difficulty with his occupation due to constant arguments over modern medicine. He gets a job assisting Dr. Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce), whose practice specializes in the treatment of \\"hysteria\\", a popular diagnosis for women of that time. Medical practitioners like Dr. Dalrymple tried to manage hysteria by massaging the genital area, decently covered under a curtain, to elicit \\"paroxysmal convulsions\\", without recognizing that they were inducing orgasms. Granville meets Dr. Dalrymple's daughters, Emily (Felicity Jones), and her older sister Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a premodern feminist who runs a settlement house in a poor section of London. Granville seems to be good at massaging, getting a sizeable following, while at the same time Dr. Dalrymple suggests he might eventually take over the business and marry Emily. One night after work, Charlotte comes in with her friend Fannie (Ashley Jensen), who has broken her ankle. After he helps treat her, Dalrymple forbids Granville from offering any future assistance to Charlotte, hoping to dissuade her from her work in the slums. Meanwhile, the increased clientele at the practice is hard on Granville, and his hand musculature is unable to keep up with the task; an attack of cramp results in his dismissal. Fortunately, his friend, Lord Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett), has developed an electrical feather duster, and its vibrations give Dr. Granville the idea of modifying the gadget for use as an electric massager. After successfully using it on the Dalrymple's maid Molly (Sheridan Smith), he persuades Dr. Dalrymple to try the device on his patients, resulting in massive success. Mortimer and Emily then become engaged, while Charlotte struggles with supporting the welfare house. At the engagement party, Charlotte is arrested while protecting Fannie from a police officer. Emily and Dr. Dalrymple urge Granville to testify at her trial that she is hysterical in order to prevent her from being sent to prison. During the trial, the prosecutor recommends that Charlotte be sent to a sanatorium and be forced to undergo a hysterectomy. As Mortimer speaks, he explains that the symptoms for hysteria are too common to be regarded as a mental illness, and that he himself believes that Charlotte is the most generous and caring person he knows. The judge agrees with Mortimer's argument, and Charlotte is sentenced to just thirty days in prison for her assault on the policeman. Emily decides to end her engagement to Granville, after realising her only motive was to please her father. The vibrator now enters the stage as a medical device for the treatment of the condition, reducing treatment time while greatly increasing customer satisfaction. The royalties from its sale result in independent wealth for Granville, who has fallen in love with Charlotte. Pledging to use some of his wealth to establish a clinic at her settlement house, he proposes marriage to Charlotte and she accepts.

In 2010, however, Maine‚Äôs thesis was rebutted by Helen King, and a 2018 paper by Hallie Lieberman and Eric Schatzberg dismisses this idea as false, with no more than \\"circumstantial evidence that a few physicians and midwives may have practiced genital massage before the 20th century\\". Hysteria was a recognized malady until the American Psychiatric Association discontinued this term in 1952. Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville filed the first patent for an electromechanical vibrator termed Granville's Hammer in about 1883. Granville, however, did not apply his invention in the treatment of hysteria; rather, he used it to treat muscular disorders. Some believe that other physicians started to apply the vibrator for the treatment of hysteria, but this claim is under dispute, with Lieberman and Schatzberg writing that Maines \\"fails to cite a single source that openly describes use of the vibrator to massage the clitoral area\\". Reception The film received mixed reviews, garnering a score of 53 out of 100 (based on 33 reviews) at Metacritic. Rotten Tomatoes reported a score of 58% based on 118 reviews and a consensus of \\"Hysteria has an amusing subject but its winking, vaguely sarcastic tone doesn't do the movie any favors.\\" References External links  * 2011 films Biographical films about physicians British films British romantic comedy films English-language films Films directed by Tanya Wexler Films set in the Victorian era Films set in London ","title":"Hysteria (2011 film)"},{"id":"32781985","text":"The Hoodoo Mountains are a mountain range in the northwest United States, in north central Idaho.

A 1932 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, McCormack also studied at Hertford College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned a Master of Science degree in civil engineering. In 1942, he was assigned to the War Department General Staff. On 1 July 1944, he became the Chief of the Movements Branch of Twelfth United States Army Group, remaining in this role until 28 May 1945. He then returned to the War Department General Staff, where he served in the Operations and Plans Division. In 1947 McCormack was chosen as the Director of Military Applications of the United States Atomic Energy Commission with the rank of brigadier general. He took a pragmatic approach to handling the issue of the proper agency to hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile, and encouraged and supported Edward Teller's development of thermonuclear weapons. He transferred to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950, and was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1952. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. After retiring from the Air Force in 1955, McCormack became the first head of the Institute for Defense Analysis, a non- profit research organization created to provide advice and support to the Department of Defense's scientific and technological research efforts formed by ten universities. In 1958 he became vice president for industrial and governmental relations at MIT, in which capacity he originated the proposal that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics be used as the basis for a new space agency, which eventually became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He was Chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and from 1965 to 1970 was chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation. Early life and career James McCormack, Jr., was born in Chatham, Louisiana, on 8 November 1910. He attended the Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia, before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point on 2 July 1928. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers on graduation on 14 August 1932, ranking 19th in his class. He departed for England where he studied at Hertford College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He was promoted to first lieutenant in August 1935, and awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree from Oxford. On returning to the United States, he was posted to the 8th Engineers at Fort McIntosh, Texas, as a troop commander. In June 1936 he became a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated with a Master of Science degree in civil engineering in August 1937. He then became a student officer at the Engineering School at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In June 1938, he reported to Vicksburg, Mississippi, as Assistant Project Engineer on the Sardis Reservoir Project. World War II McCormack reported to Fort Benning, Georgia, as a company commander in the 21st Engineers in October 1939. He was promoted to captain on 9 September 1940, and after serving as adjutant of the 20th Engineers at Fort Benning, he temporarily commanded one of the regiment's battalions before assuming command of the 76th Engineer Company at Fort McClellan, Alabama, in mid-1941. Later that year he attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College, after which he was promoted to major on 1 February 1942, and posted to the War Department General Staff. He was Assistant Chief of the Types and Allowances Branch of G-4 from March 1942 to March 1943, with a promotion to lieutenant colonel on 9 October 1942, and then Chief of the Construction Branch of G-4 from March 1943 to September 1943. In October 1943, McCormack became Chief of the Transportation Branch of the First United States Army Group, and was promoted to colonel on 1 December 1943. On 1 July 1944, he became the Chief of the Movements Branch of Twelfth United States Army Group, remaining in this role until 28 May 1945. For his services in the European Theater of Operations, he was awarded the Legion of Merit on 30 December 1944, and the Bronze Star Medal in May 1945. The British government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 24 March 1945, while the French government awarded him the Croix de guerre with the silver star on 29 January 1945, and made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor on 3 October 1945. On 4 June 1945, McCormack returned to duty with the War Department General Staff as a member of the Policy Section of the Strategy and Policy Group, becoming the assistant section chief on 16 September 1945. He was then a staff officer with the Strategy and Policy Group from 16 February until 16 August 1946, when he became chief of the Politico-Military Survey Section of the Operations and Plans Division. For his service with the War Department General Staff, he was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Legion of Merit on 8 April 1947. Cold War Inscription from former AEC Chairman alt=A handwritten note that says: \\"Dear Jim, as a reminder of our tour of duty with the atom. With respect and warm greetings, David E. Lilienthal\\" At this point, McCormack had become apprehensive about his career, but in early 1947 a new and exciting opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee research and development of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Act had created a statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation. By law, the Director of Military Applications had to be a serving armed forces officer. The frontrunner for the post was the wartime commander of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; and he had a strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate. The AEC commissioners asked for Major General Lauris Norstad, the head of the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then selected McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove to make the best of it, working within the existing framework. McCormack became involved in discussions with Edward Teller over the possibility of developing thermonuclear weapons, then known as the \\"Super\\". McCormack became an early advocate of the Super, which promised yields in the megaton range, and directed Norris Bradbury at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to proceed with its development even at the detriment of other weapons. The debate over the merits of the Super pitted the United States Air Force against the other services, which wanted more small, tactical weapons. Concurrently, there was a technical debate between Teller and other scientists like Robert Oppenheimer over the feasibility of the Super, because there was no guarantee that it would work, and even after Operation Greenhouse, the processes involved in thermonuclear reactions were not fully understood. It ultimately became apparent that the Super design would not work, but the development of the Teller-Ulam design provided a new path to high yield thermonuclear weapons. For his services as Director of Military Applications, McCormack was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. Later life McCormack transferred to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like other witnesses, McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while the two men had disagreed over the merits of the Super, that he saw nothing dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it. McCormack retired from the Air Force in 1955, and became the first head of the Institute for Defense Analysis, a non-profit research organization to provide advice and support to the Department of Defense's scientific and technological research efforts formed by ten universities. In 1958 he became vice president for industrial and governmental relations at MIT. He originated the proposal that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics be used as the basis for a new space agency, which eventually became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In 1964, the Governor of Massachusetts, Endicott Peabody, appointed McCormack as Chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In October 1965, he was appointed chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), with a $125,000 salary. To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources to carry out the policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director. McCormack died at his winter home in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, on 3 January 1975, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The Dutch Creek Hoodoos are within a 67-acre conservation area that is managed by the Natural Conservancy of British Columbia. This conservation area is joined by the Nature Trust Hoffert Property and they both act as a habitat for varying plants and animals including the American badger, Lewis's woodpecker, the Hooker's Townsendia, Eagle, and Hawk. The Dutch Creek Hoodoos can be further discovered by following the 4.6 mile trail that faces an elevation gain of 95 meters over the course of the trail. Formation The Dutch Creek Hoodoos are formed just like all other Hoodoos form. Over time as the ground shifts and moves cracks form that causes pockets to form. When rain begins to fall it is easily caught in the cracks and can often settle within those pockets. As temperatures drop the water freezes and expands the pockets often causing larger portions of rock to break off. This process is referred to as Ice Wedging and the repeating of this process causes the formation of a Fin. When ice wedging occurs within the fin a Window can form and when a window can no longer support the weight it breaks and leaves behind what we now call a Hoodoo. History The Ktunaxa Nation is made up of the Kootenai tribe that is made up of people from Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia Canada. Throughout history, the Ktunaxa nation has told their Creation story that depicts how the Ktunaxa nations boundaries and lakes was formed. At the roots of the Ktunaxa nation you'd find an ancestral world full of animals because humans had not yet been created. During those ancestral times the ancient sea monster Yawunik was known to kill a number of animals so a council head up by the Chief animal Nalmuqcin was formed to defeat Yawunik. The council combined the Kootenay River and Columbia River systems to trap Yawunik within the Columbia Lake and chased him throughout the river system. Over the course of this chase Yawunik gave name to many well known locations near the rivers and lakes of Canada. As the chase continued so did the naming of locations along the way. After failing to capture Yawunik multiple times Nalmuqcin sat along the river and had a conversation with Kikum. Kikum was a wise old one who suggested that Nalmuqcin use his size and strength to block the flow of the river into the lake and successfully trap Yawunik within. When they implemented the plan, the council was able to trap Yawunik and send in Yamakpal to deliver the final blow and drag his remains ashore. The bones of Yawunik were scattered around and the ribs were what we now refer to as the Dutch Creek Hoodoos. The different colored remains were scattered around the new nation and the different colors represented the different races of people that would congregate within that area including white, black, yellow, and red. The story comes to an end as Malnuqcin stands up overjoyed at the councils recent accomplishments and hits his head on the ceiling of the sky successfully knocking himself dead. The varying portions of his very large body are said to be strewn throughout many well known locations such as Yellowhead Pass, Yellowstone Park, and the Rocky Mountains.

CFSC is guided by a vision of a world in which peace and justice prevail, where the causes of war and oppression are removed, a world in which the whole of Creation is treated with respect and where individuals and communities are freed to reach their fullest potential. Quaker service work is rooted in the daily practice of pacifism, integrity, truthfulness, equality, community, simplicity and, above all, love both in the objectives of its work and in the discernment with which it plans and delivers its work.CFSC Policy, Organization and Procedure Manual (March 2011) Since 1931, the Canadian Friends Service Committee (CFSC) has been addressing the underlying conditions of conflict by bringing transformative approaches to human rights, justice, and peace. CFSC cultivates a culture of peacebuilding, the realization of Indigenous Peoples' human rights, and the use of less punitive and more restorative approaches in criminal justice systems. CFSC believes that there is that of God in every person, which inspires transformative, practical expressions of love and care for all Creation including the alleviation of suffering, the promotion of justice and peace, and provision of education and research on these concerns. History Canadian Friends Service Committee (CFSC) was founded in 1931 when members of the Religious Society of Friends or \\"Quakers\\" wanted a vehicle to act upon their peace and social justice concerns. That year, Fred Haslam \\"was instrumental in the organization of the CFSC, and, as its executive secretary for the next twenty-five years, he was personally responsible for the day-to-day direction of its activities, especially those concerning world peace and the abolition of capital punishment\\". Since its founding, CFSC has worked on many projects related to peace and justice. In 1947, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) received the Nobel Peace Prize for its service work during World War II.Nobel Prize Laureates: Peace (1947) All of the Service Committees work is honoured by the Prize and the ethics that garnered it continue to inform CFSC's work today. Between 1959 and 1963, during the Vietnam War, CFSC sent medical aid to Vietnam to be used by victims on all sides of the conflict in accordance with Quaker's tradition of relief work that cuts across the boundaries of war and conflict. Many American Quaker's knowingly contravened U.S. law by contributing to this work through CFSC. In 1976, CFSC and Canadian Quaker's worked with partners to secure the abolition of the death penalty. Since 2003, CFSC has been helping American soldiers and their families who refused to participate in the Iraq War and came to Canada seeking refuge. In 2014, CFSC was one of two non-Indigenous organizations asked to intervene in the Supreme Court in the Tsilhqot'in Nation land rights case, it encouraged the Court to adopt an approach to Indigenous land rights that would be consistent with international human rights standards, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Court later unanimously recognized the Tsilhqot'in peoples right to control their traditional territory. For 80 years, the concerns, witness and projects of CFSC have been challenging and enriching, and have contributed to a more peaceful and sustainable world. Because Quakers recognize that a concern is \\"that leading of the Holy Spirit which may not be denied\\", CFSC has supported service projects, peace witness, education, and public policy engagement. CFSC's work is not solely philanthropic or humanitarian, but expresses a spiritually-based approach to the life of our times. Program Committees *Quaker Indigenous Rights Committee (QIRC)CFSC: Indigenous Peoples' Rights Friends have traditionally had a concern for the rights of Indigenous Peoples. In 1974 individual Quakers (Friends) were led to go to Kenora in Northern Ontario to attempt reconciliation in a confrontation over mercury contamination of the waterways. Friends with skills in pathology and medicine assisted the Indigenous community, whose people were suffering from mercury poisoning, by helping to document the problem and to provide medical treatment. The Quaker Committee on Native Concerns (now Quaker Indigenous Rights Committee) was born out of this work and other concerns, especially amongst Friends in western Canada. Since then the Committee has supported Indigenous community building initiatives, and urged governments to live up to their legal commitments to Indigenous peoples including Esgenoopetitj (Burnt Church) in New Brunswick, Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba and the Lubicon in northern Alberta. Since the mid-1990s, QIRC has worked with others at the United Nations towards the development and recognition of an international instrument specifically addressing the rights of Indigenous Rights through the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. CFSC is one of the founding members of the Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This group of Indigenous and Non-Indigenous partners work together to inform and educate Canadian people and politicians on work related to the UN Declaration. *Quakers Fostering Justice (QFJ)CFSC: Justice In 1972, CFSC established the Quaker Committee on Jails and Justice (now called Quakers Fostering Justice, QFJ) which has worked to encourage prison visiting, sought alternatives to prisons, and fostered awareness of the roots of crime and violence in society. QFJ promotes restorative justice and has supported the Alternatives to Violence Project. In 1981, Canadian Yearly Meeting (Canadian Quakers) minuted: \\"Prison abolition is both a process and a long-term goal. In the interim there is a great need for Friends to reach out and to support all those affected: guards, prisoners, victims, and families. We recognize a need for restraint of those few who are exhibiting dangerous behaviour. The kind of restraint used and the help offered during that time must reflect our concern for that of God in every person.\\" *Quaker Peace Committee (QPC)CFSC: Peace Quaker Peace Committee (QPC), formerly Quaker Peace and Sustainable Communities Committee (QPASCC), exists to put into practice the Quaker Testimonies through projects, education, and public witness designed to alleviate suffering and poverty, promote justice, sustainable livelihoods and peace. The work of QPC is guided by the Quaker Testimonies of Peace, Simplicity, Community, Equality and Integrity. QPC works in partnership with communities, both domestically and internationally. QPAC's work is rooted in mutual learning, which is the traditional Quaker practice of encouraging exchange, cooperation, education, and relationship amongst partners and participants in projects, overseas or in Canada. Lessons learned through our grassroots experience inform policy and education work in Canada. Generally speaking, projects are designed to have long-term results and develop self-reliance, as well as to respond to practical needs. Using Quaker practice and in worshipful discernment, QPC provides concrete assistance and engages in policy dialogue towards peaceful, sustainable communities worldwide. QPC's work and experience is shared with Quakers and other people through education and partnership-building. In this way, QPC hopes to contribute to the social transformation necessary to achieve their goal that one day all people might be free from suffering, persecution and repression, and instead enjoy their rights to dignity, sustainable livelihoods, social inclusion and expression.

They were widely used in rapidly expanding industrial cities such as Manchester in England, but were difficult to empty and clean. A typical comment was that they were of \\"most objectionable construction\\" and \\"usually wet and very foul\\". They were replaced eventually by pail closets and flush toilets. Similar systems still exist in some developing countries, but the term \\"privy midden\\" is now an archaism. Development and improvement Diagram of an improved midden closet in Nottingham The midden closet was a development of the privy, which had evolved from the primitive \\"fosse\\" ditch. The early version was essentially an outhouse for public use, located over a hole in the ground at a public dump. In a speech given to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1876 a Mr Redgrave described the midden closet as representing \\"the standard of all that is utterly wrong, constructed as it is of porous materials, and permitting free soakage of filth into the surrounding soil, capable of containing the entire dejections from a house, or from a block of houses, for months and even years\\". Later improvements, such as a midden closet built in Nottingham, used a brick-raised seat above a concave receptacle to direct excreta toward the centre of the pit‚Äîwhich was lined with cement to prevent leakage into the surrounding soil. This closet was also designed with a special opening through which deodorising material could be scattered over the top of the pit. A ventilation shaft was also installed. The design offered a significant improvement over the less advanced midden-privy, but the problems of emptying and cleaning such pits remained and thus the pail system, with its easily removable container, became more popular. Problems with middens By 1869 Manchester had a population of about 354,000 people served by about 38,000 middensteads and 10,000 water closets. An investigation of the condition of the city's sewer network revealed that it was \\"choked up with an accumulation of solid filth, caused by overflow from the middens\\". Such problems forced the city authorities to consider other methods of human waste disposal. The water closet was used in wealthy homes, but concerns over river pollution, costs and available water supplies meant that most towns and cities chose more labour-intensive dry conservancy systems. Manchester was one such city and by 1877 its authorities had replaced about 40,000 middens with pail and midden closets, rising to 60,000 by 1881. The soil surrounding the old middens was cleared out, connections with drains and sewers removed and dry closets erected over each site. A contemporary estimate stated that the installation of about 25,000 pail closets removed as much as of urine and accompanying faeces from the city's drains, sewers and rivers. The 1868 Rivers Pollution Commission reported two years later: \\"privies and ashpits are continually to be seen full to overflowing and as filthy as can be ... These middens are cleaned out whenever notice is given that they need it, probably once half-yearly on an average, by a staff of nightmen with their attendant carts.\\" (See Night soil.)

In real life actor Power would die of a heart attack in 1931 in the arms of his own son Tyrone Power, the later film star.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Fury Plot As described in a film magazine, Boy Leyton (Barthelmess) is second mate on board the Lady Spray, the ship on which his father is Captain Leyton (Power). Boy is often chided by his father for his effeminacy and more often beaten. While in port Boy proposes to Minnie (Gish) and suggests that she go to Glasgow to meet him there to be married. The ship sails and the Captain learns of his son's intention to marry. He calls him in and tells him about his mother, who deserted him, and tries to turn him away from all women, but Boy refuses to listen. The Captain is suddenly taken ill, but before he dies he makes Boy promise that he will not marry until he has found the man who wronged his mother. The Captain is buried at sea and the ship continues on its course. Upon reaching Glasgow Boy tells Minnie what happened. While at the bar, he meets an old woman who comes in begging. During the conversation he discovers that she is his mother, and he forces her to tell him who her betrayer was. Boy learns that it was the first mate from his father's ship who is now its captain. He finds the man and, though greatly outweighed, he finally succeeds in knocking him down. The stunned man falls from the ship into the sea and disappears.

After starting her career in animation, Pichelli entered the comic book industry working for IDW Publishing before joining Marvel Comics in 2008 after getting discovered in an international talent search. After having worked on several Marvel titles, such as Namora, Pichelli was hired as the main artist on the second volume of Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which premiered in September 2011. Pichelli won a 2011 Eagle Award for Favorite Newcomer Artist. Career Pichelli sketching at the New York Comic Con Pichelli was born in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Italy. She began her career in animation, working as a storyboard artist, animator and character designer. She said of this work, \\"It wasn't really for me. I felt like a tiny cog in a machine.\\" She started working in the comic book industry after meeting comics artist David Messina. Prior to that, she was not particularly interested in comics and preferred animated films and anime. She worked as a layout assistant for Messina and worked on such titles as the Star Trek comic book series produced by IDW Publishing, including such editions as Star Trek: Countdown and Star Trek: Nero. In 2008 she submitted her work to the Chesterquest international talent search and was named one of the finalists by Marvel Comics editor C. B. Cebulski, which led to her working for Marvel. She illustrates for Marvel from her home in Rome. Pichelli started working for Marvel Comics in 2008 with the limited series NYX: No Way Home, followed by a brief run on Runaways with writer Kathryn Immonen in 2009. She worked with Immonen again on the X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back limited series, released in December 2009, which focused on the X-Men character Pixie. Pichelli provided art for one storyline in the I Am An Avenger anthology series, which ran from 2010 to 2011, then joined the team working on Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man starting with the October 2010 issue #15. After that series ended, Pichelli contributed to the 2011 limited series Ultimate Fallout, where she illustrated the first image of the Spider-Man character as portrayed by Miles Morales in the Ultimate Marvel universe. Pichelli took on regular art duties on the relaunched Ultimate Comics: Spider- Man with Morales as the protagonist, starting in September 2011. In August 2018, Pichelli and writer Dan Slott launched a new Fantastic Four series. Technique and materials Pichelli uses a Cintiq 12wx graphic tablet. When illustrating Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, she added more screentones to her illustrations to give what she called \\"a more 'pop' feeling to the book\\", as she believed it would be more fitting to that series. In creating the visual look of characters, Pichelli approaches the design by giving thought to the character's personalities, including the background that may have influenced them, and the distinctive traits that the characters exhibit, such as the clothing they wear, their body language and expressions. She followed this approach when creating Miles Morales. Reception Pichelli won a 2011 Eagle Award for Favorite Newcomer Artist, over fellow nominees Rafael Albuquerque, Fiona Staples, Sean Murphy and Bryan Lee O'Malley. Marvel Comics senior editor Mark Paniccia said of Pichelli: \\"Every time I see new pages from Sara she continues to grow as an artist. She's amazing now and I can't imagine where she'll be a year from now.\\" Marvel Comics editor Tom Brevoort called her \\"a real breakout talent\\" and \\"a top talent primed to explode in a major way\\". David Brothers of ComicsAlliance praised her attention to detail and said he particularly likes the way Pichelli draws hair, facial expressions and body language: \\"The first two add a lot to the atmosphere of the comics she draws, and the third cranks her storytelling up to another level.\\" IGN writer Jesse Schedeen called Pichelli's art in Ultimate Fallout \\"energetic, cinematic, and just flamboyant enough to offer a change of pace from the rest of the Ultimate Fallout stories\\". Personal life Pichelli lives in Rome, Italy.

It is used on public transport services within the Buenos Aires metropolitan area and other Argentine cities and was promoted by the Argentine Secretary of Transportation. It is valid on a number of different travel systems across the city including the Underground, buses and trains. One of the benefits of this change is that it has helped speed passengers on to the bus. People no longer had to wait to be issued a printed receipt as they each enter the bus. Environmentally this should help reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen because buses don't have to idle as long while passengers load, helping improve air quality in the city. The electronic ticket is eliminating the printed receipts thus lowering the amount of littering in the city. The city, in turn, no longer have to process, collect, count, and transport coinage received in payment of some 11 million trips per day.Clar√≠n: Volvieron las monedas a la calle (8/15/2009) Background Buenos Aires was affected for several years by an acute coin shortage that impacted the economy, banking, and transportation.

A robust example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, it was a gift to the city from industrialist Benjamin H. Warder, and served as the main branch of the Clark County Public Library from 1890 to 1989. It now houses the Clark County (Warder) Literacy Center. History Warder (1824‚Äì1894) was president of Warder, Bushnell & Glessner Company (established 1879), headquartered in Springfield, manufacturers of Champion harvesters and farm machinery. In 1902, Warder's company merged with four others -- McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Deering Harvester Company, Milwaukee Harvester Company, Plano Manufacturing Company -- to form International Harvester. Warder and his business partners, Asa S. Bushnell and John J. Glessner, each hired Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson to design a house: the Warder Mansion in Washington, DC. (1885‚Äì88); the Bushnell Mansion in Springfield, Ohio (1885‚Äì88);Bushnell Mansion and the John J. Glessner House in Chicago, Illinois (1885‚Äì87). Richardson died in 1886, but architects in his office completed the houses and formed a successor firm: Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. Warder hired them to design the library. The L-shaped building is located at the southwest corner of High Street and Spring Avenue. It is constructed of Ohio buff sandstone trimmed with Worcester brownstone, under a red slate roof. The east wing features an arcaded entrance porch; at the juncture of the wings is a tower that contains the staircase. The main reading room features a massive stone fireplace, 18 feet tall and 12 1/2 feet wide.Warder Public Library in Springfield, Ohio from Ohio Memory.

Varespladib methyl is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the molecule varespladib. From 2006 to 2012, varespladib methyl was under active investigation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as a potential therapy for several inflammatory diseases, including acute coronary syndrome. In March 2012, Anthera halted further investigation of varespladib per a recommendation from an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Varespladib and varespladib methyl were characterised as effective molecules in neutralization of snakes venoms and are under experimental evaluation. Mechanism = Prodrug activation = Varespladib methyl, in contrast to varespladib, is orally bioavailable and after absorption from the GI tract, it undergoes rapid ester hydrolysis to the active molecule ‚Äì varespladib. = sPLA2 inhbition = Increased levels of sPLA2 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular disease, and may lead to both acute and chronic disease manifestations by promoting vascular inflammation. Plasma levels of sPLA2 can predict coronary events in patients who recently suffered an ACS as well as in those with stable coronary artery disease. Furthermore, sPLA2 remodels lipoproteins, notably low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and their receptors, which are responsible for removing cholesterol from the body. This remodeling can lead to increased deposition of LDL and cholesterol in the artery wall. In combination with chronic vascular inflammation, these deposits lead to atherosclerosis. Varespladib inhibits the IIA, V and X isoforms of sPLA2 to reduce inflammation, lower and modulate lipid levels, and reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), both indicators of inflammation. = Snake venom antidote activity = sPLA2 is also present in snake venoms and implicated in their toxicity. It plays a role in the morbidity and mortality from snakebite envenomations, triggering induced cell lysis, disrupted hemostasis, and diminished oxygen transport, as well as myotoxicity and neurotoxicity which can lead to paralysis. Varespladib methyl, as well as varespladib, were found to be inhibitors of the sPLA2 of snake venoms. Varespladib methyl was less potent than varespladib. Both showed activity against a broad spectrum of different snake venoms originating from six continents. They protected rodents against neurotoxicity and hemostatic toxicity, increasing survival of envenomed animals. Varespladib also effectively inhibited in vitro and in vivo the non-enzymatic myotoxic activity of snake venom's PLA2-like protein (MjTX-II). Co-crystallization of varespladib with MjTX-II toxin (PDB code: 6PWH) revealed that the drug binds to a hydrophobic channel of the protein. This blocks fatty acids from binding there, thus inhibiting their allosteric activation of the toxin, thereby impairing its ability to disrupt cell membranes. History Varespladib methyl was originally developed jointly by Eli Lilly and Company and Shionogi & Co., Ltd., and was acquired by Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2006. A Phase II study demonstrated selective sPLA2 inhibition as well as statistically significant anti-inflammatory responses and reductions in LDL cholesterol levels. Two other Phase II trials, conducted in patients with coronary artery disease, found significant decreases in sPLA2 and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory biomarkers. Varespladib methyl has also been shown to further reduce LDL and inflammatory biomarker levels when administered in conjunction with a cholesterol lowering statin therapy. In 2010, a Phase III study entitled VISTA-16 was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of short-term treatment with varespladib methyl in subjects with ACS. The trial was halted in March 2012 due to insufficient efficacy. On November 18, 2013, an excess of myocardial infarctions, and of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions and stroke in the VISTA-16 study were reported. First report on its efficacy as an antidote for snake venoms comes from 2016. Due to oral bioavailability it is considered as a potential first-line field- treatment for snakebite envenomation, which could be applied before provision of definitive medical care.

Backus on inverting geophysical data, and also for his role in establishing an international network of long-period seismometers. Gilbert was born in Vincennes, Indiana. A 1949 graduate of Lawrenceburg High School (Kentucky), his undergraduate and graduate degrees were earned from MIT (B.S., 1953, and Ph.D. in geophysics, 1956), and he continued at MIT as a postdoctoral fellow until 1957, when he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA he was an assistant, then associate, professor, but left to take an appointment as a senior researcher at Texas Instruments. In 1961, he was recruited by Walter Munk to the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, also becoming a professor of geophysics at the University of California, San Diego. He remained at UCSD through the remainder of his career, and became an emeritus professor. In his later years, Gilbert enjoyed extensive world travel with his wife, Sally Gilbert. He died due to complications resulting from a car accident in Southern Oregon on August 15, 2014. He was 83 years old. Contributions Gilbert was among the first to recognize that the free oscillations of the Earth (so-called bell- ringing modes) could be measured immediately following large earthquakes, and could be used to produce structural models of the inner earth. In collaboration with Adam Dziewonski, he applied these ideas first to seismic records from the 1964 Alaska earthquake and then to records from the 1970 Colombia earthquake. In this context he and Backus developed robust methods for inverting seismic data. By the early 1970s it was clear that better data from long-period seismometers was needed for this kind of work. Gilbert convinced geophysicist/philanthropist Cecil Green to fund a network of seismometers designed to provide data for global studies of the Earth. The first of 40 stations of this International Deployment of Accelerometers (IDA) array (the acronym also commemorating co-philanthropist Ida Green) was installed in 1974, and it continues in operation to this day. Awards Gilbert had received many honors, including the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1981; the William Bowie Medal of American Geophysical Union in 1999; and the Harry Fielding Reid Medal of the Seismological Society of America in 2004.

Architecture The Romanesque Revival building was designed by Walter C. Root in 1891. The most distinctive features are on the southeast facade, including towers that mimic a medieval castle. The building was enlarged in 1909 to fill the western half of the block with a one-story addition that is not as stylistically ornate, but mimics the original design. History The car barn was one of four facilities designed by Root for the Washington and Georgetown Railroad when it was planning an expansion of its cable car service in the 1890s. The Navy Yard was the terminus of a cable car route that ran up 8th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, continuing to Georgetown. The car barn was used to turn around the cars and ready them for their next trip across the city. The railway was acquired by the Capital Traction Company in 1895, and after a fire destroyed the main powerhouse in 1897, the cable cars were replaced with electric. in the electric car era, the barn was primarily used for storage, and it was expanded for this purpose in 1909. Streetcar service in DC ended in 1962, and several of the retired streetcars were stored in the Navy Yard Car Barn. The tracks leading into the car barn were paved over in 1963, and the building was later sold. It was leased by the United States Department of Labor and used to store records until the mid-1970s, and was then abandoned. Redevelopment The building was painted blue and redeveloped for commercial use in the 1990s. When it was sold to a new developer in 2005, the building housed three DC Public Charter Schools. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 2006. At the time, it was the last Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company building to survive the cable car era. In 2014, the National Community Church purchased the property.

The Space programme 2040 intends to replace the Badr satellite programme and geo-stationary communication satellite. On 11 August, Paksat-IR was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center by China, making it first satellite to be launched under this programme. According to Suparco, five GEO satellites and six low earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be launched between 2011 and 2040. The stated goals of the program are expected to gain significant experience in satellite development, practising of space medicine, and to promote socio-economic sector in the country. While the programme intends to learn to develop the military and space technologies and to conduct experiments on fundamental sciences in space frontier, the government maintained that Space programme-2040's prime purpose is to bring the benefits of the full spectrum of space technology to the people of Pakistan. On 15 July 2011, Prime minister Yousaf Gillani gave official approval of the programme with the 2011 Pakistan fiscal year budget.  Low Earth orbit  In 1992, Suparco launched her first LEO project, and it was completed in 1996. Badr-II was Suparco's first LEO satellite and was launched in 2001 by Baikonur Cosmodrome by the Russian Space Agency. Since then, Suparco took initiatives to replace her first Suparco satellite, therefore, Remote Sensing Satellite programme in January 2007. =Optical satellite= Suparco planned to launch its first optical satellite in the end of 2011 from People's Republic of China. The satellite is reported to have payload of 2.5 meter PAN in 700 km in SSO. It is the first satellite that is locally manufactured by the Suparco and to meet the national and international user requirements in the field of satellite imagery. =Remote Sensing Programme= There are six remote sensing satellites are expected to be developed and launched under this programme. Suparco is intending to launch her first remote sensing satellite in 2018 and it is named as PRSS-O1. According to Suparco, the planned and manufactured satellites are list below: PRSS-O1 PRSS-S1 PRSS-O2 PRSS-S2 PRSS-O3 PRSS-S3  Geostationary orbit  The Space Programme 2040 included the development of five GEO satellites and six LEO satellites to replace Suparco's existing satellites in the orbit. There are no plans for development of a Launch vehicle, and the programme is entirely intended to launch more communication and remote sensing satellites from other countries. In 11 August, the Suparco launched the Paksat-IR, as first satellite as part of this programme. =Geo-satellites= According to Suparco, the Space Programme intends to launch five GEO satellites from 2011 till 2040. Here the details are given: Paksat-IE The Paksat-IE was country's first GEO satellite that was operated by the Suparco. Previously owned by Boeing and operated under lease by Paksat. It was launched on 31 January 1996 and leased to Suparco in 2003. Since then, Suparco initiated to developed its own GEO satellite programme, financed by People's Republic of China. The satellite will be replaced by its advanced and upgrade satellite, the Paksat-IR. Paksat-IR The Paksat-IR is a first GEO satellite that was launched at 21:17hrs 11 August as part of this programme from People's Republic of China. Its satellite vehicle was the Long March 3E carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China's Sichuan province. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and the Suparco was the main contractor to build Paksat-IR, and DESTO was selected to build the primary heat shield and electronic materials for the spacecraft.

In 1908, Ritz published Recherches critiques sur l'√âlectrodynamique g√©n√©rale,Critical Researches on General Electrodynamics, Introduction and First Part (1980) Robert Fritzius, editor; Second Part (2005) Yefim Bakman, Editor. a lengthy criticism of Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetic theory, in which he contended that the theory's connection with the luminiferous aether (see Lorentz ether theory) made it \\"essentially inappropriate to express the comprehensive laws for the propagation of electrodynamic actions.\\" Ritz proposed a new equation, derived from the principles of the ballistic theory of electromagnetic waves, a theory competing with the special theory of relativity. The equation relates the force between two charged particles with a radial separation r relative velocity v and relative acceleration a, where k is an undetermined parameter from the general form of Ampere's force law as proposed by Maxwell. The equation obeys Newton's third law and forms the basis of Ritz's electrodynamics. : mathbf{F} = frac{q_1 q_2} {4pi epsilon_0 r^2} left[left[1+frac{3-k}{4} left(frac{v}{c}right)^2 - frac{3(1-k)}{4} left(frac{mathbf{vcdot r}}{c^2}right)^2 - frac{r}{2c^2} (mathbf{acdot r}) right] frac{mathbf{r}}{r} - frac{k+1}{2c^2} (mathbf{vcdot r})mathbf{v} - frac{r}{c^2} (mathbf{a})right] Derivation of Ritz's equation On the assumption of an emission theory, the force acting between two moving charges should depend on the density of the messenger particles emitted by the charges (D), the radial distance between the charges (œÅ), the velocity of the emission relative to the receiver, ( U_x and U_r for the x and r components, respectively), and the acceleration of the particles relative to each other ( a_x ). This gives us an equation of the form: Reprinted as :: F_x = eD left[ A_1 cos(rho x)+ B_1 frac{U_x U_r} {c^2} + C_1 frac{rho a_x} {c^2} right] . where the coefficients A_1 , B_1 and C_1 are independent of the coordinate system and are functions of u^2/c^2 and u^2_rho /c^2 . The stationary coordinates of the observer relate to the moving frame of the charge as follows :: X+x(t') = X'+x'(t')-(t-t')v'_x Developing the terms in the force equation, we find that the density of particles is given by :: D alpha frac {dt' e' dS} {rho^2} = - frac {e' partial rho} {c rho^2 partial n} dS dn The tangent plane of the shell of emitted particles in the stationary coordinate is given by the Jacobian of the transformation from X' to X : :: frac{partial rho} {partial n} = frac{partial (XYZ)} {partial (X'Y'Z')} = frac{a e'}{rho^2} left(1 +frac{rho a'_rho}{c^2} right) We can also develop expressions for the retarded radius rho and velocity U_rho <rho> using Taylor series expansions :: rho = r left(1+frac{ra'_r}{c^2}right)^{1/2} :: rho_x = r_x + frac{r^2 a'_x}{2c^2} :: U_rho = v_r - v'_r +frac{ra'_r}{c} With these substitutions, we find that the force equation is now :: F_x = frac{ee'}{r^2} left(1+frac{ra'_r}{c^2}right) left[A cos(rx) left(1-frac{3ra'_r}{2c^2}right) + Aleft(frac{ra'_x}{2c^2}right)-Bleft(frac{u_x u_r}{c^2}right)-Cleft(frac{ra'_x}{c^2}right)right] Next we develop the series representations of the coefficients :: A = alpha_0 + alpha_1 frac{u^2} {c^2} + alpha_2 frac{u^2_r}{c^2}+... :: B = beta_0 + beta_1 frac{u^2} {c^2} + beta_2 frac{u^2_r}{c^2}+... :: C = gamma_0 + gamma_1 frac{u^2} {c^2} + gamma_2 frac{u^2_r}{c^2}+... With these substitutions, the force equation becomes :: F_x = frac{ee'}{r^2} left[left(alpha_0+alpha_1 frac{u_x^2}{c^2}+alpha_2 frac{u^2_r}{c^2}right) cos(rx) - beta_0 frac{u_x u_r}{c^2}-alpha_0 frac{ra'_r}{2c^2} + left(frac{ra'_x}{2c^2}right)(alpha_0-2gamma_0) right] Since the equation must reduce to the Coulomb force law when the relative velocities are zero, we immediately know that alpha_0 = 1 . Furthermore, to obtain the correct expression for electromagnetic mass, we may deduce that 2gamma_0 -1 = 1 or gamma_0 =1. To determine the other coefficients, we consider the force on a linear circuit using Ritz's expression, and compare the terms with the general form of Ampere's law. The second derivative of Ritz's equation is :: d^2 F_x = sum_{i,j}frac{de_i de_j'}{r^2} left[left(1+alpha_1 frac{u_x^2}{c^2}+alpha_2 frac{u_r^2}{c^2}right) cos(rx) - beta_0 frac{u_x u_r}{c^2}-alpha_0 frac{ra'_r}{2c^2} + frac{ra'_x}{2c^2}right] Diagram of elements of linear circuits Consider the diagram on the right, and note that dq v = I dl , : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' = 0 : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' u^2_x = -2dq dq' w_x w'_x :::::: = -2 I I' ds ds' cosepsilon : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' u^2_r = -2dq dq' w_r w'_r :::::: = -2 I I' ds ds' cos(rds)cos(rds) : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' u_x u_r = -dq dq' (w_x w'_r+w'_x w_r) :::::: = -I I' ds ds' left[cos(xds)cos(rds)+cos(rds)cos(xds')right] : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' a'_r = 0 : sum_{i,j} de_i de_j' a'_x = 0 Plugging these expressions into Ritz's equation, we obtain the following :: d^2 F_x = frac{I I' ds ds'}{r^2} left[left[2alpha_1 cosepsilon + 2alpha_2 cos(rds) cos(rds')right]cos(rx) - beta_0 cos(rds')cos(xds)-beta_0 cos(rds)cos(xds')right] Comparing to the original expression for Ampere's force law :: d^2 F_x = - frac{I I' ds ds'}{2r^2} left[left[(3-k)cosepsilon - 3(1-k) cos(rds) cos(rds')right]cos(rx)-(1+k)cos(rds')cos(xds)-(1+k)cos(rds)cos(xds')right] we obtain the coefficients in Ritz's equation :: alpha_1 = frac{3-k}{4} :: alpha_2 = -frac{3(1-k)}{4} :: beta_0 = frac{1+k}{2} From this we obtain the full expression of Ritz's electrodynamic equation with one unknown : mathbf{F} = frac{q_1 q_2} {4pi epsilon_0 r^2} left[left[1+frac{3-k}{4} left(frac{v}{c}right)^2 - frac{3(1-k)}{4} left(frac{mathbf{vcdot r}}{c^2}right)^2 - frac{r}{2c^2} (mathbf{acdot r}) right] frac{mathbf{r}}{r} - frac{k+1}{2c^2} (mathbf{vcdot r})mathbf{v} - frac{r}{c^2} (mathbf{a})right] In a footnote at the end of Ritz's section on Gravitation (English translation) the editor says, \\"Ritz used k = 6.4 to reconcile his formula (to calculate the angle of advancement of perihelion of planets per century) with the observed anomaly for Mercury (41\\") however recent data give 43.1\\", which leads to k = 7. Substituting this result into Ritz's formula yields exactly the general relativity formula.\\" Using this same integer value for k in Ritz's electrodynamic equation we get: : mathbf{F} = frac{q_1 q_2} {4pi epsilon_0 r^2} left[left[1 - left(frac{v}{c}right)^2 + 4.5 left(frac{mathbf{vcdot r}}{c^2}right)^2 - frac{r}{2c^2} (mathbf{acdot r}) right] frac{mathbf{r}}{r} - frac{4}{c^2} (mathbf{vcdot r})mathbf{v} - frac{r}{c^2} (mathbf{a})right] References and notes Further reading History of physics ","title":"Ritz ballistic theory"},{"id":"32782983","text":"Rebuild the Dream is an American center-left political organization founded in June 2011 by former Obama Administration advisor Van Jones and the group MoveOn.org.

The geometric pattern of crossing horizontal and vertical sticks on this house is reminiscent of Japanese framing as seen in the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia which influenced the Stick and later Prairie styles, and may have been an influence in this house (Hartman p. 1).\\" The home is still very well preserved and stands strong today.

Shirley Ann Richards plays a chiropractor. It was her last role in Australia before leaving for Hollywood. Ken Hall later recalled in his memoirs: > It [the film] provided a much bigger snag to make than we had expected: > there were next to no troops available to make it with. The army had a few > hundred militiamen in camp at Liverpool. They had been called up for > national service and home defence, were raw and as yet untrained. Eighteen- > year-olds formed a big percentage, and they were out to prove their manhood > by stacking their own normal conversation with every four-letter word in the > language. As soldiers they had a long way to go, but they were all we had. > The veteran NCOs got stuck into them and soon had them in at least rough > shape.

Release While the film was originally made to increase recruitment for the AIF, after Japan entered the war additional footage was shot and the film recut to also appeal to the Australian Militia Force. The film was previewed to the Department of Information on 29 January 1942. It was released throughout Australia as a supporting featurette in Greater Union cinemas. =Critical= The Sydney Morning Herald called 100,000 Cobbers \\"a fine film call to the fighting youth of Australia in this grave hour... the best film Ken Hall as made and it will have particularly nostalgic appeal for old diggers... It is often a quietly moving story.\\" The News of Adelaide called it \\"probably the best documentary film Australia has produced... well acted, neatly produced and its action scenes are authentic and moving.\\" The Mercury of Hobart wrote that Joe Valli was \\"outstanding\\". The West Australian wrote that: > It is a film for everybody, a picture everyone should see and one that no > Australian can view without a feeling of pride and genuine emotion... From > the time the recruits reach the enlistment depot every phase of their lives > and training is presented with a realism hitherto lacking in some of our > propaganda films. The film was distributed in England and the US. Filmnk magazine later wrote that Taylor and Richards made a \\"marvellous team\\". Later release In 1947 the army was worried about running short of men to serve in Japan and the islands. They used the film as a recruiting tool in conjunction with the British documentary The True Glory.

Brotherly love  The following is based on the public domain article Brotherly Love found in the 1906 Jewish EncyclopediaJewishEncyclopedia_com - BROTHERLY LOVE =A Biblical command= Brotherly love is the love for one's fellow-man as a brother. The expression is taken from the Greek word Œ¶ŒπŒªŒ±Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒØŒ± (Philadelphia = \\"love of brothers\\"), which trait distinguished the Early Christian communities. - and express the idea of Christian fellowship and fraternity. It was also important in the Essene brotherhoods, who practised brotherly love as a special virtue.Josephus, \\"B. J.\\" ii. 8, ¬ß 2; Philo, \\"Quod Omnis Liber Probus,\\" ¬ß 12 Brotherly love is commanded as a universal principle in : \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,\\" the preceding verse containing the words: \\"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart.\\" This commandment of love, with the preceding sentence, \\"Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people,\\" may originally have referred, and has by some scholars Stade, \\"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\\" i. 510a been exclusively referred, to the Israelitish neighbor; but in verse 34 of the same chapter it is extended to \\"the stranger that dwelleth with you . . . and thou shalt love him as thyself.\\" In it is declared unjust to wrong the servant in his cause: \\"Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?\\" The principle of brotherly love, including all men, is plainly stated in the Book of Wisdom i. 6, vii. 23, xii. 19: \\"Wisdom is man-loving\\" (Œ¶ŒπŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒΩ); \\"the righteous must be man-loving.\\" The Testaments of the PatriarchsIssachar v., vii. teach the love of God and love of all men \\"as [His?] children.\\" Commenting upon the command to love the neighbor (Lev. l.c.) is a discussion recordedSifra, Hedoshim, iv.; compare Gen. R. xxiv. 5 between Rabbi Akiva, who declared this verse in Leviticus to contain the great principle of the Law (\\"Kelal gadol ba-Torah\\"), and Ben Azzai, who pointed to Gen. v. 1 (\\"This is the book of the generations of Adam; in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him\\"), as the verse expressing the leading principle of the Law, obviously because the first verse gives to the term \\"neighbor\\" its unmistakable meaning as including all men as being sons of Adam, made in the image of God. Tanhuma, in Gen. R. l.c., explains it thus: \\"If thou despisest any man, thou despisest God who made man in His image.\\" =The Golden Rule= Hillel also took the Biblical command in this universal spirit when he responded to the heathen who requested him to tell the mitzvoth of the Torah while standing before him on one foot: \\"What is hateful to you, do not do to your friend. This is all of the Torah; the rest is the explanation -- go and learn\\".Shab. 31a The negative form was the accepted Targum interpretation of Lev. xix. 18, known alike to the author of Tobit iv. 15 and to Philo, in the fragment preserved by Eusebius, Preparatio Evangelica, viii. 7;Bernays' \\"Gesammelte Abhandlungen,\\" 1885, i. 274 et seq. to the Didache, i. 1; Didascalia or Apostolic Constitutions, i. 1, iii. 15; Clementine Homilies, ii. 6; and other ancient patristic writings.Resch, \\"Agrapha,\\" pp. 95, 135, 272 That this so-called golden rule, given also in James ii. 8, was recognized by the Jews in the time of Jesus, may be learned from Mark xii. 28-34; Luke x. 25-28; Matt. vii. 12, xix. 19, xxii. 34-40; Rom. xiii. 9; and Gal. v. 14, where the Pharisaic scribe asks Jesus in the same words that were used by Akiva, \\"What is the great commandment of the Law?\\" and the answer given by Jesus declares the first and Great Commandment to be the love of God, and the second the love of \\"thy neighbor as thyself.\\" To include all men, Hillel used the term beriotcreatures [compare Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒπœÇ]; Mark xvi. 15; Rom. viii. 19 when inculcating the teaching of love: \\"Love the fellow- creatures\\".Abot i. 12 Hatred of fellow-creatures (sinat ha-beriyot) is similarly declared by Joshua ben Hananiah to be one of the three things that drive man out of the world.Abot ii. 11; compare I John iii. 15 = Hate thy enemy? = That brotherly love as a universal principle of humanity has been taught by the rabbis of old, is disputed by Christian theologians,JewishEncyclopedia_com - BROTHERLY LOVE who refer to the saying attributed to Jesus in Matt. v. 43: \\"Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say unto you, Love your enemies,\\" etc. G√ºdemann thinks that Jesus' words had a special political meaning, and that they refer to a view expressed by the zealots who wanted to exclude dissenters from the command of love by such teaching as is found in Abot:R. N. xvi., ed. Schechter, p. 64 \\"Thou shalt not say, I love the sages but hate the disciples, or I love the students of the Law but hate the 'am ha- are·∫ì [ignoramuses]; thou shalt love all, but hate the heretics [\\"minim\\"], the apostates, and the informers. So does the command, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' refer only to those that act as one of thy people; but if they act not accordingly, thou needst not love them.\\" Against this exclusive principle, Jesus asserted the principle of brotherly love as applied by the liberal school of Hillel to all men. Indeed, the Talmud insists, with reference to Lev. xix. 18, that even the criminal at the time of execution should be treated with tender love.Sanh. 45a As SchechterSchechter, \\"J. Q. R.\\" x. 11 shows, the expression \\"Ye have heard . . .\\" is an inexact translation of the rabbinical formula, which is only a formal logical interrogation introducing the opposite view as the only correct one: \\"Ye might deduce from this verse that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say to you the only correct interpretation is, Love all men, even thine enemies.\\" There is a commandment to assist thy enemy in case of emergency in Ex 23,5: If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. = The Good Samaritan = The story of the good Samaritan, in the Gospel of Luke 10 25‚Äì37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \\"neighbor,\\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews‚Äîi.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Kohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \\"Samaritan\\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \\"Israelite,\\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love. The term \\"neighbor\\" has at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers. In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \\"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\\" Likewise in xxviii.: \\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn ·∏§ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; ·∏§ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \\"Sha'are ·∏≤edushah,\\" i. 5; and Moses ·∏§agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \\"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\\" p. 258. Accordingly, the synod at Leipzig in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \\"Ethics of Judaism,\\" i. 234, 302) that \\"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \\"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\\" l.c.).  Philosophic views  The seven word expression, \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\\", appears seven times in the Bible. (; ; ; ; ; ; ) \\"Thou shalt love\\" is from Greek Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒÆœÉŒµŒπœÇ from Œ¨Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ¨œâ (agapao) - to love (in a social or moral sense:) \\"Agape refers to the paternal love of God for man and of man for God but is extended to include a brotherly love for all humanity. (The Hebrew ahev has a slightly wider semantic range than agape). Agape arguably draws on elements from both eros and philia in that it seeks a perfect kind of love that is at once a fondness, a transcending of the particular, and a passion without the necessity of reciprocity.\\"Philosophy of Love - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy  See also  * Great Commandment * The New Commandment  References  Christian terminology New Testament words and phrases Philosophy of love ","title":"Brotherly love (philosophy)"},{"id":"32783123","text":"Lauv√∏ya (sometimes L√∏v√∏ya) is an island in the municipality of Flatanger in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway.

Hall which focuses on Australia as the main Allied base in the South West Pacific area. Actors depict a cross section of Australians involved in the war effort. Plot A series of everyday people talk about their contributions to the war effort. A motor mechanic speaks about how he was working happily in 1939, not thinking much of the crisis in Europe; he subsequently began making aircraft and enlisted in the Volunteer Defence Force. The factory manager talks about how Australia has increased its industrial capacity and the high rates of tax necessary to pay for it. In peace time he was an engineer in charge of a cosmetics factory. He talks in particular about the munitions and weapons made in Australia. Old Man Stewart, the farmer, talks about how the war interrupted his life and the importance of getting on with the job of growing food. He speaks about the female land army. A man on a tractor, a former milkman, talks about his job building roads and aerodromes. His daughter Gwennie is working making munitions. She used to work in a beauty parlour and now pours TNT into munitions. She talks about the varied things women do in the war. Her boyfriend Bill is in the navy. He talks about the Australia navy, the battles they lost, including the Sydney, Perth and Canberra. Bill and Gwennie are at a cafe when they meet a merchant seaman who has survived several attacks and sinkings. He talks about the role of the merchant navy in transporting troops, munitions and food. An RAAF pilot banters with an RAF pilot in New Guinea. They go off on a mission. An RAF mechanic and RAAF mechanic banter and worry about their pilots. Then with an American mechanic \\"Brooklyn\\" they remember the bombing of Darwin and talk about how the Allies will defeat Japan. In the jungle, an Australian and American soldier get cut off together. The Australian soldier reminisces about service in Tobruk, Greek, Greece and the Malayan campaign. He praises his English, Indian and New Zealand allies. The Australian has a brother taken POW in Malaya, the American a brother in Bataan. They vow to get revenge on the Japanese. The narrator then talks about Peter Lalor, the Eureka Rebellion and the vow taken at the Eureka Stockade. Cast *Alec Kellaway as the Mechanic (the former motor mechanic) *John Nugent-Hayward as Harry, the Factory Manager *Bert Bailey as Old Man Stewart, the Farmer *Bill Perryman as the Road Builder *Muriel Steinbeck as Gwennie, the Munition Worker *Walter Pym as Bill, the Sailor *George Randall as the Merchant Seaman *Peter Finch as the RAAF pilot *Ralph Smart as the RAF pilot *Joe Valli as the RAF mechanic *Chips Rafferty as the RAAF mechanic *Wayne Froman as USAC mechanic *Grant Taylor as AIF soldier *Ron Randell as US soldier Production Various actors were granted leave from the armed services to appear in the movie, including Gunner Peter Finch, Sgt. Ron Taylor, LAC Chips Rafferty, PO Ralph Smart, Joe Valli, Ron Randell and Sergeant-Major Walter Pym and Squadron Leader George Randall. Jungle scenes were reconstructed in Cinesound's studio under the supervision of Damien Parer. The US Army lent fighting equipment for battle scenes. To add realism to sequences live ammunition was used. Ken Hall later said he wanted to use professional actors rather than real workers and farmers \\"to give the film a professional finish, and that the majority of them were real-life war workers, either in the services, or in essential industry.\\" Prime Minister John Curtin wrote a special foreword for the film which stated that the film: > Was made to give the people of Great Britain, America, Soviet Russia, and > the United Nations some accurate idea of Australia at war. The Commonwealth > Government has released this film for exhibition throughout Australia, in > the feeling that every citizen will take pride in a record of national > achievement. You are about to see a motion picture which you helped to make > as a member of thee fighting forces, as a worker on the home front, as a > tacpayer, as a buyer of war bonds. Release The film had its first public screening in Hobart on 12 May when Senator Bill Ashley, the then-Minister for Information, showed it after giving a talk. The film premiered to commercial audiences in Sydney at the Lyceum Theatre in Sydney in June 1943. It had been passed without cuts by the government censor, but the word \\"bloody\\", which was spoken twice in the jungle scenes, was removed by a cleric who ran the Lyceum. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that: > South-West Pacific is one of the best, and certainly the most comprehensive, > of the propaganda films yet made here. Well written, yet not ‚Äì without some > trace of the bombast, which unfortunately seems characteristic of so many of > our propaganda film narratives, the picture graphically reviews our national > contribution to the Allied cause. More engrossing than a major screen story, > it outlines an amazing achievement, one which audiences here will find is > much greater and more versatile than they had imagined.... The acting on the > whole is so convincing and the varied Australian types so well portrayed > that it would be unfair to single out any particular player for mention. > Here is a picture that every Australian should see. =Political controversy= A special screening of the movie for Members of Parliament and other special guests took place in July. The screening did not go well: reportedly several MPs laughed at sequences and walked out of the theatre. The general consensus was the film compared poorly to its companion feature, Desert Victory (1943), and should not have used actors instead of real people. According to a journalist from the Brisbane Sunday Mail who was present at the screening, one viewer said it had \\"enough ham to feed the whole Australian army\\". The journalist went on to criticise the film: > The artificiality of the sequences, false values, false sentiments, and > complacency of the whole film made almost a painful impression on many of > the vice regal, diplomatic and parliamentary audiences upstairs at the > theatre. Downstairs, where the audience comprised soldiers, mostly taken > from the front line to attend a special training school at Duntroon, there > was loud laughter at some scenes intended to be impressive. There was no > smell of battle in the film as in the wonderful Desert Victory, which had > preceded it. There were no actors and no politics in Desert Victory, only > fighters and workers. There were only actors and a strong political flavour > in South-west Pacific... Any audience ran be forgiven for laughing in the > wrong place. In the search for lightness and brightness, comedy has been > over emphasised. The film misses a glorious opportunity to show some thing > of the real work of Australian soldiers. The movie was then released in Adelaide. The Adelaide Advertiser said it should not be exported: > Despite the excellence of its pictorial matter, its sentiment is out of key, > it is boastful, and its characters talk incessantly. Some of the characters > employed are more caricatures or comedians than average Australian people > (Bert Bailey is there in his Dad part of On Our Selection fame), and the > servicemen types are quite inadequate. The pictorial representation of > factory development, of farm and pasture, and of the Allied Works Council > projects, is good, but in all else Producer-Director Ken G. Hall has made a > far too low assessment of the intelligence of his prospective audiences. However, a critic from the Hobart Mercury liked the film, writing that \\"Script is direct, forceful. Photography good. Worth seeing.\\" The Adelaide News thought the film had good and bad points: > It is undoubtedly comprehensive for a 3,000-ft. film. Producer-Director Ken > G.Hall and commentator Tom Gurr have snapshotted Australia's war effort from > a good many angles. They seem out of perspective at times. 'Tough! Of course > it's tough.' booms the voice of Australia.

The emphasis throughout is on the > home front, its trials, and Its achievements, the last' described with a > complacency that's naive and perhaps ill judged in a film intended for > export. Even so, as a home-front documentary the film has a good deal to > commend it, except that the workers portrayed are an over-clean and actorish > lot. Not enough footage is given to servicemen. Those who do appear are > stock types. The Adelaide Mail reported that: > Points in its favor... were its crisp photography, clear commentary, > economical dove-tailing of sequences showing many aspects of war work, and > its patient sincerity in trying to give industrial war workers a pride in > their jobs. On the debit side were a naive boastfulness ('things we taught > the Allied Nations'), emphasis on the amateur aspect of Australia's war work > (plenty about factory operatives who used to make and sell cosmetics, but > not a word about the sizeable heavy industries operating for years), too > much home front, too little front line, and too many of those old familiar > faces ‚Äî like 'Dad' Bert Bailey ‚Äî from screen and vaudeville. There seemed to > be a feeling of 'Dad 'n' Dave' in types and dialogue right through the > film.... Summary ‚Äî 'South-West Pacific' good enough as a civilian morale > booster, for home consumption, but definitely not for export. =Arthur Fadden complaint= The film was subsequently screened by Senator Ashey, after a speaking engagement in Brisbane, Queensland during which Ashley praised the achievements of the Curtin government, and claimed the film illustrated these. The then-leader of the opposition, Arthur Fadden, complained that the movie was being used for electioneering purposes (it was near the time of the 1943 election) and asked for it to be withdrawn from distribution. =Film withdrawn= Despite Ashley's protests, Curtin ordered that all future screenings of South West Pacific be stopped, and the movie be replaced by an entirely new documentary to be made later. Curtin claimed this was not because of Fadden's complaint, but due to his belief that South West Pacific was not sufficiently realistic and vivid to do justice to Australian services fighting in the South-west Pacific area; he wanted a better portrayal of the war in this zone, with more emphasis on fighting troops. Curtin later stated \\"I make it clear that the decision to make what I have described as a better film than South-west Pacific in no way reflects on the ability of Cinesound Productions Ltd. as producers of motion pictures. That company was asked to do a Pacific film and it did so in accordance with the specifications given to it.\\" Queensland Theatres Ltd then wrote to Curtin requesting that they continue to be allowed to show the film and Curtin said he would have another look at it. The government later made Jungle Patrol (1944), set during the Finisterre Range campaign, which used real soldiers and emphasised fighting troops. It was made by Tom Gurr who wrote South West Pacific. Doc Evatt took a company of the film to the US and Britain. =Later Reputation= Filmink magazine wrote that the plot involving Steinbeck was strong enough for a feature.

Solar EOR uses solar thermal arrays to concentrate the sun's energy to heat water and generate steam. The steam is injected into an oil reservoir to reduce the viscosity, or thin, heavy crude thus facilitating its flow to the surface. Thermal recovery processes, also known as steam injection, have traditionally burned natural gas to produce steam. Solar EOR is proving to be a viable alternative to gas-fired steam production for the oil industry. Solar EOR can generate the same quality steam as natural gas, reaching temperatures up to 750 ¬∞F (400 ¬∞C) and 2,500 PSI. While typical fuel-fired steamflood operations inject steam into the ground at a constant rate, research conducted by leading oil producers shows that variable rate steam injection has no negative impact on production levels. In effect, solar EOR could supply up to 80 percent of a field's annual steam requirements, by injecting solar-generated steam during the sunny hours, and a reduced amount of gas-fired steam at night or in less sunny weather or climates. This method of integrating solar EOR will displace larger amounts of gas consumption without affecting oil output.Van Heel, A.P.G.; Shell Technology Oman; van Wunnik, J.N.M.; Bentouati, S.; Terres, R.; Petroleum Development Oman, \\"The Impact of Daily and Seasonal Cycles In Solar-Generated Steam On Oil Recovery\\" , \\"Society of Petroleum Engineers\\", 11‚Äì13 April 2010 Technology While there are many types of solar-to-steam technologies, often referred to as solar thermal or concentrated solar power, only two are currently deployed for solar EOR. =Central tower= Originally designed for generating electricity, central tower, or power tower technology, uses a field of large tracking mirrors, called heliostats, to concentrate the sunlight on a boiler filled with water that rests on a central tower. The sun's energy is reflected on the boiler to produce steam, which is used to turn a traditional turbine to create electricity. For EOR, the process ends at steam production. High-temperature steam made from demineralized water in the tower receiver passes through a heat exchanger, generating steam of lower temperature from high-contamination oilfield feedwater at lower temperatures. The steam is fed into distribution headers which lead to injection wells, which convey steam into the oil-bearing formation. =Enclosed trough= Inside an enclosed trough system The enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, \\"Energy & Resources Predictions 2012\\", 2 November 2011 Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse structure. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure.Helman, Christopher, \\"Oil from the sun\\", \\"Forbes\\", April 25, 2011 Steam is generated directly, using oil field-quality water, as water flows from the inlet throughout the length of the pipes, without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids. The steam produced is then fed directly to the field's existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity. GlassPoint Solar, the company that created the Enclosed Trough method, states its technology can produce heat for EOR for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.Goossens, Ehren, \\"Chevron Uses Solar-Thermal Steam to Extract Oil in California\\", \\"Bloomberg\\", October 3, 2011 Current projects =21Z in McKittrick, California= World's first commercial solar EOR project, located in Kern Country, CA, USA. GlassPoint Solar partnered with Berry Petroleum, California's largest independent oil producer, to deploy the world's first commercial solar EOR project. Commissioned in February 2011, the project is located on a 100-year-old McKittrick Oil Field in McKittrick, California. Coined the Kern County 21Z Solar Project, the system spans roughly one acre and will produce approximately one million Btus per hour of solar heat, replacing natural gas used for steam generation. The solar EOR project was constructed in less than six weeks and is the first installation of GlassPoint's enclosed trough technology in an oil field.World's first commercial solar EOR project begins =Coalinga in Coalinga, California= In October 2011, Chevron Corp. and BrightSource Energy revealed a 29-megawatt solar- to-steam facility at the Coalinga Oil Field in Fresno County, California. The Coalinga solar EOR project spans 100 acres and consists of 3,822 mirror systems, or heliostats, each with two 10-foot (3-meter) by 7-foot mirrors mounted on a 6-foot steel pole focusing light on a 327-foot solar tower. BrightSource was contracted to provide the technology, engineering and production and construction services, and Chevron Technology Ventures will manage operations of the project. The facility began construction in 2009. It was reported that Chevron spent more than its $28 million on the contract, and BrightSource has lost at least $40 million on the project and disclosed it will lose much more.Gilbert, Daniel, \\"Drilling for Crude Goes Solar\\", \\"The Wall Street Journal\\", October 1, 2011 =Petroleum Development Oman= 7MW Solar EOR project in Amal, Oman In May 2013, GlassPoint Solar and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) commissioned the Middle East's first solar EOR project. PDO is a joint venture between the Sultanate of Oman, Shell and Total. The 7 MW solar EOR facility produces a daily average of 50 tons of emissions-free steam that feeds directly into existing thermal EOR operations at PDO's Amal West field in Southern Oman. The system in 27 times larger than GlassPoint's first installation at Berry Petroleum's 21Z oil field. Reports by Petroleum Development Oman indicate that the pilot was delivered on-time, under-budget, and above contract output specifications, with zero lost time injuries. In the first year of operations, the fully automated system successfully exceeded all performance tests and production targets. The system recorded a 98.6% uptime, significantly exceeding PDO's expectations. Even during severe dust and sandstorms, the system has proven to maintain regular operations. In 2015 Oman announced Miraah, a $600 million, 1 gigawatt solar-thermal facility by 2017 at Amal West. The plant will cover with 36 large greenhouse protecting the solar collectors from sand and dust.Oman to Build Giant Solar Plant to Extract Oil, Wall Street Journal, Georgi Kantchev, July 8, 2015 Oman anticipates that the new solar project will replace 5.6 trillion BTUs of natural gas each year, which is equivalent to the amount required to produce electricity for 209,000 people in Oman. In August 2017, GlassPoint and its contractors crossed the threshold of 1.5 million man-hours worked without lost time injury (LTI) at Miraah. In November 2017, GlassPoint and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) completed construction on the first block of the Miraah solar plant safely on schedule and on budget, and successfully delivered steam to the Amal West oilfield. = Belridge Solar = A rendering of future solar field at South Belridge The Belridge Solar Project is a joint venture between GlassPoint Solar and Aera Energy. The project was announced in November 2017 and, when completed, is projected to produce approximately 12 million barrels of steam per year through a 850MW thermal solar steam generator. The project will be located at the South Belridge Oil Field, near Bakersfield, California, and will be the state's largest solar EOR field when completed. It will also cut carbon emissions from the facility by 376,000 metric tons per year. Market The global market for EOR technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual rate of 28 percent, reaching $16.3 billion in 2014. While quickly gaining traction, it is predicated solar EOR will have minimal impact on the market till 2015.Molchanov, Pavel, \\"Can Thermal Technology Transform the Economics of Enhanced Oil Recovery\\", \\"Raymond James Energy Report\\", March 7, 2011 (Retrieved 12 October 2011) As solar EOR scales up, oil producers will consume less gas for oil production According to research analysts at Raymond James, solar EOR can be done more cost effectively than using gas, even as current depressed prices. Steam represents as much as 60 percent of the production cost for heavily oil extraction. In addition to being cost competitive with gas, solar EOR provides a hedge against long-term gas price escalation. Long-term price projections put natural gas at $5.00 per thousand cubic feet, considerably higher than the 2011 forecast of $3.75 per thousand cubic feet. When an oil producer invests in a solar EOR system, all costs are upfront and the standard life of the equipment is 30 years. =United States= California is a promising geography for solar EOR with its high level of sunshine and vast heavy oil reserves. Currently, 40 percent of California's oil production deploys steam injection for EOR and in a few years will grow to 60 percent. Together five heavy oil producers ‚Äì Chevron, Aera Energy, Berry Petroleum, Plains and Occidental ‚Äì consume about 283 Bcf of gas annually. This equals 1.3 percent of total demand in the United States. However, analysts say that solar EOR could replace 20 percent of the natural gas used for EOR in California.Groom, Nichola, \\"Analysis: Oil companies go solar to tap hard-to-get supplies\\", \\"USA Edition; Reuters\\". Retrieved 17 August 2011 =Middle East= The Persian Gulf has exceptionally favorable insolation, which in some locations exceeds levels in the Mojave Desert, which is a factor in making solar EOR very promising there. The other factor is less obvious but even more important: with the exception of Qatar, Persian Gulf countries are short of natural gas and actually have to import gas. The limited natural gas supplies is made worse by growing local economies that require natural gas for desalination, electricity and other industrial uses.Molchanov, Pavel, \\"Solar EOR Keeps Advancing: Oman to Build First System In Mid-East\\" , \\"Raymond James Energy Report\\". Retrieved 10 November 2011 By using solar, instead of gas, to generate steam for EOR, Middle Eastern companies can extend their domestic natural gas supplies to higher value uses. This is especially relevant for Oman, which is aggressively pursuing EOR ‚Äì for example at the Mukhaizna field, which is operated by Occidental Petroleum. Oman built a natural gas export terminal, but since its oil production peaked in 2000, the country redirected the gas for used in its EOR operations. The scarcity of gas in Oman means the price there is around $10 per thousand cubic feet. Oman currently uses a significant amount of its natural gas for EOR. A report published by Ernst & Young in January 2014 found that full-scale deployment of solar EOR in Oman, in which solar steam accounted for 80% of Oman's thermal EOR needs, could save up to half a billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas per day and contribute more than $12B in Omani GDP by 2023.http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-Solar-enhanced-oil-recovery- in-Oman-January-2014/$FILE/EY-Solar-enhanced-oil-recovery-in-Oman- January-2014.pdf History In 1983, ARCO Solar constructed a solar steam generation pilot using central tower technology in Taft, California. The system generated one megawatt of thermal energy during peak operating conditions.Larson, Ronald, \\"Implementation of Solar Thermal Technology\\" , 'MIT Press\\", 1996 Though technically feasible, the system was not cost-effective and was not replicated. [4] The ARCO pilot was the first time solar steam was applied to facilitate heavy oil recovery.

This is an effort to make sense of the Bulgarian character through the prism of maritime influence in the life of our people. The author, [Varban Stamatov] has turned upside down the libraries of Sofia, St.Petersburg, Warsaw, Berlin, Tbilisi, Rieka, London, Paris and Genoa, for decades gathering material, not missing any important publication on marine navigation whatsoever, and covering centuries of national history. He emerges before the reader's court with a subjective though hard to disprove theory. He tells inspiringly of the First and Second Bulgarian Kingdoms, yet quite generally his reasoning is at cross purposes with that of the history textbooks. Stamatov cannot be a bombastic, blinded patriot, he sees the megalomaniacal ambitions of our potentates who dreamt of overtaking Byzantium. He speaks with confidence of three centuries of bloodshedding wars, whose sole purpose had not been the defence of the native land. He examines them as a feature of bracing energy, as a will of state establishment and ambition to include more land for the Slavic people. Isn't it true, as in our past ‚Äì since Tsar Samuil destroyed his brother Aaron's family, all the way to the \\"September Uprising\\" and \\"the people's law-court\\" ‚Äì that there has ever been the sinister sequence of fratricidal brawls, is it not true, that for eleven centuries we lived at the heart of the now extinct church cannon of Byzantium, of the re-introduced heresies, of the translated semi-scientific compilations within monastic-cell tuition. The author does not bypass the frozen by canonical dictum restrictions in art and culture, but he discovers just one truly illuminated figure, that of the great John Exarch, author of the unique in breadth and volume work of enlightenment in Middle Ages Bulgaria, \\"The Six Days\\". Quite probably all the old 'pro-bulgarianists' will jump, and so will all the historians, but let them before that, think on the author's words: 'our Odyssey in history is from beginning to end without sea, without horizons, lacking thirst for discovering new worlds, without wandering warriors, merchants or seafaring travellers'.\\" * ‚Ä≥–ü–ª–∞–º—ä–∫‚Ä≥ –ú–∞–π 1984, –ë–∞–Ω—á–æ –ë–∞–Ω–æ–≤, ‚Ä≥–û–≤–ª–∞–¥—è–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ —Ç–µ–º–∞‚Ä≥ –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è Plamuk, May 1984, Bancho Banov, \\"Conquering the marine theme\\" Sofia. ‚ÄúVarban Stamatov isn't one of the praised writers. Furthermore, his name is comparatively seldom seen in literary articles or reviews. I don‚Äôt say this to reproach the critics. I consider something else to be more important : he is one of the read writers. Not only men at sea are reading him, those who can recognize themselves in his novels. His creative writing attracts much wider audience, who, in literature search the spirit of the times, truths about moving forward, about the complicated transformation of the human being. Naturally, the marine theme, if it can be called that, is the basis and prevalent in his books. Having taken possession of him since the start of his path in literature, she gradually widened her borders and reached ever greater depths. From ‚ÄúCoast of the poor‚Äù through to ‚ÄúIslanders‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlagman‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe great bitter lake‚Äù to ‚ÄúCricket on the Pole‚Äù Varban Stamatov unfolded a previously unknown in our literature marine panorama, recreated a new, unresearched by no one else reality in the life of the Bulgarian man. ‚Äú ibid. ‚ÄúIf in ‚ÄúFlagman‚Äù the field of action is deliberately restricted to only the ship‚Äôs deck, the ‚ÄúGreat bitter lake‚Äù is a novel about the contemporary Bulgarian sailor, placed at the centre of the greatest and most turbulent on earth tremors. The rich and complex composition affords the author a freedom to direct his characters to hot spots on the planet everywhere, where a battle is raging against violence and evil. In the novel , the linear annotations of the plot are oddly intertwined and connected. They run in two dimensions: in actual reality-on the old trough, anchored in the Suez Canal during the Israeli aggression, and, in the imaginary, desired world of the characters ‚Äì experienced in the contra- revolution in Chile, in the victory of the African nations, in the massacres in Indonesia, and who knows where else. This compositional decision has enabled Stamatov to describe to the greatest degree the mentality and soul of his heroes, to reveal their insight into the revolutionary pulse of the times, their solidarity towards each justified human act, and their dedication.‚Äù * Stamatov V., Hostage and fugitive Fatherland 1997 p. 7 ‚Ä≥–í—Å–µ–∫–∏, –∂–∏–≤—è–ª –Ω–∞ –∑–µ–º—è—Ç–∞, –µ –µ–¥–Ω–∞ –º–∞–ª–∫–∞ —Ç–∞–π–Ω–∞, –Ω–∞–π-—á–µ—Å—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–∏–∑–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∞ –ø–æ —Ä–µ–¥ –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω–∏, —Å–∞–º–æ –µ–¥–∏–Ω –ø—ä—Ç–Ω–∏–∫, –∫–æ–π—Ç–æ –∏–¥–≤–∞ –∏ —Å–∏ –æ—Ç–∏–≤–∞, –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä—è–¥–∫–æ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—è–π–∫–∏ –ø–æ–¥–∏—Ä–µ —Å–∏ –Ω—è–∫–∞–∫–∞–≤–∞ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–Ω–∞ —Å–ª–µ–¥–∞. –í –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∞ —Å–º–µ—Ç–∫–∞ –≤—Å–∏—á–∫–∏ –¥–æ –µ–¥–∏–Ω, –ø—Ä–∏ —Ü—è–ª–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–∏ —Å—É–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç, —Å–º–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –ø—Ä–∞—Ö –∑–∞ –≤—è—Ç—ä—Ä–∞, –∑–∞ –¥–∞ –±—ä–¥–µ–º –Ω–∞–π-—á–µ—Å—Ç–æ –æ—â–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∂–∏–≤–µ –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–∏ –∑–∞–µ–¥–Ω–æ —Å –≤—Å–∏—á–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Å–∏ —Å–º–µ—à–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è, –Ω–µ—Ç—ä—Ä–ø–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –º–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Ç–∞, —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤–µ, –∞—Ö–º–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ...‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥Each of us who has been on this earth, is a tiny enigma frequently unspoken for various reasons, and is just a one-way passenger who comes and goes seldom leaving some tangible trail.

Saturnino Ohure was of Lotuho origin. He was born around 1921 and baptized at Torit, now in Eastern Equatoria state, in 1931. He studied at the Okaru and Gulu seminaries, and on 21 December 1946 was ordained a priest at Gulu. He and a companion were the first Lotukos to be ordained to the priesthood. In 1957 Father Saturnino and Ezboni Mondiri Gwanza, founded the Southern Sudan Federal Party (SSFP), which beat the Liberals and won forty seats in the 1958 parliamentary elections, the first after independence in 1956. Saturnino ran successfully for the Torit constituency, and became a leader of the southerners in the Constituent Assembly. When the SSFP spoke up in parliament for the north to consider Sudanese federation, as promised, the government arrested Mondiri and the SSFP broke up. In its place, Father Saturnino formed the Southern Block, with 25 members. The military government dissolved the assembly in November 1958. In 1961, Saturnino fled to Uganda to avoid arrest. Saturnino Ohure and Joseph Oduho moved from Uganda to Kinshasa, Zaire, where they were joined by William Deng and founded the Sudan African Closed Districts National Union (SACDNU) in 1962. Saturnino was killed by a Ugandan soldier near Kitgum on 22 January 1967. In January 2009 his body was exhumed from its grave in Kitgum and transported to Torit for reburial.

Depending on the regulatory jurisdiction, this information may be stored in the trial master file or TMF, which today takes the form of an electronic trial master file (eTMF). The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) published a consolidated guidance for industry on Good Clinical Practice in 1996 with the objective of providing a unified standard for the European Union, Japan, and the United States of America to facilitate mutual acceptance of clinical data by the regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions. This guidance document established the requirement across all ICH regions to establish trial master files containing essential documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced.[2] In some jurisdictions, for example the USA, there is no specific requirement for a trial master file. However, if the regulatory authority requires ICH GCP to be followed, then there is consequently a requirement to create and maintain a trial master file.[2]  History  In a clinical trial involving human subjects, a set of content known as a trial master file (TMF) must be produced in accordance with applicable international and local regulations. TMFs are a collection of documents and other artifacts which \\"individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards of Good Clinical Practice and with all applicable regulatory requirements.\\" Historically, TMFs have been paper-based content sets stored in physical file cabinets, central file rooms, or shelved in binders. The size and complexity of a TMF is in direct proportion to the length and complexity of the trial. The TMF is actively built during a trial, and must be maintained during a post-trial period for possible regulatory agency inspection in alignment with GCP and local country regulations. Traditionally, the TMF content names and requirements varies from sponsor to sponsor, creating a high degree of variability and inconsistency.  TMF definition  A trial master file contains essential documents for a clinical trial that may be subject to regulatory agency oversight. In the European Union (EU), TMFs have a different definition and set of requirements than in the US. The EU Commission's Directive 2005/28/EC 63 Chapter 4 states 'the trial master file shall consist of essential documents, which enable both the conduct of a clinical trial and the quality of the data produced to be evaluated. Those documents shall show whether the investigator and the sponsor have complied with the principles and guidelines of good clinical practice and with the applicable requirements.' The US FDA recognizes the use of TMFs as a significant piece of information but unlike the EU with its TMF regulation, there is no formal requirement for maintenance of essential documents in a TMF in US-based clinical trials in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. However, since the U.S. FDA require trials to be conducted in compliance with ICH GCP, there is an expectation that a trial master file will be created and maintained in accordance with those guidelines.  TMF content  The United States, the EU and Japan support the International Conference on Harmonisation or ICH. The ICH has published a minimum set of essential documents for the TMF. The minimum essential documents that are required for the registration of pharmaceutical products designed for human use are specified in the document 'ICH Good Clinical Practices,' published in 1997 by the ICHICH Good Clinical Practice P.47 Example ICH essential documents that would be required in any US, EU or Japan based clinical trial would include: signed protocol, audit certificate, subject enrollment log. Although the ICH guidelines are applicable to the three named ICH regions, many other countries have agreed to follow the guidelines and have incorporated the principles into their national medicines legislation. Creation of a TMF and inclusion of ICH essential documents is based on the discretion of the regulatory agency for the country in which the clinical trial is conducted. In addition, the submission of a marketing application will normally require compliance with the regulatory requirements of that country, including requirements specific to TMF content.  TMF content classification efforts  Since the requirement to maintain a TMF containing essential records was documented in the ICH GCP E6 Consolidated Guideline in 1996, trial sponsors have struggled to identify exactly what content the TMF should contain. ICH E6 includes details of only a minimum list of contents and no other regulation or guideline provides a comprehensive list of TMF content. As a result of the inconsistencies that were developing across the sector, an industry group comprising about 20 members from the Drug Information Association (DIA) decided to develop a standard contents list for the TMF. The TMF Reference Model team was formed in 2009 within the Document and Records Management Community of the DIA. The first version of the TMF Reference Model (TMF RM)[5] was released in June 2010 and was updated in February, 2011 (v1.1) based on feedback provided by Regulators, and again in December, 2011 (v1.2), based on feedback provided by users of the model as they used it within their respective organizations to structure their paper and electronic TMFs. v2.0 in June 2012 and included expansions to the reference model. Artifacts, the term used for content types, were added for Investigator Site Files, Device trials, and Investigator Initiated Studies. The scope of metadata within the model was also extended in v2.0 to include the trial process with which each TMF artifact is associated. In June 2015 v3.0https://tmfrefmodel.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/tmf-reference-model- version-3-0_16-june-20153.xlsx of the TMF Reference Model was published. v3.0 includes provision for sub-classification of artifacts; identified as sub- artifacts. Section 01.03 (Trial Committees) was revised to provide additional flexibility, allowing for limitless numbers of committees to be managed within a TMF with a common classification structure. It also included 12 new artifacts, 8 removed artifacts and 1 re-classified artifact. The DIA states on their website 'The TMF Reference Model provides an opportunity for standardization across the industry, and can be used by any company in an electronic or paper format'.[5] Whilst the DIA doesn't have a formal, public and open standards effort in place to develop a formal, published standard, the use of the Reference Model is helping industry to standardize on the content of the trial master file, on the nomenclature for trial master file artifacts and on the taxonomy used. For clarification purposes, there is no intention by the DIA or the members of the Reference Model Project for the TMF Reference Model to be considered a formal standard. In 2010, eTMF.org was formed as a non-profit effort 'To develop and publish a candidate standard that will enable global exchange, search and retrieval of TMF files.[6] eTMF.org published a white paper in October 2010 on how paper TMF content could be organized and deployed with electronic systems, using an open source, machine-readable, standards-based content classification system.[7] In September 2013 non-profit CareLex initiated an eTMF standards initiative under the OASIS standards organization to develop a consistent, machine-readable content classification model for eTMFs.[8] Rationale for the creation of the TMF Reference Model This initiative did not receive industry support and is now effectively dismantled. The TMF contains the trial sponsor‚Äôs and participating investigators‚Äô set of content which individually and collectively permit the evaluation of the conduct of a clinical trial and the quality of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate compliance with the standards of GCP and with all applicable regulatory requirements.[1] It is part of the evidence provided for regulatory inspection that verifies that the members of the trial team: ensured subject protection, compliance with regulations/Good Clinical Practice, and that scientifically robust benefit-risk data was produced. While ICH GCP E6 details the minimum essential documents, it addresses only a sub-set of TMF content that is required to be created and available for inspection. Documentation requirements for the set- up and maintenance of quality systems, electronic systems, safety monitoring, and proof of an adequate and well-controlled trial, to name a few, exist in various regulations across many countries or regions, but are not explicitly described in ICH GCP E6. Since there was no comprehensive, common industry model or best practice for a TMF, the objective of the TMF RM is to provide a single, unified interpretation of the regulations of the ICH regions as a document-type listing which would be accepted by all clinical trial stakeholders and which can be adopted or adapted by any company, institution or organization. It does not provide guidance on the process by which the content is created, managed or retained. TMF Reference Model shortcomings As of May 2013, the TMF RM v2.0 was made available in an electronic spreadsheet format which is suitable for human viewing. While the TMF RM is acceptable for paper TMFs, there is no support for TMF content exchange between computer systems. As the TMF RM is not a standard and is therefore not fixed, the TMF Model allows for flexibility in approach and any aspect of the model can be changed to suit an individual user's needs. Whilst this benefits the individual user, it results in variances in use and interpretation from one company to another. One issue with the use of the TMF RM as an eTMF classification model relates to duplicate artifact names in the TMF RM. The current release of the TMF RM v3.0 contains several duplicate artifact names such as 'Communications' or 'General', each with different contexts and uses but the same name, which makes the TMF artifact names more challenging to implement in eTMF search and retrieval where a unique set of search results is desired.[9] A second issue with the TMF RM relates to the length of the TMF RM artifact names - one artifact name is more than 64 characters. Different file systems have different limits on the depth of the filename path, creating potential problems and limitations based on the file system hierarchy in use.[10] Thirdly, with respect to the use of the TMF Reference Model as a database schema, the TMF RM v3.0 spreadsheet cannot be used without manual modification as a classification taxonomy in an electronic database.[11] Electronic systems which are not based on interoperability standards are often unable to communicate with other systems or applications.[12] The TMF RM currently lacks a controlled vocabulary based on published standards, which means that content indexed with the TMF RM artifact names and terms could return duplicate records, incorrect records or possibly no records at all if the model is not implemented appropriately.[13]The TMF RM doesn't provide standards-based methods to exchange the TMF model except for exchanging spreadsheet copies of TMF models. Today internet standards such as those promoted by the W3C are utilized for interoperable electronic exchange over legacy manual information exchange approaches. Development of eTMF Content Exchange Standards and Protocols In an effort to assure interoperability of eTMF data among clinical trial stakeholders, in September 2013 non-profit CareLex initiated an eTMF standards initiative under the OASIS Open standards development organization for the development of a global eTMF ISO standard supporting seamless eTMF content exchange and portability. CareLex and SureClinical Inc are the founding sponsors of the eTMF standards initiative, with participation on the curation of a controlled vocabulary by the National Cancer Institute. http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/9/prweb11088154.htmhttp://sureclinical.com/start- new-era-clinical-trials/The stated objective of the eTMF standards initiative is to \\"define an open, internationally recognized standard that will assure information interoperability among clinical trial stakeholders in the BioPharma industry.\\" According to minutes from the OASIS eTMF standard Technical Committee, the standards initiative is coordinating the efforts of clinical trial sponsors, CRO‚Äôs, research organizations, and vendors to develop an ISO standard. https://www.oasis- open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=etmf This effort did not receive industry support and has now been dismantled and replaced by the TMF Reference Model Exchange Mechanism. https://tmfrefmodel.com/ems As of February 2014, a partial list of members in the OASIS eTMF Standard Technical Committee includes CareLex, EMC, Forte Research, HL7, Mayo Clinic, Oracle, Paragon Solutions, Safe-BioPharma, SterlingBio, and SureClinical. National Cancer Institute worked with the OASIS team to curate eTMF terms. The Technical Committee was closed by TC Administration without publication of a standard on 17 November 2017 and is no longer active. https://www.oasis- open.org/committees/documents.php?wg_abbrev=etmf In June 2018, the TMF Reference Model project team published a specification https://tmfrefmodel.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/etmf-ems-v1-0.pdf and an example XML exchange file https://github.com/TmfRef/exchange- framework/blob/develop/example.xml for an eTMF Exchange Mechanism Standard https://tmfrefmodel.com/2018/05/31/etmf-ems-launch/ at the DIA Global Meeting in Boston, USA. Use of this standard will help facilitate the exchange of TMF content between systems.  TMF Recent developments  In February 2013, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) created a draft guideline document that recognizes the importance and legal equivalence of the TMF and the eTMF, and provided guidance to organizations implementing TMFs and eTMF systems. In the guideline document, EMA inspectors state that paper TMF documents may be stored in electronic eTMF systems, and after this process, that the paper may be destroyed. The use of eTMF systems for electronic storage is fully supported by the EMA in clinical trials as a replacement for paper. In a cautionary statement, the agency cites quality problems with TMFs and eTMFs due to document quality and discrepancies such as missing pages, improper labelling or missing documents.[16] In April 2014, the European Parliament approved Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, repealing Directive 2001/20/EC.[17] Article 57 of the Regulation requires that the TMF \\"shall at all times contain the essential documents relating to that clinical trial which allow verification of the conduct of a clinical trial and the quality of the data generated\\", confirming that the trial master file should be maintained contemporaneously. Article 58 requires that \\"the sponsor and investigator shall archive the content of the clinical trial master file for at least 25 years after the end of the clinical trial.\\" This requirement defines a minimum retention period across the EU for all clinical trial master files, irrespective of whether the data subsequently supports a marketing authorization approval.  Companies  Many contract research organizations (CROs) provide document management services to support trial master file management. In addition, there are a small number of niche companies that focus specifically on the trial master file. Their services include process and quality consultancy, management and filing of trial master file content and provision of trial master file document management technology solutions (eTMFs).

Early life and education Brittelle was raised in rural North Carolina, and often cites his upbringing in a small southern town with a conservative Christian environment as in opposition to his Brooklyn-based, agnostic Buddhist adulthood, a dissonance reflected in his musical output. Though a trained composer and orchestrator, he has often expressed frustration and dissolution with the world of academia and the classical industry in general. In undergrad, while enrolled at Vanderbilt University as a composition major, Brittelle experienced what he has referred to as a psychotic break, in part as a result of academic artistic constrictions, resulting in him briefly dropping out of school. He has claimed this breakdown, and his subsequent recovery, to be a formative experience in the development of his collage-based, non-developmental, genre-fluid style of composition. After being enrolled in a D.M.A. program at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York for a period of two years, Brittelle dropped out and re-enrolled privately with his primary teacher, Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici, for two subsequent years as a non- matriculating student. In addition to Del Tredici, Brittelle's musical mentors have included Mike Longo (longtime pianist/arranger for Dizzy Gillespie), and punk guitarist Richard Lloyd of Television. After dropping out of graduate school, Brittelle found himself attracted to pop, hip-hop, and punk music as a way of connecting more viscerally with an audience. This led to fronting a New York post-punk band and working at Sin-e, a heralded New York City music venue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. However following a severe vocal injury he returned to composition, armed with the desire to incorporate disparate and oppositional influences into one vision. Brittelle has stated that his first album \\"Mohair Time Warp\\" written in the wake of his vocal injury, is the first example of work that represented the full breadth of his musical vision. Career His work has been praised on NPR's All Things Considered and in many other major outlets, including the New York Times (Sunday Arts & Leisure), The Nation, the Los Angeles Times, MUSO, the Oxford Culture Review, and Wisconsin Public Radio. The New Yorker labeled Brittelle as ‚Äúa mercurial artist whose oeuvre embraces post-punk flamboyance, chamber music elegance, and much more.‚Äù Classical TV has stated: ‚ÄúWilliam Brittelle is creating a body of work that has no precedent, and marks him as one of the most promising heirs of the vital American maverick tradition.‚Äù Furthermore, Amid the Minotaurs, a piece commissioned and premiered by vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, was featured on the group's Grammy-winning debut album. Brittelle's discography includes Loving the Chambered Nautilus, a series of electro- acoustic chamber music pieces melding classic synthesizer sounds and drum programming with virtuosic and textured classical composition written for ACME (the American Contemporary Music Ensemble). The album was featured by NPR's All Things Considered, and Nautilus hit #1 on Amazon's Chamber Music Chart. The New York Times labeled the work ‚Äúbright and joyous,‚Äù and MUSO dubbed it ‚Äúa fast, fun, freedom-fueled flurry of a record.‚Äù Previous to Nautilus, Brittelle released Television Landscape, his fully composed, post-apocalyptic art rock concept album scored for orchestra, rock band, synths, and children's choir. Dubbed ‚Äúirresistible‚Äù by the New York Times and ‚Äúa glorious reclamation of lush sounds crusty critics have vilified for years‚Äù by Time Out New York, Television Landscape drew substantial praise from both rock and classical critics, leading the Los Angeles Times to say, ‚ÄúYou might wonder if Jane‚Äôs Addiction had discovered the soul of Debussy.‚Äù eMusic called the album ‚Äúexpansive, anthemic, all-encompassing, shot through with raw emotion‚Äù and named it to its \\"Albums of the Year\\" list. The album's centerpiece, the nostalgia-soaked soft rock ballad \\"Sheena Easton,\\" was singled out by PopMatters for its ‚Äúcomplex orchestrations‚Äù and ‚Äúmind-bending arrangements.‚Äù The Believer magazine chose the album's closing track \\"The Color of Rain\\" for inclusion in its prestigious annual music issue. Brittelle's compositions have been presented at venues across the world, including the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the Kennedy Center, Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Da Camera in Houston, Seattle's Town Hall, the Ecstatic Music Festival in New York, the Kahserne in Switzerland, the Gothenburg Symphony Chamber Series in Sweden, the Freemantle Arts Center in Perth, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. His music has been commissioned by the Seattle Symphony, the Indianapolis Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony, the North Carolina Symphony, the Walker Art Center, the Liquid Music Series, the Alabama Symphony, Mass MoCA, and the Basel Sinfonietta among others. Notable commissions include Love Letter for Arca, piece for synthesizer and orchestra, and Obituary Birthday, a requiem for Kurt Cobain, with the Seattle Symphony, Oh Albert: An LSD Oratorio for the Basel Sinfonietta, Psychedelics for Roomful of Teeth and full concert choir, and Dido's Lament Revisited for Wild Up and Zola Jesus for the Ecstatic Music Festival. Past collaborative works include orchestral arrangements for the bands Lower Dens and Wye Oak (band) and electronic artists Oneohtrix Point Never and Son Lux. A further recent project includes Si Otsedoha (We're Still Here), a collaboration with the Easter Band of the Cherokee Indian and the North Carolina Symphony which serves as platform for a severely marginalized community to re-contextualize its suffering as strength, to connect with its oppressor in a proud and public way from a position of power. The work, commissioned by the Eastern Band in effort to create new art featuring the Cherokee language, premiered in October 2018 with a multi-date tour of North Carolina. Brittelle has also been the recipient of grants and awards from the National Endowment of the Arts, American Music Center, American Composers Forum, the Jerome Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, NYSCA, and ASCAP. He formerly served on the faculty of The New School in New York City, developing and teaching courses in Post-Genre Music and the Ethos of Punk.

In order to supply the Willamette Valley with wood products from forests in the Northern Oregon Coast Range, the railroad followed the Luckiamute River to connect Independence, a city along the Willamette River, to Valsetz, a logging community in the Coast Range whose name is a portmanteau of the railroad's name. In September 1978, when it became no longer profitable for the logging industry, most of the railroad was abandoned. In 1985, brothers Dave and Mike Root bought the intact remnant of the Valley and Siletz line and combined it with the former Longview Portland & Northern Grand Ronde Division line to form a company called the Willamette Valley Railroad. The Valley and Siletz line was separated from the Willamette Valley Railroad in 1988. It operated until May 1992, serving the Mountain Fir Lumber Company.

Gameplay  The game is played with touch controls on a 7x7 square grid. In each round, the player places a disc that falls from the top of the grid. Each disc has a number 1‚Äì7, or a blank. Whenever the number of any disc matches the number of contiguous discs in a row or column, that disc disappears and also hits any blank discs it touches. When a blank is hit twice, it turns into a numbered disc. After a number of turns, the round ends and a full row of blank discs emerges from the bottom of the grid. There is no time limit, and discs may be dropped at the player's leisure. The objective is to eliminate discs and score combos for as long as possible until either the grid overflows or the grid is full and it is impossible to place another disc. If the player clears the screen of all discs, then the player is given a 70,000 point bonus. There are three modes available ‚Äì \\"Normal Mode\\" is the basic way to play. The player will drop a mixture of colored and gray discs, and the levels will come more frequently as the player goes on; \\"Blitz Mode\\" starts with the levels coming quickly, but the player won't be given gray discs to drop; \\"Sequence Mode\\" is exactly like Normal Mode, except the player (and everyone else in the world) will get the same discs in the same order every time.

She is signed to a joint-record label venture with G7 Records / Universal Music Canada / Cherrytree Records / Interscope Records and also signed to Waka Flocka Flame's Brick Squad Monopoly label.  Early life  Reema Major was born in Khartoum, Sudan, to a South Sudanese mother and an Emirati origin father Her mother moved to Kenya and later to Uganda before settling in 1998 in Canada through the United Nations refugee programme.

He is best known for being the husband of the Quaker martyr, Mary Dyer, who was executed for her Quaker activism. Sailing from England as a young man with his wife, Dyer first settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but like many members of the Boston church became a supporter of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and signed a petition in support of Wheelwright. For doing this, he was disenfranchised and disarmed, and with many other supporters of Hutchinson, he signed the Portsmouth Compact, and settled on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay. Within a year of arriving there, he and others followed William Coddington to the south end of the island where they established the town of Newport. Once in Newport, Dyer was very active in civil affairs, holding a number of offices, particularly those using his clerical skills such as clerk and secretary. The political alignment of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport was in flux for the first decade of government there, and Coddington had gone to England to obtain a commission to keep the island independent with him as governor. By 1651 Dyer and others had greatly tired of Coddington's rule, and he was one of three men who went to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. Being successful, Dyer returned with the news in 1653, but his wife, Mary, who had been there at the same time, remained in England. Mary returned from England in 1657 after being there for five years, and had become a zealous Quaker convert. Banned from Massachusetts, she nevertheless defied the authorities and returned in 1659, being sentenced to hang, but getting a stay of execution while on the gallows. Her last trip to Boston in 1660 resulted in her execution and martyrdom. Following Mary's death, Dyer remarried, and continued his public service, while having some legal entanglements with William Coddington. He was dead by late 1677, though no record for his death has been found.  Early life  William Dyer was baptized at Kirkby Laythorpe, Lincolnshire, England, on 19 September 1609, the son of William Dyer. In 1625, while a teenager, he was apprenticed to Walter Blackborne, a fishmonger, and 16 years later, while he was in New England, he was taxed back in England as a member of the \\"Fishmonger's Company,\\" though his profession before leaving there was that of a milliner. Dyer was married at Saint Martin-in-the-Fields in Westminster on 27 October 1633 to Mary Barrett (their oldest son Samuel named a son Barrett). In 1635, Dyer and his wife sailed from England to New England. Mary was likely pregnant, or gave birth during the voyage, because on 20 December 1635 their son Samuel was baptized at the Boston church, the same month that the Dyers joined the church. Dyer became a freeman of Boston on 3 March the following year. Once in Boston the Dyers became attracted to the preachings of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during what is called the Antinomian Controversy, and in March 1637 Dyer signed a petition in support of Reverend Wheelwright, in it saying that \\"the court had condemned the truth of Christ.\\" Half a year later, on 15 November, he was disenfranchised for signing this petition, and then on 20 November he and others were ordered to deliver up all guns, pistols, swords, powder and shot because the \\"opinions and revelations of Mr. Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinson have seduced and led into dangerous errors many of the people here in New England.\\" In October 1637 Mary Dyer gave birth to a premature, stillborn and deformed child, which following the Dyer's departure from Massachusetts, Boston magistrate John Winthrop had exhumed. In March 1638 Winthrop wrote the following about the Dyers and the infant: \\"The wife of one William Dyer, a milliner in the New Exchange, a very proper and fair woman, and both of them notoriously infected with Mrs. Hutchinson's errors, and very censorious and troublesome (she being of a very proud spirit, and much addicted to revelations) had been delivered of a child some few months before...it had a face but no head...\\" Winthrop went on to describe the deformities, and add his own embellishments, and declared that this was divine reaction to the sinful errors of Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and their followers.  Rhode Island  Scores of the followers of Wheelwright and Hutchinson were ordered out of the Massachusetts colony, but before leaving, a group of them, including Dyer, signed what is sometimes called the Portsmouth Compact, establishing a non-sectarian civil government upon the universal consent of the inhabitants, with a Christian focus. This document was penned by Dyer, he signing his name and then adding the title \\"clerk.\\" Planning initially to settle in New Netherland, the group was persuaded by Roger Williams to purchase some land of the Indians on the Narragansett Bay. They settled on the north east end of Aquidneck Island, and established a settlement they called Pocasset, but in 1639 changed the name to Portsmouth. William Coddington was elected the first leader of the settlement, and given the Biblical title of Judge. Portsmouth Compact; Dyer's name appears 11th on the list A year after arriving in Portsmouth there was discord among the leadership of the settlement, and several of the leaders decided to go elsewhere. Dyer was one of nine men to sign an agreement on 28 April 1639 whereby a new plantation would be formed. The men and their families soon moved to the south end of Aquidneck Island, establishing the settlement of Newport, once again under the leadership of Coddington. Once established in Newport, Dyer and three others were tasked in June 1639 to proportion the new lands, and within the next year he was assigned 87 acres. In 1640 the two Aquidneck Island towns of Portsmouth and Newport united under a single government, and Dyer was the Secretary for them during the entire period that the island remained under its own authority, from 1640 to 1647. Roger Williams, who envisioned a union of all four settlements on the Narragansett Bay, went to England to obtain a patent bringing all four towns under one government. Williams was successful in obtaining this document late in 1643, and it was brought from England and read to representatives of the four towns in 1644. Coddington was opposed to the Williams patent and managed to resist union with Providence until 1647 when representatives of the four towns ultimately met and adopted the Williams patent of 1643/4. With all of the Narragansett settlements now under one government, Dyer was elected the General Recorder for the entire colony in 1648. Coddington was unhappy with the consolidated government, and wanted colonial independence for the two island towns, and decided to go to England to present his case to the Colonial Commissioners in London. In April 1651, the Council of State of England gave Coddington the commission of a separate government for the island of Aquidneck and for the smaller neighboring island of Conanicut (later Jamestown, Rhode Island), with him as governor. Henry Bull of Newport said that Coddington was welcomed upon his return from England, and that the majority of people accepted him as governor. From 1650 to 1653, most of which time was during the island's separation from Providence, Dyer served as the Attorney General. For reasons that are not clear in existing records, criticism of Coddington arose as soon as he returned with his commission. The venerable Dr. John Clarke voiced his opposition to the island governor, and he and Dyer were sent to England as agents of the discontents to get the Coddington commission revoked. Simultaneously, the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand, and the three men sailed for England in November 1651. Mary Dyer had sailed to England just before the three men departed. Because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch, the men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652. Whether true or not, Coddington was accused of taking sides with the Dutch on matters of colonial trade, and in October 1652 his commission for the island government was revoked. Dyer was the messenger who returned to Rhode Island the following February, bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams' Patent of 1643, while his wife remained in England. The reunion of the colony was to take place that spring, but the mainland commissioners refused to come to the island to meet, and the separation of mainland from island was extended for another year. During this interim period, John Sanford was elected as governor of the island towns, while Gregory Dexter became president of the mainland towns. In May 1653 Dyer received a commission from the General Assembly in preparation for military action against the Dutch. Captain John Underhill was selected as Commander in Chief upon the land, and Captain William Dyer became Commander in Chief upon the sea. The following year he had some harsh words for Coddington and Richard Tew, who he accused of making \\"encroachments upon the highway.\\" In 1655 Dyer's name appears on a list of freemen from Newport.  Execution of Mary Dyer  Mary Dyer being led to her execution In 1657, Mary Dyer returned from England, after being away for five years. While there, she became a Quaker and a minister of that denomination, and upon disembarking at Boston she was jailed by the authorities for her beliefs and religious outpourings. Following the intercession of her husband, she was released, but Dyer was bound to not let her lodge in any town of the Massachusetts Bay Colony nor to speak to anyone during the journey home. Though banned from returning to Massachusetts under threat of death, Mary nevertheless went back to Boston in 1659 and was condemned to hang with two other Quakers. While she was on the scaffold with the noose around her neck, her execution was halted, and she was sent back to Rhode Island, after which she traveled to Long Island. One more time Mary returned to Boston, and on the last day of May 1660 she was brought before Governor John Endecott, where she was questioned. Following her responses, she was ordered to be hanged the following day. On the gallows, she was encouraged to repent by Reverend John Wilson, her former pastor at the Boston church, and to not be so deluded by the devil. Following her execution, the Friends' records of Portsmouth noted her death: \\"Mary Dyer, the wife of William Dyer of Newport in Rhode Island: She was put to death at the town of Boston with the like cruel hand as the Martyrs were in Queen Mary's time...\\" Later life Following his wife's death, William Dyer was remarried to a woman named Catherine by about 1664, and continued his public service. In 1661 he was a Newport Commissioner, in 1663 he was one of several prominent citizens named in the Rhode Island Royal Charter, from 1664 to 1666 he was a Deputy, from 1665 to 1668 he was the General Solicitor, and in 1669 he was secretary to the council. In 1670 he was involved in a number of deeds with his sons, which he used to settle the terms of his estate. No death date has been found for Dyer, but he was dead by 24 October 1677 when his widow sued the widow of his son, Samuel. Also, Governor Benedict Arnold's will, dated 24 December 1677, mentions William Dyer, Senior, now late deceased.  Family  Six of the eight children of William and Mary Dyer grew to maturity and married. Their oldest surviving son, Samuel, married Ann Hutchinson, the daughter of Edward Hutchinson and Catharine Hamby, and the granddaughter of William and Anne Hutchinson. Dyer had one known child with his second wife.

Ansell is a Chicago-based physician, social epidemiologist and author. His efforts at both the national and local levels have advanced concerns about health inequities and the structure of the US health care system. His years as a provider to the medically underserved have made him a vocal supporter of single-payer health care. He spent seventeen years at Cook County Hospital currently known as John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County upon which the medical T.V. drama ER was based. Ansell was inspired by his time at Cook County Hospital to write a memoir and social history entitled, County: Life, Death, and Politics in Chicago‚Äôs Public Hospital. County was hailed as a \\"landmark book\\" by Julia Keller of the Chicago Tribune, aiming \\"to inform and to inspire\\" readers about the disparities in health care. In the book, Ansell argues that only a single-payer solution that provides access to all US residents regardless of circumstances can provide relief for those closed out of the health care system.  Early years and education  Ansell spent his formative years in Binghamton, New York. After high school, he attended Franklin and Marshall College (B.A., 1974) and medical school at the SUNY Upstate Medical University (M.D., 1978) He received his Masters of Public Health from the University of Illinois School of Public Health (1991)  Medical education and training  After finishing medical school in 1978, Ansell trained at Chicago‚Äôs Cook County Hospital, one of the nation's oldest and foremost public hospitals. After residency, Ansell served at County as attending physician for 13 years, joining other physicians in a new Division of General Medicine/Primary Care.  Efforts against patient dumping  In the mid 1980s, Ansell and colleagues noted a marked increase in the numbers of patients transferred to public hospitals around Chicago and the US, due to a lack of health insurance. This practice is known as patient dumping. In 1984, Ansell joined a project led by Robert Schiff], M.D., to expose patient dumping in Chicago. He contributed to the article \\"Transfers to a Public Hospital\\" that appeared in the February 1986 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, criticizing patient dumping and the unnecessary deaths it caused. Efforts against patient dumping like this eventually led to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act that made the emergency transfers of patients illegal.  Health Inequity Work  Ansell founded and directed one of first programs in the US to battle race-based disparity in health care, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program at Cook County Hospital, in 1984. In 1995, Ansell left Cook County Hospital to become Chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine of Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, the city's largest private safety-net hospital. Among other activities at Mount Sinai, in 2002 he founded the Sinai Urban Health Institute a major health-disparity research and intervention center along with the late Steven Whitman, PhD who served as its director. In 2006, he and Dr. Whitman helped expose the racial breast cancer mortality gap in Chicago in an article they published. In response, they joined with others to found the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Taskforce, a group dedicated to the elimination of this disparity in the Chicago area. In 2015, Ansell helped found the DePaul-Rush Center for Community Health Equity a Chicago-based health equity educational and research center based at DePaul University and Rush University Medical Center.

Centered on Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, one of the most prominent thinkers of the Polish Enlightenment, the Forge (Ku≈∫nica) activists formed a radical, leftist faction of the reform supporters (the Patriotic Party, an organization that has been called the first Polish political party). They disseminated news and ideas of the French Revolution in Poland. Their pamphlets criticized feudalism and privileges of the nobility. Their name, Ko≈Ç≈Çataj's Forge, was given to them by their political opponents, and was originally pejorative. Early development Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj put forward the manifesto of the Forge in a series of anonymous letters to the Marshal of the Sejm, Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski. These letters were published in 1788-1789 as: To Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski... Several Letters from an Anonymous Writer (literal translation of Do Stanis≈Çawa Ma≈Çachowskiego... Anonyma list√≥w kilka). The work has also been rendered into English as the \\"Letters from an Anonymous Writer\\" or \\"Anonymous Letters to Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski\\". They were supplemented in 1790 by the \\" of the Polish Nation\\" (Prawo polityczne narodu polskiego). Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj criticized the dysfunctional politics of the Commonwealth, which were dominated by powerful magnates, and called for various reforms such as the strengthening of executive (royal) power, improvement of the state's military, elimination of liberum veto, universal taxation, and the emancipation of underprivileged classes (primarily, burghers and the peasantry). The Forge's projects were highly refined; in fact the \\"Political Law\\", which contained the proposal for a new constitution became a major inspiration for the Constitution of 3 May. Public support Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj and other publicists from his group were quite able to influence contemporary public opinion in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They were very active, and campaigned not only in the parliament (the Great Sejm) but also outside of it, gathering support from regular citizens. The Forge writers were particularly adept at ridiculing their political opponents; so in addition to serious treaties, articles and letters, they often published satirical pamphlets. Many of the Forge activists came from outside of the Polish nobility (szlachta), which traditionally saw state politics as their exclusive territory. The Forge had strong ties to the bourgeoisie of Polish cities and towns, and to a significant degree was able to influence and control their demonstrations. This was used to bring up the fact of the growing importance of the burghers, the need to include them in state politics, and to deliver a warning to the more traditionally-minded politicians about the growing dangers of resisting change. The group was small enough that one of their principal meeting places was Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's home in Warsaw. Key activists of the Forge, besides Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj himself, included Franciszek Salezy Jezierski, Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski, J√≥zef Meier (Mejer), Antoni Trebicki (Trƒôbicki), Franciszek Jelski, Tomasz Maruszewski, Jan Dembowski and Kazimierz Konopka. Other supporters included Franciszek Zab≈Çocki, Jan ≈öniadecki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz. Many of them emigrated after the victory of the Targowica Confederation in the War in Defense of the Constitution, or after the final Third Partition of Poland. Whereas Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj himself was more of a moderate, some of the Forge's followers were more radical, and many of the Polish Jacobins of the 1794 Ko≈õciuszko Uprising were Forge's members. Forge activists usually met in the Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's house that was located in the Solec neighborhood in Warsaw.

It humorously and ironically presented history of a given regiment, as well as its contemporary fate. ≈ªurawiejkas were also used in cavalry regiments of the Imperial Russian Army, as the tradition of writing them, as well as the very name of the couplet, comes from Russian cavalry, and was taken over by the Poles in the interbellum period. Famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov is considered the father of ≈ºurawiejka, as he wrote first couplets while serving as a junker in the Russian Army. ≈ªurawiejkas were sung by Polish cavalrymen at several occasions, mostly during different parties, and were usually associated with dancing. Returning topics of most of them are the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, drinking, looting, and women. They described a military unit in black humor, using derogatory terms and swear words.  ≈ªurawiejka in the Polish Army  Following the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, the couplets quickly gained popularity among cavalry regiments of the Polish Army. Some historians trace back Polish ≈ºurawiejkas to the ‚ÄúUhlan March‚Äù, written in 1863, during the January Uprising. Furthermore, during World War I, soldiers of the Polish Legions sang the ‚ÄúSong of Wasowicz‚Äôs Squadron‚Äù, which described a cavalry charge during the Charge of Rokitna (13 June 1915), led by rotmistrz Zbigniew Dunin-Wasowicz. \\"Nasz WƒÖsowicz, ch≈Çop morowy, Zbi≈Ç Moskali w Cucy≈Çowej.

Prior to the 1900s, Bayfield group sandstone was also variously named Lake Superior Sandstone, brownstone, or redstone,Eckert, p. 33 and prefixed by the quarry location. The name was changed to the Bayfield group as its relation to Jacobsville Sandstone (once known as Lake Superior Sandstone) is uncertain. Formation The Bayfield group is irregularly bedded, in contrast to the even, calcareous sandstones in southern Wisconsin.Bulletin 1912, p. 29 The geological formation is entirely devoid of fossils.Bulletin 1912, p. 32 The Bayfield group overlies the much thicker Oronto Group.Bulletin 1912, p. 48 The formation, 4300 feet thick, is divided into three: Chequamegon Sandstone, Devils Island Sandstone, and Orienta Sandstone. The Chequamegon Sandstone is a red and white sandstone 1000 feet thick. The Devils Island Sandstone is a 300-foot thick, pink-to-white pure quartz sandstone with significant ripples. The Orienta Sandstone is 3000 feet thick and similar to the Chequamegon Sandstone, but with a higher feldspar concentration. The Bayfield group is a member of the Keweenawan Supergroup. Properties The Bayfield group is a predominantly red sandstone, though it varies through lighter colors such as pink, yellow, light brown, gray and white.Bulletin 1912, p. 26 A minority portion is a dark \\"brownstone\\" which is a good building material. The colors occur in bands, though mottling and other irregular markings are common.Bulletin 1912, p. 31 As most of the stone's constituents are the end- products of weathering, it is very resistant to atmospheric action. Composition The grains vary from coarse pebbly grits to shale. The finer the grains, the darker their color. The grains are cemented primarily by quartz, with iron oxide coating the grains. In order of abundance, the Bayfield group is composed of: quartz, feldspar (both orthoclase and plagioclase), mica, iron oxide (both magnetite and limonite), chert, and ferromangesian minerals. The quartz usually comprises about 75% of the stone.Bulletin 1912, p. 27 Based on an average of 52 samples, the Orienta Sandstone is composed of: 33.3% nonundulatory quartz, 29.7% undulatory quartz, 17.3% potassium feldspar and 9.4% silicic volcanic clasts.

However, the heavy influence of speculators helped lead to a decline that paralleled the Panic of 1893. By the time that the quarries could recoup their losses, paler limestones had gained favor, partly due to the \\"White City\\" of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. By 1897, very little stone was being extracted. By 1912, only two quarries remained producing high quality Bayfield group sandstone.

Bruske was a baseball correspondent for Sporting Life from 1905 to 1914. He also wrote for several Michigan newspapers from 1898 to 1910. He covered the Detroit Tigers for 14 years, including their American League championship seasons of 1907, 1908, and 1909. During the 1910s, he became involved in the automobile business. In 1910, he led the \\"Under Three Flags\\" automobile expedition from Quebec City to Mexico City, and in 1911 he participated in the Glidden Tour, a cross-country automobile race. From 1914 to 1915, he managed the Maxwell automobile racing team that included Barney Oldfield and Eddie Rickenbacker. Bruske also worked in the advertising business for many years. During the 1910s, he was at different times the adverting and publicity director for four of Detroit's leading automobile manufacturers, E-M-F Company, Studebaker, Maxwell, and Harroun. In his later years, he handled the advertising accounts for Fisher Body and Firestone/Oldfield Tires. Early years Bruske was born in Charlotte, Michigan, and raised in Saginaw, Michigan. He was the son of Rev. August F. Bruske, who served as president of Alma College. Bruske attended Alma College where he was a champion tennis player and an infielder and captain of the baseball team. He graduated from Alma in 1898. Newspaper career After graduating from Alma, Bruske held reporting jobs with the Lansing State Republican, the Grand Rapids Herald, The Grand Rapids Press, and the Saginaw Evening News. While in Grand Rapids, he covered the city's Western League baseball team that featured three future inductees into the Baseball Hall of Fame -- Rube Waddell, Sam Crawford, and Jake Beckley. In 1901, Bruske joined the Detroit Tribune and became the head of its sports department in 1902. He established Michigan's first Sunday sports section while he was with the Tribune. He also established Michigan's first color newspaper supplement with a green sports section at the Tribune. In 1906, Bruske moved to the Detroit Times as the sports editor. In January 1905, Bruske also became the Detroit correspondent for the Sporting Life, a national weekly founded in 1883 devoted to coverage of the sport of baseball. Bruske's baseball articles were regularly featured in Sporting Life from January 1905 through April 1914.(Bruske's final column for Sporting Life) Automobile career In May 1910, Bruske left his position as the sporting editor of the Detroit Times to become the publicity agent for the E-M-F Company, which was at the time the fourth largest automobile manufacturer in the United States. In June 1910, Bruske led a pioneering automobile expedition known as \\"Under Three Flags.\\" Bruske and a small crew drove a Flanders \\"20\\" roadster (an early offering by E-M-F Company) from Quebec City to Mexico City in 58 days from June 6 to August 3, 1910. The E-M-F Company subsequently published a book about the expedition, likely written by Bruske. Alfred Henry Spink, the founder of The Sporting News, called Bruske's \\"Under Three Flags\\" expedition \\"the most remarkable journey ever placed to the credit of a car of its power.\\" In October 1911, Bruske participated in the Glidden Tour, a cross-country automobile race from New York to California. By 1912, the E-M-F Company had combined with Studebaker, and Bruske was in charge of advertising and publicity for Studebaker. He toured the country arranging exhibitions, overseeing the company's participation in road races, and writing newspaper stories promoting Studebaker automobiles. In December 1914, he left Studebaker to manage the Maxwell automobile racing team. The Maxwell team was one of the leading automobile racing teams in the 1910s and included among its stars, Barney Oldfield, Ray Harroun (winner of the 1911 Indianapolis 500), Eddie Rickenbacker, and Billy Carlson. In April 1915, after equipping the team's cars with Master carburetors, the Maxwell team took first and second place in a race in Venice,California. In July 1915, the Maxwell team, with Rickenbacker driving, won the 300-mile Sioux City sweepstakes. In August 1915, the Maxwell automobile company withdrew from the automobile racing business, and Bruske was given a position overseeing the company's newspaper work. From 1917 to 1919, he was the advertising manager for Ray Harroun's Harroun Motors Corp. In a draft registration card completed at the time of World War I, Bruske described himself as an \\"advertising writer\\" for the Harroun Motors Corp. He was living at that time with his wife, Mary Plum Bruske, at 195 Pallister Street in Detroit.Draft registration card for Paul Hale Bruske, born November 7, 1877. Family and later years After two years with Harroun, Bruske joined Power, Alexander & Jenkins Co., an advertising agency in 1919. Bruske remained active in the advertising business in his later years, with clients that included Fisher Body and Firestone/Oldfield Tires. Bruske married a fellow Alma student, Mary Wheeler Plum. They had a son, Paul Wheeler Bruske and a daughter Barbara Plum Bruske.

The script had been placed on the 2010 Brit List, a film- industry-compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film. With seven votes, the film was placed third.  Plot  Four men emerge from a building wearing gas masks, having committed a robbery, and leave on motorbikes. At the same time DI Max Lewinsky (McAvoy) is reporting by phone to his superiors that \\"Sternwood is doing it tonight\\". Lewinsky then sets off in pursuit of the gang in his car. He fails to catch them and suffers an injury after being shot in the leg by Jacob Sternwood (Strong), who could have easily killed him but seems to have an aversion to killing. Three years later Lewinsky is still suffering from his wound and has to use drugs for the pain. He works with a sidekick, DS Sarah Hawks (Andrea Riseborough), with whom he is on good terms. While escorting a prisoner, Dean Warns (Johnny Harris), who is suspected of being involved in an illegal arms trade, they are met by ambitious Commander Thomas Geiger (David Morrissey) and DCI Nathan Bartnick (Daniel Mays) who inform them that Warns is to be released due to lack of evidence. Warns had been seen by a security guard in a container yard in connection with the offence but now the guard has retracted his statement. Lewinsky learns that Sternwood's son, Ruan, has collapsed on an aircraft runway while travelling under an alias and has been hospitalized. Ruan had made a call to an Iceland landline number before he collapsed, so the police intend to go to Iceland to find Jacob Sternwood, but Lewinsky has no faith in this idea. The police ignore Lewinsky's doubts; they go to Iceland and surround Sternwood's property but he escapes, leaving behind a booby trap bomb which kills several policemen. Lewinsky suggests that Ruan's location be made public to draw Jacob out of hiding, and offers to stay in the hospital with Sarah to await Jacob's appearance. Jacob goes to the hospital to confirm his son's situation and manages to leave without being caught. Ruan dies shortly afterwards but it is decided not to reveal this on the off-chance that Sternwood will return to try to free his son. Lewinsky decides to find the security guard who had retracted his statement, thinking that Sternwood may have forced him to do so. The security guard refuses to help. Meanwhile, Sarah follows Warns to the container yard to look for evidence but is intercepted by Warns who kills her. Bartnick is contacted by Sternwood. Bartnick arranges to meet Sternwood at a club to tell him who shot Ruan. Geiger, having tapped the phone call, informs Lewinsky about the meeting. Lewinsky goes to the club to anticipate Sternwood's arrival but Bartnick and Warns are already there working together and Lewinsky is caught in a trap. A gunfight follows between Lewinsky, Bartnick and Warns, and Sternwood, during which Bartnick is fatally shot by Sternwood. Sternwood decides to protect Lewinsky, apparently as a result of their previous encounter when Sternwood had shot Lewinsky, however after the gunfight Lewinsky attacks Sternwood but is overcome by him then Sternwood demands to be taken to see his son. Lewinsky complies without revealing that Ruan is dead, and takes Sternwood to the hospital mortuary. Sternwood is at once heartbroken and incensed by the realization that his son is dead. Whilst at the hospital mortuary Lewinsky discovers that Sarah is dead when he comes across her body on a stretcher. Sternwood and Lewinsky now confront Warns at his house. Warns is told that his collaboration with Geiger is known, along with the details of the gunrunning trade. A shootout ensues resulting in Warns being taken prisoner and forced to contact Geiger to arrange a meeting at \\"The Punch\\", a section of the container yard. Lewinsky and Sternwood force Warns to go with them to the meeting. When Geiger arrives they ambush him. Lewinsky blames Geiger for Sarah's death and accuses him of complicity in the arms deal among other criminal dealings. Geiger admits \\"turning a blind eye\\" on many occasions. Suddenly armed military contractors from Kincade make their presence known by opening fire which is followed by another gunfight during which Lewinsky kills Warns and Sternwood shoots Geiger dead. Lewinsky and Sternwood now face each other and Lewinsky raises his gun, but recalling the earlier time when Sternwood deliberately did not kill him, allows him to flee then presents himself to the arriving police.

Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 5.63/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Welcome to the Punch is a little deeper and more thoughtful than most police dramas -- but not quite enough to surmount its thinly written characters and numbing violence.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated it 2/5 stars and called it an ambitious but predictable film that \\"runs out of steam\\" by the end.

Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"But despite its fast pacing and well-staged action set-pieces, the film fails to make much of an impression.\\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"derivative, dumb fun\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that it is an \\"enjoyable absurdity\\" that is unintentionally funny yet still recommended.

Subsequently, the wider region was referred to by Europeans as \\"Tartary\\" or \\"Tartaria\\".

After the fall of the Liao, the Tatars experienced pressure from the Jurchen Jin dynasty and were urged to fight against the other Mongol tribes. The Tatars lived on the fertile pastures around Hulun Nuur and Buir Nuur and occupied a trade route to China in the 12th century. Kara-khanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari noted that the Tatars are bilingual, speaking Turkic alongside their own language.Maƒßm≈´d al-Ka≈°ƒüari. \\"Dƒ´wƒÅn LuƒüƒÅt al-Turk\\".

Under the leadership of his grandson Batu Khan, Tatars accompanied Mongols westwards, driving with them many of the Turkic peoples toward the plains of Russia in the Turkic migrations. Their name Tatar was used by Russians and Europeans to denote Mongols as well as Turkic peoples under Mongol rule, especially in the Golden Horde. Later, it was used for any Turkic- or even Mongolic-speaking people encountered by the Russians. Eventually however, the name stuck onto the Turkic Muslims of Ukraine and Russia, namely, the descendants of Muslim Volga Bulgars, Kipchaks, and Cumans, and Turkicized Mongols or Turko-Mongols (Nogais), as well as other Turkic-speaking peoples (Siberian Tatars, Qasim Tatars, Mishar Tatars).

The leaves are 10 to 13 centimeters long and are made up of several pairs of leaflets each measuring up to 7 centimeters long by 3 wide. The leaves have tendrils at their tips. The plant produces inflorescences of 6 to 9 flowers with curving corollas up to 3 centimeters long. The flowers are yellowish white turning rose-pink with maturity and then purplish with age. The fruit is a black legume pod 9 or 10 centimeters long containing spherical black seeds. The flowers are visited by the  ªi ªiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and the  ªamakihi (Loxops virens virens), two species of Hawaiian honeycreepers. The shape and color of the flowers suggest they may be pollinated by birds. This plant was first collected in 1794 by Archibald Menzies on Mauna Loa.

Founded in 1915, it was a municipal organization which included a sanatorium, dispensaries, and other auxiliary agencies essential in the control of tuberculosis. The sanitarium was the largest municipal sanitarium in the country and had a capacity of 950 beds. History In 1911, the city of Chicago bought to establish the sanitarium in what is now the North Park Village Nature Center. It operated from 1915 through the 1970s. Dr. Theodore B. Sachs was its first president. Dr. J. Robert Thompson served as chief of laboratories from 1945 to 1970. By the 1950s and 1960s, the disease incidence was drastically reduced through improved public hygiene, vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. When the sanitarium became under-used by the 1970s, the city of Chicago decided to redevelop the property as North Park Village, to include senior citizen housing, a school for the developmentally disabled, a nature preserve, and parkland. In 1977, the Chicago Park District began leasing and re-developing the site. The sanitarium site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Geography It occupied a square in the extreme northwest section of the city, at the corner of North Pulaski Road (formerly Crawford Avenue) and Bryn Mawr Avenue. There was a special service entrance at Peterson Avenue. The work of improving the grounds was done under the direction of O. C. Simonds & Company, Landscape Gardeners. A broad stretch of ground was reserved for farming and gardening. The grounds were divided into two sections: the south section reserved for the cottages for ambulant women patients; the north section, for men. East of the Administration building were the dining halls, one for men patients and another for women patients. Nearby were a group of Infirmary buildings with a capacity of about 300 beds. The power house and laundry building were at the extreme eastern point. The \\"Open Air Cottages\\" for ambulant men and women patients formed two separate groups of buildings. Of the initial 28 cottages, 20 were for adults and 8 for children with the total capacity of about 380 beds. An additional 12 cottages were added at a later time, increasing the number of beds for ambulant cases to 650. The Nurses' Building, the garage, farmhouse and barns were located elsewhere on the grounds.

He compiled these albums from his weekly podcast, where he challenged himself to write, record, and produce a new song within a week, every week, for an entire year. He had done this to prove to himself, and to fans, that he was capable of working with a deadline. Thing a Week One Thing a Week One is the first album of the series, and Jonathan Coulton's fourth studio album. It contains some of Coulton's earliest hit songs, including \\"Shop Vac\\" and a cover of Sir Mix-a-Lot's \\"Baby Got Back.\\" This album also features \\"W's Duty,\\" one of very few songs Coulton has written about a real life topic. The tenth Thing a Week, \\"When I'm 25 or 64\\", is missing from this album due to copyright restrictions (it is a mashup of The Beatles' \\"When I'm Sixty-Four \\"and Chicago's \\"25 or 6 to 4\\"). It may be freely downloaded from Coulton's website.http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2005/11/18/thing-a-week-10-when- im-25-or-64/ As such, this is the only Thing a Week album without at least 13 tracks (compare Thing a Week Four, which has 14). =Track list= All tracks written and composed by Jonathan Coulton unless noted.

It features some of Coulton's most popular songs, including \\"Re: Your Brains,\\" which would later be featured in Valve's popular 2009 video game, Left 4 Dead 2. \\"Chiron Beta Prime,\\" a Christmas song that originated as a Christmas card to one of Coulton's friends, is also on the album and shows how Coulton's songs tend to be about science fiction. It also includes \\"I Will,\\" a cover of The Beatles' song from the White Album. =Track List= All tracks written and composed by Jonathan Coulton unless noted. Thing a Week Three Thing a Week Three is the third Thing a Week album, and the sixth studio album by Jonathan Coulton. It contains two of Coulton's most popular songs. \\"Code Monkey,\\" used as the theme to a TV show and internet series, G4's Code Monkeys, and \\"Tom Cruise Crazy\\", a song about Tom Cruise. \\"Code Monkey\\" was likely inspired by Coulton's days at the New York software company Cluen. =Track list= All tracks written and composed by Jonathan Coulton unless noted. Thing a Week Four Thing a Week Four is the fourth and final Thing a Week album, and the seventh studio album by Jonathan Coulton. It has some more of his popular songs, including \\"Creepy Doll\\", a song where a man buys an abandoned house and finds a living, creepy doll upstairs, and later is killed by the doll in a fire. (This song inspired a Magic: The Gathering card of the same name]). \\"Mr. Fancy Pants\\", a song where a man is obsessed with his pants, urging another man to buy the world's best pants to best 'Mr. Fancy Pants' in a contest of whose pants are better. \\"You Ruined Everything\\", seemingly a parody of typical love songs by taking the tone of a love song with lyrics reflecting anger, sadness, or regret towards somebody. It is actually about Coulton's daughter, as he was inspired to write it because of her. \\"I'm Your Moon\\", a song about the moon, Charon, of Pluto. Coulton criticizes Earth scientists for renaming Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, and Coulton has been known to introduce the song by casually damning the scientists who made that decision.

Without this home-care, most of these cared for would require permanent placement in institutions or health care facilities. Respite care An estimated 50 million family caregivers nationwide provide at least $306 billion in uncompensated services‚Äîan amount comparable to Medicare spending in 2004 and more than twice what is spent nationwide on nursing homes and paid home care combined. Family caregivers may suffer from physical, emotional, and financial problems that impede their ability to give care now and support their own care needs in the future. Without attention to their needs, their ability to continue providing care may well be jeopardized. Respite care is one of the services that Alzheimer's caregivers say they need most. One study found that if respite care delays institutionalization of a person with Alzheimer's disease by as little as a month, $1.12 billion is saved annually.Leon, et al., 1998 A similar study in 1995 found that as respite use increased, the probability of nursing home placement decreased significantly Kosloski K, Montgomery RJV, 1995 U.S. businesses also incur high costs in terms of decreased productivity by stressed working caregivers. A study by MetLife estimates the loss to U.S. employers to be between $17.1 and $33.6 billion per year. This includes replacement costs for employees who quit because of overwhelming caregiving responsibilities, absenteeism, and workday interruptions. =Caregiver wellness reduces hospitalizations, doctor visits, work absences= Significant percentages of family caregivers report physical or mental health problems due to caregiving. A recent survey of caregivers of children, adults and the disabled conducted by the National Family Caregivers Association, found that while 70% of the respondents reported finding an inner strength they didn't know they had, 27% reported having more headaches, 24% reported stomach disorders, 41% more back pain, 51% more sleeplessness and 61% reported more depression.National Family Caregivers Association, April 30, 2000 Three fifths of family caregivers aged 19‚Äì64 surveyed recently by the Commonwealth Fund reported fair or poor health, one or more chronic conditions, or a disability, compared with only one-third of non caregivers. Caregivers reported chronic conditions at nearly twice the rate of non caregivers (45% to 24%). A 1999 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that participants who were providing care for an elderly individual with a disability and experiencing caregiver strain had mortality risks that were 63% higher than non caregiving controls. In an Iowa survey of parents of children with disabilities, a significant relationship was demonstrated between the severity of a child's disability and their parents missing more work hours than other employees. They also found that the lack of available respite care appeared to interfere with parents accepting job opportunities.Ableson AG, 1999 =Respite for younger family members with disabilities= Respite has been shown to improve family functioning, improve satisfaction with life, enhance the capacity to cope with stress, and improve attitudes toward the family member with a disability.Cohen and Warren, 1985 In a 1989 US national survey of families of a child with a disability, 74% reported that respite had made a significant difference in their ability to provide care at home; 35% of the respite users indicated that without respite services they would have considered out-of-home-placement for their family member.Knoll James, Human Services Research Institute, March 1989 There was a statistically significant reduction in somatic complaints by in a study of primary caregivers of children with chronic illnesses, and a decrease in the number of hospitalization days required by children, as a direct result of respite care.Sherman BR, 1995 Data from an ongoing research project of the Oklahoma State University on the effects of respite care found that the number of hospitalizations, as well as the number of medical care claims decreased as the number of respite care days increased.FY 1998 Oklahoma maternal and child health block grant annual report, July 1999 A Massachusetts social services program designed to provide cost-effective family-centered respite care for children with complex medical needs found that for families participating for more than one year, the number of hospitalizations decreased by 75%, physician visits decreased by 64%, and antibiotics use decreased by 71%.Mausner S, 1995 An evaluation of the Iowa Respite Child Care Project for families parenting a child with developmental disabilities found that when respite care is used by the families, there is a statistically significant decrease in foster care placement.Cowen, Perle Slavik, 1996 A 1999 study of Vermont‚Äôs then 10-year-old respite care program for families with children or adolescents with serious emotional disturbance found that participating families experience fewer out- of home placements than nonusers and were more optimistic about their future capabilities to take care of their children. =Results when caregivers of the elderly use respite= Respite for the elderly with chronic disabilities in a study group resulted in fewer hospital admissions for acute medical care than for two other control groups who received no respite care Sixty-four percent of caregivers of the elderly receiving 4 hours of respite per week, after one year, reported improved physical health. Seventy-eight percent improved their emotional health, and 50% cited improvement in the care recipient as well. Forty percent said they were less likely to institutionalize the care recipient because of respite. Caregivers of relatives with dementia who use adult day care experience lower levels of caregiving related stress and better psychological well-being than a control group not using this service. These differences were found in both short-term (3 months) and long-term (12 months) users. ) =Respite provided across the lifespan yields positive outcomes= In a 2004 survey conducted by the Oklahoma Respite Resource Network, 88% of caregivers agreed that respite allowed their loved one to remain at home, 98% of caregivers stated that respite made them a better caregiver, 98% of caregivers said respite increased their ability to provide a less stressful environment, and 79.5% of caregivers said respite contributed to the stability of their marriage. When newly formed, the Nebraska statewide lifespan respite program conducted a statewide survey of a broad array of caregivers who had been receiving respite services, and found that one in four families with children under 21 reported that they were less likely to place their child in out-of-home care once respite services were available. In addition, 79% of the respondents reported decreased stress and 58% reported decreased isolation. Data from an outcome based evaluation pilot study show that respite may also reduce the likelihood of divorce and help sustain marriages  The Lifespan Respite Act  Recognizing this significant contribution and the needs faced by America's caregivers, the United States Congress passed The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 (HR 3248) which was signed into law in December 2006. The bill was introduced and championed in the US House of Representatives by Rep. Mike Ferguson and James Langevin (D-RI). A companion bill in the Senate was cosponsored by Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Senator John Warner.HR3248 Much of the success for the passage of this legislation is due to the work of The Lifespan Respite Task Force which includes a diverse group of national and state organizations, state respite and crisis care coalitions; health and community social services; disability, mental health, education, faith, family caregiving and support groups; groups from the child advocacy and the aging community; and abuse and neglect prevention groups. If and when the new law is funded, (check progress at the ARCH website) it will provide funds for states to develop lifespan respite programs to help families access quality, affordable respite care. Lifespan respite programs are defined in the Act ‚Äúas coordinated systems of accessible, community-based respite care services for family caregivers of children and adults with special needs.‚Äù Specifically, the law authorizes funds for: * Development of state and local lifespan respite programs * Planned or emergency respite care services * Training and recruitment of respite care workers and volunteers * Caregiver training When the bill passed the House, Rep. Ferguson, whose own father was a caregiver for his ill mother for six years said, ‚ÄúToday's action by the House of Representatives represents not only an important victory for family caregivers nationwide, but it also sends America's caregivers a clear message: Your selfless sacrifice is appreciated, and help is on the way.‚Äù The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 is based on model state lifespan respite programs that have successfully addressed all of these barriers. Three states have enacted legislation to implement lifespan respite programs (Oregon, Nebraska, Wisconsin), which establish state and local infrastructures for developing, providing, coordinating and improving access to respite for all caregivers, regardless of age, disability or family situation. Oklahoma has also implemented a successful lifespan respite program.

Bloodstained undershirt of Franz Xaver Nies. Roadside marker at the site of the incident. The Juye Incident (, German: Juye Vorfall) refers to the killing of two German Catholic missionaries, Richard Henle and Franz Xaver Nies, of the Society of the Divine Word, in Juye County Shandong Province, China in the night of 1‚Äì2 November 1897 (All Saints' Day to All Souls' Day). A third missionary, Georg Maria Stenz, survived the attack unharmed. The mission compound where the incident took place was located in Zhang Jia Village (, spelled \\"Tshantyachuang\\" in writings by Georg M. Stenz), about 10 km northeast of the town of Juye and about 25 km northwest of the city of Jining. Georg M. Stenz was the priest stationed in Zhang Jia Village and the other two missionaries, Henle and Nies, had come to visit him. Stenz describes the events of the incident as follows: Before they went to bed shortly before midnight, the missionaries had practiced the Requiem Mass (Miseremini mei) for the following All Souls' Day. Stenz had given his room to his guests for the night and had moved into a vacant porter's room himself. Believing the area to be quiet, the missionaries did not take any precautions and Stenz left the door to his room unlocked. A band of twenty to thirty armed men broke into the mission compound shortly after the missionaries had gone to bed. They broke the door to the room where Henle and Nies were staying and killed the two missionaries. Both victims were found to have suffered numerous wounds from stabbing and both were dead shortly before midnight. The attackers searched for Stenz, but could not find him. They retreated when the local Chinese Christians arrived at the scene to help. It is not certain who committed the killings, but it is most commonly assumed that the attack was launched by members of the Big Swords Society.. Stenz blamed the attack on the warden of a neighboring village (Cao Jia Zhuang, spelled \\"Tsaotyachuang\\" by Stenz and located about 10 km to the south of Zhang Jia Village) and believed that the attack was rooted in a dispute between the warden and comparatively wealthy relatives who had converted to Christianity and had therefore refused to pay for local temple feasts. Less than two weeks after the Juye Incident, the German Empire used the murders of the missionaries as a pretext to seize Jiaozhou Bay on Shandong's southern coast. Under German threats, the Qing government was also forced to remove many Shandong officials (including governor Li Bingheng) from their posts and to build three Catholic churches in the area (in Jining, Caozhou, and Juye) at its own expense.. The mission that had been attacked also received 3,000 taels of silver in compensation for stolen or damaged property, and received the right to construct seven fortified residences in the area, also at government expense., pp. 27‚Äì28. This settlement strengthened missionary work in southern Shandong province and was part of the events that led to the Boxer Uprising (1899-1900), a movement directed against the Christian and foreign presence in northern China., pp. 134‚Äì35; . Imitating Germany, other powers (Russia, Britain, France, and Japan) began \\"a scramble for concessions\\" to secure their own spheres of influence in China., pp. 129‚Äì30. Historian Paul Cohen has called the Juye incident \\"the opening wedge in a process of greatly intensified imperialist activity in China\\" and Joseph W.

The cloister takes its name from the blue tinted windows that were part of the original chapel. Since being abandoned in 2008, the structures and grounds of the complex, which include a cemetery, face an uncertain future. History In 1891, Father Damien-Marie Saintourens of the Order of Preachers came from France and was joined by nuns in what was then West Hoboken, New Jersey where they established the American branch of Dominican Nuns of the Perpetual Rosary. Between 1912 and 1914 the Gothic Revival complex was built as the first monastery in the United States dedicated to the recitation of the Perpetual Rosary. The Passionist fathers of St. Michael's Monastery and Church acted served as chaplains at the chapel's services. Twenty-one other centers were later established across the country. Adornments included art work created by former resident Sister Mary of the Compassion.Gomez, John (March 7, 2011). \\"Sister Mary of the Compassion, a cloistered nun at the Blue Chapel, was renowned for her artwork\\". NJ.com. and stained glass windows originally thought to have been imported from Germany, but discovered in 2012 to have created in Buffalo, New York by stained glass artist Leo P. Frohe (1851 - 1919) of Buffalo Glass Works in the spirit of the historic Munich School style. The convent housed a number of important relics, including those of the True Cross and fragments of a bone of Saint Dominic. The landscaped grounds encompass and are enclosed by a high stone wall creating an oasis in the densely populated urban neighborhood which surrounds it. There are approximately 65 graves of nuns located in the cemetery on the property. The U-shaped bluestone building that included the chapel, dormitories, kitchen, and offices was well-maintained for many years, but as finances and residents diminished it began to fall into disrepair, and was vacated in 2009. Water damage and lack of heat have contributed to further deterioration. Plans to by the order to renovate the building to apartments were met with community opposition and were withdrawn, leaving the status of the complex uncertain. The convent is not listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places or the National Register of Historic Places. Preservation New Jersey, a historical preservation organization, considers the landmark to one of the state's most endangered historic sites. The city has expressed interest in preserving the site, and tried draw attention to the complex in 2011 by placing a historic site marker there. Protective stipulations were written into the city's zoning plan passed in early 2012. Around the same time, local historian Tony Squire made the discovery that the stained glass windows, which are still in excellent condition for their age, were not made in Germany, but by artist Leo P. Frohe. Because obtaining national landmark status for the Chapel would require establishing its architectural or historical importance as \\"the work of a master\\" or the studio of a significant artist, it is speculated that Squire's research may reveal Frohe as such a master. Frohe enthusiast believes that Frohe indeed qualifies, as the Buffalo Stained Glass Works has a history that traces back to the beginning of stained glass in the United States, and Frohe himself was awarded a silver medal in the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in France for his work, beating hundreds of fellow American competitors.

Early life and career George F. Pearson was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1799 but lived most of his life in Massachusetts. He entered the U.S. Navy on March 11, 1815, as a midshipman, and his first ship was the frigate . In 1820 Midshipman Pearson served on the ship of the line . In 1822 he was on the ship of the line and passed for promotion at the West Indies station. Pearson was commissioned Lieutenant on January 13, 1825, and was given duty on the West Indies station. Lt. Pearson's assignment was on the schooner in the Mediterranean in 1826. In 1828, he was with the Mediterranean Squadron on the sloop-of-war . In 1829 he took a leave of absence which lasted until 1831 when he joined the sloop of war on the Mediterranean Station. From 1832 to 1836, he was again on leave, or waiting for orders or stationed as Ordinary at Boston until he was assigned to the the flagship for Commodore Alexander Dallas of the West Indies Squadron, where it conducted operations supporting the Second Seminole War. Pearson was promoted to Commander on September 8, 1841. After the sloop of war Boston completed repairs it set sail from New York under the command of Commander Pearson on November 7, 1846, to join the Home Squadron blockading the eastern coast of Mexico. Eight days out of port, Boston ran aground on Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas after encountering a storm. Boston was wrecked beyond salvage, but her entire crew survived the disaster. On September 14, 1855, Pearson was promoted to Captain. In 1860 Person was given command of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

Under his command Commander Henry Kallock Davenport suppressed the so-called Salvador Pirates, a Confederate Navy plot to capture one of the two Panama Railroad steamships and turn it into a Confederate commerce raider to capture a gold-laden Pacific Steamship Company vessel. His squadron continued to protect American lives and property in Mexico and became in the same mission in Peru, defending them from attack by either side both during the Spanish blockade during the Peruvian War with Spain.  Later life  After the Civil War ended in May 1865, Pearson's Pacific Squadron had to deal with the . Its captain, unaware of war's end, was attacking American whaling ships in the North Pacific as late as August 1865. From 1866 to 1869 the Pacific Squadron was split into North and South Pacific Squadrons.

Life He is said to have been born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, possibly on 25 April 1721, to Samuel and Margaret Wale, though some sources indicate he was born in London. He was first trained in the art of engraving on silver plate. He then studied drawing under Francis Hayman at the St. Martin's Lane academy. Wale assisted John Gwynn in his architectural drawings, especially in a transverse section of St Paul's Cathedral, which was engraved and published in their joint names in 1752. St Paul's Cathedral, with John Gwynn. He became one of the original members of the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1765 and of the Royal Academy in 1768, and was the first professor of perspective to the Academy. He exhibited drawings of scenes from English history, and occasionally scriptural subjects, described as designs for altar-pieces, from 1769 to 1778, when he suffered from a paralytic stroke, and he was placed on the Royal Academy pension fund, the first member who benefited by it. He continued to hold the professorship of perspective, though he gave private instruction at his own house instead of lecturing; and in 1782, on the death of Richard Wilson, he became librarian. He held both offices until his death on 6 February 1786. Unmarried and childless, he left his copperplates, prints, and belongings to his friend and fellow founder of the Royal Academy, architect John Gwynn, with whom he shared his house, and his nurse, Mrs. Mary Gurpin. He was buried in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. His portrait appears in Johann Zoffany's picture of the Royal Academy in 1772, engraved by Richard Earlom. Works He painted some decorative designs for ceilings at a time when the taste for that style of ornamentation was on the wane, and he was occasionally employed in painting tradesmen's signs, till these were prohibited by act of parliament in 1762. A full-length portrait of Shakespeare by Wale, which hung across the street outside a tavern near Drury Lane, obtained some notoriety owing to the splendour of the frame and the ironwork by which it was suspended. It had scarcely been erected when it had to be removed. His main work was in designing vignettes and illustrations on a small scale for the booksellers; a large number these were engraved by Charles Grignion the Elder. Among them were the illustrations to the ‚ÄòHistory of England,‚Äô 1746‚Äì7; ‚ÄòThe Compleat Angler,‚Äô 1759; ‚ÄòLondon and its Environs described,‚Äô 1761; ‚ÄòEthic Tales and Fables,‚Äô William Wilkie's ‚ÄòFables,‚Äô 1768 (eighteen plates); Henry Chamberlain's ‚ÄòHistory of London,‚Äô 1770; and Oliver Goldsmith's ‚ÄòTraveller,‚Äô 1774. His book illustrations show Hayman's influence. He also published numerous plates in the Oxford Magazine and other periodicals. He exhibited ‚Äòstained drawings,‚Äô i.e. designs outlined with the pen and washed with indian ink, and occasionally larger drawings in watercolours, at the exhibitions of the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens, 1760‚Äì1767, and designed the frontispiece to the catalogue in 1762.

The escape resulted in the deaths of two sheriffs and triggered one of the largest manhunts in Arizona history. Veterans of the Apache Wars scoured the Arizona frontier for nearly a year in search of the fugitives, by the end of which all were caught or killed except for the famous Indian scout known as the Apache Kid. Background When the reservation system began in Arizona, the local Apache peoples were among the first to be subjugated. Throughout most of the Old West period, the reservations were undersupplied, which led to starvation, and their operators tended to be corrupt. This led to conflicts such as Geronimo's War, beginning in 1881, during which Geronimo and his band of Apaches left their assigned reservations and evaded capture until 1886. The Apache Kid, or Haskay-bay-nay- ntayl, had for most of the 1880s served as an Indian scout for the U.S. Army in the Apache Wars, having been involved in the mutiny during the Battle of Cibecue Creek and the Crawford Affair. Though many people at the time believed that the Apache Kid did not kill any of the soldiers at Cibecue, he left the reservation system in 1887 after an incident at the San Carlos Reservation. The Kid was also a friend of Al Sieber, Chief of the Army Scouts, who allegedly betrayed him after the Cibecue affair. Sometime in 1888 the Apache Kid was caught, put on trial in Globe for various crimes, and sentenced to spend the next seven years in Yuma Territorial Prison. The Kid had already served over a year of prison time at San Carlos and Alcatraz Island, so the prospect of going to the prison at Yuma was intolerable and he conspired with his fellow inmates to escape whenever and wherever possible. After the trial, on the morning of November 1, 1889, Sheriff Glenn Reynolds arrived at the jail in Safford to pick up eight Apache prisoners and one Mexican who were to be transferred to Casa Grande by stagecoach, a two-day ride, and from there to Yuma by train. Sheriff Reynolds made arrangements to be taken to Casa Grande by stagecoach owner Eugene Middleton, who had survived several conflicts with the Apaches since 1881. Reynolds also collected $400 from the county clerk to pay the expenses of the trip. Accompanying Reynolds and Middleton was Sheriff William A. \\"Hunkydory\\" Holmes. When the prisoners were loaded into the coach the party headed north for Globe. Sheriff Reynolds rode his horse, Tex, while Middleton and Holmes rode in the coach. The trip was long; Holmes spent the time target-shooting with his rifle, while Middleton sang and drank whiskey. After stopping at Pioneer, Arizona for lunch, the party continued on to the Gila River in a rainstorm. Just beyond the Gila was the little town of Kelvin, or Riverside Station, where the party stopped for the night. Escape Sheriff Glenn Reynolds On the next morning, Saturday, November 2, Sheriff Reynolds woke the others early so as to leave by 5:00 AM, in order to make Casa Grande that night before the train was scheduled to leave. Around this time Reynolds expressed concern about a section of the road outside of town known as Kelvin Grade, and also left his horse Tex behind so as to ride in the coach with Holmes. The road was very steep and with the coach loaded with nine prisoners, the horses were not strong enough to pull the wagon up, especially since it had been raining heavily the night before. In order to ascend Kelvin Grade, Reynolds decided the prisoners would have to be offloaded and then walk up. When the party reached the grade, seven of the prisoners were taken off as planned, but the Apache Kid and one other man were considered too dangerous and left on board. Middleton stayed on as well, to drive the coach, while Reynolds led the prisoners with Holmes in the rear. The coach proceeded up the grade first and was followed by the line of prisoners and sheriffs. The prisoners were all in handcuffs and bound together in pairs, except for Jesus Avott, the Mexican in the group. Gradually two of the Apaches moved in close to the unsuspecting Reynolds, and after the coach had pulled out of sight, they suddenly pounced on the sheriff to wrest his shotgun from him. At the same time another pair of Apaches attacked Holmes and took his rifle. The prisoner Bach-e-on-al shot Holmes, who died instantly; then, Bach-e-on-al aimed for Reynolds, who was now reaching for his pistol. Because the day was cold, Reynolds had buttoned up his coat and could not get to his gun fast enough. Bach-e-on-al fired and hit Reynolds in the head, killing him instantly as well. Just after the scuffle broke out, Avott ran ahead to warn Middleton who assumed the firing was nothing more than target practice. When Avott reached the coach Middleton told him to get in but instead he hid in some bushes. Bach-e-on-al was not far behind and shortly thereafter shot Middleton in the head. The bullet went in through the mouth, without hitting any teeth, and exited Middleton's neck. Amazingly, Middleton survived, without losing consciousness. After that the remaining Apaches came up and released the Kid from inside the coach. One of the fugitives, named El-cahn, was going to smash Middleton's head with a rock while he lay on the ground helpless, but the Apache Kid prevented it, possibly recalling that Middleton had shared his cigarettes with the Kid the night before. Aftermath The Apache Kid After the massacre, the Apache Kid and the others robbed the dead sheriffs and Middleton of their clothes, jewelry, and weapons. Next they fled into the surrounding desert while Jesus Avott was still hiding. Once the Apaches were gone, Avott cut a horse loose from the coach so as to ride it to town, but it kicked him off. However, a nearby rancher, Andronico Lorona, who was driving some cattle through the area, noticed the stalled coach and decided to investigate it. There Lorona found Avott and gave him a horse to take into Florence. Lorona then left to tell his foreman about the prisoners' escape, and the foreman sent a group of cowboys to guard the dead bodies. For his part in all of this, Avott was pardoned and did not have to serve time in Yuma. Sometime before the cowboys arrived at the murder scene, Middleton found the strength to stand up, but found that he could not lift himself onto the coach or a horse so was forced to walk and crawl the long distance back to Riverside Station. When Middleton reached Riverside he received medical treatment and told the townspeople what had happened. Shorty Sayler, a stagecoach driver, took Reynolds' horse Tex and rode it to Globe, forty miles away, to alert the authorities. Sayler stopped and changed horses at Pioneer and then made it to his destination in record time, arriving before noon the same day. The telegrapher at Globe was Dan Williams, who later said; \\"I happened to be the receiving operator and hastened to Al Sieber with terrible news, whose comment was, ‚ÄòI was afraid of that, and that was my reason for offering the scout escort to Casa Grande.' From his bed, Sieber directed a scout detail of twenty men under Lt. Watson to take the trail from San Carlos.\\" Deputy Sheriff Jerry Ryan took Reynolds' place upon learning of his death, but because the escape occurred in Pinal County, Sheriff Jerry Fryer assumed command of the investigation. Sheriff Ryan telegraphed a Captain Bullis at San Carlos who in turn notified General Nelson A. Miles. Over the next several months, until October 1890, American militias, bounty hunters, and United States Army troops searched the Arizona desert for the escaped prisoners, all of whom were eventually caught or killed except the Kid. Between 1889 and 1894, several murders and skirmishes occurred between settlers and Apaches, most of which were blamed on the Apache Kid and his friend Massai, another former army scout who was said to have been killed by a posse in September 1906. At one point the bounty hunter Mickey Free told Al Sieber that he had trailed the Kid for three months before killing him and carving a tattoo of the letter \\"W\\" as proof. The \\"W\\" had been tattooed in blue ink on the foreheads of about 100 San Carlos Apaches before the army introduced a new identification system. The Kid is not known to have had a tattoo like this but Mickey Free, who knew the Kid personally, said he did. In 1890, some Mexican Rurales killed an Apache and recovered Sheriff Reynolds' pistol and watch, initially leading them to believe they had killed the Kid. But the dead man was said to be much older than the Kid.Hayes, pg.162 In 1896, John Horton Slaughter also claimed to have killed the Apache Kid in the Sierra Madre of Chihuahua, Mexico, where Apache bands were still holding out as late as 1915. But because Slaughter had crossed the international border, he kept quiet about the incident out of fear of getting into trouble with his superiors. A native named Wallapai Clark also said he shot the Kid while he was trying to steal his horse from a corral, and in 1899, the colonel of the Rurales, Emilio Kosterlitzky, claimed the same when his men killed three Apaches. In 1924, after a band of Apaches crossed into Arizona to raid for horses, the Kid‚Äôs nephew, Private Joe Adley of Fort Huachuca, confided to Lieutenant John H. Healy of the 10th Cavalry that the Apache Kid was still alive in Mexico. This was mostly substantiated by Guadalupe Fimbres Mu√±oz, who was captured in 1915 during a surprise attack on Apache Juan‚Äôs stronghold in the Sierra Madre. She had been one of the trail guards for the Apaches and had sounded the warning that had allowed the other members of the band to escape. Initially, many thought she was the granddaughter of Geronimo, while others said her father was Apache Juan. However, Guadalupe herself claimed that her father was the Apache Kid. Sightings of the Kid occurred as late as 1935 when he was reportedly seen while visiting friends at San Carlos.

It was presented to the Committee of Estates by Sir George Maxwell, at Stirling, on 22nd of that month. Those who supported the Remonstrance are known as Remonstrants of Remonstraters. Remonstrance Patrick Gillespie was the principal author of the remonstrance addressed to the Scottish Parliament by the \\"gentlemen, commanders, and ministers attending the Westland Force\\", in which they made charges against the public authorities, condemned the treaty with Charles II, and declared that they could not take his side against Oliver Cromwell. The Remonstrators declared \\"freely and faithfully concerning the causes and remedies of the Lord's indignation\\", which had gone out against his people, among the first of which they reckoned the backsliding from the National Covenant, \\"the great and mother sin of the nation\\", as the principal. The chief remedy proposed was to remove from the presence of the king, the judicatories and the armies, the \\"malignants\\", whom many of the committee were accused of having received \\"hito intimate friendship\\", admitting them to their councils, and bringing in some of them to the parliament and committees, and about the king, thereby affording \\"many pregnant presumptions\\", of a design on the part of some of the committee of estates, \\"to set up and employ the malignant party\\", or at least, giving \\"evidences of a strong inclination to intrust them again in the managing of the work of God\\". cites: Balfour vol. iv p. 152 The Committee of Estates ignored the first remonstrance, a circumstance which gave such umbrage to Archibald Johnston, Lord Warriston and the leaders of the Western Association army, that they drew up another, couched in still stronger language, on 30 October, at Dumfries, where they had retired with the army on a movement made by Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army to the west. In this fresh remonstrance, the Remonstraters declared that as it was now manifest that the king was opposed to the work of God and the covenants, and cleaving to the enemies of both, they would not regard him or his interest in their quarrel with the invading English; that the king ought not to be trusted in Scotland with the exercise of his power until he gave proofs of a real change in his conduct; and that an effectual course ought to be taken for preventing \\"his conjunction with the malignant party\\", and for investigating into the cause of his late flight; and that the malignants should be rendered incapable in future of hurting the work and people of God. cites: Balfour vol. iv p. 136 A petition was presented to the Committee of Estates on the 19 November, requiring a satisfactory answer to the first remonstrance. On 25 November, a joint declaration was issued by the King and the Committee. They declared that \\"the said paper, as it related to the parliament and civil judicatories, to be scandalous and injurious to his majesty's person, and prejudicial to his authority\\"; and the commission of the General Assembly having been required to give their opinion upon the remonstrance, in so far as it related to religion and church judicatories, acknowledged that, although it contained \\"many sad truths in relation to the sins charged upon the king, his family, and the public judicatories\\", which they were \\"resolved to hold out, and press upon them in a right and orderly, way\\", together with such other sins as by impartial search, and the help of the Lord's Spirit, on their endeavours therein, they should find, nevertheless, the commission declared itself dissatisfied with the remonstrance, which it considered \\"apt to breed division in kirk and kingdom\\". cites: Balfour vol. iv p. 175 Aftermath The declaration of the commission of the General Assembly was not only approved of by the General Assembly, but what was of equal importance, the General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that in such a perilous crisis all Scotsmen might be employed to defend their country (and so giving support to the annulment of the Act of Classes (1649) which had impeded Engagers and Royalists from joining in the resistance to the English Invasion). An exception for persons \\"excommunicated, forfeited, notoriously profane, or flagitious, and professed enemies and opposers of the covenant and cause of God\\", was no doubt made, but this exemption did not exclude all the \\"malignants\\". The rescinding of the Act of Classes took effect on 13 August 1650. Gillespie and other Remonstraters protested against the General Assembly resolution, and when the General Assembly met in July 1651 they protested against its legality. For this he and two others were deposed from the ministry. They and their sympathisers disregarded the sentence, and made a schism in the church. Gillespie and those who held similar views would become known as Protestors for protesting against the resolution to rescind the act, while those who supported the resolution to rescind the act would become known as Resolutioners. The divisions in the Kirk and the Scottish Nation made the subjugation of Scotland easier for the English both militarily as the New Model Army could engage and defeat disparate Scottish armies in detail, and politically the English Commonwealth was able use the disunity to gain a political advantage over both parties.

Career  Monah Li began her career as a teenager making her own clothes in Vienna. Her dresses attracted attention and were bought by boutiques in her hometown and in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. One of the only female students to have attended the prestigious Higher Teaching Institute Industries in Austria, she graduated from textile engineering school with honors at age nineteen. Though accepted into Karl Lagerfeld's class at the Academy for Applied Art in Vienna, Li chose to pursue her career after her hand painted silk garments received a write up in German Vogue, before moving to Los Angeles where her psychiatrist mother was living to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. After a brief stint in Los Angeles where her growing drug use distracted her from school, Monah Li returned to Vienna, where she was hospitalized for addiction. As part of her rehab program, she went to work in a garment shop owned by the rehab's head of psychiatry, learning \\"couture' from the seamstresses who also worked there. After leaving the rehab program, she opened her own boutique in Vienna, winning the Best Designer of 1988 Award from the Austrian Wool Secretary. Monah Li then returned to Los Angeles, and after her first successful dress design was knocked off, founded her own company and began to create unique, one of-a-kind hand sewn garments, up-cycling vintage slips, dress and sweaters with lace insets, lingerie fastening and straps, which she then over-dyed. Finding success through sales to trend-setting retailers like Fred Segal, she opened a boutique on Vermont Avenues, which stocked her signature X-dress and other styles. The shop was described as one of \\"the best new stores in the city,\\" and was credited with turning Vermont Avenue, the main street in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, into a hip shopping destination. She rallied a group of other local designers and founded the Coalition of Los Angeles Designers in 1998; the group is now defunct, but while active, staged fashion shows and worked to bring awareness about innovative Los Angeles clothing to a wider audience. In 1998 Monah Li was nominated as California Mart Rising Star. In 2000, Monah Li added perfume she designed and created to her boutique, and branched out into large scale manufacturing of her designs for department stores. Unfortunately, a production contractor \\"did such shoddy work that stores nationwide returned the merchandise,\\" costing her business $800,000 in two months. Despite the setback, she put together a fashion show for New York in Spring 2000, where reps from Bebe saw her designs and immediately hired her as head designer for their newly created Los Angeles office. Bebe CEO and founder Manny Mashouf told the Los Angeles Times, \\"Her dresses are highly designed in terms of seams and details. They're sexy and feminine and have a fluid motion.\\" Fashion writer Lauri Pike said of Monah Li's hiring, \\"It's a great matchup in a lot of ways. I think of those [Bebe] clothes as being a little too young and slutty. But if Monah Li designs for them, I'm going to watch it. If they want to pull ahead of their competition or appeal to slightly older women, Monah Li could be very helpful.\\" Monah Li eventually left bebe to restart her own label. She showed at Los Angeles Fashion Week in 2003, and returned in 2004 with a \\"dramatically reinvented look\\" featuring richly colored solids and fur stoles which was called \\"one of the most visually stimulating and breathtaking shows of the week.\\" Monah Li then started a partnership with a manufacturing company, but there were disagreements. The business ended in 2007. Monah Li shifted her career goals from fashion, taking writing classes at UCLA and completing a certificate program in alcohol and drug counseling, while assisting her longtime boyfriend who was working on his third novel. During her hiatus from designing, she recovered from nineteen years of bulimia, with the support of friends and her newly discovered interest in belly dancing. In 2008, she and her author/screenwriter boyfriend were married. After their divorce in 2010 and the completion of her counseling internships, Monah Li returned to designing, with a fashion show featuring her classic looks in March 2011. She also spent a brief time designing once again for bebe, then began selling her own designs at a Los Feliz boutique owned by designer Tiziana. In August 2011, she opened her new boutique in the Elysian Park area of Los Angeles. Personal life Monah Li has been married three times. She has a grown daughter by her second husband.

It banned Royalists and those who had supported the Engagement from holding public office including positions in the army. Against sizeable opposition the rescinding of the Act took effect on 13 August 1650. Royalists banned from holding public office The act banned Royalists from holding public office. Its broad wording not only banned those who had fought with or supported Royalists such as Marquess of Montrose, it also banned those who had supported the Engagement (now discredited and political weakened after the Engager's army's defeat at the Battle of Preston (1648)), those who had not vehemently protested against the Engagement and those not of upright character. Rescinding The rescinding of the Act of Classes in 1651 led to a serious breach in the ranks of the Scottish clergy. The Resolutioners, or supporters of the resolution to rescind that act (such as James Sharp), were opposed by the Protesters, the rigid adherents to the strictest interpretation of the Covenant (such as Patrick Gillespie and James Guthrie). The period of the Commonwealth was filled with the strife between these two parties, its bitterness not lessened by the fact that the assembly, dissolved in 1653 by Cromwell's soldiers, was not allowed to meet again in his protectorate.

These events see between 10 and 30 managers present to investors and asset managers in small groups, usually six or less. Over two or three days industry professionals see a variety of managers running different classes. Between sessions there are also external speakers who present their views on anything from the global economic outlook to the future of the trade business. These events are free of charge but only open to qualified investors, wealth managers and advisers by personal selection from Citywire. =Fund Manager Ratings= Citywire Fund Manager Ratings track managers, not their funds, looking at how they've performed across all the funds they've run, wherever they've run them over the past three years. The methodology is purely quantitative, rewarding managers for superior risk-adjusted returns. The service judges fund managers on performance relative to a benchmark on the funds they run. Citywire chooses the benchmark, just in case the asset management group has chosen one it believes is not robust enough. Fund Manager Ratings is an impartial service and nobody can pay Citywire to rate a manager. Citywire rates all eligible managers (around 15,000 active managers in 41 countries around the world). =Awards= Citywire hosts awards for fund managers in the financial services industry. The basis of the awards is strictly mathematical, with no human verdict.
