Both are close allies and members of NATO and Francophonie. Both have a stance of multilateralism. The two nations have official bilingualism (with French being one of the official languages), and similar federal government systems owing in part to language tensions in both. Both are actively involved in the current war in Afghanistan under ISAF.  Missions  Belgium has an embassy in Ottawa, one consulate (in Montreal, the consulate in Toronto was closed in 2014), and four honorary consulates (in Edmonton, Halifax, Vancouver and Winnipeg) located in Canada. Belgium's three regions (Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels) each have their own offices in the Montreal consulate. Wallonia also has a second office in the Toronto consulate, which also represents Flanders and Brussels. Canada maintains an embassy in Brussels (which also covers Luxembourg). Canada also has a consulate in Antwerp, and Quebec maintains its own separate delegation in Brussels. The Canadian delegations to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are located in Belgium, as Belgium houses the headquarters of each. Luxembourg is often dealt with in tandem to Belgium. Belgium and Canada are member states of a variety of international organizations. They include: the United Nations, NATO, La Francophonie, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Dfait-maeci.gc.ca  Trade  Bilateral investment in 2006 was $5.9 billion. Luxembourg included, the total rises to $8.4 billion. Belgium exported a total $2.35 billion in 2006 in goods. Belgian exports include fuels, diamonds and mineral oils, vehicles, machinery and pharmaceutical products. The same year Canada exported $2.84 billion in goods. Canadian exports include diamonds, nickel, machinery, oil and zinc. Belgium was Canada's 5th biggest export destination within the EU during that year. Antwerp is one of the main ports of entry for Canadian goods to the EU. Belgian and Canadian universities have many partnerships. More than 20 Canadian universities partner with their Belgian counterparts in an array of fields ranging from health to social sciences.  History A few Belgians came to New France before 1759. In the mid-19th century there were enough arrivals to open part-time consulates in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. After 1859 the main attraction was free farm land. After 1867 the national government gave immigrants from Belgium a preferred status, and encouraged emigration to the Francophone Catholic communities of Quebec and Manitoba. Edouard Simaeys became a part-time paid Canadian agent in Belgium to publicize opportunities in Canada and facilitate immigration. The steamship companies prepared their own brochures and offered inexpensive package deals to farm families. By 1898 there was a full-time Canadian office in Antwerp which provided pamphlets, lectures and specific travel advice. By 1906 some 2000 Belgians a year were arriving, most with skills in agriculture. A third wave of immigration took place after 1945, with urban areas the destination. The 1961 census counted 61,000 Canadians of Belgian ancestry.Paul R. Magocsi, Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples (1999) pp 257-69 To provide financial support to Belgian immigrants suffering setbacks, the Soci√©t√© belge de bienfaisance was established in 1921 in Montr√©al. In 1936-7, it was merged into the newly founded Association Belgique-Canada. The association's level of activity has fluctuated over the years, being more active in the 1940s, less so in the 1970s. The last recorded AGM took place in 2011. Belgian immigration to western Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century attracted the attention of the Belgian government. It enacted laws and regulations to protect the emigrants and guarantee adequate shipboard conditions. Provision was made to assist emigrants who decided to return to Belgium. Starting in the 1860s consular officials made on-site visits to inspect conditions in Canada, which eagerly welcomed the new arrivals. The Catholic Church was likewise welcoming, and a number of priests immigrated. The Walloon immigrants discovered they could continue to speak French in Canada, while the Flemish quickly learned English. The Belgians formed no national organization on their behalf. Some settled in towns such as St. Boniface, Manitoba, but most became farmers who specialized in dairy farming, sugar beets and market gardening. After 1920 there was a move to western Alberta, with an economy based on ranching, horse breeding, and sugar beets.Cornelius J.

In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. Name Originating as a station on the Mullewa to Wongan Hills railway line, it was initially known as Bowgada when it was planned in 1913. The name Bowgada was taken from the pastoral station located nearby. Shortly before the line was opened in 1914 the name changed to Koolanooka and the next station south on the railway line was named Bowgada instead. The townsite was gazetted in 1916. The town takes its name from the nearby Koolanooka Spring. The word is Aboriginal in origin and means place of plenty wild turkeys. Iron ore mining An iron ore mine was opened in the area in 1965 along with the associated railway spur line, powerhouse, port facilities at Geraldton and housing for workers in Morawa. The original 1966 Koolanooka iron mine was the first iron ore exporting mine in Western Australia. In 2006 iron ore mining was re-commencing at the location.

The Haynesville Shale underlies an area of about 9,000 square miles and averages about 200 to 300 feet thick. The Haynesville Shale is overlain by sandstone of the Cotton Valley Group and underlain by limestone of the Smackover Formation.Ground Water Protection Council and ALL Consulting (2009) Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer.

It contains vast quantities of recoverable natural gas. This natural gas is known as \\"shale gas\\" because the wells produce from low permeability mudstones that are also the source for the natural gas. It was known to contain large quantities of natural gas prior to 2008. However, prior to that time, it was uneconomic to extract the natural gas. As a result of rising gas prices and improved technology in hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, it became possible to extract the gas from the Haynesville Shale in an economic and cost-effective manner. Source of name The Haynesville Formation, from which the Haynesville Shale gets its name, was named after the town of Haynesville, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. The type location for Haynesville Formation, is the Hunt Oil Company No. 1 well in Haynesville oil field, sec. 3, T. 23 N., R. 7 W., Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. In many geological reports and journal papers, the Haynesville Shale was classified as part of the Bossier Shale, although they are now classified as separate formations.Goebels, L.A.

GEOLEX Database, National Geologic Map Database. United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Lithology of Haynesville Shale The Haynesville Shale is a lithological heterogeneous, often organic-rich, mudstone. The composition of these mudstones varies greatly depending on position on geographic location and stratigraphic position. They vary from calcareous mudstone near the carbonate platforms and islands to argillaceous mudstone in areas where submarine fans prograded into the basin and diluted organic matter. For example, the Haynesville Shale has been observed to vary in composition from 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent calcite in samples recovered from one oil and gas well. In that well, the Haynesville Shale consists of silty, argillaceous mudstones, silty, calcareous mudstones, and dolomitic mudstones and dolomites. The silty, argillaceous mudstones contain more than 30% silt- sized siliceous grains. The silt often occurs as laminations within these mudstones. In addition, the argillaceous matrix of such mudstones frequently contains numerous calcareous particles and stringers. The calcareous particles include coccoliths, bivalve, and gastropod fragments, and calcispheres. Organic matter in the form of amorphous kerogen coats the argillaceous material. Silty, calcareous mudstones contain more than 20% calcite. In these mudstones, the calcite occurs as silt-sized microfossil hash composed of fragmented fossils and carbonate mud. Where organic matter is low and silts are rare, the calcareous microfossil and carbonate mud has recrystallized. Possibly, further alteration of silty, calcareous mudstones has resulted in the formation of the dolomitic mudstones and dolomites. Both the silty, argillaceous mudstones and silty, calcareous mudstones often exhibit sparse to abundant, laminated pelletal fabrics.Ewing, T.E.

Map showing distribution of Haynesville Shale within East Texas and northwest Louisiana The Haynesville Formation consists of marine and coastal plain limestone, shale, mudstone, and sandstone. In addition to the Haynesville Shale, the Haynesville Formation contains two formal subdivisions, which geologists call members. They are the Gilmer Limestone, also informally known as the Cotton Valley Limestone, and Buckner Anhydrite members. The Gilmer Limestone and Buckner Anhydrite members represent coastal and shallow marine deposits, which form along the northern boundary of the basin in which the Haynesville Shale accumulated and separate it from contemporaneous undifferentiated nonmarine deposits that occur beneath Arkansas further north. In addition, the Gilmer Limestone member also represents a carbonate platform with oolite shoals that lie beneath central Upshur and western Smith counties, Texas. They comprise the western boundary of the ancient shelf basin within which Haynesville Shale accumulated. A third, informal member, which called the \\"Gray sandstone,\\" of the Haynesville Formation interfingers with Haynesville Shale along its northern edge. This sandstone is regarded as having accumulated as submarine fans carrying sediment from the coastline into the basin within which the Haynesville Shale accumulated. Fossils and age Very limited detailed descriptions of the Haynesville Shale indicated that it is fossiliferous. The reported fossils include unidentified coccoliths, bivalves, gastropods, and calcispheres. Both stratigraphic relationships and a nannofossil (coccolith) assemblage described from it indicates that it is Kimmeridgian, 151 to 157 million years old, in age.Cooper, W.W., and B.L. Shaffer (1976) Nannofossil biostratigraphy of the Bossier Shale and the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies. v. 26, pp. 178-184. Depositional Environment The Haynesville Shale was deposited in a restricted basin that was located on a southward sloping continental shelf covered by relatively shallow water. The mudstone comprising it accumulated as a widespread and laterally continuous blanket across the limits of this restricted basin. The accumulation of pelleted, fossiliferous, organic-rich carbonate mud and even and wavy-lenticular laminated beds of very fine quartz silt and detrital clay reflects the mixed accumulation of carbonate sediments generated within this basin and clastic sediments that came from outside it. The northern edge of this basin consisted of shallow coastal waters floored by carbonate muds and oolite shoals lying just north of the modern Louisiana - Arkansas border. The shallow coastal waters were bordered further north by an arid coastal plain characterized by extensive sabkhas. The western edge of the basin in which the Haynesville Shale accumulated consisted of a broad north-south carbonate platform with prominent oolite shoals. The southern rim of this ancient basin and extent of the Haynesville Shale was an ancient Jurassic island, called \\"Sabine Island. This ancient island now lies deeply buried beneath the surface of Sabine County, Texas.Ewing, T. E. (2009) The ups and downs of the Sabine Uplift and the northern Gulf of Mexico Basin: Jurassic basement blocks, Cretaceous thermal uplifts, and Cenozoic flexure. Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies Transactions. v. 59, pp. 253-269. The carbonate platforms, their oolite shoals, the Sabine Island, and prehistoric Gulf of Mexico coastline created a restricted basin that marine currents could only readily access from the east. As a result of these restrictive conditions, anoxic conditions frequently occurred during the deposition of the sediments that form the Haynesville Shale. Anoxic bottom water conditions allowed organic matter falling to the floor of this basin to be preserved and incorporated into sediments that became the Haynesville Shale. The mechanisms by which organic matter accumulated within these sediments consisted of a complex interplay of local carbonate generation, clastic input from outside sources, variable burial rates, and variable bottom water anoxia and euxinia. Natural gas Natural gas production from Haynesville Shale (2010-2018) Historical gas production from Haynesville Shale (2000-2013) The Haynesville Shale came into prominence in 2008 as a major producer of shale gas in East Texas and Louisiana. Producing natural gas from the Haynesville Shale involves drilling wells from and to deep; the formation becomes deeper to the south. In 2008, the Haynesville Shale was thought to be the largest natural gas field in the contiguous 48 states with an estimated 250 trillion cubic feet (7.1√ó1012 m3) of recoverable gas. More recently, as of 2009, the Haynesville was estimated to have 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, second only to the Marcellus Formation in the US.US Energy Information Administration, US shale gas. Some scientists estimated recoverable reserves average of 6.5 billion cubic feet per well.Hammes, U. (2009) Sequence stratigraphy and core facies of the Haynesville mudstone, East Texas. Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies Transactions, v. 59, p. 321-324. The US Energy Information Administration estimated that the average well would produce 2.67 billion cubic feet of gas.US Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy outlook 2012, accessed 14 Sept. 2013. Production has boomed since 2008, creating a number of new millionaires in the Shreveport, Louisiana region. Haynesville gas production peaked at 7.2 billion cubic feet per day in November 2011. In January 2013 the formation produced 6.2 billion cubic feet per day, 9.3% of all the gas produced in the US.US Energy Information Administration, What is shale gas and why is it important?, retrieved 14 Sept. 2013. The other members of the Haynesville Formation are also the source of oil and gas production. Oil and gas is currently produced from shelf-edge carbonate reservoirs which consist of oolite shoals within the Gilmer Limestone and Buckner Anhydrite members. The submarine fan sandstones of the Gray sand in north Louisiana are also significant producers.Atwell, B.W., B. Henk, F.C. Meendsen, and J.A.

Education Avery August was born in Belize City, Belize. August attended government primary schools, and subsequently attended St. Michael's College for Boys (as High Schools in Belize are called),http://www.belizenorth.com/schools.htm where he earned a High School Diploma. Following one year at the Belize Technical College, he emigrated with his family to Los Angeles, California. There he attended California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned a B.S. degree in Medical Technology.http://www.the-scientist.com/2005/11/07/s30/1/ While at California State University, he got involved in undergraduate research in the laboratory of Dr. Phoebe Dea, then Professor of Chemistry & Biochemistry at California State Universityhttp://www.calstatela.edu/univ/ppa/newsrel/opaweb.htm (see Scientific Career below for details). This first exposure to research pushed him to attend graduate school at Cornell University's Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences in New York City. There he worked at the Sloan Kettering Institute (an institute within the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) with Immunologist Dr. Bo Dupont, and where he earned his PhD in immunology. He then gained post-doctoral experience at The Rockefeller University, working with renowned virologist and National Academy of Science member, Dr. Hidesaburo Hanafusa. Scientific career August first worked in the catalytic synthesis of fatty acids and other lipids as an undergraduate student in Prof. Dea's laboratory at California State University, Los Angeles. This work resulted in the publication on methods to easily catalyze the insertion of deuterium into unsaturated fatty acids, which could then be used as probes of membrane structure.A. August, C.J. Dao, D. Jensen, Q. Zhang, and P.Dea. ‚ÄúA facile catalytic deuteration of unsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids.‚Äù (1993) Microchem. J. 47:224. Upon moving to Cornell University, Dr. August initiated work on his PhD thesis, to understand the molecular basis of activation of T cells. T cells are major players in regulating the development of an immune response.Kuby Immunology, 6th Edition, TJ Kindt, BA Orborne and RA Goldsby, WH Freeman Publishers. The importance of these cells is illustrated by the fact that the virus HIV infects helper T cells, and thus disables effective immunity against the virus, resulting in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS.H. Wigzell. \\"Immunopathogenesis of HIV infection.\\" (1988) J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 1:559-65. At Cornell, Dr. August worked with Dr. Bo Dupont, working on unraveling the molecular basis for T cell costimulation by the cell surface protein CD28. This work resulted in 9 publications (see references at PubMed). This work also led to the production of his PhD thesis entitled \\"On the molecular basis of the two signal hypothesis of T cell activation: Signaling by CD3 and CD28\\".A. August (GS). ‚ÄúOn the molecular basis of the two signal hypothesis of T cell activation: Signaling by CD3 and CD28‚Äù. Ph.D. Thesis. Cornell University. Following graduation, Dr. August joined the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology at Rockefeller University, headed by Dr. Hidesaburo Hanafusa. At The Rockefeller, Dr. August worked on a number of areas, including analysis of the BRCA1 oncogene that when mutated, results in much increased risk for breast cancer. This work was the first to show that this protein could regulate the transcription of genes and could potentially regulate the development of Breast cancer in this fashion.A.N.A. Monteiro, A. August, and H. Hanafusa. ‚ÄúEvidence for a transcriptional activation function for BRCA1 C-terminal region.‚Äù (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93: 13595.A.N.A. Monteiro, A. August, and H.

They can discuss products or services they sell. KTLR broadcasts by day at 1,000 watts using a non-directional antenna. But because it shares the same frequency as Class A clear channel station WLS in Chicago, KTLR is a daytimer. It must sign off at sunset to avoid interfering with WLS, because radio waves travel further at night. Programming can be heard around the clock on KTLR's FM translator station, K279CR, at 103.7 MHz. History The station's original call sign was KBYE, signing on the air in 1945. It was one of OKC's first African-American formatted stations for many years. The tower, before moving to Britton Rd. and Eastern was located on the same property as Remington Park at approx. 55th and N. Eastern. The studio was located at 9th and Broadway downtown, where the Murrah Bombing site is now. Ownership for many years was by the Lynch brothers. Under Tyler ownership, the station was then known as KKNG beginning in 1999. On August 30, 2008, the station changed its call sign to the current KTLR.

The spur joins the main bridge at a T-intersection over the water, and is a rare example of a three-way bridge. History The original plan for a causeway to link Chincoteague to the mainland was proposed by John B. Whealton, who formed the Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company in 1919. The route originally proposed ran from Wallops Neck to the south end of Chincoteague, but was changed to bring the bridge to the center of town. An application for permission to the Virginia General Assembly was approved on September 14, 1919. Bids for the project were opened as soon as the news was telegraphed to Chincoteague. Whealton's bid for $144,000 was the lowest. The project was completed on November 15, 1922. An opening ceremony was attended by 4000 people and featured an address by Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd. Rain started to fall during the ceremony, and when the attendees started to leave the causeway became impassable, with 96 cars stuck. Boats were called to rescue the stranded, and barges ended up taking the cars to the mainland. Whealton undertook repairs, increasing the portion of shell in the dredged sand-and-oyster-shell surface and completing repairs by Christmas of 1922. Tolls were suspended on the causeway in 1930. The causeway's bridges were rebuilt in the late 1930s, with the Black Narrows fixed bridge and the Chincoteague Channel swing bridge dating to 1939 and 1940, respectively. The old Chincoteague Channel Swing Bridge, which was replaced in late 2010 A new bridge was built by the Virginia Department of Transportation to replace the deteriorated Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel bridges, completed in late 2010. The new bridge veers to the north just to the west of Black Narrows, suspended completely over open water and curving eastward just to the north of Marsh Island. The bridge crosses Lewis Creek Channel, north of Chincoteague Channel, via drawbridge and descends to meet grade at the intersection of Maddox Boulevard and Main Street, about 1/2 mile to the north of the old Chincoteague Channel Swing Bridge landing. Just to the north of Black Narrows is a T-intersection for a spur bridge to the small community on Marsh Island, as the Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel bridges that cross the island were removed shortly after the opening of the new bridge.

Battle In the Battle of Hanging Rock in the Civil War, a retreat to West Virginia by Union General David Hunter was briefly disrupted by the forces of Confederate Generals Jubal A. Early and John McCausland. On June 21, 1864, Hunter and his men were seeking refuge after failing to capture Lynchburg, 60 miles to the east. About 100 union soldiers were killed partly because their way was blocked by trees that had been felled across the road. \\"On June 21, 1864 General Hunter, retreating from defeat at Lynchburg by General Early, met Confederate forces led by General John McCausland.

McCausland pursued Hunter by crossing the Peaks of Otter and headed toward Salem on the Great Valley Pike (the primary corridor for today‚Äôs I-81 and U.S. Route 11 in Virginia), which was a better road and a faster way to get to the Roanoke Valley.

The film was based on the 1970 movie The Baby Maker that was initially adapted by Nerissa Cabral into a Komiks series. The film was turned into a teleserye of the same title in 2007 for the first installment of Sineserye Presents.  Plot  On the outside, married couple Fina (Santos) and Rodel (Manzano) Alcaraz appear to be a match made in heaven, but behind the thick walls of their home, their relationship is on the verge of crumbling. Despite being relatively affluent, the couple is empty as they are childless, for any attempt to conceive might prove fatal to Fina due to her condition. In an act of desperation, Rodel takes matters into his own hands and seeks the services of a surrogate, Ditas (Bonnevie). The plan goes awry when Rodel becomes genuinely attracted to the younger and more alluring Ditas. The surrogate, who has lived a destitute life, finds the notion of prosperity equally irresistible. The well-intentioned plan to resuscitate life back into a dying marriage becomes its undoing.

It stars Kristine Hermosa as Ditas, Diether Ocampo as Rodel and Rica Peralejo as Fina.  In popular culture  The film was the origin of the line, \\"Para kang karenderi√°ng buk√°s sa lah√°t ng gustong kumain!\\" (\\"You're like an eatery open to anyone who wants to eat!\\").

International Japan Karate-Do Association headed by Shihan Sadasige Kato. Its headquarter is situated in Tokyo, Japan, though its main activities are based on Europe.  Japan Karate Association (JKA), and descendants  The Japan Karate Association (JKA; \\"Nihon Karate Kyokai\\" in Japan) was formed in 1949 by several of Gichin Funakoshi's senior students. The highest rank that Master Funakoshi awarded to his students was 5th Dan (5th degree black belt). JKA raised the highest rank from 5th Dan to 10th Dan with less strict requirements to obtain each rank. Takushoku University provided the most members initially, but Hosei, Waseda, Gakushuin, and Keio Universities also contributed members. Masatoshi Nakayama (1913‚Äì1987) led the JKA, with Gichin Funakoshi holding a position equivalent to Professor Emeritus. The JKA grew to be one of the biggest karate organizations in the world. Differences between senior instructors and administrators gave rise to several breakaway groups, with the JKA itself eventually dividing into two factions. Nobuyuki Nakahara, Ueki Masaaki, Tanaka Masahiko, Yoshiharu Osaka and others led one faction (Nakahara Faction), while Matsuno Raizo, Asai Tetsuhiko, Abe Keigo and Yahara Mikio led the other (Matsuno Faction). Following legal battles, the Nakahara group retained control of the JKA. The following sections describe some of the Shotokan organizations that descended from the JKA. The founders of these organizations are some of the most senior Shotokan instructors in the world. International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) Hidetaka Nishiyama (1928‚Äì2008) began his karate training in 1943 under Gichin Funakoshi. Two years later, while enrolled at Takushoku University, he became a member of the university's karate team, and in 1949 its captain. He was a co-founder of the All Japan Collegiate Karate Federation and was elected as its first chairman. In 1951, Nishiyama became a founding member of the JKA, and was elected to the JKA Board of Directors. In 1952, he was selected as a member of the martial arts combat instruction staff for the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) Combat Training Program, which also included as instructors Funakoshi, Nakayama, and Isao Obata. Nishiyama came to the United States in 1961, on the invitation of SAC students and JKA members residing in the country, and four months later founded the American Amateur Karate Federation (AAKF),American Amateur Karate Federation (AAKF) as a branch of the JKA. In 1968, Nishiyama organized the first World Invitational Karate Tournament held in Los Angeles. Following disagreements over organization during the 1st (1970) and 2nd (1973) World Karate Championships, the International Amateur Karate Federation (IAKF) was formed in 1974, with Nishiyama as executive director. In 1985, the IAKF changed its name to the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). Nishiyama obtained the 10th dan in 2003 from the International San Ten Karate Association. He died on November 7, 2008. His former students include Hiroshi Shirai, Takeshi Oishi, James Yabe and Avi Rokah. Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation Hirokazu Kanazawa (1931‚Äì2019), 10th Dan, broke away from the JKA in 1978, and called his organization Shotokan Karate-do International Federation (SKIF). Kanazawa had studied under Masatoshi Nakayama and Hidetaka Nishiyama, both students of Gichin Funakoshi. SKIF introduced elements of T'ai chi ch'uan, particularly in the matter of flow and balance, and actively promoted the evolution of Shotokan while maintaining the traditional core of the art. Kanazawa is considered one of the most technically brilliant Shotokan exponents, and was a top contender in competition. Most notably, he won the kumite championship at the first JKA Open Tournament (1957) with a broken hand. Kanazawa was awarded 10th Dan in 2000. International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF) Teruyuki Okazaki (1931‚Äì2020), 10th dan, leads the International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF), a large Shotokan karate organization in North America, South America and the Caribbean. Okazaki studied under Gichin Funakoshi and Masatoshi Nakayama, and was integral in the founding of the JKA Instructor Trainee program. As part of an effort by Nakayama to spread Shotokan karate internationally, Okazaki came to the USA in 1961. Okazaki founded the ISKF in 1977 and it was part of the JKA until June 2007. Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS) Tetsuhiko Asai (1935‚Äì2006), 10th dan, often practiced Sumo, Judo, Kendo, and the Spear in his youth. Asai studied at the Takushoku University in Tokyo, where he also studied Shotokan karate. He joined the instructors' program and became a JKA instructor. In later years, Asai instructed in China, Hong Kong, America, Europe, and Hawaii (where he led the Hawaiian Karate Association). Asai was made Chief Instructor of the JKA after Masatoshi Nakayama's death in 1987; however, he‚Äîalong with a number of other senior JKA instructors‚Äîopposed the appointment of Nakahara as Chairman, and so formed a separate JKA (Matsuno Section). Following a lengthy legal battle, the Nakahara group won the rights to the JKA title and Asai's group adopted the name of the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS). Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA) Keigo Abe (1938‚Äì), as a student at the JKA Honbu, learned directly from Nakayama, which is reflected in his deference to Nakayama as being his only headmaster. Abe was a former senior instructor at the JKA Honbu, having graduated from the instructors' program. He held the office of Director of Qualifications in the original, pre-split JKA. However, after the split in 1990, he became the Technical Director of the JKA (Matsuno Section), during some of the association's most turbulent years. In his youth, Abe took 3rd place in the very first JKA National Championships; was the captain of the Japanese team at the second World Championships in Paris, France; won 1st place at the JKA International Friendship Tournament (1973); and took 1st place in the second and third JKF National Championships as a representative of Tokyo. Renowned for his strong traditional approach to Shotokan karate, he retired from the JKA in 1999 to form his own international organisation‚Äîthe Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA).Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA) Abe is reputed as being responsible for formulating the Shobu Ippon tournament rules, which are used by most Shotokan stylists today. However, there is a school of thought that these rules were actually formulated by Hidetaki Nishiyama during his time at the JKA. Abe is supported in the JSKA by Makoto Matsunami 8th dan, who runs his own independent dojo in Japan, as Technical Director and Takashi Naito 6th dan, as Director of Administration. Keigo Abe was awarded 9th dan in 2008 by the JSKA Shihankai. Karatenomichi World Federation (KWF) Mikio Yahara (1947‚Äì), 10th dan, is Chief Instructor of the Karatenomichi World Federation (KWF). Yahara graduated from Kokushikan University and became a JKA instructor during that organization's zenith in the 1970s and 1980s. In over a decade of competition, Yahara distinguished himself as a fighter, monopolizing the high ranks of domestic and international championships. As a Kata World Cup Champion, he is probably most famous for his performance of the Unsu and Empi kata. When Tetsuhiko Asai, Keigo Abe, Yahara, Akihito Isaka and other leading JKA Karateka formed the Matsuno Section of the JKA, Yahara became Assistant Chief Instructor. In 2000, Yahara formed the Karatenomichi World Federation with Isaka and which is represented in over 40 countries. Yahara fractured three of his opponent's ribs during his 8th dan promotion kumite in July 2006. The KWF claims that no other senior karate instructor has ever submitted himself to real kumite, in front of juniors and in front of the camera, for his 8th dan. In April 2007, Yahara and Japanese industrial loan magnate Kenshin Oshima, who is also a personal pupil of Yahara officially opened the ShotoKan, Ôø•1 billion private members' dojo donated to the KWF by Oshima. Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI) Kousaku Yokota (1947- ), 8th \\"dan\\" is the Chief Instructor to the Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI), with its headquarters in the USA. He was a student of the late Jun Sugano a former JKA Vice Chairman 9th dan, training in his dojo until moving to America. During his time with the JKA in the US, Yokota acted as an assistant instructor under Teruyuki Okazaki, Chairman 10th dan of the International Shotokan Karate Federation's (ISKF) in Philadelphia. It was here Yokota states he began his JKA instructor's graduate programme and completed it under Jun Sugano in Japan in 1983. Yokota resigned from the JKA in 2002 and joined the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS) where he was graded 6th dan by Tetsuhiko Asai in 2006. He became, in his own words, an ardent student of Asai karate and in his latter years, a confidant. He resigned from the JKS in 2009 and went on to assist in the re-establishment of the International Japan martial arts Karatedokai (IJKA) with Mr Asai's widow, Keiko Asai.IJKA website, . Accessed October, 2014. After leaving the IJKA in 2010, Yokota took up the position of Technical Director to the World Japan Karate Alliance (WJKA). He left the WJKA in 2013 to form the Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI) both to honor his teacher; Tetsuhiko Asai, as well as offering him a vehicle by which he could better promulgate Asai's teachings worldwide (Asai-Ryu). Asai-Ryu, builds on the teachings of Funakoshi/Nakayama-ryu Shotokan karate but has added into the system techniques which combine the strong, long distance fighting method of traditional JKA Shotokan with that of the softer and more fluid short distance fighting style of White Crane Kung fu with whom Asai trained. Asai added these techniques along with the additional Asai kata into traditional Shotokan training to supplement the elements he believed were missing within the JKA system. As a karateka, Yokota believes strongly in the budo/bujutsu concept of the art and de-emphasizes (though not reject) the competition aspect. He has however, participated in tournaments at the behest of his instructors of the day and was champion of Hyogo Prefecture in 1981 and 1982. He also represented Hyogo prefecture at the JKA All Japan Championships in Tokyo as well as All Japan National Athletic Festival (Kokutai) in Shiga Prefecture in 1983. During his tournament career he had the opportunities to fight against the following Shotokan notables; Masahiko Tanaka, Masao Kagawa, Mikio Yahara, Hideo Yamamoto. In order to better test his own karate skills and training further, he also trained and participated in full contact Kyokoshinkai, which he states helped validate his belief in the budo/bujutsu aspects of the art. This, in turn, led him to follow the teachings of Tetsuhiko Asai. Yokota, in addition to traveling around the world teaching at the seminars, is the author of Shotokan Myths (Second Edition), Shotokan Mysteries and Shotokan Transcendence. He also believes in the use of internet tools to teach a one-to-one class and to examine the dan ranks. More information can be found at his organization's URL: . Neither Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI) nor its instructors have any links with either of the two major groups formed by Tetsuhiko Asai; the Japan Karate Shotorenmei (JKS) run by Mr. Masao Kagawa 8th Dan or the International Japan martial arts Karatedokai (IJKA) headed by Keiko Asai and their Chief Instructor, Mr. Hontsung Chen 8th Dan. = World JKA Karate Association (WJKA) = The WJKA has no direct or indirect link or affiliation with the Japan Karate Association (JKA) or the Japan Karate Association World Federation (JKA/WF) or any other Japanese led Shotokan group either inside or outside Japan. It is a stand-alone western organisation run by senior western Shotokan instructors headed by Mr Jan Knobel 9th Dan. The aim of the World JKA Karate Association (started in 2000 as Alliance) is to propagate pure JKA Shotokan karate steeped in the teachings and traditional methodology of the Japan Karate Association of the 1960s through to the early 1980s, prior to the death of Masatoshi Nakayama, and as outlined in the Best Karate Series. The concept of the WJKA was first put to an international board in 1994 in Brussels, by Sidoli Sensei and Knobel Sensei at the 2nd JKA Euro-Camp in 1996. The reasoning for this was the fact that both felt that karate-ka from both sides of the JKA (as prior to political divisions) should be able to train together and test together. They proposed that a neutral and non-political 'friendship society' of JKA karate-ka should be created, where no individual association should be in control of any other, allowing autonomy and the freedom to fully develop. Between 1997 and 1999 there were several discussions between the European instructors. At the conclusion of these discussions, all seemed keen to try and alma gate in friendship. The concept was not to create yet another JKA body, but to create a 'union' where everyone was in communication, affording everyone access to instruction, regardless of which association an instructor. A meeting was held in Germany in May 2000 between students of Mikami Sensei, Yahara Sensei, Asai Sensei and Ochi Sensei. All agreed on the need for such an organization in order that JKA karate could still be enjoyed by all, rather than one association being in total control of the mantle of JKA style karate. At the 12th (Asai faction) JKA World Karate Championships, held in Cardiff in July 2000, discussions took place between high-grade non- Japanese instructors. All agreed with the need to begin the international friendship, and to draw from the experiences of senior karate-ka from around the globe and at this point the WJKA was born. In 2007 the WJKA came at its turning point. Sidoli sensei resigned and Jan Knobel, today's president, started to run the WJKA alone. In the same year, Master Kousaku Yokota joined the WJKA as Technical Director, a position he held until his resignation in 2013 when he left to form Asai Shotokan Association International (ASAI). One of the first US members, Craig Kimura Hargis, joined WJKA in 2004 as its USA Western Region Chief Instructor, and was, along with Knobel and Yokota, one of the organization's original 8th dans. He teaches for the organization in California and is a member of the Shihankai.WJKA website, 2010 In 2010, The WJKA changed its name from Alliance to Association with an International Shihankai as its board. Today the Shihankai consists of 3 senior instructors namely, Jan Knobel 9th dan President, Don Owens 9th dan and John Turnbull 7th dan. Today WJKA teaches both JKA directions, Nakayama ryu and Asai ryu.  Shotokai  The name \\"Shotokai\\" (see main article, Sh≈çt≈çkai) is used as a synonym for the Shotokan ryu association Dai Nihon Karate-do Shotokai. It is the Shotokan Karate association established by Gichin Funakoshi originally in 1930. Shotokai association is the keeper of master Funakoshi's Karate-do heritage. \\"Shotokai\\" should be considered the \\"approved\\" evolution of Roushi ( Funakoshi ) Sensei's Karate technique as developed, with Roushi Sensei's approval by Shigeru Egami (1912‚Äì1981). Egami, at Funakoshi's direction, was the chief instructor of Shotokan Dojo 1976-1981. Egami began training under Funakoshi in 1930, upon entering Waseda University, and helped to establish that university's karate club. Together with Funakoshi's son Gigo (Yoshitaka), Takeshi Shimoda, and Hironori Ohtsuka, Egami was among the group of Funakoshi's students who toured with him during his exhibitions of karate in Japan during the 1930s. After Gigo's death in 1945, Egami was considered Funakoshi's successor.Funakoshi, Gichin (1973). \\"Karate-do Kyohan\\", Kodansha International Ltd, Tokyo. . See foreword by translator Tsutomu Ohshima. During his early 40s, Egami began to radically rethink the effectiveness of some of his basic techniques. He writes: > During this questioning I understood one thing. Until that moment I had > practiced karate with a fundamental illusion, I had confused hardness with > strength and I made every effort to harden my body thinking that I would > obtain more strength when hardening the body is equivalent to stopping the > movement. This is a fundamental defect. I had then to start massaging and > lightening the body I had struggled so many years to harden. Egami began experimenting with a more relaxed technique, gained through excessive practice when the body lacked sufficient strength to hold on the rigidity of overly muscular and \\"stiff\\" technical execution. Following the Master's death in 1957 (26 April Showa 32 (1957)), a rift developed among Funakoshi's students, chiefly, as there was an insistence that certain elements (the JKA) control the funeral arrangements, disregarding Funakoshi's family's wishes. The Shotokai (\\"Shoto's society\\") and the JKA became separate factions after the conduct demonstrated at the funeral of master Funakoshi. Again, chiefly because constituent Universities (of the JKA - namely Takushoku, Kao and Hosei Universities) removed their University karate Club flags from the coffin of Master Funakoshi at 7.00 pm the evening before the funeral - and did not attend the following day for the funeral. Genshin Hironishi, former head of the Shotokai writes about these events on page 23 of Tsui So Roku: Egami (Okura Jiro (Ed.): Egami Shigeru Tsuis≈çroku (Memoirs of Egami Shigeru). Nihon Karate-do Shotokai, 1981. 182p). To this day, the Shotokai continues the Soto-zen inspired practiced of Master Funakoshi. Particularly, tournament competition was frowned upon prior to Master Funakoshi's passing, as it was an affront to the inherent humility and the \\"inward looking\\" focus in Master Funakoshi's practice. The acclaim and recognition sought and awarded in competition directly affronts this notion. Other practices of the now-separated JKA, who were essentially all junior to the Shotokai members they separated from, included the practice of grading beyond the original \\"five dan\\" structure, to ten dan gradings. It is of historical significance that Egami Shigeru, as Master Funakoshi's chosen technical director, never attained more than a 4th Dan.  Shotokan Karate of America (SKA) Tsutomu Ohshima (1930‚Äì) began practicing karate at the Waseda University club in 1948, receiving instruction from Funakoshi and Egami among others, and became captain of the club in 1952. In 1955, he moved to USC to continue his studies, and led his first U.S. practice soon afterwards. In 1957, he started the first university karate club in the United States, at Caltech, and in 1959 founded the Southern California Karate Association. As more dojos were opened throughout the U.S., the organization was renamed to Shotokan Karate of America (SKA) in 1969. SKA maintains its national headquarters in Los Angeles. Today, Ohshima is recognized as the chief instructor of many other SKA-affiliated Shotokan organizations worldwide. In 1957, Ohshima was awarded the rank of 5th dan by Master Funakoshi, the highest rank awarded, and by his choice, this is the rank he has retained, and the highest rank attainable in SKA.  Funakoshi Shotokan Karate Association (FSKA])  Shihan Kenneth Funakoshi, founder and chief instructor of the FSKA is fourth cousin to Master Gichin Funakoshi ‚Äì the founder of Modern Shotokan.Funakoshi Shotokan Karate Association He started judo training in 1948 under Arakaki Sensei at the Fort Gakuen Japanese Language School in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended Farrington High School in the Kalihi District and was on the football team and captain of the Territory of Hawaii (Hawaii was not a state yet) Championship swim team. While attending at the University of Hawaii on a swimming scholarship Funakoshi Sensei started Kempo training under Adriano Emperado from 1956 to 1959. In 1960, Funakoshi started shotokan training when the Japan Karate Association (JKA) assigned its first grand champion, Hirokazu Kanazawa to teach at the Karate Association of Hawaii for three years. For the next three years, Funakoshi trained under Masataka Mori, another senior instructor from the Japanese Karate Association. From 1966 to 1969, he trained under the third and last instructor sent by the J.K.A., the legendary Tetsuhiko Asai, another former grand champion from Japan. In 1969, after training 10 years under three of Japan's top instructors and winning the grand championship of the Karate Association of Hawaii for five years in a row (1964 ‚Äì 1968), Kenneth Funakoshi was appointed as the Chief Instructor for the Karate Association of Hawaii. Funakoshi moved to San Jose, California to teach karate in December 1986, in 1987, the non-political Funakoshi Shotokan Karate Association was founded with its world headquarters now in Milpitas, CA and affiliates throughout the United States, Mexico, Europe, Africa, Middle East and South America.  Kenkojuku Karate Association (KKA) It was founded in 1942 by Tomosaburo Okano, a Japanese Iaido master and a student of both Gichin Funakoshi and his son Yoshitaka (Gigo) Funakoshi; it remains as one of the most traditional schools of Shotokan karate, with the Shotokai, it even continues Okinawan kobud≈ç (traditional weapons) as part of its practice . The association's motto is \\"Inner Strength with Outward Humility\\". Since master Okano's passing the Kenkojuku Budokan Hombu Dojo is now run by his son Tomokatsu Okano, from the style's hombu dojo located in: 8-5, Minami-cho Hachioji-Shi Tokyo, 192 Japan. Kenkojuku karate has just a few representatives within the United States, the Caribbean, India and Latin America. In the United States Sensei Masakazu Takahashi began his karate training under Master Tomosaburo Okano In 1961. In 1971, he traveled to America to begin his teaching career. The Takahashi Karate Dojos, located in Amity Harbor and Mount Kisco, New York, have been established for more than 42 years, offering traditional martial arts training to beginners and advanced students. Sensei Takahashi is the head of the U.S.A Kenkojuku Karate Association and holds the rank of 8th degree Black Belt. Sensei Takahashi has devoted his life to master his art and teach his students Traditional Shotokan Karate. Sensei Koji Sugimoto is the current representative of the Japan Karate Federation for Shotokan Kenkojuku karate. He was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1947. At the age of fourteen, he began karate under master Tomosaburo Okano, one of the original students of Gichin Funakoshi. Sensei Sugimoto continues to expand his knowledge and skills of the art of karate. Presently Shihan Sugimoto holds the rank of 6th degree under the Japan Karate Federation (JKF) and a 7th degree Black Belt under the World Karate Federation (WKF). He teaches in two locations in Miami, Florida. In South Dade County and at the Miami Dade College, Kendall campus. Master Tomosaburo Okano was on the panel of Masters of the Japan Karate-do Federation (JKF) and was declared a Living National Treasure of Japan before he died on July 19, 2003, at the age of 81.  American JKA Karate Association - International  The AJKA-I is an international independent JKA-style Shotokan karate association led in Europe 9th Dan, Chief Instructor Leslie Safar. The organization has branches in Hungary, Germany, USA, Switzerland, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, and India.  World Traditional Karate Organization  The World Traditional Karate Organization (WTKO) is an organization for groups and individuals that follow traditional Shotokan karate and wish to preserve the values and principles that exemplify the Shotokan of Nakayama Sensei and his peers that made Shotokan karate the pre-eminent karate style throughout the world, yet are open to different views on how to each reach our individual goals. Many of the group's senior instructors spent decades with the JKA, several of whom lived in Japan for extended periods, before deciding to form a new organization that would represent higher standards and not be stifled by politics. Senior members include John Mullin, Steve Ubl, Richard Amos, Bruno Trachsel, Jon Keeling.

Born to a destitute family, Ditas has resigned herself to the fact that her life will be a struggle, but she still has the strong resolve to make it in life, no matter what. As such, Ditas will not let her lowly stature in life hamper dreams of a promising future. She makes a living by selling her babies to the highest bidder, a lucrative job that is problem- free until a well-to-do couple approaches her one day and changes the rules of the game. The picture-perfect couple Rodel (Diether Ocampo) and Fina (Rica Peralejo) are young, good-looking, and rich. The couple couldn't wish for anything more since they seemingly have everything anyone could ever want. With one exception.

When they hear rumors about a certain surrogate mother who happens to be Ditas, the couple sees an opportunity to finally fill the void in their lives.

These romantic undertones between Spock and James T. Kirk were brought to the attention of the office of the creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, who made Pocket Books recall the first edition. This edition subsequently became a collector's item, with more than fifty changes made to a revised version. Plot The USS Enterprise is on patrol near the Romulan neutral zone and the crew is experiencing unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain of the ship and Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day. The Romulans had attempted to travel back in time and destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the ShiKahr realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline. Romulan agents board the ShiKahr and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds that he is linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea to allow it to pass. They retrieve Kirk, and discover that taking Kirk and Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline. Development The original manuscript included Kirk/Spock slash fiction overtones The original manuscript of Killing Time included Kirk/Spock based slash fiction overtones. The foundation of this genre of writing dated back to the 1970s with fan created fiction about Kirk and Spock. This has since become a term typically used for same-sex unofficial fiction. Author Della van Hise had previously written these types of stories about those characters. When that manuscript was sent by Pocket Books for approval by Paramount Studios, the pages with the slash fiction were marked to be edited out of the eventual novel. It was returned, but at the time Pocket Books were between editors as Mimi Panich had just left, and her replacement Karen Haas had not yet arrived. At some point, someone went through the manuscript and marked the pages which Paramount had asked to be removed with the letters \\"STET\\", which is a Latin term used by proofreaders to tell the printer to disregard earlier changes. Pocket Books published 250,000 copies of Killing Time in the first print run. After the publishing, Gene Roddenberry's assistant, Richard Arnold, received a letter from a reader stating that the book was suggesting a romantic link between Kirk and Spock.Ayers (2006): p. 59 This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, who reportedly \\"became livid\\".Alexander (1994): p. 486 Following his complaints to Pocket Books, the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed. Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 and 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item. Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, \\"If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in Killing Time, they could find it... Just as beauty is in supposedly in the mind of the beholder, so is questionable material.\\" More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition. Following the issues with the publishing of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were stepping out of the bounds set by the television series.Ayers (2006): p. xii Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied. Critical reception Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer, writing for Tor.com in February 2013, said that Killing Time was \\"incredibly romantic\\". She stated that it reminded her of 18th century literary Romanticism, \\"which suggested that morality lay in nature and civilization was a corrupting influence\\". She said that whilst it could be considered \\"a trivial piece of fluff tossed off by a fan writer and published when Pocket Books wasn‚Äôt paying much attention\\", it could also be seen to be a \\"call to action that requires readers to examine their relationships and their actions\\". In Elizabeth Woledge's article for Extrapolation, entitled \\"From Slash to the Mainstream: Female Writers and Gender Blending Men\\", she describes Killing Time as \\"erotic but not sexual\\" and said that Spock and Kirk both \\"combine masculine and feminine imagery\\". She suggested that it was not the romantic overtones that caused the reaction, but rather that it was this gender-blending that was the issue.

It may also include waste associated with the generation of biomedical waste that visually appears to be of medical or laboratory origin (e.g. packaging, unused bandages, infusion kits etc.), as well research laboratory waste containing biomolecules or organisms that are mainly restricted from environmental release. As detailed below, discarded sharps are considered biomedical waste whether they are contaminated or not, due to the possibility of being contaminated with blood and their propensity to cause injury when not properly contained and disposed. Biomedical waste is a type of biowaste. Biomedical waste may be solid or liquid. Examples of infectious waste include discarded blood, sharps, unwanted microbiological cultures and stocks, identifiable body parts (including those as a result of amputation), other human or animal tissue, used bandages and dressings, discarded gloves, other medical supplies that may have been in contact with blood and body fluids, and laboratory waste that exhibits the characteristics described above. Waste sharps include potentially contaminated used (and unused discarded) needles, scalpels, lancets and other devices capable of penetrating skin. Biomedical waste is generated from biological and medical sources and activities, such as the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. Common generators (or producers) of biomedical waste include hospitals, health clinics, nursing homes, emergency medical services, medical research laboratories, offices of physicians, dentists, veterinarians, home health care and morgues or funeral homes. In healthcare facilities (i.e. hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices, veterinary hospitals and clinical laboratories), waste with these characteristics may alternatively be called medical or clinical waste. Biomedical waste is distinct from normal trash or general waste, and differs from other types of hazardous waste, such as chemical, radioactive, universal or industrial waste. Medical facilities generate waste hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some wastes are considered multihazardous, such as tissue samples preserved in formalin. Effects on humans Sharpsmart Reusable Sharps Container Disposal of this waste is an environmental concern, as many medical wastes are classified as infectious or biohazardous and could potentially lead to the spread of infectious disease. The most common danger for humans is the infection which also affects other living organisms in the region. Daily exposure to the wastes (landfills) leads to accumulation of harmful substances or microbes in the person's body. A 1990 report by the United State CountryAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry concluded that the general public is not likely to be adversely affected by biomedical waste generated in the traditional healthcare setting. They found, however, that biomedical waste from those settings may pose an injury and exposure risks via occupational contact with medical waste for doctors, nurses, and janitorial, laundry and refuse workers. Further, there are opportunities for the general public to come into contact medical waste, such as needles used illicitly outside healthcare settings, or biomedical waste generated via home health care. Management Biomedical waste must be properly managed and disposed of to protect the environment, general public and workers, especially healthcare and sanitation workers who are at risk of exposure to biomedical waste as an occupational hazard. Steps in the management of biomedical waste include generation, accumulation, handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal.U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Finding the Rx for Managing Medical Wastes, OTA-O-459 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, September 1990) The development and implementation of a national waste management policy can improve biomedical waste management in health facilities in a country =On-site versus off-site= These healthcare workers are being trained to safely handle contaminated wastes before being assigned to an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Disposal occurs off-site, at a location that is different from the site of generation. Treatment may occur on-site or off-site. On-site treatment of large quantities of biomedical waste usually requires the use of relatively expensive equipment, and is generally only cost effective for very large hospitals and major universities who have the space, labour and budget to operate such equipment. Off-site treatment and disposal involves hiring of a biomedical waste disposal service (also called a truck service) whose employees are trained to collect and haul away biomedical waste in special containers (usually cardboard boxes, or reusable plastic bins) for treatment at a facility designed to handle biomedical waste. =Generation and accumulation= Biomedical waste should be collected in containers that are leak-proof and sufficiently strong to prevent breakage during handling. Containers of biomedical waste are marked with a biohazard symbol. The container, marking, and labels are often red. Discarded sharps are usually collected in specialized boxes, often called needle boxes. Specialized equipment is required to meet OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 and EPA 40 CFR 264.173. standards of safety. Minimal recommended equipment include a fume hood and primary and secondary waste containers to capture potential overflow. Even beneath the fume hood, containers containing chemical contaminants should remain closed when not in use. An open funnel placed in the mouth of a waste container has been shown to allow significant evaporation of chemicals into the surrounding atmosphere, which is then inhaled by laboratory personnel, and contributes a primary component to the threat of completing the fire triangle. To protect the health and safety of laboratory staff as well as neighboring civilians and the environment, proper waste management equipment, such as the Burkle funnel in Europe and the ECO Funnel in the U.S., should be utilized in any department which deals with chemical waste. It is to be dumped after treatment. =Storage & Handling= Storage refers to keeping the waste until it is treated on-site or transported off-site for treatment or disposal. There are many options and containers for storage. Regulatory agencies may limit the time for which waste can remain in storage. Handling is the act of moving biomedical waste between the point of generation, accumulation areas, storage locations and on-site treatment facilities. Workers who handle biomedical waste must observe standard precautions. =Treatment= The goals of biomedical waste treatment are to reduce or eliminate the waste's hazards, and usually to make the waste unrecognizable. Treatment should render the waste safe for subsequent handling and disposal. There are several treatment methods that can accomplish these goals.It include secregating the bio waste Biomedical waste is often incinerated. An efficient incinerator will destroy pathogens and sharps. Source materials are not recognizable in the resulting ash. Alternative thermal treatment can also include technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis including energy recovery with similar waste volume reductions and pathogen destruction. An autoclave may also be used to treat biomedical waste. An autoclave uses steam and pressure to sterilize the waste or reduce its microbiological load to a level at which it may be safely disposed of. Many healthcare facilities routinely use an autoclave to sterilize medical supplies. If the same autoclave is used to sterilize supplies and treat biomedical waste, administrative controls must be used to prevent the waste operations from contaminating the supplies. Effective administrative controls include operator training, strict procedures, and separate times and space for processing biomedical waste. Microwave disinfection can also be employed for treatment of Biomedical wastes. Microwave irradiation is a type of non-contact heating technologies for disinfection. Microwave chemistry is based on efficient heating of materials by microwave dielectric heating effects. When exposed to microwave frequencies, the dipoles of the water molecules present in cells re-align with the applied electric field. As the field oscillates, the dipoles attempts to realign itself with the alternating electric field and in this process, energy is lost in the form of heat through molecular friction and dielectric loss. Microwave disinfection is a recently developed technology which provides advantage over old existing technologies of autoclaves as microwave based disinfection has less cycle time, power consumption and it requires minimal usage of water and consumables as compared to autoclaves. For liquids and small quantities, a 1‚Äì10% solution of bleach can be used to disinfect biomedical waste. Solutions of sodium hydroxide and other chemical disinfectants may also be used, depending on the waste's characteristics. Other treatment methods include heat, alkaline digesters and the use of microwaves. For autoclaves and microwave systems, a shredder may be used as a final treatment step to render the waste unrecognizable. Some autoclaves have built in shredders. Country-wise regulation and management The international symbol for biological hazard. =United Kingdom(UK)(England)= In the UK, clinical waste and the way it is to be handled is closely regulated. Applicable legislationNetRegs - Current legislation lists includes the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Part II), Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, and the Hazardous Waste Regulations (England & Wales) 2005, as well as the Special Waste Regulations in Scotland. A scandal erupted in October 2018 when it emerged that Healthcare Environment Services, which had contracts for managing clinical waste produced by the NHS in Scotland and England, was in breach of the environmental permits at four of its six sites by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately. 17 NHS trusts in Yorkshire terminated their contracts immediately. The company sued for compensation. Amputated limbs were said to be among 350 tonnes of clinical waste stockpiled instead of incinerated in Normanton. The company maintains that the problem is caused by a reduction in incineration capacity, and the re-classification of clinical waste as ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù, which meant more needed incineration. The government's contingency plans include installing temporary storage units at hospitals, but the company say that this is more dangerous than allowing them to exceed their permitted allowances. The company still has contracts with 30 other trusts in England, and a waste disposal contract with NHS England for primary care and pharmacy. =United States of America= In the United States, biomedical waste is usually regulated as medical waste. In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed The Medical Waste Tracking Act which allowed the EPA to establish rules for management of medical waste in some parts of the country. After the Act expired in 1991, responsibility to regulate and pass laws concerning the disposal of medical waste returned to the individual states. The states vary in their regulations from none to very strict. In addition to on-site treatment or pickup by a biomedical waste disposal firm for off-site treatment, a mail-back disposal option allows generators of waste to return it to the manufacturer. For instance, waste medicines and equipment can be returned. The waste is shipped through the U.S. postal service. While available in all 50 U.S. states, mail-back medical waste disposal is limited by very strict postal regulations (i.e., collection and shipping containers must be approved by the postal service for use). =India= The Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and further amendments were passed for the regulation of bio-medical waste management. On 28 th Mar 2016 Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016 were also notified by Central Govt. Each state's Pollution Control Board or Pollution control Committee will be responsible for implementing the new legislation. In India, though there are a number of different disposal methods, the situation is desultory and most are harmful rather than helpful. If body fluids are present, the material needs to be incinerated or put into an autoclave. Although this is the proper method, most medical facilities fail to follow the regulations. It is often found that biomedical waste is dumped into the ocean, where it eventually washes up on shore, or in landfills due to improper sorting or negligence when in the medical facility. Improper disposal can lead to many diseases in animals as well as humans. For example, animals, such as cows in Pondicherry, India, are consuming the infected waste and eventually, these infections can be transported to humans who consume their meat or milk. Large number of unregistered clinics and institutions also generate bio-medical waste which is not controlled. Due to the competition to improve quality and so as to get accreditation from agencies like ISO, NABH, JCI, many private organizations have initiated proper bio-medical waste disposal but still the gap is huge. Many studies took place in Gujarat, India regarding the knowledge of workers in facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes, or home health. It was found that 26% of doctors and 43% of paramedical staff were unaware of the risks related to biomedical wastes. After extensively looking at the different facilities, many were undeveloped in the area regarding biomedical waste. The rules and regulations in India work with The Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules from 1998, yet a large number of health care facilities were found to be sorting the waste incorrectly. Updating this article around 26 March 2020. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been very stringent on the application of the BMW 2016 over the past 12 months. There are now over 200 licensed Common Bio Medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBWTDF) or Common Treatment Facility (CTF) in the country. The rules have been updated over the years. You can find the BMW 2016 act and the subsequent amendments at this site \\"https://earthron.com/bmw-act-and-process\\". The training of Health Care Facility staff and the awareness of the Hazards of Bio Medical waste is still a challenge in most of the country. The compliance is being enforced through penalties and via awareness. The CTF are operational in most Tier 1 cities and Tier 2 cities of India and compliance is high today because of NGT. But lack of awareness lead to issues of improper segregation. In Tier 2 and 3 cities the general waste is also mixed with Bio Medical waste. The latest guidelines for segregation of bio-medical waste recommend the following color coding: *Red BagSyringes (without needles), soiled gloves, catheters, IV tubes etc. should be all disposed of in a red colored bag, which will later be incinerated. *Yellow BagAll dressings, bandages and cotton swabs with body fluids, blood bags, human anatomical waste, body parts are to be discarded in yellow bags. *Cardboard box with blue markingGlass vials, ampules, other glass ware is to be discarded in a cardboard box with a blue marking/sticker. *White Puncture Proof Container (PPC)Needles, sharps, blades are disposed of in a white translucent puncture proof container. *Black BagsThese are to be used for non-bio-medical waste. In a hospital setup, this includes stationary, vegetable and fruit peels, leftovers, packaging including that from medicines, disposable caps, disposable masks, disposable shoe-covers, disposable tea cups, cartons, sweeping dust, kitchen waste etc.  Environmental impacts =The syringe tide environmental disaster = The syringe tide environmental disaster of 1987‚Äì1988 raised awareness about medical waste as medical syringes washed ashore in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. A similar situation occurred in 2013 at Island Beach State Park in New Jersey, and brought about the Floatables Action Plan. The syringes endangered marine species and posed a threat to humans who visited the beach. The crises spurred scientists and lawmakers to create mechanisms, policies, and laws so that health care providers would process their bio-waste in an environmentally friendly way. =Effects of medical waste on the environment = Accumulation of biomedical waste in a hospital basement. Improper management of health care waste can have both direct and indirect health consequences for health personnel, community members and on the environment. Indirect consequences in the form of toxic emissions from inadequate burning of medical waste, or the production of millions of used syringes in a period of three to four weeks from an insufficiently well planned mass immunization campaign. Biomedical waste is not limited to medical instruments; it includes medicine, waste stored in red biohazard bags, and materials used for patient care, such as cotton and bandaids. The most serious effect that biomedical waste has on our seas is the discharge of poisons into the waters that could then be consumed by ocean life creatures. Toxins would interject into the food chain and eventually reach humans who consume sea creatures. Human exposure to such toxins can stunt human growth development and cause birth defects. The high volume of plastic use in the medical field also poses a dangerous threat to the environment. According to North and Halden, 85% of disposable plastic materials make up all medical equipment. Our current reliance on plastic materials is rooted in their unique capabilities to be lightweight, cost-effective, and durable while preserving the sterility of medical equipment. In addition to the serious health implications of releasing harmful toxins in the environment from medical waste deposits, introducing this volume of single-use plastics can catalyze the compounding health detriments caused by macro and microplastics. =Incineration of biomedical waste= Methods of biomedical waste incineration  The three type of medical waste incinerators are controlled air, excess air, and rotary kiln. Controlled air is also known as starved-air incineration, two-stage incineration, or modular combustion. This is the process of which waste is fed to a combustion chamber and combustion air begins to dry and facilitates volatilization of the waste. As a result, carbon dioxide and other excess gases are released into the atmosphere. The second type of incineration is the excess air process. This is similar to the controlled air process, such as the waste being dried, ignited, and combusted by heat provided by the primary chamber burner. However, the main difference is that moisture and volatile components in the waste are vaporized. In a rotary kiln, the process is similar to the two mention above, however, it is more versatile in terms of being able to mix wet and dry waste components and viewed by many waste engineers as being the most environmentally friendly.  Impact on the environment  Post incineration process, toxic ash residue is produced and is often disposed at landfills. These landfills are not protected by any barrier and the residue has the potential of reaching underground water that is often exposed to human use. The combustion of plastic material releases toxic gases that escapes and joins breathable air. Human and animal exposure to such gases can cause long term breathing and health issues. The rotation of toxic air does not only impact human well- being, but also of animals and plants. Air pollution caused by the incinerators depletes the ozone layer, causes crop and forest damage, and increases climate change. Constant exposure to such toxins and chemicals in the air could be deemed detrimental to trees and plants and could eventually lead to extinction of certain plants in specific areas. Pollution and chemical leaks also affect the fruits of trees and would cause them to be poisonous and therefore, inedible. = Environmental waste in California = Medical waste management program  California created the Medical Waste Management Program, which regulates the generation, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste by providing oversight for the implementation of the Medical Waste Management Act. Precautions have been taken in California which permits and inspects all medical waste offsite treatment facilities and medical waste transfer stations. In order to dispose waste, the department recommends the following process to make controlled substance waste nonretrievable. Pills containing a controlled substance are crushed before placing the residue into a pharmaceutical waste container. Controlled substance that is remaining in a syringe is wasted into a pharmaceutical waste container before disposing of the syringe in a sharps container. Expired medications should be returned through a reverse distributor. = Environmentally friendly alternatives = Reusable RMW or sharps containers reduce the amount of plastic sent to landfills and emissions. Non-incineration treatment includes four basic processes: thermal, chemical, irradiative, and biological. The main purpose of the treatment technology is to decontaminate waste by destroying pathogens. Modern technology invented mechanics that would allow medical professionals and hospitals to dispose medical waste in an environmentally friendly way; such as: autoclaving, plasma pyrolysis, gasification, chemical methods, and microwave irradiation. These alternatives are also highly versatile and can be used for all different types of waste. An autoclave, similar to a pressure cooker, uses high-temperature steam to penetrate waste material and kill micro-organisms. Autoclave treatment has been recommended for microbiology and biotechnology waste, waste sharps, soiled and solid wastes. Microwave irradiation is based on the principle of generation of high frequency waves. These waves cause the particles within the waste material to vibrate, generating heat and killing the pathogens from within. A simple yet effective method is chemical disinfection: 1% hypochlorite can kill thriving bacteria. Plasma pyrolysis is an environment- friendly mechanism, which converts organic waste into commercially useful byproducts. The intense heat generated by the plasma enables it to dispose all types of waste including municipal solid waste, biomedical waste and hazardous waste in a safe and reliable manner. Gasification can offer carbon sequestration and energy generation, reducing the carbon footprint of biomedical waste treatment. =Other possible solutions = Initiative from corporations and hospitals is essential to creating a healthier environment, however, there are various methods in which involves action from the general population and would contribute to a clean air environment. By creating surveillance groups within hospitals, everyone would be held accountable for misconduct and improper disposal of waste. Consequences could be implemented where individuals would be required to pay a fine, or face unpaid suspension from work. Companies and governmental organization should also initiate non- routine checkups and searches, this would place pressure on hospitals to ensure that waste is properly disposed all year round. Voluntary clean-ups would involve hospital staff in assuring that medical waste is not littered around the hospital or thrown into regular garbage bins.

He was the first chair of the Council of the District of Columbia and was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of the city in 1978. Early life and education Tucker was born on December 21, 1923, in Akron, Ohio. He was the fourth of eight children. His father was a workforce foreman for the municipal government. In 1942, Tucker graduated from West High School. In 1946, he graduated from University of Akron with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology. In 1950, he earned a master‚Äôs degree in psychology from the same school. At college, he met his future wife, Alloyce Robinson. While in college, Tucker bused tables at the Garden Grille in Akron. He noticed that despite Ohio‚Äôs public accommodations law, African Americans were routinely turned away. Tucker was fired shortly after insisting that he eat in the main dining room while patronizing the restaurant on his day off. Career After graduating, Tucker worked for the National Urban League, first in Canton, Ohio, and in New York City. In 1956, he joined its Washington D.C. office. In 1959, Tucker was fined $500 after pleading no-contest to charges of filing fraudulent income tax returns by over-claiming allowable deductions. President Lyndon B. Johnson pardoned him in 1966. As part of the Poor People's Campaign, along with Reverend Ralph Abernathy and Coretta Scott King, Tucker organized Solidarity Day, a 50,000 member protest in Washington D.C. on June 19, 1969. From 1969 to 1974, he served as a member of the first appointed Council of the District of Columbia and in 1974, he was elected chairman of the council in the first election after District of Columbia home rule was established. He served for one term. Tucker also served as chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. In 1977, he made a pitch to team owners to bring a Major League Baseball team to Washington, D.C. In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor against the incumbent Walter Washington and at-large council member Marion Barry. Tucker lost the primary to Barry by 1,500 votes. In January 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Tucker to be Assistant Secretary for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. He served until the end of Carter's term. In 1981, he opened a consulting firm, Sterling Tucker and Associates. In 1989 and 1990, he served as a director of the D.C. Drug Control Policy, working to develop strategies for combating drug usage in Washington D.C. In 1990, Tucker was chairman of the American Diabetes Association. Death Tucker died in July 2019 at the age of 95 in Washington, D.C. from congestive heart failure and kidney failure. His body was lying in repose in the John A. Wilson Building.

A bestseller, it was the author's breakout novel, retelling the central Star Trek story of the friendship between James T. Kirk and Spock through the experiences of two female civilians, Egyptian Cleante al Faisal and Vulcan T'Shael. It is noted for its emphasis on interpersonal relationships over action, and for the minimal role played in the story by the franchise's established characters. Plot On the planet Vulcan, several representatives of each Federation world are kept as \\"Warrantors of the Peace\\". As close relatives of the leaders of their worlds, they serve as hostages against the actions of their planetary governments, and are immediately killed if their world attacks another Federation planet. Six of these Warrantors - an Andorian, a human, a Vulcan and three Deltans - are kidnapped and held by the Romulan Empire. The Andorian is killed during the kidnap, and the three Deltans are tortured to death by their Klingon captors, acting for the Romulans. The plot focuses on the cultural differences and eventual friendship between the two surviving captives, T'Shael and Cleante. Themes Bonanno's concept of \\"Warrantors of the Peace\\" appears to be an implementation of Roger Fisher's 1981 proposal that the officer who accompanies the President of the United States with nuclear launch codes have those codes implanted in his heart, to be cut out by the President's hand in the event of war: Reception and legacy Dwellers was positively received at publication. While Fantasy Review emphasised the regular cast's incidental appearance in the novel, they recommended it highly despite its \\"minor flaws\\": \\"Dwellers in the Crucible is an excellent study of values ... [t]here are things here to think about which belie the Star Trek image.\\" Later, recalling Dwellers in 2009, author Keith R. A. DeCandido would describe the impact the \\"cool\\" story had on him: \\"I didn't know that a Star Trek book could do that.\\" Controversy In 1992, Bonanno was contracted by Pocket Books to write a follow-up novel to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Her manuscript, entitled Music of the Spheres, reintroduced Dwellers characters Cleante and T'Shael. As Dwellers had done, Music focused on Bonanno's characters rather than on the familiar characters from the television show. This had not been a difficulty in 1985, but by 1992 Paramount Pictures had introduced new standards for Star Trek tie-in novels, which outlawed extensive use of original characters. The story was heavily rewritten, and that rewrite subsequently rewritten by Gene DeWeese. The derivative novel was eventually published as Probe, still naming Bonanno as the author. Despite her wishes, Pocket Books refused to strip her name from the book. Bonanno stated at the time that only one page of the published novel resembled what she had written.

Retrieved on 27-Aug-2008 History Infected or The Infected were formed by Nathan Waters aka Nasty Nate, Robert Gunning and Brandon Faukner in 1993. This was the lineup for the limited release of All the Shit You Hate, recorded in 1994 and 1995. \\"Buff\\" Mike Nagiec joined to play bass in 1995, and Sean Degan joined as second guitarist later on. Faukner left in late 1996, citing creative differences, and Degan was pressed into drumming. This lineup released the band's first full-length studio LP, New Defiance and the notable \\"Alano\\" show, bootlegs of which are one of the few known live recordings of this version of the band. Kevin Davis, former member of several local punk bands, notably Blatherskyte with Nathan Waters, replaced Degan on drums in 1996. A few weeks later, Andrew \\"Andy-Boy\\" Hibpshman joined as second guitarist, but moved to bass when Naigec decided to quit the band. This lineup lasted a year.Liner notes for Tales of a Tortured Mind Gunning left the band in 1997, and the band was searching for a replacement guitarist for some time. Mark Borders, originally a member of the seminal Berea, Kentucky hardcore punk band Deep 13 eventually joined to play guitar, and the most stable lineup of the band, lasting from 1997 to 2000, was complete. The cassette EP Progress in the Downtime, the full-length album Tolerance for Failure, the Floormodeled EP, a split 7\\" record with local band Redheaded Stepchildren and the second installment of All the Shit You Hate were all produced during this time, along with the band's first cross-country tours and many regional performances. Kevin Davis was replaced in 2000 and a series of drummers followed. Edgar Purdom was the longest-lasting of these, filling the role for a little under a year. He left, however, to join label mates The Brassknuckle Boys. Rocky Borders, of Redheaded Stepchildren and Mark's brother, eventually joined as drummer. This was the longest-lasting lineup for the Infected, producing the unreleased studio album All-Time Low and the \\"I5\\" single, as the band disbanded in 2003. In September 2006, the Infected played a reunion concert in order to promote the CD Tales of the Tortured Mind, a retrospective of material from 1996 to 2003. This release was pressed specifically to fund the release of All Time Low, which has been in hiatus due to lack of funding for three years.Mark Borders, September 4, 2006 A second show was played on September 30, 2006, also to fund the release of All Time Low.Eugene Records & Fanzine  Central & Lexington, KY Band and Booking Resources The first show featured the drummer from the Lexington-based rock and roll band HEARTTHROB, while the second has Rocky Borders returning to the lineup. Rocky Borders played his last show with the band on June 16, 2007, with Edgar Purdom rejoining the band a little more than a month later. The Infected recorded a three-song demo directly after Purdom joined the band. However, this line up only lasted for 4 months, with the group deciding to let him go. In 2007, Kelly Patrick Cammack was hired to play drums. In May 2008 Infected parted ways once again, only for Nate to regroup with an all new line up in July 2008. Kevin Davis returned to play drums, along with original guitarist Robert Gunning and long time friend of the band, Mike \\"Beans\\" McCarter on bass. Mark Borders went on to play guitar for Green Jell√ø. Mike \\"Beans\\" McCarter eventually left the band in 2011 after falling out with other members. Since then Infected has fine tuned their lineup, before settling with their current group, which includes the additions of Kevin Mutz on drums, Eric Nickel on Bass, and Chris Reeves as the lead guitarist. As of 2012 Infected continue to tour the U.S., with recent summer tour dates added to the bands web page http://www.infectedrockshop.com In Jan 2013 long time off and on Infected drummer Kevin Davis returned to the band on second guitar replacing Kris Anglin.

Kevin Davis was in the band Blatherskyte with Nathan Waters. Side projects were also very widespread, such as Bitchkiller, featuring Andrew Hibpshman with several ex-members of local grindcore band Ungrateful, and Kane (also known as Cane), which was a humorous hardcore band along the lines of Anal Cunt and Spazz, featuring the members of the Infected and Deep 13 playing instruments that they did not play in their normal band (with the exception of Mark, who played drums in Deep 13 at the time, and Tom Spalding of Deep 13, who played bass in both bands). Both of these bands were relatively short lived, however. The most significant side project was Squall Line. It also featured members of other local bands and former and present Infected members. Andyboy was also in Kill Toby Wyatt which featured members from Deep 13 and The Parlor Boys and is now playing drums with local stoner rockers Stampede and playing guitar in Hateshrines with former Infected and Deep 13 bandmate Mark Borders. Andy has now started a stoner/emo band called Horned Owl as well. Mark Borders has been running sound for bands such as Nashville Pussy, Mot√∂rhead, The Black Dahlia Murder, and various others, as well as playing guitar with Green Jell√ø and Dwarves.

It was developed for the Nintendo DS, though it has been suggested it would have been a WiiWare game instead. Bernard has since expressed interest in bringing the title to Wii U. Set in France during World War II, Imagination Is The Only Escape is an educational title aiming to teach children about The Holocaust. Story The story starts off before the Occupation of France by Nazi Germany. The player is introduced to the main character, a Jewish boy named Samuel who is playing with his friends, going to school, and living a normal life in Paris. However, when France is invaded by the Nazis, Samuel and his family are soon forced to move to a ghetto and wear the yellow star of David on their clothes. The scene changes to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, the mass arrest of Jews in Paris that took place on July 16, 1942. During the chaos Samuel's mother tells him to escape the city. She takes off his star so he cannot be recognized as a Jew, and gives him the address of a Catholic priest who can help him escape Paris and the occupied part of France. As Samuel escapes, his mother is spotted and taken away. Samuel starts his journey to find the priest, sneaking his way through Paris. Samuel finds him, and is smuggled out to southern France. They arrive at a small village hidden in a forest, where the villagers are passing off Jewish children from all over France as Christian orphans, and Samuel meets a fox who tells him that if he helps him he will be able to see his mother again. Development In 2013, Bernard started an Indiegogo drive for Imagination Is the Only Escape. It did not reach its goal, and whether or not the game will eventually be made is unknown. Controversy Imagination has courted controversy for its dark setting and subject matter, though some outlets have applauded the game for approaching such a delicate subject. Nintendo of America has stated that they have no plans to release the game. Bernard claims that the company is afraid of the game's subject matter, but believes Nintendo of Europe will not block its release.

Name Brookspoint was often referred to as the \\"Workingmen's Village\\", referring to the land owners during the time of Mayor Luis Lardizabal, until the name was changed to what it is known as today under Resolution 47-1974; Regular Meeting held on February 27, 1974 D-2A6. The name Brookspoint is believed to have originated from its location, bounded by brooks and creeks. Political division Originally, the barangay was only a small territory, since its area was composed of only 3 districts As time progressed and the number of people increased, houses were built within and around the area, increasing the need to establish its correct boundaries. At present, Brookspoint is composed of seven districts, and is surrounded by nearby barangays such as Pacdal, East Modernsite, South Central and East Bayan Park.  Demographics  As of the 2000 census of the NSCB, Brookspoint had a total population of 1,477. NSO 2007 Census, population is 2,081. NSO Census 2010, population is 2,299. In an August 2015 census report released by Philippine Statistics Authority, the agency recorded a decline with the population now at 2,048.  Geography  Land Area - The total land area of Brookspoint is approximately 13.64 square kilometers. This is inclusive of parts of the mountains. The landmarks circumscribing the community which roughly delineate its boundaries are: * East- Busol Watershed * West- Ledesma, South Central Barangay * North- East Bayan Park Brgy * South- Pacdal Barangay  Language and Dialects  The residents of Brookspoint are a mixture of different peoples of different cultural and ethnical backgrounds who speak varied languages. The most common spoken language is Ilocano, with a large number of residents from the Tagalog ethnic group. Education * Brookspoint Elementary School. Starting its operations in 2009, Brookspoint Elementary School has become one of the anchor projects of the Puguon administration with funding coming from the Department of Education and the National Government.

Konstantinov Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI), member of: the Russian and American Physical Society, the executive committee of the Nuclear Physics Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the editorial board of the Russian journal ‚ÄúYadernaya Fizika‚Äù.Physics of Atomic Nuclei Anselm known for his discovery of non- universality of the Landau pole in Quantum field theory, contributions to the theory of complex angular momenta, works on the Quark model, Spontaneous symmetry breaking, mechanisms of CP violation, modifications of the Standard Model, Cosmology, and the development of a simple model for the proton spin crisis. Biography Anselm was born into a family of physicists. His father (1905‚Äì1988) was a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, professor; his mother Irina Victorovna Motchan (1903‚Äì1978) also was a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. Both parents worked as research scientists at the Leningrad Institute of Semiconductors. Aleksey Anselm graduated summa cum laude from the Leningrad State University (LSU) in 1956 and enrolled at the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute (Phystech) of the . He joined the Nuclear and Particle theory group of professor I. M. Shmushkevich in the Theory Department. It did not take a long time for such leading Soviet theorists as Lev Landau, Karen Ter-Martirosian and Vladimir Gribov to recognize Alexey Anselm as a talented and capable physicist. Weak and strong interactions of elementary particles became the principal field of his scientific research. Director of the B.P. Konstantinov Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute (PNPI) Alexey Andreevich Anselm In 1971 the Theory Department of Phystech was transferred to Gatchina, where it joined the . All further scientific activity of A. Anselm developed in this institute. Besides research, since 1974 A. Anselm was also a professor at the Physics Department of the Leningrad State University where he was teaching graduate courses. In the early 1980s Anselm became a head of the LNPI Theoretical Department, and in 1992 he was elected director of the LNPI. The years immediately after collapse of the Soviet Union were perhaps the most difficult period in the history of this renowned scientific institution. Unfailing determination by Anselm enabled the institute to survive the hard times. In 1994 a serious illness forced Alexey Anselm to retire. He endured hard medical treatments both in St. Petersburg and in Boston (US), where his daughter had moved by that time. At the end medicine was powerless, and he died in the early fall of 1998. Anselm is buried at the town cemetery of Newton, at the outskirts of Boston, US. Scientific contributions * Anselm made significant contributions to quantum field theory and the theory of strong and weak interactions. He actively worked with graduate students and many of his students became internationally recognized theorists in their own right. : In the beginning of 1950s particle physics theory was in deep crisis after L. Landau, A. Abrikosov and I. Khalatinikov discovered that quantum field theory predicts nullification of interaction in quantum electrodynamics. This so called ¬´Moscow Zero¬ª means that quantum field theory, the principal tool of theoretical research in particle physics is not self-consistent. Landau and his school put forward widely accepted arguments that the ¬´Moscow zero¬ª takes place in any field theory and thus any field theory is doomed. In 1959 young Anselm discovered that there is no nullification of interaction in a certain two-dimensional model with four-fermion interaction. This means that the ¬´Moscow zero¬ª is non-universal and self-consistent quantum field theories do exist. Anselm‚Äôs discovery opened a path to constructing a field theory of fundamental particles and their interactions. In modern language Anselm was the first to discover a phenomenon later called ¬´asymptotic freedom¬ª and fundamentally important for the modern quantum field theory: : Still, this first major achievement of young A. Anselm did not receive due attention of the Soviet physicists, and 15 years later the \\"asymptotic freedom‚Äù phenomenon was re-discovered by western scientists. > ¬´Anselm‚Äôs work dates back to rather gloomy days for field theorists, after > Landau‚Äôs discovery of the so-called \\"zero charge\\" or, infrared freedom in > modern terminology.¬ª Anselm‚Äôs Discovery of the Gross‚ÄìNeveu model in M. > Shifman Under the spell of Landau 2013, chapter 11, pp.488-490. * In the early 1960s in search for an alternative to quantum field theory physicists turned to the theory of complex angular momenta. This approach is based on analyticity and unitarity. The principal contributions to the development of this approach were made by V. Gribov and his colleagues, including Anselm. Into cooperation with Y. Azimov, V. Anisovich, G. Danilov, I. Dyatlov, V. Schekhter 85 –ª–µ—Ç –í. –ù. –ì—Ä–∏–±–æ–≤—É –∏ –í. –ú. –®–µ—Ö—Ç–µ—Ä—É Anselm obtained the results that received worldwide renown. Among these results are ** The theory of production of three particles near the threshold; ** Studies of Regge poles in perturbation theory; ** Prediction of the interference minima in a cross section of elastic collisions at large angles, and much more. * At a later stage the field theory took again the central stage in the theoretical research. Anselm started to work on gauge theories, the theoretical basis of the future Standard Model of strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. His emphasis was on the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories interactions. A. Anselm proposed a new mechanism of symmetry breaking in electroweak theory due to ‚Äúradiative‚Äù interaction of heavy quarks. In collaboration with his students D. Diakonov, A. Johansen, and N. Uraltsev he explored whether the asymptotic freedom of gauge theory can be combined with the Higgs phase which prevents the infrared pole, whether an electron mass can be obtained as a radiative correction to the muon mass, whether the observed experimentally CP violation is compatible with the CP violation induced by the complexity of the Higgs sector. * Together with N. Uraltsev, Anselm proposed and studied in detail possible existence of massless or very light Higgs particles. Anselm invented a new kind of one or more massless Goldstone bosons which he christened ¬´arions¬ª. Would these particle be found in nature is today an open question. * Independently of the better known work of the future Nobel Prize winner Gerard 't Hooft Alexey Anselm simultaneously put forth the principle of the quantum anomalies cancellation at the level of constituent particles, * In the last decade of the 20th century, the most cited works by Anselm (partly done jointly with A. Johansen, L. Lipatov, M. Ryskin, A. Shuvaev) were devoted to production of coherent pion fields in ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions. These fields are known today as \\"disoriented chiral condensate\\" (DCC). The possibility of DCC existence is widely discussed in connection with the experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. * Anselm (together with A. Johansen) suggested a natural dynamic mechanism explaining the doublet-triplet hierarchy within supersymmetric grand unified models of electroweak and strong interactions.Ansel'm A. A., Iogansen A. A. Supersymmetry grand unification theory with an automatic fine adjustment - JETP Letters 1986 v. 44 p. 628-631 He has made important contributions to the understanding of the axial anomalies in supersymmetric theories. Social activities * Anselm was a chairman of the Committee on Basic Nuclear Physics at the . The aim of the committee was to identify and support the most promising research projects in Russia. Despite the limited resources available for the Committee A. Anselm managed to support many promising scientific projects. * For many years Anselm organized the scientific program of the annual ¬´Winter School¬ª of the St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute. Thanks to his dedication and talent, each Winter School became an inordinate event. * Anselm was an active promoter and popularizer of the latest achievements of science, especially in physics and cosmology. He wrote for the Russian magazine ¬´Zvezda¬ª, and since 1991 regularly appeared on the air of the Russian Service of BBC in the ¬´Paradigm¬ª programs with Yuri Kolker. Later, some of the talks between J. Kolker and A. Anselm were featured in the article entitled ¬´How this world is arranged¬ª.

The risks are particularly severe in some regions of Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. The Department of Climate Change said in its Climate Change Impacts and Costs fact sheet: \\"...ecologically rich sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland Wet Tropics, Kakadu Wetlands, Australian Alpine areas, south-western Australia and sub- Antarctic islands are all at risk, with significant loss of biodiversity projected to occur by 2020\\".Climate Change ‚Äì Potential impacts and costs Retrieved 2008-08-01 It also said: \\"Very conservatively, 90 Australian animal species have so far been identified at risk from climate change, including mammals, insects, birds, reptiles, fish, and amphibians from all parts of Australia.\\" Australia is already the driest populated continent in the world. Seawall in Machans Beach, Queensland Climate change is recognised as one of the largest global crises. The issue has gained traction around the world as the world becomes increasingly urbanised. This is because urbanisation brings irreversible changes in our patterns of resource/waste production and consumption. Therefore, how to plan, manage, and live in cities will be largely determined by the progress of the climate change phenomenon.Global Warming Threatens Australia's Tropical Biodiversity Retrieved 2008-07-29 According to projections by the Department of Climate Change in Australia, it is expected that national average temperatures would increase by 0.4 to 2.0 ¬∞C . Based on some predictions for 2070, data suggests that people who are not accustomed to the warmer climate may experience as much as 45 days per year where they are unable to tolerate being outside, compared to the current 4‚Äì6 days per year. Rainfall patterns and the degree of droughts and storms brought about by extreme weather conditions are likely to be affected. Research has suggested that nearly three-quarters of global energy consumption occur in cities, while emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming come from urban areas.Global Warming is a reality already with us Retrieved 2008-07-29 Nearly a third of these emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels used in urban transportation. Another third is formed from the energy used to regulate building temperature and to run personal appliances. The final third is contributed by the industrial sector. The main emitters of greenhouse gases are the construction, real estate, agriculture and metallurgical industries, the transportation sector, the industrial uses of fossil fuels and the burning of biomass.Top Greenhouse Gas Emitters Not Disclosing, Acting of Financial Risks of Climate Change Retrieved 2008-06-22 Some examples of daily activities that contribute to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere include the use of carbon-based electricity in street lighting, driving motor vehicles, cooking, and the lighting, heating and cooling of housing. If the policies of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries remain unchanged, specifically Australia and the United States, and also China and India, carbon dioxide emissions, which represents 72% of all greenhouse gas emissions, will increase by a third in the year 2020 instead of the 5% reduction as was approved in the Kyoto Protocol.Ratification of the Convention on the OECD Retrieved 2008-07-29 With the current path of climate change, the world population is entering an era of growing urban vulnerability. The accelerated pace of urbanisation and the increasing percentage of the world's population living in cities has significantly increased the vulnerability of urban areas as anthropogenic hazards and agents for climate change.  Adaptation  According to the IPCC's 2001 Assessment Report, no matter how much effort is put into mitigating climate change, some amount of climate change cannot be avoided. The report shared that adaptation should complement mitigation efforts.Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report Retrieved 2008-07-30 Adaptation is the approach that focuses on alleviating current problems brought about by global warming and climate change. It is the attempt to live with the changes in the environment and the economy that global warming has generated and will continue to generate. In short, it involves taking action to deal with the problems brought about by global warming and climate change. Examples include building better flood defences and avoiding the building of residential areas near low-lying, flood-prone areas. In contrast, mitigation focuses on steps taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is the set of preventative measures taken to curb global warming and climate change. Examples would be investing in clean fuel and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. Although national governments and local authorities are taking stringent mitigation measures, the need for adaptation is in the interest of dealing with climate change because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for decades and is trapped in oceans for centuries, thereby resulting in a change in ocean chemistry and may adversely affect ocean life.Oceans Found to Absorb Half of All Man-Made Carbon Dioxide Retrieved 2008-07-29 No matter how much humanity cuts greenhouse gas emissions now, the emissions released now will have an impact for decades. Therefore, adaptation is crucial for cities looking towards strengthening their resistance against the climate impact that past emissions have caused ‚Äì to deal with the problems caused by greenhouse gas emissions pumped out years ago. The determinants of adaptive capacity include the availability of financial resources, technology, specialised institutions and human resources, as well as access to information and existence of laws (both social and organisational) ‚Äì attributes and resources that are usually scarce in developing countries and in small cities. In cities with a proven vulnerability to climate change, investment is likely to require the strengthening of urban infrastructure, including storm drain systems, water supply and treatment plants, and protection or relocation of solid waste management and power generation facilities. Coastal regions are likely to need large investment in physical infrastructure projects, specifically projects related to the effects of rising sea levels. Projects such as the construction of protective barriers against rising sea levels, the building of dams to retain and manage water, the redesign and development of port facilities and the improvement of the defence systems at coastal areas should be carried out. Another measure of adaptation is the construction of new cities on higher ground, withdrawing the population away from vulnerable floodplains. This withdrawal would probably be managed over time, and may require a public- private partnership consisting of a combination of market incentives such as the differential cost of insurance and re-insurance, and investment planning. Internalising the limitations of climate change requires proper planning for land use and the adherence to building codes. Planning for land use should channel new residential developments and productive investment towards less vulnerable areas. The inhabitants of slums and informal housing should receive assistance to regularise their properties, enabling low-income groups such as themselves to buy, build or rent homes in secure locations. As a basis for planning, local authorities need a reliable and well-informed assessment of the risks faced by urban cities. The dissemination of such information, and establishing early warning systems and evacuation plans including warning systems for emergencies, disaster response and improved urban environmental management is crucial for adapting to the dangers of climate change.  Projects and programs in Australia  Federal, state and territory policy makers have supported a National Biodiversity and Climate Change Action Plan that works to adapt to the impacts of climatic change and manage the effects on wildlife. The nation is also interested to co-ordinate the management of its coasts and strives to lessen the effects of climate change on agriculture. Federal natural resource goals, government agencies and non-government organizations established 56 regional resource management (NRM), organisations beginning in the mid-1990s. NRM organisations fall under the federal government Natural Heritage Trust. NRM operate according to individual constitutions, usually by the state government and others by community associations. Their boards are appointed by either the local government or community stakeholders. NRM Planning for Climate Fund', put $13.6 million toward helping NRMs plan land use in light of climate change by building a base of detailed climatic information. Part of making this included making interactive online tools for interpreting climate data: Regional Climate Change Explorer, Climate Futures Tool, and Climate Campus. Adaption NRM makes climate information easier to apply to regional planning through 5 modules. These include an NRM Adaption Checklist, adaptive weed management framework, modeling techniques for biodiversity, field options for biodiversity management, and stakeholder engagement. The World Resources Institute identifies policy uncertainty and over-reliance on international markets as the top threats to Australia's GHG mitigation. Internationally, Australia is bound to reducing emissions to at least 5% by 2020 under the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements and .5% less than 1990 levels by 2020 under the Kyoto Protocol. Domestically, the Clean Energy Act 2011 addresses GHG with an emissions cap, carbon price, and subsidies. Emissions by the electric sector are addressed by Renewable Energy targets at multiple scales, Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), carbon capture and storage flagships, and feed-in tariffs on solar panels. Emissions by the industrial sector are addressed by the Energy Efficiency Opportunities (EEO) program. Emissions by the building sector are addressed by building codes, minimum energy performance standards, Commercial Building Disclosure program, state energy-saving obligations, and the National Energy Saving Initiative. Emissions by the transportation sector are addressed by reduced fuel tax credits and vehicle emissions performance standards. Emissions by the agricultural sector are addressed by the Carbon Farming Initiative and state land-clearing laws. Emissions by the land use sector are addressed by the Clean Energy Future Package, which consists of the Carbon Farming Futures program, Diversity Fund, Regional Natural Resources Management Planning for Climate Change Fund, Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund, and Carbon Farming Skills program. = National Climate Change Adaptation Programme = The Department of Climate Change (Australia) has come up with the National Climate Change Adaptation Programme which aims to work with industries, scientific organisations, residents and other governments to create workable solutions. According to the programme brochure, \\"Guidelines, planning tools and information about climate change impacts form the basis of the Programme\\".National Climate Change Adaptation Programme Retrieved 2008-07-31 Some A$14 million over a period of four years (2008‚Äì2012) is to be spent on this initiative . The programme has forged strong research links in at-risk areas such as the Great Barrier Reef. Research conducted in the Great Barrier Reef is focused on developing methods to deal with climate change to protect the reef. It is hoped that this work will create a universal model for sustainable, cost-effective reef development. According to the programme's brochure: \\"National greenhouse mitigation policies and programmes are projected to reduce emissions by 94 million tonnes by 2010 ‚Äì the equivalent of removing every motor vehicle in Australia from the road! However, the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere and the growing emissions from around the world will affect our climate. Adaptation to climate change will complement action to reduce greenhouse gases\\". = Climate Adaptation Flagship = The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) started the Climate Adaptation Flagship , with the aim of \\"enabling Australia to adapt more effectively to the impacts of climate change and variability and informing national planning, regulation and investment decisions\\". This is part of the National Research Flagships Program , designed to bring various stakeholders, i.e. research companies, industries, international connections, eminent scientists and CSIRO, together in hope of delivering practical solutions that address the pressing issues of Australia. The Climate Adaptation Flagship project concerns both climate variability (or non-human causes, as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and climate change. The research budget for this Flagship for the year 2008‚Äì09 is close to A$30 million . There are four research prongs to this project: # Pathways to adaptation: Concerns studies on climate science, analyses of economic and social situations and choices of adaptation, understanding the values of various affected and involved parties, effects of implementing adaption options, and the hurdles limiting adaptation. # Sustainable cities and costs: Concerns research into facilities design, development of urban systems, integration of socio-economic and environmental studies to help stakeholders adjust to the effects of climate change on a regional level, and the development of high-quality urban development projects that improve the available body of information related to climate adaptation with a focus on cohesive urban construction and development. # Managing species and natural ecosystems: Concerns research into forecasting nature's response to climate change, and coming up with adaptation options to improve its hardiness; minimising the threats brought about by forest fires, habitat loss and invasive species; and connecting climate change adaptation strategies into environmental protection and natural resource administration policies. # Adaptive primary industries, enterprises and communities: Concerns research into providing workable adaptation solutions that will maintain the way of life of rural communities and industries adversely affected by the prospect of climate change, the use of participatory engagement to integrate policies that address the management of uncertainties brought about by climate change into administrative policies of the industries, choices of adaptation and tools to aid decision-makers and industries in lessening the impacts of climate change and to allow them to benefit from new opportunities, and the development of new techniques and technologies to enable industries to properly and effectively manage climate change. = National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility = NCCARF is hosted by Griffith University in Queensland and \\"leads the research community in a national interdisciplinary effort to generate the information needed by decision-makers in government and in vulnerable sectors and communities to manage the risks of climate change impacts.\\".National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility Retrieved 2011-07-06 The key roles of NCCARF include: * developing National Adaptation Research Plans to identify critical gaps in the information available to decision-makers * synthesising existing and emerging national and international research on climate change impacts and adaptation and developing targeted communication products * undertaking a program of Integrative Research to address national priorities, and * establishing and maintaining Adaptation Research Networks to link together key researchers and assist them in focussing on national research priorities. The facility is a partnership between the Australian government's Department of Climate Change and Griffith University, with a consortium of funding partners drawn from across the country: * Queensland Government * Griffith University * James Cook University * Macquarie University * Murdoch University * Queensland University of Technology * The University of Newcastle * University of Southern Queensland * University of the Sunshine Coast The facility is based at Griffith University's Gold Coast campus, but works in close partnership with the wider Australian climate change adaptation research community. = The Local Adaptations Pathway Program = The Australian government is of the view that local government is critical in managing the impacts of climate change and seeks to assist local councils in studying and applying adaptation options. The programme is the Australian government's initiative to enable councils to go through climate change risk assessments and come up with action plans to prepare for the impacts the phenomenon may have on local society. Up to A$50,000 will be released. A list of councils successful in procuring the funding is provided on the programme's website .

The clandestine, yet altruistic group is said to consist of seven senior individuals, selected in their junior year. While, historically, graduating members formally announced their identities each spring, today's membership is steeped in mystery and is only revealed upon a member's death. Now rumored to meet late at night in Colonial Williamsburg's Shields Tavern, present-day Sevens are perhaps most noted for their efforts to honor and encourage those who help strengthen the university. Through its endowment association, the society pursues major philanthropic projects such as scholarships and anonymous donations to the College. Sevens have also been known to mysteriously leave small gifts and tokens of appreciation for unsuspecting groups and individuals (e.g., in 2003, an admissions counselor discovered two dozen golf umbrellas ‚Äì each adorned with the '7' symbol ‚Äì after casually mentioning how helpful they'd be during rainy campus tours). History The Seven Society is most commonly believed to have been founded in 1826. Little else is known about the society's early history; for the College of William & Mary, the second half of the 19th century brought the American Civil War, two devastating campus fires, and the College's subsequent closing from 1881 to 1888. But by the beginning of the 20th century, the Sevens had resurfaced; and in 1939 the group publicly declared themselves to be ‚Äúthe only secret society of the College of William and Mary\\" (other recorded groups ‚Äì namely The 13s, Alphas, and Flat Hats ‚Äì were highly selective student clubs that would later be revived as secret societies). =Motifs and symbols= In chartering the College of William & Mary, founding benefactors King William III and Queen Mary II of England sought to establish \\"a certain place of universal study\\" to be led by \\"one President, six Masters or Professors.\\" Together these seven individuals would be known simply as the Society. In 1729, after the full installation of the College‚Äôs \\"departments\\" (a president and six professors), corporate authority of William & Mary was transferred from the College‚Äôs surviving trustees to the seven-member Society. The group served as the governing body for the university ‚Äì ensuring William & Mary‚Äôs continuous wellbeing and future prosperity. A seven motif appears elsewhere on the campus. The Royal Charter instructs chancellors to serve seven year terms. The Sunken Gardens area is crossed with seven brick pathways. Seven buildings surround the gardens- Washington Hall, Ewell Hall, McGlothin Street Hall, the Christopher Wren building, John Tyler Hall, Tucker Hall, and James Blair Hall. Of the lodge buildings, housing in the middle of campus traditionally held by seniors (until they were knocked down in 2016 for the construction of the Integrated Wellness Center), seven were used for housing. Tyler and The Seven Wise Men Flowers, said to be left by the Sevens, occasionally adorn this sculpture of President Lyon Gardiner Tyler located in W&M;'s Tyler Family Garden. The most legendary Society was established and led by the College‚Äôs 17th president, Lyon Gardiner Tyler. Still suffering from the effects of the Civil War, William & Mary was ultimately forced to close its doors in 1881. After being closed for seven years, the school was reopened in 1888 by the then newly appointed president, Lyon G. Tyler. By 1891, President Tyler had managed to assemble a \\"small but able\\" teaching staff that included professors Hugh S. Bird, Charles E. Bishop, Van F. Garrett, J. Lesslie Hall, Thomas J. Stubbs, and Lyman B. Wharton. Affectionately dubbed the \\"Seven Wise Men\\" by students, Tyler and the six professors are credited not only with reviving William & Mary but also for transforming the College into a thriving, modern- day university. =Notable 20th-century members= * Lawrence W. l‚ÄôAnson ‚Äì Chief Justice, Virginia Supreme Court (1974‚Äì1981) * Roy R.

His crimes were committed when he was in the United States Army, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was tried and convicted by military courts and was sentenced to be put to death. On November 26, 2008, a federal judge issued a stay of execution stopping the planned December 10 execution. On January 26, 2012, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief in Gray's case and on November 13, 2017 the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces similarly denied an appeal for extraordinary relief.  Early life  Gray was born in Cochran, Georgia, but grew up in Liberty City, a public housing project in Miami. He enlisted at age 18 in 1984 and was assigned to the Target Acquisition Battery, 1-39 Field Artillery Battalion. At the time of his arrest, he was stationed at Fort Bragg, near Fayetteville, North Carolina, holding the rank of Specialist Four (E-4) and serving as a cook assigned to 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne. During his court-martial, his mother Lizzie Hurd and sister testified that he had been abused by his stepfather as a child. Colonel David Armitage, a military forensic psychiatrist, also testified that in Gray's early life he had experienced:  Crimes  On April 27, 1986, Gray murdered civilian Linda Jean Coats, age , a student at nearby Campbell University. On December 11, 1986, Gray abducted, raped, and murdered a second civilian, Tammy Cofer Wilson, age 18. On December 15, 1986, Gray abducted, raped, sodomized, and murdered Private Laura Lee Vickery-Clay, age 18. She disappeared from Fort Bragg. Two witnesses saw her at a local K-Mart with a man later identified as Gray. Vickery-Clay's car, found the next morning a block from her home, appeared to have been driven through the woods, and the driver's seat was set back farther than necessary for Vickery-Clay to drive. Three of Gray's fingerprints were found on the hood of the car. On January 17, 1987, a soldier discovered Vickery-Clay's half-naked, decomposed body in the woods in Fort Bragg. She had been raped, sodomized, and shot in the neck, forehead, chest, and back of the head. She had also suffered blunt force trauma to various parts of her body. The murder weapon, a .22 caliber pistol that Gray had stolen in November 1986, was found 60 feet from the victim's body. On January 3, 1987, he raped and attempted to murder Private Mary Ann Lang Nameth, age 20. Gray entered her barracks room under the pretense of needing to use the bathroom. Once inside, Gray grabbed Nameth, held a knife to her throat, and asked for her military field gear. Gray tied Nameth's hands behind her back, removed her underclothing, and raped her. Gray then stabbed her repeatedly in the neck and on the side of her body, and threatened to return and kill her if she screamed. Nameth suffered a lacerated trachea and a collapsed lung, but survived. When Gray's photograph appeared in the news following his arrest for another crime, Nameth identified him as her assailant. Three days later, on January 6, he raped, sodomized, robbed, and murdered a third civilian, Kimberly Ann Ruggles, age 23. On the evening of January 6, a local cab driver, was dispatched to pick up a passenger named \\"Ron\\" at Gray's address. In the early morning hours of January 7, military police officers on routine patrol discovered Ruggles' empty cab parked at the edge of the woods. Her nude body was discovered a short distance away. She had been raped, sodomized, beaten, and stabbed seven times. Ruggles' mouth was gagged with a cloth belt that matched a pair of black karate pants other police officers had found in Gray's possession hours earlier. Gray's fingerprints were on the interior door handle of Ruggles' taxi, and Ruggles' fingerprints were found on money in Gray's possession. Gray's footprints were also found at the scene of the crime.  Criminal case  In November 1987, Gray pleaded guilty in Cumberland County Superior Court to 22 felonies: two counts of second degree murder (Coats and Wilson), two counts of first degree burglary, five counts of first degree rape, five counts of first degree sexual offense, one count of attempted first degree rape, three counts of second degree kidnapping, two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, and one count each of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflicting serious injury. He was sentenced to eight life sentences, including three to be served concurrently. Gray was also tried by a military court. The general court-martial lasted from December 1987 until April 1988 and was composed of commissioned and enlisted soldiers at Fort Bragg. Gray was convicted of 14 charges, including the premeditated murders of Ruggles and Vickery-Clay, the attempted premeditated murder of Lang Nameth, three rapes, two robberies, and two counts of forcible sodomy. On April 12, 1988, he was unanimously sentenced to death. He was additionally sentenced to a Dishonorable Discharge, total forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction in rank to Private E-1. On July 29, 1988, the Commanding General of the 82nd Airborne Division approved the sentence. Gray was 22 at the time of his sentencing. Gray remains on death row at the United States Disciplinary Barracks, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. As a member of the United States Armed Forces, Gray cannot be executed until the president approves the death sentence. On July 28, 2008, President George W. Bush approved Gray's execution, making Gray the first service member sentenced to death since 1961. One month later, Army Secretary Pete Geren set the execution date as December 10, 2008, and ordered that Gray be put to death by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. The military released the news of Gray's execution date on November 20, 2008. Army personnel will be responsible for conducting the execution, based on an agreement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Appeals  Immediately following Gray's court- martial, the records of the trial were forwarded to Defense Appellate Division and received by them on August 8, 1988. Counsel filed initial pleadings with the Court of Military Review on September 15, 1989. On February 13, 1990, that court ordered a sanity board, which, on June 30, 1990, found that Gray was responsible at the time of the offenses and that he was competent to understand his trial and the present appellate proceedings. On July 20, 1990, the Government Appellate Division answered Gray‚Äôs assignment of errors. On December 27, 1990, Gray filed a motion with the Court of Military Review requesting that court to order the Government to provide $15,000 for an expert psychiatrist, a death penalty qualified attorney, and an investigator. Oral arguments were heard on the motion in January 1991. On March 12, 1991, the Court of Military Review denied the motion. Gray renewed his request for a psychiatrist and an investigator on August 7, 1991, but the Court of Military Review denied it on August 23, 1991. On September 12, 1991, Gray filed a writ- appeal petition requesting that this Court order the Government to provide $10,000 and an emergency stay of the proceedings before the Court of Military Review. On October 18, 1991, this Court denied the writ-appeal petition and the stay application. On December 16, 1991, Gray filed a motion with the Court of Military Review requesting that court to order additional medical and psychological tests be performed by military authorities. On December 31, 1991, that court granted Gray‚Äôs request and ordered a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the brain; a 20-channel scalp electrode, sleep-deprived EEG; and a SPECT scan of his brain, as well as intellectual, academic, psychological, and personality tests. On February 18, 1992, a report based on these tests was completed by Captain Fred H. Brown, Jr., Ph.D., a clinical psychologist from Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg. Brown stated in an affidavit filed with the appellate court that Gray was sane at the time of the offenses and during the proceedings. On March 9, 1992, counsel filed a petition for new trial based on newly discovered evidence of lack of mental responsibility. On February 26, 1992, Gray filed a supplementary assignment of errors, to which the Government responded on March 27, 1992. On April 8, 1992, the Court of Military Review heard oral arguments, and on December 15, 1992, denied the petition for a new trial and affirmed the findings and sentence. On December 30, 1992, Gray filed a motion renewing his request for funds for an expert investigator and a behavioral neurologist. Gray filed a petition for reconsideration of this decision on January 4, 1993. The Court of Military Review heard oral arguments on the motion for funding on January 21, 1993, and denied the motion for funding and the petition for reconsideration on January 22, 1993. On February 11, 1993, Gray filed a motion and suggestion for reconsideration by the court sitting en banc of the denial of funding, and a motion and suggestion for reconsideration by the court sitting en banc of the decision of December 15, 1992. On March 11, 1993, the court denied both motions and the suggestions for reconsideration en banc, but granted a motion allowing Gray to file a supplemental assignment of errors (XXVIII-LVI). The Government answered this assignment of errors on April 12, 1993. On June 9, 1993, the Court of Military Review again affirmed the findings and sentence. Gray filed a motion for reconsideration on June 28, 1993, which the court denied on June 30, 1993. With Gray's sentence affirmed by the President and the warrant issued by the Secretary of the Army, execution was scheduled for December 10, 2008. Army spokesman Lt. Col. George Wright said on November 20 (the date when the execution date was announced) that Gray had two legal options remaining: filing a petition with a federal appellate court to stay the execution, or requesting that the president reconsider approval of the execution. On November 26, 2008, a federal judge granted Gray a stay of execution to allow time for further appeals. On January 26, 2012, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief. On September 29, 2015, a judge ruled against Gray's arguments of his appeal thus ending the long-running appeal set into motion by Bush's approval of Gray's sentence in 2008. On November 13, 2017 the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces issued a Per Curiam Opinion denying Gray's Writ of Error Coram Nobis with prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction. On June 28, 2018, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear Gray's case, without giving a reason.  See also  * John A.

Before he came to Essendon, Hanley played his football at South Ballarat. He was used mostly as a defender during his VFL career but also spent some time as a follower. A premiership player in both 1911 and 1912, he remained with Essendon until the conclusion of the 1914 season when he was suspended for eight matches in the penultimate game of the year. He did not return the following season and instead joined the army with whom he served overseas. Hanley was involved in a controversial incident in 1912 when he alleged that he had been deliberately impeded by a boundary umpire. His allegation was that when he was on the boundary line competing against a Collingwood player for the ball, the umpire grasped him by the hand, thus preventing him from taking part in the contest. The umpire was not punished due to a lack of witnesses. References *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007). The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. 7th ed. Melbourne: Bas Publishing.

After Barry won the mayoral election, his seat representing Ward 8 on the Council became vacant. Whittington announced her candidacy for the seat on the Council. She was backed by Barry, and her campaign was chaired by Barry's wife, Cora Masters Barry. Initial results from the special election had Whittington in first place by two votes. Candidate Sandy Allen sued to have the election voided because she said individuals who were not residents of Ward 8 had voted in the special election. After a recount, Whittington's lead was revised to one vote. Allen filed another lawsuit to prevent Whittington from taking office, saying that multiple votes for Whittington were cast by individuals who did not live in Ward 8. The court allowed Whittington to be sworn into office, and she took the oath on May 31, 1995. The court later rejected the residence challenge by Allen, saying that Allen had failed to prove that any of the people she named were not actually residents of Ward 8 at the time of the election. Allen filed another lawsuit to overturn the election's results because of alleged voting irregularities. The court allowed the election to stand.  1996 campaign for Council  Whittington ran for reelection in 1996, and her candidacy was endorsed by Mayor Barry. Allen defeated Whittington in the Democratic party primary election, receiving 1,746 votes to Whittington's 1,425.

Released theatrically on April 1, 1945, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the final wartime Woody Woodpecker short released a month before V-E Day and 4 months before V-J Day. Plot Woody walks about town and realizes that all of the restaurants are closed. He finds one store with a sign in its window that reads: \\"We stuff birds.\\" He assumes that it is a restaurant when it is actually a taxidermist's shop. He approaches the counter to place his order. From his coat pocket, the taxidermist, an anthropomorphic cat (voice by Hans Conried), removes an ad from the Museum of Natural History announcing a $100,000 reward for a stuffed king-size woodpecker. He secretly places knock- out drops in the food he prepares for Woody. The food puts Woody to sleep, but he recovers on the cutting table. He escapes the taxidermist by climbing onto an elevator; the taxidermist falls down the elevator shaft to the basement, where he abandons his $100,000 ambition Cultural references *Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's \\"Funeral March\\" can be heard in the background score as the taxidermist places the knock-out drops into Woody's food. *The taxidermist refers to Woody's soup as \\"blackout borscht.\\" At the time of Woody Dines Out's release, blackouts were common among coastal regions of the United States. Borscht is a Russian dish, and the Soviet Union was a member of the Allied Powers at the time. *As Woody pilots the elevator to faster and faster speeds, the speedometer reads: Is this trip really necessary? This is a reference to the army rationing of gasoline and rubber for the war effort. *The background for the title card is two plates of food, which ties into the cartoon name.

She was named \\"Merited Artist of the Soviet Union\\". Kuinova was born in Samarqand, Uzbek SSR, but moved to Stalinabad, Tajik SSR with her seven brothers and two sisters when she was thirteen years old, after their father was jailed and murdered by the Soviet government for his mercantile prosperity. Her family were Bukharian Jews, and their last name was originally Cohen, but Fatima changed it to Kuinova to escape the persecution Jews faced under Stalin. During her childhood, she knew the famous Mullodzhanov family and was a friend to Shoista Mullojonova. Fatima was raised in Central Asia under Stalin's Soviet regime and spoke Russian, but she also learned Bukhori, which is a dialect of the Persian. Her father was the cantor of the Bukharian Jewish synagogue and taught Fatima the music of her Bukharian Jewish heritage. Kuinova began singing in different festivals at a young age. She also sang for Joseph Stalin, who was likely ignorant of her Jewish faith. Fatima became famous after performing for the soldiers during World War II. In 1948, she was named \\"Honored Artist of the Soviet Union\\". After that, she began to study Shashmakom music and sang it throughout the Soviet Union and Central Asia. Kuinova became the lead singer of the Tajik State Philharmonic, with long-time friend Shoista Mullojonova. The two were widely recognized in the republic and were some of the Soviet Union's leading traditional performers. Both Fatima and Shoista were soloists in the Tajik Ensemble \\"Rubobistok\\" that performed on television and radio throughout the Tajik SSR, Central Asia and the USSR and traveled to sing in areas like Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow. She also went on tours to Europe, Afghanistan, and Iran, where she sang for the Shah. She immigrated to Queens, New York, USA in 1980 and settled in Rego Park, where she founded and was the lead vocalist for the Shashmaqam Music of the Bukharan Jews Ensemble. In 1992, Kuinova was a recipient of the National Heritage Fellowship award, given by the National Endowment for the Arts. In Queens, Fatima works with the Bukharian Jewish musical community and performs in numerous cultural and folk events in New York City.

Lavadenz, Alfonso Monta√±o Lino, Jose Camaho Arancivia, Jos√© Cuadros Quiroga, Germ√°n Monroy Block, Rodolfo Costas, Ra√∫l Molina Guti√©rrez, Rigoberto Armaza Lopera and others, Rodolfo Plaza Montero refused to accept any official position with the new government and dedicated his time to his import and export business. Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans regard Plaza as one of the best amateur players of Bolivian f√∫tbol comparable to the likes of Mario Alborta, Roberto Soto and others. Rodolfo Plaza Montero had been major national player both for Bolivar and the national team. As the team's only player to serve as coach and president, this makes him the only person in the history of Bolivian f√∫tbol to be a champion as a player, coach and president. Early years Rodolfo was the fifth son born to Miguel Plaza Coca and Asteria Montero. He was born in Cochabamba, Bolivia. His older brothers; Miguel Plaza Montero, Andres Plaza Montero and Juan Plaza Montero were great athletes in their own merits. Miguel was a great f√∫tbol player, Andr√©s was a national boxing champion who beat Froilan Pinilla by a few points. Andres Plaza Montero played f√∫tbol for The Strongest, the classic nemesis of Bolivar and Juan Plaza Montero was a national boxing champion in Chile, staging most of his fights in Valparaiso. Rodolfo started his athletic career as a boxer. He fought in preliminary bouts when his older brother Andres beat Froilan Pinilla in the main event. The four brothers spent some time in Chile and arrived in La Paz in 1923. Rodolfo attended primary school leaving it while in the third grade. He worked for a printing press where he improved his vocabulary while setting up the press. He also learned the trade of tailor. He started his f√∫tbol career early and started playing for Bolivar in 1929 at age 20. In 1931, Bolivar won its first championship in what was called Asociaci√≥n de F√∫tbol de La Paz. The f√∫tbol games were cancelled in 1932 and 1933 . In 1932 Rodolfo was called to serve in the Bolivian army and was sent to the front lines where he served as a suboficial (Chief Warrant Officer). He was wounded in the left arm by a bullet. In 1933, while in the Gran Chaco (the largest dry forest in South America and the continent‚Äôs most extensive forested region after Amazonia), Rodolfo caught yellow fever and almost died. For the rest of his life, he asserted that the cure of yellow fever was the thermal baths of Urmiri where he spent most of 1934. Rodolfo was awarded the \\"Benemerito de la Guerra del Chaco Award\\" (Hero of the Chaco War) but chose not to collect any benefits. Club career El Cabro Plaza and his team won the championships of The Bolivian Amateur F√∫tbol League (Liga de F√∫tbol Amateur Boliviano) six times in 1931, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942. In addition, El Cabro Plaza won the championship in 1956 as coach and president. One of Rodolfo's teammates, Walter \\"Chingolo\\" Orozco, is considered one of the icons of the team. Orozco stated that Club Bolivar became The Academy in the 1930s and 1940s when Orozco, Alborta, El Cabro Plaza, Angulo, Teran, Velasco, Durandal, Molina, Saravia and others played for the team. That team was composed by the subtlety of Orozco, the gallantry of Mario Alborta, the power of Kullu Baldell√≥n, firmness and poise of El Cabro Plaza. International career=1938 Juegos Bolivarianos= 22 August 1938, El Cabro Plaza scored the two goals to beat Ecuador 2-1 and give Bolivia the Silver Medal of the tournament. =Playing style= El Cabro Plaza had speed, a powerful left leg and great vision and knowledge of the game. He was a team player and played in the old style alignment that had 1 Goalkeeper, 2 Backs 3 Midfielders and 5 forwards. In his days there were no numbers assigned to the club jerseys but he would sport number 7 (Left Wing) in the 1950s and 1960s. El Cabro Plaza seemed to know where every player in the field was going and his centers of the ball were feared by the opposing midfielders, backs and goalkeepers, El Cabro scored many goals with powerful shots outside the penalty box. El Cabro was a very aggressive player that did not fear shoulder to shoulder bumps and could head the ball into the net when corner kicks were served by the right wing. This picture shows both, Miguel Plaza Montero and Rodolfo Plaza Montero during the last days amateur f√∫tbol The most valuable player, Ultima Hora. In 1957 that \\"Bol√≠var\\" of golden times of the 1930s and 1940s had fielded some insurmountable \\"cracks\\" in an old timers game in the Hernando Silez Stadium. Mario Alborta was geometrically precise, almost intellectual and classical perfection. That goal he scored in Santiago de Chile, the first minute, was unique in the annals of South American football. By the end, Nicomedes Tapia, fast and efficacious, and the bold Cabro Plaza, a real kid since age 18 became the terror of the archers, great player who became president of the Club. His eagle eye dominated the entire field. Nobody beat him in the accuracy of the passes when he opened the game by the left wing or in the power of free kicks. Bold goalkeepers: Ponce, and the great Angel Saavedra Velasco so hard to beat. Also, one should remember great players like Aguilar, Segaline, Bustamante, Sainz, Fernando Velasco, Arturo Plaza, Gualberto Saravia, Quiroga. And on defense relive the great figures of Durandal and Angulo, the ball control of Beriche Rengel. On the Monday edition's of the daily newspaper Ultima Hora the sports page had a section where the most valuable player (el mejor jugador del domingo) was featured. On that Monday El Cabro made the feature ebem hough the top card of the afternoon had stars like Victor Augustin Ugarte and Mario Mena. Mario Alborta (hand over his face) died 10 years later in January 1976 Political views and a revolutionary In the 1940s Rodolfo Plaza and his brothers Miguel Y Andres had set up store fronts within a block of each other. Rodolfo's business was across the Tel√©grafos in Ayacucho street. Andres had his shop set up at the opposite corner on the Post Office in the corner of Potosi street and Ayacucho Street. Miguel had his shop located a block from Andres' located in Potosi street. The three brothers were successful businessmen. Rodolfo was the only one of the three that fought in the Chaco War, He started his involvement in politics influenced by the emergence of Raz√≥n de Patria (a hitherto-secret military faction known as Radepa (Raz√≥n de Patria, or Fatherland's Cause) established by veteran military officers of the Bolivian Army disappointment of the way President [Daniel Salamanca Urey] managed the war. The massacres of Catavi and Siglo XX the ongoing Spanish Civil War also had influenced Rodolfo's views. He showed loyalty to his veteran comrades and assisted them financially and by publishing a left wing circular called Alambre de P√∫a edited by a fellow whose last name was Murillo. It is said that the Government of the Sexenio had tortured Murillo and forced him to drink motor oil. The six years preceding the 1952 Revolution are known as the Sexenio, members of the Conservative Party tried to stem the growth of the left, but they ultimately failed because they could not halt the economic decline and control the growing social unrest. His time as a political prisoner. In 1946, with the fall of Villarroel's presidency, he intervened politically with the \\"Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario\\". In the Civil War of 1948 Rodolfo Plaza and Cesar Lafaye ended up political prisoners and roommates. One of Rodolfo's and Cesar delightful pastimes was to walk the memory lanes of f√∫tbol while Rodolfo wore his team's jersey. Rodolfo was arrested and confined without the benefit of Habeas Corpus. Habeas Corpus had been suspended during the Sexenio. He spent about three months of political confinement in Apolo and about two months in the Lake Titicaca island of Coati. Rodolfo seldom if ever spoke about the experiences of his confinements except that most of the time he wore the Jersey of his beloved Bolivar. The Revolution of 1952 He was a revolutionary fighter. He took active part of the popular insurrection of the historic \\"9 de Abril (1952) revolution\\", with Juan Lechin, Rodolfo fought in Miraflores and together with Lechin and Julio Pantoja took over the presidential palace in Plaza Murillo (Palacio de Gobierno. All the time that the \\"Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario\\" was in power he never accepted nor requested a public office, His life was dedicated to sports and to the Club Bolivar. Club management Rodolfo Plaza Montero became president of the club at a time when Club Bolivar was on the verge of insolvency. As president Rodolfo Plaza Montero used his own funds to compensate players. Some of the players that were compensated totally by using his own funds include Mario Mena, Augustin Ugarte, Santos, Rico, Villagran, Mugertegi, Flores and others. Rodolfo Plaza Montero financial help proved to be indispensable to win the 1956 championship. As president he was instrumental in the acquiring of the lots in Tembladerani where the club built Simon Bolivar stadium that can seat 25,000 fans. Some of the players that were compensated totally by using his own funds include Mario Mena, Augustin Ugarte, Santos, Rico, Villagran, Mugertegi, Flores and others. Rodolfo Plaza Montero was a great scout and recruiter for the club, when he signed young and promising players, he would pay out of his own funds for transportation, room and board and expenses for these youngsters. El Cabro Plaza's vision of his club included not only the development of new players competing in the \\"cuartas especiales\\" tournaments but he seeded the vision of what would take more than a decade as an incubator of great players like Marco \\"El Diablo\\" Etcheverry, Alumnus of Taihuichi F√∫tbol Academy. In 1971, Rodolfo Plaza Montero shared with Mario Mercado his vision of transforming the club into a self-sustaining professional entity. Mario Mercado took notes and promised Rodolfo that if he ever became president of the club he would look at the plan and in that way repay Rodolfo the enormous amounts of money that Rodolfo spent supporting the club. Mario Mercado never honored his word even though he used Rodolfo's intellectual property to advance the club. Mario Mercado did not attend Rodolfo's funeral in December 2, 1988, perhaps because they did not share convergent political views. Mercado was a member of Banzer's ADN. Personal life Rodolfo had a charisma and the looks to persuade anyone on business transactions. This charisma was mixed with naivet√© that blinded him when he trusted his partners with his business interests. In 1946 he trusted Jorge Hinojosa to run \\"Almacenes Plaza\\" while he was confined to the province of Apolo. Hinojosa emptied Rodolfo's bank account and moved to San Francisco. In 1953 Rodolfo travelled to New York City on a business trip and left Eduardo Bazaure to run his business except that Bazaure did not have access to the bank account except to make deposits. Bazaure emptied the storerooms where Rodolfo stored several hundred 100 pound bags of rice and smuggled them to Peru. In 1982, he purchased all the ingredients to manufacture Tri-Mate and had as a partner a man with the last name of Soliz. Soliz also took advantage of Rodolfo's na√Øvet√©. Rodolfo was a great athlete and he was a good boxer. It ran in the family, Andres Plaza Montero Was national boxing champ and Juan Plaza Montero was boxing champ of Valparaiso Chile. He had the opportunity to get his picture with Jack Dempsey when he visited New York. Rodolfo gave financial assistance to Mario Bueno, a heart weight boxer who was also an official in the Bolivia Police. He always spoke about the fight between Firpo and Dempsey. He liked Pascual Perez from Argentina and Mike Tyson. When watching boxing results on the news reels shown at the movies, he always would make conversation about that fight for days on end. Rodolfo was an avid tennis player who played the sport every Saturday at the Sucre Tennis Club. Rodolfo had two sons with Raquel Barrientos, two daughters one from his second marriage and one out of wedlock. In popular culture Traditionalist \\"Juan Vargas\\" Museum is a municipal museum in La Paz, Bolivia. Its local name is Museo Costumbrista \\"Juan Vargas\\" and is located opposite the park Riosinho in La Paz, Bolivia. The museum makes historical reference to customs typical to the city of La Paz. The building features are consistent with the architectural richness of the streets Jaen, Ingavi and Pichincha. In this museum there are valuable pieces, relics and memorabilia dating from the early years of the Colony and the Republic to today. The Museum jealously guards valuable works of traditions and customs pace√±as (of La Paz) so that they do not get lost in time. The house was built in the Colonial era and the museum is named after the first mayor of the city of La Paz . Among the most representative works available to the public, we find historical events such as the hanging of Murillo or martyrdom Tupac Katari; outstanding characters from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries made of clay; a miniature replica, made of ceramic, the foundation of La Paz. In addition to pre- Columbian pictures of drums, some paintings of old La Paz and scenes of the old city tram. Rodolfo Plaza Montero is the only Player, Coach and President of any f√∫tbol club represented in the Museo Costumbrista in a minituarized mock up of the Estadio La Paz playing for Bolivar against its nemesis The Strongest. Last days After many years of walking the steep streets of La Paz without losing wind and faster than most and in his late seventies, Rodolfo attended his last f√∫tbol game in Hernando Siles Stadium. The excitement of the game caused Rodolfo to have a massive heart attack from which he could not recover. In that game Bolivar clinched the championship. All the newspapers of La Paz had obituaries about his death and his funeral was attended by a multitude of people some of whom were personal friends and some that were fans of his beloved club Bolivar. This happened November 30, 1988. He was buried December 2, 1988 in the Pavilion of Veterans of the Chaco War in the General Cemetery of La Paz. 1909 births 1988 deaths Bolivian footballers Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Rodolfo Plaza Montero"},{"id":"18627200","text":"Turo≈õ≈Ñ Dolna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Turo≈õ≈Ñ Ko≈õcielna, within Bia≈Çystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

He is currently the head coach of Gettysburg College. Player Mettrick grew up in Manchester, England, playing in the Manchester United youth system from 1982 to 1984. Mettrick was offered a spot in the Manchester United reserve team, but chose to attend Hartwick College where he was a member of the men's soccer team from 1984 to 1987. During his four seasons with the Hawks, they went to two NCAA Final Fours. He finished his career with forty-six career goals and earned first team All American recognition in 1985 and 1987. Mettrick was inducted into the Hartwick Athletic Hall of Fame on September 20, 1997. He graduated in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in physics. In 1988, the Baltimore Blast of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) picked Mettrick in the first round of the MISL Draft. He played for the Blast until 1992, the year the MISL folded. During his four seasons with the Blast, the team went to the 1989 and 1990 finals, losing both times. In 1993, Mettrick signed with the expansion Baltimore Bays of the USISL. He was named to the 1993 All Atlantic Division Team.1993 USISL Awards He played for the Bays through at least the 1994‚Äì1995 USISL indoor season.

In 1994, he moved up to the head coaching position. In his six seasons as head coach, he took Mount St. Mary's to a 57‚Äì42‚Äì12 record. =Loyola College in Maryland= In 2000, Loyola College in Maryland hired Mettrick as its head soccer coach, replacing the veteran Bill Sento, who had been at the helm for two decades. 2000‚Äì2002 Mettrick's first three seasons at the Evergreen were quite successful. In 2000, he took advantage of a team that was largely intact from the 1999 season, adding only Scottish central defender Niall Lepper to the starting lineup, and led Loyola to its first national ranking since 1997. Despite a slow start in 2001 after a loss and a tie in a season-opening tournament in California, Loyola went onto a 19-game unbeaten streak before losing to Saint Louis in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division I Tournament, relying primarily on the strength of its defense led by Lepper and three-time regional All-America goalkeeper Reb Beatty. Loyola ended the 2001 campaign with a record of 17‚Äì2‚Äì2, including victories over nationally ranked Maryland (twice), Fairfield, and American, and finished ranked in the Top 10 in the nation. Mettrick was named the NSCAA South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year. Mettrick continued this success into the 2002 season; despite losing six starters, the core of the team in Lepper and Beatty returned and led Mettrick's gang to a 13‚Äì5‚Äì3 record and another berth in the NCAA Tournament before falling to Furman. 2003‚Äì2006 The 2003 season was Mettrick's first with a team based solely on his recruits; from 2000 to 2002, the majority of the starting lineup consisted of players that had been recruited by Bill Sento. Further complicating matters was the loss of Beatty and Lepper ‚Äì Loyola's two best players ‚Äì due to graduation. Loyola was able to reach the MAAC Championship game in 2003 but was defeated in the final by Saint Peter's, starting a streak of four consecutive years without an MAAC championship. This streak included losing seasons in both 2005 and 2006. 2007‚Äì2013 Under pressure to turn things around, Mettrick took the best pieces of his 2006 team and added several new recruits, leading to an incredible change of fortune. In both 2007 and 2008 he coached the Greyhounds into the NCAA Tournament, reaching the second round both years. In 2008, he was awarded the NSCAA/Adidas Coach of the Year award for the North Atlantic Region after leading the team to an undefeated regular season in the MAAC. The Greyhounds reached the NCAA College Cup for a school Division I record third- straight season in 2009. Loyola then finished with a 9‚Äì7‚Äì2 record in 2010. Mettrick was relieved of his duties on November 12, 2013.

Life and work Hagemeyer was born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. His family came to California to grow fruit trees, but in 1916 he met photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who convinced him to devote his life to the then emerging world of artistic photography. In 1923 Hagemeyer opened a portrait studio in San Francisco, which he occupied primarily from October thru early April. In 1922 Hagemeyer built a spring- summer studio in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, at that time the largest art colony on the Pacific coast, and donated his photographs that December to a local fund-raising exhibit.Carmel Pine Cone: 16 December 1922, p.1; 23 December 1922, p.8. It was here that Hagemeyer met Edward Weston, who encouraged him to further his career in photography. He moved his Carmel address in 1924 to a new \\"artfully designed studio\\" at the prominent junction of Mountain View and Ocean Avenues, which became a meeting place for intellectuals as well as a \\"gallery\\" to display the works of local and visiting artists. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website ().Carmel Pine Cone, 9 May 1925, p. 1.The Oakland Tribune, 10 May 1925, p.6-S. In 1928 he relocated to a significantly larger \\"Johan Hagemeyer Studio-Gallery,\\" where he devoted an entire room to his own pictorial art and held major exhibitions of prominent Post-Impressionists painters, such as Henrietta Shore, as well as art photographers, including Edward Weston.Carmel Pine Cone: 27 July 1928, p. 4; 9 July 1926, p11. In February 1932 at the Haggin Museum in Stockton, California Hagemeyer displayed his photographs in a joint exhibition with Carmel's most famous Impressionist painter, William Frederic Ritschel.Carmelite (Carmel, CA), 4 February 1932, p. 9. Through the spring and summer of 1938 he exhibited his landscape and portrait photos at the Guild of Carmel Craftsmen.The Carmel Cymbal, 20 May 1938, p. 2.Carmel Pine Cone: 17 June 1938, p.20; 9 September 1938, p.7. From the 1920s through the 1940s Hagemeyer photographed leading figures of the day, including Pedro Joseph de Lemos, Albert Einstein, and Salvador Dal√≠. However, he sometimes retouched or manipulated his photos, which went against the beliefs of Weston. His refusal to adhere to Weston's views was a major cause in a growing alienation of the two men. When Weston, Ansel Adams and others founded Group f/64, devoted to straight, unmanipulated photography, Hagemeyer did not join. The Johan Hagemeyer Photograph Collection at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, contains the approximately 6,785 photographic prints and negatives which made up Hagemeyer's personal archive at the time of his death in Berkeley in 1962.

Male circumcision is widespread in the Muslim world, and accepted as an established practice by all Islamic schools of jurisprudence.; It is considered a sign of belonging to the wider Muslim community. Islamic male circumcision is analogous but not identical to Jewish circumcision. Muslims are currently the largest single religious group in which the practice is widespread, although circumcision is never mentioned in the Quran itself but is mentioned in hadith literature and the sunnah. Whether or not it should be carried out after converting to Islam is debated among Islamic scholars. Religious sources Circumcision being performed in central Asia (probably Turkestan), c. 1865‚Äì1872. Restored albumen print. The Quran itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. In the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, both male and female circumcision were carried out by Pagan Arabian tribes, and male circumcision by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for religious reasons.W. La Barre, The Ghost Dance, London, 1972 This has also been attested by the Muslim scholar al-Jahiz,Volume II of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938 as well as by the Roman Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.The Works of Flavius Josephus, translated by W. Whiston, 2 vols., London, 1858 According to some hadiths, Muhammad was born without a foreskin (aposthetic), while others maintain that his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, circumcised him when he was seven days old.Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al- maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54‚Äì55 Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community. Some hadiths report that Heraclius, Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, had referred to Muhammad as \\"the king of the circumcised\\".Sahih al- Bukhari, Vol. 1, Book 1, No. 6. Some hadiths mention circumcision in a list of practices known as fitra (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, one of the companions of Muhammad, was quoted saying: \\"five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits\\" (reported in the hadiths of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). So, despite its absence from the Quran, it has been a religious custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other hadiths which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of fitra, and yet another hadith which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha, one of Muhammad's wives, is quoted with saying: \\"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth.\\" Hence, the different hadiths do not agree on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. Muhammad's wife Aisha supposedly quoted Muhammad as saying that \\"if the two circumcised parts have been in touch with one another, ghusl is necessary\\".Malik ibn Anas, Ketab al-mowatta, Volume I, pages 45-47, traditions 70-75. ed. M.F. Abd-al-Baqi, CairoIbn Majah, Kitab Sunan, ed. M. F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo, 1972, Page 199 Volume I According to some hadiths, Muhammad supposedly circumcised his grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, on the seventh day after their birth.Al-Amili, Muhammad Ibn Hasan Al-Hur. Wasa'il al- shi'ah ila tahsil masa'il al-shariah. Vol 15. Tehran, Al-Maktabah al- Islamiyyah, 1982 Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim also quote from Muhammad that Prophet Abraham performed his own circumcision at the age of eighty.Sahih Bukhari Hadith No. 575, and Muslim's anthology of authentic hadith, IV, item 2370. It is also reported by Abu Dawud and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal that Muhammad stated that circumcision was a \\"law for men and a preservation of honor for women\\".Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167 Circumcision was introduced to many lands for the first time through Islam itself following the early Muslim conquests under the Rashidun, who were the companions and contemporaries of Muhammad. An example are the Persians, which practiced neither male nor female circumcision before the advent of Islam. Post-Islamic converts such as Afshin were found guilty in trials of remaining uncircumcised;Page 766 of the Volume II of Al-Basaer wa al-Dhakha'ir, Abu Hayyan Tawhidi, KaylƒÅnƒ´, Damascus, 1964 this further indicates that the practice was deemed compulsory by the early Muslims. =Sunni Islam= The four schools of Islamic law have different opinions and attitudes towards circumcision: some state that it's recommendable, others that it's permissible but not binding, while others regard it as a legal obligation.; Amongst Ulema (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsory or non-obligatory status of circumcision in accordance with Sharia (Islamic law). Imams Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa, founder of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Malik ibn Anas, founder of the Maliki school, maintain that circumcision is a Sunnah Mu'akkadah‚Äînot obligatory but highly recommended. The Shafi‚Äòi and Hanbali schools regard it as binding on all Muslims, both males and females. According to Shafi‚Äòi and Hanbali jurists both male and female circumcision are legally obligatory for Muslims, while Hanafi jurists consider circumcision to be recommendable exclusively for Muslim males on the seventh day after birth. The Salafi website IslamQA.info, founded by the Saudi Arabian Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid, has quoted some hadith to argue that the requirement of circumcision in Islam is based on the covenant with Abraham, that male circumcision is obligatory for Muslim men in order to provide ritual cleanliness while the purpose of female circumcision for Muslim women is to \\"regulate\\" and reduce their sexual desires. = Shia Islam = Most Shia traditions regard the practice as obligatory. They rely on sayings that come from classical Shia authors.Book 90 of Hilyat ul-muttaqeen In one narration Muhammad was asked if an uncircumcised man could go to pilgrimage. He answered \\"not as long as he is not circumcised\\". They quote Ali as saying: \\"If a man becomes Muslim, he must submit to circumcision even if he is 80 years old.\\"Al- Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:35 Another narration from Al-Sadiq says: \\"Circumcise your sons when they are seven days old as it is cleaner (athar) and the flesh grows faster and because the earth hates the urine of the uncircumcised.\\"Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:34 It is also believed that the urine of the uncircumcised is impure, while if one prays with unclean genitals their prayer may not be considered as acceptable, even of those who have been circumcised, meaning that it may have to be repeated again at a time when the believer has purified themselves and removed the impurity. Another hadith of Muhammad states: \\"the earth cries out to God in anguish because of the urine of the uncircumcised\\", and that \\"the earth becomes defiled from the urine of the uncircumcised for forty days\\".DS Hellsten. Male and Female Circumcision: Medical, Legal and Ethical Considerations in Pediatric Practice. Page 147 Time for circumcision Traditional procession after circumcision of a child in Dutch East Indies, 1915‚Äì1918. Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. Therefore, there is a wide variation in practice among Muslim communities, with children often being circumcised in late childhood or early adolescence. It depends on family, region, and country. The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of puberty. Procedure Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, in Islam there is no fixed age for circumcision. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across countries, cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim- majority countries, circumcision is performed on Muslim boys after they have learned to recite the whole Quran from start to finish. In Malaysia and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the procedure between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a puberty rite, serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult. The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity. There is no equivalent of a Jewish mohel in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in health facilities or hospitals, and performed by trained medical practitioners. The circumciser can be either male or female, and is not required to be a Muslim. The position of the scar is usually neither fully \\"low\\" nor fully \\"high\\". The only requirement is to have the glans fully exposed at all times and enough of the skin removed to ensure that there are no folds that allow accumulation of body fluids (urine). This is required to ensure the hygiene requirements for the salat (daily prayers). However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in Islam, the \\"styles\\" of the circumcision of a Muslim vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge. Earlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and at homes by visiting practitioners. Celebrations In Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called Perayaan Sunatan, but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is bid‚Äòah whereas most of them say it is not. In Turkey also widely celebrated and called \\"Sunnet Toreni\\" \\"Sunnet mevludu\\". Female genital mutilation Khaf·∏ç, or kÃ≤hÃ≤ifƒÅ·∏ç, refers to female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is sometimes referred to as khitan. In many communities, khafd is a rite of passage and refers to excision of the female genital organs.Gerald R. Hawting (2006), The Development of Islamic Ritual, , pp. 358‚Äì361. According to UNICEF, over 200 million women in Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Southeast Asia have been subjected to the practice and are living with FGM.\\"Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Global Concern\\" , New York: UNICEF, February 2016. Although not mentioned in the Quran, it is praised in a few da ªƒ´f (weak) hadith as noble but not required,See e.g.: and is regarded as obligatory by the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islam. In 2007, the Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research in Cairo ruled that FGM had \\"no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions\\".* \\"Fresh progress toward the elimination of female genital mutilation and cutting in Egypt\\" .
