It peaked at #12 on the Most Played Jukebox Folk Records chart in 1948.  Background  The details surrounding the origins of \\"A Mansion on the Hill\\" are ambiguous. For many years, an apocryphal tale circulated that after meeting Hank Williams and hearing his compositions, Fred Rose was so impressed that he could hardly believe that the unknown singer from Alabama could have written so many quality songs by himself, so he tested Hank by giving him the title \\"A Mansion on the Hill\\" to write a song around, which Hank did in a side room. In an interview years after Hank's death, his ex-wife Audrey claimed to have had a hand in writing the song herself: :\\"Fred said...'To prove to me you can write, I'm gonna give you a title, and I want you to take it back to Montgomery and write a song around it.' Hank worked with it and worked with it, and he never could do too much with it, and the reason he couldn't was because it wasn't his idea. One night...I started singing, \\"Tonight down here in the valley'...He really liked it, and it was a mixture of my lyrics, Hank's lyrics, and Fred Rose's lyrics.\\" Part of the reason why Williams had difficulty with \\"A Mansion on the Hill\\" might have been that he did not write narrative ballads, his best songs freezing a moment, a feeling, or a grudge in time. He wound up adapting the melody for the song from Bob Wills' 1938 recording of \\"I Wonder If You Feel the Way I Do.\\" The song was recorded in Nashville at Castle Studio on November 7, 1947, with Rose producing. The players included Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Robert \\"Chubby\\" Wise (fiddle), Zeke Turner (lead guitar), probably Louis Innis (bass) and either Owen Bradley or Rose on piano.

SCOAP was established in 2005 through a grassroots effort of Washington State's surgical community led by David Flum, MD, MPH, and the state chapter of the American College of Surgeons. SCOAP is administered by the Foundation for Health Care Quality (FHCQ), a non-profit organization serving as ‚Äò‚Äòsafe-harbor‚Äô‚Äô for the multiple groups involved in healthcare improvement projects in Washington State. In 2009, SCOAP rolled out its most visible initiative‚Äîthe Surgical Checklist. Modeled after the checklist used by pilots on commercial airlines, this checklist is now in every Washington State hospital. This list assures the entire surgical team reviews each step in the upcoming surgery at the same time and prior to the surgery itself. The checklist initiative was widely implemented and received support from Washington State governor, Christine Gregoire. SCOAP data exchange is protected by the WA State Continuous Quality Improvement Program statute. As a Washington State approved Coordinated Quality Improvement Program, SCOAP's participating hospitals are allowed to disclose protected healthcare information specifically for program purposes. Hospitals hire and train staff to review medical records and abstract clinical data using SCOAP data collection forms and data dictionaries. The clinical data are entered to the SCOAP registry using a web-based form. Participant hospitals receive quarterly QI performance reports that show their data alongside benchmarks and peer performance. The SCOAP continuous data collection and feedback loop is proven to improve the quality and safety of surgical and interventional care while decreasing costs. There are currently five SCOAP registries: gastrointestinal/general surgical procedures, oncologic surgical procedures, pediatric surgical procedures, spine surgical procedures, and vascular surgical and interventional healthcare procedures. Growth and development SCOAP's growth and development was supported through grants from the Life Sciences Discovery Fund, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to investigators in the Department of Surgery at the University of Washington (UW) under principal investigator David Flum, MD, MPH. Current research and development using SCOAP data is supported by the UW's Comparative Effectiveness Research Translation Network (CERTAIN) within the Surgical Outcomes Research Center (SORCE). CERTAIN aims to answer patient centered comparative effectiveness research questions across a range of clinical topic areas, most recently including; the use of interventional care for claudication, the role of antibiotics in appendicitis, the value of elective surgery for diverticulitis, the impact of non-steroidal pain medication on outcomes and the effect of hyperglycemia on surgical infections. Led by implementation research teams at the UW, SCOAP was the first to bring advanced operating room checklists to every hospital in the state in 2010. In 2012 this group helped move checklisting from the OR to the surgeon's office by creating Strong for Surgery, an initiative now run in partnership with the American College of Surgeons. SCOAP has similarities to the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP), but is more focused on directing improvements in process of care metrics along with benchmarking on risk-adjusted outcome measures. SCOAP was also the first statewide performance surveillance to incorporate patient reported outcomes (pain and function in spine surgery) into its benchmarking.

As a younger man he volunteered and participated on the Republican (anti-Fascist) side in the Spanish Civil War. Early Life and education Schaul was born a few years after the opening of the twentieth century, at Hohensalza (as it was then known), a mid-sized newly industrialised town in the Prussian province of Posen. His father was employed in clerical work. From 1915 he attended a Secondary School in Frankfurt (Oder) that concentrated on Classics and Humanities. He then, between 1925 and 1928 undertook university level study in Economics and Law at Berlin, Freiburg and Heidelberg. The next three years he spent working as a trainee referendary in the Berlin law courts. Marriage and career It was during this period that in 1929 Hans Schaul married the children's author, . Their daughter, Anja, would be born in 1937 and then killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944. Law practice Schaul received his practice certificate in 1932, and thereafter worked as a lawyer in Berlin. However, January 1933 saw r√©gime change and government policies in Germany became viciously anti-semitic. Schaul and his wife were Jewish. From 1933 he was barred from working as a lawyer in Germany and fled to France, at one stage working in Paris as a photographer. It was from France that in 1936 he joined the International Brigades, following which he took part in the Spanish Civil War on the anti-Francoist side. At times he was working in the International Brigade's General Inspectorate with the high-profile Italian Communist Luigi Longo (also known as \\"Gallo\\"). In 1937 Schaul became a member of the Spanish Communist Party, also working as an editor on several political newspapers. Spanish civil war He returned to France in 1938 and worked for the \\"Support Committee\\" for German fighters in the Spanish Civil War. The next year, in 1939 he joined the Communist Party of Germany, the surviving leadership of which had escaped to Paris after Germany became a one-party dictatorship back in 1933. Second world war War resumed, involving France and Germany, in September 1939: Schaul was interned at Saint-Jean-de-la-Ruelle near Orl√©ans. He spent the next few years in a succession of internment camps, ending up by 1943 in the camp at Djelfa, a few hundred kilometers to the south of Algiers. The internment camp at Djelfa contained enemies identified by the collaborationist French government, who were mainly Communists, Jews, and former Spanish Civil War International Brigade members. In 1943 Schaul then became a member of a British Labour Corps in Algeria, following the Anglo- American military invasion of the entire region. In 1944 he was able to travel to the Soviet Union, arriving in November of that year. Here he was employed as an instructor for French and Japanese prisoners of war. He was then employed by Moscow's Administrative Head Office for Prisoners of War, working as an instructor at various \\"Antifascist Schools\\", notably \\"Anti-Fascist School 2041\\" at Talitsa. War ended in May 1945 and in 1948 the Party Central Committee ordered him back to Germany, where he married Dora Davidsohn. Even before this marriage, however, he had obtained a post as the personal assistant to Heinrich Rau, chairman of the influential German Economic Commission in the part of what had been Germany that became, between 1945 and 1949, administered and designated as the Soviet occupation zone. In October 1949 the Soviet Occupation zone was reinvented as the German Democratic Republic, a Soviet sponsored separate German state with its constitutional arrangements and political power structure closely modeled on those in the Soviet Union itself. From 1949 he was working for the new country's Ministry for Planning, and in 1950 Schaul switched to the National Planning Commission itself. End times From 1951 till 1956 Hans Schaul worked as a professor at Berlin's Academy for Economics. After that he became chief editor with Einheit, which was a newspaper of the country's ruling SED (party), targeted at a readership able and willing to take an interest in \\"the theory and practice of Scientific Socialism\\".

In her early youth, she was renown for her equestrian skills on her father's land. She later became the royal mistress of King Lunalilo and formed a contentious relationship with Queen Emma of Hawaii and was rumored to be the main obstacle between a possible marriage between the two. Along with a group of other members of the royal court, Eliza accompanied the king to Kailua-Kona during his last illness and remained by Lunalilo's side until his death from tuberculosis on his return to Honolulu on February 3, 1874. Little is known about her later life; Eliza was financially well-off until her death on February 8, 1888. Early life Eliza Meek was born on March 3, 1832, to Captain John Meek (1792‚Äì1875) and Betsy W. Meek (1807‚Äì1848). John was a New Englander from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who first arrived in Hawaii about 1809 and served for many years as harbor master and pilot of Honolulu. Betsy was the Hawaiian wife of Captain Meek and died on May 5, 1848. Eliza grew up with many siblings including her youngest sister Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Meek (1841‚Äì1895), who married American settler Horace Gate Crabbe in 1857 and had five children. In her youth, Eliza was noted for her equestrian skills on her father's lands at Lihue and Wahiawa on the island of O ªahu where their family raised thorough-bred horses which were well known across the islands. According to archivist and historian Albert Pierce Taylor, Eliza was often \\"seen riding the horse through the streets of Honolulu garbed in a wonderful pa-u, with a dozen or more followers riding behind her wearing the same color of garment\\". Eliza was considered a great beauty in her youth and possessed green-color eyes indicative of her hapa-haole (half-European, half-Hawaiian) heritage. Relationship with Lunalilo Although King Lunalilo remained a bachelor for his entire life, he took Eliza Meek as his mistress. Eliza became the mistress of King Lunalilo, who had remained a bachelor for his entire life.Although Lunalilo and Eliza were never married, Captain Edgar Wakeman, a friend of her father Captain John Meek, wrote in 1878 that she was \\"married to King William, I.\\" She developed a contentious relationship with Queen Emma of Hawaii, the widow of Kamehameha IV and a close friend of Lunalilo. According to one of Emma's letters, an elderly palace attendant Waiaha and several other older women had given Lunalilo a \\"piece of bananannah [sic] stalk pressed to drink, medicated with love potions, to produce intense affections for Eliza Meek\\". Along with a group of Lunalilo's personal attendants and relatives (including his chamberlain and Eliza's brother-in-law Horace Crabbe), Eliza was present during the king's final months of illness. During this period, Eliza was notoriously hostile to Emma, who occasionally visited the ailing King to help nurse him. According to Dr. Georges Phillipe Trousseau, the King's personal physician, Lunalilo would have married Emma had it not been for Eliza's interference. Eliza would refuse to leave Emma alone with Lunalilo even at the king's command. One night, in a fit of rage, Lunalilo threw a chair and a spittoon at Eliza's head after an argument with between the two. Emma recounted the instance in a letter to her cousin Peter Ka ªeo: > The last bit of news yesterday morning is the King's anger against Eliza > Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at > her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut on the side of her head. > The nearest Doctor was sent for [and] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It > seems the King told her to come to bed ‚Äî she replied what right has a dog or > a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been > brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to > Waterclosets. She retorted, \\"Oh, I suppose that is what you eat to exist > on.\\" This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [he] threw the > articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he > continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts > it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled > and not so upset. Despite the scuffle, Eliza was part of the royal party who accompanied Lunalilo when he sailed to Kailua-Kona, in November 1873, the following month, in the hope that the dry weather would improve his tuberculosis. However, the trip had no lasting effect on Lunalilo's health. After returning to Honolulu, Lunalilo succumbed to the disease and died on February 3, 1874. Later life Little is known of Eliza's life after Lunalilo's death. She died at Peleula ‚Äì her brother-in-law and sister's residence ‚Äì on February 8, 1888, at the age of fifty-five. In her later life, Eliza was financially well-off and owned a half interest in property on King Street, near Maunakea.

He is known for conducting surveys of lands for settlers who had requested grants in Louisiana and Florida, as well as the so-called \\"Pintado plan\\", a street map of Pensacola drawn in 1812 which included the position and size of the solares designated for construction of the city's church and other public buildings. He lived more than 35 years in the Americas (25 of them in Louisiana and Florida) and left a large corpus of work consisting of maps, plats, letters and documents vital to an understanding of the complicated sale of lands in Florida and Louisiana during the period. In 1974, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. obtained a donation of the Pintado Collection, a collection of about 1,500 documents now stored in its Division of Manuscripts.  Biography   Early years  Vicente Sebastian Pintado was born on February 20, 1774, in Santa Cruz de La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). His parents were Diego Eligio Pintado and Antonia de Brito y Salazax. Although little is known of his youth, he would be expected to have had a good background in mathematics and design.La obra del canario Pintado en la Biblioteca del Congreso (in Spanish: The work of the Canarian Pintado in the Library of Congress). Eric Beerman. It is known that Pintado entered the Spanish military in his youth, where he excelled and was promoted to an officer's rank.UWF Special Collections In 1793, Pintado sailed for Havana, Cuba aboard the barque La Hermosa Mar√≠a Yendo de Campo. During its passage north of Tolvos island he prepared a maritime chart of latitudes, this being his first commission as a cartographer. From Havana, he was ordered to Louisiana, a Spanish province at the time.  Louisiana  In 1794-1795, Pintado served under baron Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet, the governor of Louisiana and West Florida, headquartered at New Orleans. Carondelet entrusted him with the command of a sloop to carry out various commissions, operating from the Spanish fort San Juan del Bayou that protected the Lake Pontchartrain entrance of Bayou St. John and Lake Borgne, often carrying letters from Carondelet to the Captain General of Cuba, Luis de las Casas. In 1795, at the behest of Carondolet, Pintado led a survey of the lands around the fort at Christian Pass (Pasa Cristian), as well as 1,300 acres of land on the banks of the Carondelet Canal belonging to Jean Baptiste Macarty, colonel of the militia of New Orleans. Pintado subsequently performed numerous other surveys in Louisiana. Map of the New Feliciana District in Spanish West Florida, by Pintado. In 1796 Carondelet commissioned Pintado to conduct a survey of lands granted to Ambrosio Longue-√âp√©e in Iberville County on the west bank of the Mississippi River opposite Baton Rouge. After the work was completed, on May 1 of that year Carondelet appointed him assistant surveyor of Spanish Louisiana, an office he occupied from 1796 to 1805. In 1797, Carondelet instructed Pintado to do surveys in the district of New Feliciana north of Baton Rouge, and in 1798 he served as captain of militias raised in the same district. The following year he bought some land near Baton Rouge. On April 1, 1800, Pintado was appointed mayor and commandant of the militia in Bayou Sara, near the modern city of St. Francisville on the Mississippi River, replacing the late Captain Anselmo Blanchard. After the recovery of Louisiana by France in 1801 and its sale to the United States in 1803, the political climate around Baton Rouge became precarious for Pintado. In 1804, three brothers, Samuel, Nathan and Reuben Kemper, wanting to separate this region from Spanish control and deliver it to the United States, attempted to foment a rebellion. On August 7, Samuel and Nathan Kemper marched on Baton Rouge with some 30 men to seize the fort. According to the last treaty, Baton Rouge was under Spanish sovereignty, although most of its inhabitants were Anglos who preferred the sale of Louisiana to the United States. On hearing of the impending attack on Baton Rouge, the Spanish governor, Carlos de Grand Pr√©, prepared to defend Baton Rouge, forcing the withdrawal of the Kemper brothers to Bayou Sara, which was still under the command of Pintado. The rebels subsequently captured the settlement, burning its houses and a cotton mill. Pintado managed to escape and led a detachment of troops to harass those Americans who supported Kemper, forcing the insurgents to withdraw above the 31st parallel of latitude north, into the Territory of Mississippi. The Kemper brothers, undaunted by this setback, organized another assault the following year, with Ruben Kemper moving to the Bahamas where he solicited the British government for aid in expelling the Spanish from Baton Rouge. Pintado assisted in repelling this latest intrusion by the rebels, and on September 3, 1805, Nathan and Samuel Kemper were arrested by the Spanish authorities.  Florida  Map of Spanish West Florida by Pintado. Pintado served as assistant surveyor of Spanish West Florida from 1803 to 1805. Recognized by the Spanish authorities for his ability in this office, Pintado was named surveyor general of West Florida on October 9, 1805, his appointment being confirmed on December 13. Carlos Trudeau, the surveyor general of Louisiana, had previously been selected for the position, but because of his advanced age and family ties in Louisiana, refused a relocation to Pensacola. Trudeau and his former assistant Pintado divided possession all maps, plats and documents pertaining to official land measurements, Pintado keeping those related to the Floridas and Trudeau those concerning Louisiana. Copy of the Pintado Plan of Pensacola, showing the division of solares in the town C√°diz issued a royal order on October 28, 1812, awarding Pintado the title of Captain of Infantry, which made him a full army officer. In the same year, a decree by the Spanish authorities mandated the renaming of plazas and streets in Pensacola, as well the construction of a new church and government buildings. Consequently, Pintado elaborated a street map of the town, the so-called \\"Pintado plan\\", which later received the approval of the city council on December 7, 1813.The Luso-Hispanic World in Maps (Library of Congress). Also in 1812, governor Mauricio de Z√∫√±iga sent Captain Pintado to investigate and recover any runaway slaves belonging to Spanish owners in East and West Florida.MEMORIA Y SOCIEDAD (In Spanish: MEMORY AND SOCIETY). Jane Landers. After the defeat of British Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane by United States forces at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815, the new governor of Florida, Mateo Gonz√°lez Manrique, instructed Pintado to travel to Apalachicola to confer with Cochrane. As a result, Cochrane ordered the return of all slaves and Spanish troops captured by the British to Pensacola aboard one of his ships under the command of Richard Spencer. Pintado accompanied the troops and slaves on the passage, and participated with Spencer in talks with slave owners about the British compensation. Following the success of this expedition, Pintado once again turned his attention to surveying and drew several maps based on recent military operations on the Apalachicola River. Pintado continued serving as surveyor general until 1817, at which time he was transferred to Havana, Cuba,Vicente Sebasti√°n Pintado Papers (Library of Congress). where he pursued his career as a military engineer, and he and his bride began their married life.  In Havana  In Havana, Pintado continued his work of certifying and recording land surveys made in West Florida and Louisiana. He also drew a map of the territory stretching from Mobile, Alabama to the Mississippi River, showing British naval landing operations from 1814 to 1815 during the battle of New Orleans. In 1822, the Captain General of Cuba, Nicolas Mahy, ordered Pintado to prepare a file containing descriptions of all distributions of land, including solares and water rights, made in both the Floridas under the administration of the Spanish government from 1801 - 1818. Pintado completed this project in 1823. A copy was handed over to the American authorities as part of Article II of the Treaty of 1819. In April 1828, the American minister in Madrid, Alexander Hill Everett, asked Spanish Secretary of State Manuel Gonz√°lez Salm√≥n for a copy of Pintado's work. The following April, the Spanish Minister Francisco Tac√≥n wrote from Philadelphia that United States Secretary of State Martin van Buren had requested a copy of Pintado's work, consisting of 120 items concerning the distribution and granting of land in the Floridas (1808‚Äì18), certified in Havana. Pintado remained in Havana, retaining his original copy of the file despite the claims of the Americans. In 1829, aware of his failing health, he informed his wife Eulalia Balderas of the existence of these papers, and told her that in case of his death, she should not copy or give information about them to anyone, except in exchange for money to support the family, including their four children. Pintado died in Havana on August 20, 1829.  Personal life  In 1816, when Pintado was 42 years old, he married a native of Louisiana, Maria Teresa Eulalia Balderas y Dubuisson, whose father, Ignacio Balderas (born in Salamanca, Spain) had served with Pintado in Pensacola as captain of Infantry of the Fixed Regiment of Louisiana. They had four children.  After his death In 1830, Pintado's widow sold the exclusive file to land speculators in Louisiana, Florida and Missouri. Apparently the American government had refused to pay the $15,000 she demanded, so she sold them to the highest bidders. As noted by Dr. R. H√©bert, in 1841 General John Wilson was in possession of these documents, comprising 62 maps and plats bound in a leather portfolio addressed to \\"John Wilson\\".  Legacy: The Pintado Collection  In 1974, the Pintado collection was donated to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The assemblage consists of about 1,500 items, including \\"correspondence, bills of sale, court transcripts, testimonies, surveys, notebooks, plats, land grants, maps, petitions, and other papers relating principally to Pintado's duties as mayor, commandant, and surveyor general.\\" Among these papers are records of properties and land in West Florida from the Mississippi River in Louisiana to the Pearl River (today the dividing line between the states of Mississippi and Louisiana), north of Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf region in the present states of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The documents were compiled by Pintado during the sale of Louisiana, the occupation of West Florida by the British (1813‚Äì14) and the transfer of the Floridas by Spain to the United States in 1819, crucial years in the history of the region. Plan of the town and harbour of St. Augustine in East Florida, 1783, by Tomas Lopez Of the 62 maps and plats in the Pintado Collection, 15 were drawn by Pintado himself. The remaining maps, plats, and cadastres were made by assistants under his supervision, and focus mainly on the regions around Baton Rouge, New Feliciana, Mobile and Pensacola, as well as Apalachicola Bay, which divided the two Floridas (West Florida extended to the Mississippi River). The collection also includes a copy of a plan made by the famous Spanish cartographer Tom√°s L√≥pez, a map of the city and port of Saint Augustine, Florida, made in 1783. Most of the papers are dated between 1799‚Äì1817, the period in which Pintado served as mayor and commander of New Feliciana near Baton Rouge, and later as Surveyor General of West Florida. Few of the Pintado documents date before 1799, and none of the official documents are dated after 1817, although there are applications for certificates of land grants in Louisiana and West Florida. Additional Archival Materials In the P. K. Yonge Library of Florida History, Special Collections, George A. Smathers Libraries, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, in the collection \\"Pioneer Days in Florida\\", there is a smaller collection of Pintado material: \\"Official records and correspondence of Vicente Sebastian Pintado, from 1817 to 1837. The letters and certifications in the collection pertain to land grants in Pensacola, Florida, and the liquidation of the estate of former Louisiana and West Florida Intendant Juan Ventura Morales. Also included is a lengthy diligencia on Pintado's own lands in Pensacola and an inventory of settlers who received land grants from the Spanish Crown.\\"  References   External links  * Pintado, Vicente Sebasti√°n, 1774-1829 People from La Palma People of Spanish Florida People of Colonial Spanish Louisiana People from West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Vicente Sebasti√°n Pintado"},{"id":"47129444","text":"Factory tint, officially known as Privacy Glass, is an electrical process called \\"deep dipping\\" that involves dying the inside of automotive glass with a dark pigment. Factory tint is standard on the rear half of many new vehicles. With a common visual light transmission (VLT) of 15‚Äì26%, privacy glass is installed to provide passengers and personal items privacy from outsiders, hence the name privacy glass. Since most states have a VLT legal limit of around 50% for the front driver windows and windshield, factory tint is only applied to the rear half of vehicles windows to avoid breaking the law.http://www.iwfa.com/Portals/0/PDFDocs/Law_Charts/StateLawChart03.27.2015.pdf Benefits With a low VLT, the primary benefit of privacy glass is to provide privacy for passengers and personal items. Unlike window film, privacy glass does not provide the same ultraviolet (UV) protection or heat reduction qualities. Window film offers 99% UV protection against both UVA and UVB rays.http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/uva-and-uvb/understanding-uva-and- uvb Privacy glass provides protection against UVB rays because UVB rays cannot penetrate any kind of glass including non tinted glass.http://www.medicaldaily.com/glass-car-windows-doesnt-fully-protect-suns- uv-rays-could-explain-left-side-skin-255398 Removal Unlike window film, privacy glass is a pigment within the glass that's installed during the manufacturing process. There is no way to remove the tint from the glass except to replace the glass with untinted glass. The only alternative to getting the same benefits of window film is to install window film over the factory tint. There are clear window films for automotive use that won't further darken the factory tint.

The originators of the theory, Joshua Price and Zoie MacDougall, demonstrated robotic expressionism in practice for the first time at the 2012 International RoboGames in a competition to create a robot artist. As opposed to the traditional forms of precision and randomized robotic artwork, robotic expressionists embraces the \\"mood\\" of the robot ‚Äì the state of its environment, internal stresses, battery level, and other factors ‚Äì to create an art piece with creative contributions from both the human roboticist and the robot painter. Origins While robotic expressionism may have existed in undocumented forms before them, Price and MacDougall are credited with being the first roboticists to publicly display art that aligned with the theory of robotic expressionism. They began work on their first robot artist, named RobART, in the Spring of 2012. RobART was composed primarily of VEX Robotics components and had several appendages holding paint brushes, foam brushes, a foam stamp, and spray paint cans. RobART painted on the ground and moved around on its paintings with twelve wheels; it was programmed using the RobotC language. Price and MacDougall entered RobART into the ArtBot ‚Äì Paint category 2012 International RoboGames competition, which is hosted in annually in San Mateo, California. Robogames is the world's largest adult robotics competition and is often called the \\"Olympics of robots\\". RobART painted several pieces live for audiences at the competition. All of the robot's paintings were abstract takes on a polluted cityscape, the most well-known titled City No. 3. Price and MacDougall were awarded the gold medal in the ArtBot ‚Äì Paint category for their work. Price and MacDougall were subsequently invited to the Dublin branch of the Alameda County Library to demonstrate RobART in action. The library then put one of RobART's paintings ‚Äì titled City No. 4 ‚Äì on public display as an innovative art piece. Theory The theory of robotic expressionism involves concepts of programming, mechanical devices, and art theory. A primary concern in programming physical machines is keeping movement error within a certain tolerance; much research has gone into controlling physical devices to be precise when following directions. Robotic expressionists abandon this notion of robotic precision and embrace the intrinsic unpredictability in the movement on machines. By allowing for physical variability, robotic expressionists are able to explore the robot's \\"mood\\". Some of the largest contributors to a robot's mood are its battery power, the strength of its motors, the temperature of its environment, its internal structure, and the material of the surface on which it moves. The interaction between human ideas and robot mood are central to the theory of robotic expressionism. The human gives the robot a program, which for the purpose of robotic expressionism can be considered an idea or a suggestion. The robot then reads the program and follows it based on its mood; a robot's mood is different each time it paints, so it will create a different work of art even when following the same program.

Biography  He was the son of a Russian Orthodox priest in the Diocese of Kherson, then part of the Russian Empire, now Ukraine. Originally, he planned to follow in his father's footsteps, studying first at the local religious school, then at the Odessa Theological Seminary, but he soon lost interest. He had been attracted to drawing since he was a child, and began to frequent the Odessa Drawing School at the local art society. Under the influence of Odessa's status as a major port, his focus soon turned to maritime themes. Surf at the Pier (1879) In 1868, he left the seminary and went to Saint Petersburg, where he was accepted on a provisional basis at the Imperial Academy of Arts. He eventually became a full student, remaining for three years and being awarded several medals. He returned to Ochakiv in 1871 and began a series of sketches of the Black Sea coastline. Most of these early works were derivative, and were not successful when they were exhibited in Saint Petersburg. His technique and originality improved during a trip to Germany and France in 1874.Brief biography @ Imperia.

He continued to exhibit in Saint Petersburg, sometimes together with Julius Sergius von Klever. In 1882, his painting, \\"Tempest near Ochakov\\", won him the title of Academician. The following year, he was married and became embroiled in a controversy when Arkhip Kuindzhi (a former roommate at the Academy) accused him of plagiarism. Although the critics and press took his side, several artists (Kramskoi, Maximov, Volkov and Repin) published a letter in the New Times, stating that Sudovsky had \\"directly borrowed\\" from Kuindzhi.Brief biography @ the Museum of Ukrainian Art, Dnipropetrovsk. Two years later, at the height of his career, he fell ill with typhus during an exhibition in Kiev, and was taken back to Ochakiv, where he died.

Blackenings occur predominantly in rural areas of north-east Scotland, the Highlands and the Northern Isles. The origins of the custom are obscure, however researcher, Dr. Sheila Young of the Elphinstone Institute, University of Aberdeen has shown that the blackening has evolved from an earlier Scottish ritual called the feet-washing.Young, Sheila: 'Prenuptial Rituals in Scotland: Blackening the Bride and Decorating the Hen', (Lexington Books, 2019) There is uncertainty surrounding just when it began, but it probably started as a solemn washing ritual for both men and women on the eve of their wedding and included a blackening of the feet and legs by the early 19th century. A little later, it had developed into a kind of a game, with the legs and feet being alternately blackened and scrubbed clean, and then by the end of the 19th century early 20th century escape, capture, tar and feathering, and pillorying had become part of the ritual. In order for this to happen the ritual had to move out of doors. The move out of doors appears to have coincided with a change in wedding practices, with more people marrying in the summer months. A ritual, which began as a washing ceremony, developed into a dirtying ceremony. It is probable then, that a change in the form of the ritual led to a change in name. The blackening's roots are Scottish, though a similar practice, called a doing, is to be found in Northern Ireland.Young, Sheila, 'The Evolution of the Contemporary Blackening', Folklore 128 (3), 2017, 244-270  References  Marriage, unions and partnerships in Scotland Wedding traditions Rural Scotland ","title":"Blackening (Scottish wedding custom)"},{"id":"47129572","text":"Howard H.

It is a power tool which is very similar in operation to a band saw, with an endless loop blade; the material to be cut is supported by a flat table. Technical characteristics A splitting band knife can be produced in different sizes (length x width x thickness) according to the splitting machine on which it has to be fitted. Different technical characteristics define the quality of the product (blade) The blade can be welded and bevelled, toothed not rectified, rectified on both edge and surfaces, with pre-sharpening made by tools or grinding stones. A splitting band knife can be produced in several dimensions, usually with a length from mm 1000 to 15000, a width between mm 10 and 110, a thickness from mm 0,40 to 1,50. Sectors and use Tannery sector In the tannery sector the splitting band knife allows to divide/split leather and textile in its thickness. The final products of this operation are Split and Grain (internal and external parts) of the leather. Blades can be used to split every kind of material which has to be split in the thickness: * leather * fur * non-woven material * velvet In the tannery sector, splitting band knives can be used in following working: wet blue, lime, dry, wet white and other tannings. The blades which are mostly used in this sector are rectified on both edge and surfaces in order to guarantee the best splitting, that means a constance in the thickness of the leather that is produced/split (rectification of surfaces), and also to guarantee the maximum linearity during the splitting process ( back edge); the blade must run as stable as possible without oscillations at all, which could create defects on the leather. Moreover, blades are used to be provided pre-bevelled in order to save time to start the blade running up once it is fitted on the splitting machine. Rubber, cork and foam sectors In the fields of rubber and cork, splitting band knives can be used on every kind of material that needs to be split in the thickness such as: * rubber (except vulcanized rubbers) * cork * foam In this sector blades can be used according to their application, to the splitting machine, to the material and to the cut/split precision required by the final product. Shoes and leather goods sectors In the production linked to shoes and leather goods, the splitting band knives allow to divide/split and equalize or ‚Äúreduce‚Äù the leather in the thickness in order to improve the quality of the finished product. The final product of this working, equalization or ‚Äúreduction‚Äù is a leather ready to become a shoe or leather goods (for example bags, wallets, belts, etc..) The hides used in this sectors are always finished leathers and in dry. In this field, splitting band knives can be used on every kind of material that needs to be split in the thickness such as: * leather * textiles ‚Äì linings * rubber ‚Äì insoles * cardboard components The blades which are mostly used in this sector are rectified on both edge and surfaces in order to guarantee the best splitting, that means a constance in the thickness of the leather that is produced/split (rectification of surfaces), and also to guarantee the maximum linearity during the splitting process ( back edge); the blade must run as stable as possible without oscillations at all, which could create defects on the leather. Moreover, blades are used to be provided pre-bevelled in order to save time to start the blade running up once it is fitted on the splitting machine. Paper sector The splitting band knife can be used also in paper sector and allows to divide/to split the material in the thickness, for example paper reels (from toilet paper to the reels for industrial use, paper towel rolls for domestic use, etc..) In this production, the final product obtained by the splitting is: * paper for industrial sector: big rolls, reels, etc.. for hygienic uses: handkerchiefs, toilet paper, kitchen rolls In this sector blades can be used according to their application, to the splitting machine, to the material and to the cut/split precision required by the final product Band knife machines Band Knife blades are used on two types of machine (vertical and horizontal) depending on the material being cut/processed. Vertical On a vertical band knife machine usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, the most common width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band knife machine. The dimensions are indicated on a small metal tag pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical machine band knife blade is most commonly a \\"double bevel, double edge DBDE\\" execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the \\"double bevel, single edge DBSE\\" execution cuts only in one direction. Productivity is enhanced when the operator cuts both while advancing and also while retracting the work table after adjusting the foam block after each pass for cutting. The DBDE execution blade can have a parallel or twisted 180 degrees welding. The twisted welding execution saves a grinding unit, as both edges pass the same grinding unit after two turns. It has been observed that a narrow width on a vertical band knife machine gives better dimensional accuracies on the foam block. The wider the vertical machine band knife - more the deflection and size variation from one end to the other extreme end. Horizontal Horizontal band knife blades are wider usually 30-60mm wide for foam converting is popular, for leather goods 40-50mm wide blade is popular, 85-110mm width is popular for the tannery splitting band knife. There are other widths depending on the machine manufacturer. The horizontal machine band knife blade is supported by a guide to give dimensional accuracies while cutting/splitting. Therefore, only blades that have passed as one main manufacturing step a surface grinding process reach the necessary thickness tolerances of less than 0,02mm. A higher tolerance would lead to marks on the surface of the split material like leather or rubber. Blades are available in different grades of exactness depending on the required exactness on the material to be cut/split. On modern machines in combination with a high grade blade a splitting thickness of 0,2mm for 1500mm material width is possible. Blade sharpening For both the vertical and horizontal band knife machines there is a grinding attachment which continuously sharpens the band knife while it is cutting. It is possible to find a nonpowered grinding attachment for the vertical machines but for the horizontal band knife machine the grinding attachment for continuously sharpening the blade is powered by electric motors.

Constructed in 1852, it is the oldest government building still-standing in the city. The Governor's House, home of the \\"gaoler\\", in a mid-Victorian Italian Villa style, was added in 1878. Both have been on Canadian Register of Historic Places since 27 March 2008. Both buildings have been extensively restored. They are located at 73 Queen Street North, Kitchener, Ontario beside the new Court House. History The precursory requirement for the creation of a county in the 1850s was the presence of a local gaol and courthouse. In deciding the seat of Waterloo County, a seat for which Berlin and Galt were both competing, the presence of such buildings were taken into account. Because Berlin, Ontario (now Kitchener) had a jail and courthouse, the city became the county seat. The gaol had been constructed on land donated by hotel owner Frederick Gaukel. Work began in 1852, the year of the inception of Waterloo County, Ontario. It was designed by the architectural firm Mellish and Russell of Brantford, Ontario who used a Classic Revival style. The cost of the construction in 1852 was ¬£4875. For over a century after its completion, the gaol was administered municipally, although this changed after 1968, as the government reformed the administrative system of Ontario's prisons. The addition of the governor's house in 1878, designed by architect David W. Gingerich, served as the gaolor's residence for the next century of the facility's operation. Closed in 1978 to be replaced by the Waterloo Regional Detention Center, the building is now a heritage site. After the closing, the building was the subject of a 2002 feasibility study aimed at converting the former prison into an affordable housing project. Gaol and Governor's House Both the house and gaol reopened after major renovations. The section that was the gaol now houses courtrooms while the area that was the house is now the location of the offices of the court and other agencies.

In 1784, one of Louis XVI's ministers ceded the French Caribbean island to Sweden in exchange for trading rights in the Swedish port of Gothenburg. Swedish rule lasted until 1878 when the French repurchased the island. Background Following problems experienced by early French settlers, Saint Barth√©lemy was successfully colonized by French mariners in 1763. Attracted by the island's prosperity during the American Revolutionary War, Gustav III of Sweden agreed to exchange French trading rights in Gothenburg against Swedish colonization of the island. In addition to its fresh water sources, the island produced moderate amounts of cotton, sugar, cocoa, tobacco and fruits while it promised substantial revenue from trade through its natural harbour on the island's west coast. On 1 July 1784, the island became a Swedish possession. The king informed Sweden's privy council of the acquisition on 23 August. On 1 September, Swedish officials under the leadership of Salomon von Rajalin (1757‚Äì1825), the island's first Swedish governor, were appointed to administer the island. They sailed from Gothenburg on 4 December 1784 on the frigate Sprengtporten, arriving in Saint Barth√©lemy on 6 March 1785. In January 1785, the Swedish merchants Jacob R√∂hl and Adolf Fredrik Hansen had already arrived to establish a trading post with warehousing. At the time, the island had a population of some 750 of whom 281 were slaves. French was spoken in the rural areas while English was spoken in the capital. History of Swedish rule On 7 March 1785, the French commandant Chevalier de Durant ceded authority to von Rajalin who, on 16 April 1785, introduced tax free trading for visiting ships. On 7 September, he established Saint Barth√©lemy as a free port. The French port of La Car√©nage was renamed Gustavia after the Swedish king. From 28 August 1786, slave trade was included in a royal letter and on 12 March 1790 the taxation regime for the shipment of slaves was established. Between a third to half of Saint Barth√©lemy's population were registered slaves in year 1819 (estimations are between 1,283 and 2033 slaves). On 31 October 1786, the Swedish West India Company was established on the island with responsibility for maintaining the port and the employment of Swedish officials. By the end of the century, around 1,330 ships visited the port of Gustavia annually. By the beginning of the 19th century, the population had grown to around 6,000, with some 5,000 living in Gustavia. From 19 March 1801 to 10 July 1802, the British occupied the island. The weekly journal The Report of St Bartholomew was published from 1804 to 1819 documenting life on the island over a period of 15 years. Following rioting between the island's French and English communities in September 1811, an administrative council consisting of the governor and six officials was established on 25 September to govern the island. Arrangements were also made for popular representation within an assembly which met every three years. Trade continued to flourish during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States when 20% of American exports were routed via St Barth√©lemy. In 1812, the Swedish parliament transferred the colony to the king as his private property. A colonial department was established in the king's chancellery and customs duties and revenues were paid into the king's Saint Barth√©lemy fund. Revenues from 1812 to 1816 amounted to around SEK 1.9 million and from 1817 to 1830 to SEK 1.8 million providing a total surplus of SEK 2.2 million. In 1839, Gustavia lost its role as a free port. Thereafter Sweden provided the necessary financial support. In 1840, around 300 died when a feverish epidemic hit the island, reducing the population to about 2,500. In 1850, the island also suffered a severe drought. In the mid-1840s, the Swedish parliament ruled that Saint Barth√©lemy should again be included under national administration. The parliament also abolished slave trading and slavery on the island. A census in late 1875 indicated there were around 2,300 living on the island, 800 of whom resided in Gustavia. That year only 399 ships sailed to the island of which 227 were from Britain and 132 from Sweden. As a result of increases in the financial support required to administer the colony, the Swedish authorities began negotiations with France for the island's repurchase. On 10 August 1877, the transfer agreement was signed in Paris. It was ratified in Stockholm on 9 November 1877 and in Paris on 4 March 1878. The transaction price was 80,000 francs for Swedish assets and 320,000 francs for the repatriation and retirement of Swedish officials. On 16 March 1878, the French officially reoccupied Saint Barth√©lemy.

It is part of the Trump chain of golf clubs that includes clubs in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Bedminster. The club contains two 18-hole golf courses, both par 72. The Championship Course was designed by Tom Fazio, and the Riverview course was added in 1999, when the club was still known as the Lowes Island Club. The Riverview Course abuts the Potomac River and was originally designed by Arthur Hills. The club also contains a clubhouse, an swimming pool, an indoor tennis center, and a fitness center.  History  The Trump National Golf Club (Washington, D.C.) was formerly the Lowes Island Club. Donald Trump purchased the club in 2009 for $13 million from a bank after the previous owner defaulted on its loans. He financed the purchase with a loan from Chevy Chase Bank. Trump then invested at least $25 million into the property. Trump hired Tom Fazio to remake the golf courses. The clubhouse, pool, and other facilities were also renovated. Renovations were completed in June 2015. An estimated 465 trees were removed to provide unobstructed views of the Potomac River, prompting objections from some. The Trump Organization officials said that many of the trees were weak, in danger of becoming diseased, and presented soil erosion problems; the Loudoun County urban forester and other county officials \\"did not oppose cutting down some unhealthy trees\\" but did not feel \\"that the extent of the removal was necessary\\". A company official said that trash and debris was also removed from the riverbank. Trump had the \\"River of Blood\\" monument added near the Potomac River. The monument claims that \\"Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot. The casualties were so great that the water would turn red.\\" The plaque's claim is dubious, as a number of Civil War historians pointed out; no documented battle took place at or near the site. In 2016, Trump's financial disclosures indicated the property earned $17.5 million in revenue. Eric Trump now manages the club. President Trump visited the club six times between mid-March and the end of May 2017. The course hosted the Senior PGA Championship in May 2017; Bernhard Langer won his record ninth senior major title. Trump Presidency This course has become known during Donald Trump's presidency, because he golfs here on weekends that he is not traveling. He uses the course year round, and whenever he is not traveling to Mar-A-Lago, or the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ, he will golf here, and then travel to his hotel in Washington DC (the Old Post Office) for dinner.

Const. L. & Pub. Pol'y 141 (2015). Background Truth in Lending Act rescission requirements In 1968, Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act to help consumers \\"avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing.\\"82 Stat. 146, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1601(a). The Act gives borrowers the unconditional right to rescind loans within three days of consummation of the loan, after which they may rescind only if the lender failed to satisfy the Act‚Äôs disclosure requirements.Jesinoski, slip op. at 2. However, even if lenders never provide the required disclosures, borrowers only retain the right to rescind loans up to three years after the loan's consummation.Jesinoski, slip op. at 1, 2; see also 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1635(a), (f). Initial lawsuit On February 23, 2010, exactly three years after borrowing $611,000 from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. to refinance the mortgage on their home, Larry and Cheryle Jesinoski mailed a letter to Countrywide to rescind the loan agreement.Jesinoski, slip op. at 1. On March 12, 2010, Bank of America Home Loans sent a reply letter in which they refused to acknowledge the validity of the rescission. The Jesinoskis filed suit in federal district court on February 24, 2011 seeking a declaration of rescission and damages. The district court ruled in favor of Bank of America and concluded that the Truth in Lending Act requires borrowers seeking rescission of a loan to file a lawsuit within three years of consummating the loan.Jesinoski, slip op. at 1‚Äì2. Because the Jesinoskis filed their lawsuit four years after the loan's consummation, they were not entitled to rescission of the loan. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the decision of the district court.Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 729 F. 3d 1092, 1093 (2013) (per curiam). The Jesinoskis appealed again, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 28, 2014.Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1935 (2014) (granting certiorari). Opinion of the Court Commentators described Justice Antonin Scalia's unanimous opinion as the \\"shortest opinion of the year.\\" Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Antonin Scalia ruled that the Truth in Lending Act does not require borrowers to file a lawsuit to effectuate rescission.Jesinoski, slip op. at 2‚Äì3. Justice Scalia stated that the plain language of the act \\"leaves no doubt that rescission is effected when the borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind,\\" but the act \\"says nothing about how that right is exercised.\\"Jesinoski, slip op. at 2‚Äì3 (internal emphasis omitted). Although common law rules for rescission traditionally required \\"either that the rescinding party return what he received\\" or a court's \\"decree [of] rescission,\\" Justice Scalia concluded that the Act did not adopt these common law requirements.Jesinoski, slip op. at 4‚Äì5 (internal citations omitted). Instead, he argued that \\"[n]othing in our jurisprudence, and no tool of statutory interpretation, requires that a congressional Act must be construed as implementing its closest common-law analogue.\\"Jesinoski, slip op. at 4‚Äì5. Consequently, the statute has effectively altered common law practice, and borrowers \\"need only provide written notice to a lender in order to exercise his right to rescind.\\" Commentary and analysis After the Supreme Court issued its opinion, analysts described Jesinoski as a \\"landmark case\\" in Truth in Lending Act jurisprudence.Frank A.

Like its sister universities, its mandate lies in training students with a view to careers in academia, engineering and government. Established by a decree of the 17 October 2013 of the Prime Minister, the ENS Rennes is placed under the direct authority of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and is a founder of the European University of Britanny. Before 2013, it was a branch of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Paris-Saclay, but the great geographical distance between Cachan and Rennes gradually led to its being granted a greater level of autonomy. The school is divided into five departments, which have a yearly intake of eighty to 100 normaliens, i. e. students who are granted the status of paid civil servants. Like the other grandes √©coles in the French higher education system, these students are selected through highly selective entrance examinations called concours, after at least two years of preparatory tuition in schools known as classes pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles. As well as these paid students; the school also admits attendees called magist√©riens, including international students. These two groups of students, despite their different status, receive similar tuition over a four-year period. The ENS Rennes records high levels of success in steering its students towards research-oriented careers; indeed, more than eighty percent of any year-group take and pass the agr√©gation, a French national competitive examination for entrance into careers in academia, and some seventy percent go on to undertake a PhD program.

The Hillary Medal is a project of Mountain Legacy, a Nepalese non-governmental organization (reg. #1018/060-61; www.mountainlegacy.org); the president is biologist Kumar P. Mainali. The Hillary Medal was personally authorized by Sir Edmund in 2002, and ratified by the Namche Consensus, the declaration resulting from the 2003 Namche Conference: \\"People, Park, and Mountain Ecotourism.\\" Hillary Medal presentations have taken place at various venues, including two in Tengboche, Nepal, (2003 and 2008); two in Melbourne, Australia (2006 and 2010); one in Khumjung, Nepal (2011); two in Kathmandu, Nepal (2013 and 2017); and one in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (2015). The 2017 Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal was presented to Peruvian engineer C√©sar Portocarrero in Kathmandu, on December 11, 2016. History As a member of John Hunt's British Everest Expedition, Edmund Hillary earned international fame as a result of his achieving the first ascent of Mount Everest, along with Tenzing Norgay, in what Time magazine has characterized as \\"the last major earthly adventure and also the last great symbol of [the British] Empire.\\" Reaching the \\"Top of the World\\" was one of a series of adventures that brought Hillary world attention; these included the ascent of ten other Himalayan peaks between 1956 and 1965, an expedition to find the yeti; and an expedition to the South Pole as a member of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1958, a jetboat expedition up the Ganges in 1977, and a flight to the North Pole along with Neil Armstrong in 1985. Starting in the 1960s, Sir Edmund undertook numerous small-scale development projects on behalf of the Sherpa communities of the Solu, Khumbu, Pharak and Rolwaling districts of eastern Nepal. Working with friends, family, and volunteers, Hillary built some 27 schools, 3 airstrips, 2 hospitals, and an indeterminate number of bridges, water supply systems, clinics, and other infrastructure. He founded the Himalayan Trust to facilitate fundraising, and this non-governmental organization (NGO) was joined by Himalayan Trust UK, the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation (Canada), the American Himalayan Foundation (USA), the Hillary-Stiftung Deutschland (Germany), and other non-profit organizations. The idea for the Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal came from the Nepal-based ecotourism and volunteer organization, Bridges: Projects in Rational Tourism Development (Bridges-PRTD), directed by Seth Sicroff. The award was conceived as a means of both honoring the humanitarian accomplishments of Sir Edmund and also encouraging their emulation by others. It was authorized by Sir Edmund himself in December 2002, and formally ratified by the Namche Consensus, the final declaration of the 2003 Namche Conference (\\"People, Park, and Mountain Ecotourism\\"). The Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy was founded to carry out the selection and presentation of Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medals.

In 1895/96 he worked in the psychological laboratory of Heidelberg University alongside Emil Kraepelin. In 1897, Ach went on a trip to North America for further examination of motion sickness. Following the journey, he worked at the pharmacological institute of the University of Strasbourg. Ach was a member of the W√ºrzburg School of \\"imageless thought\\", where he was a student of Oswald K√ºlpe and received his PhD in 1899. Considered one of the most skillful experimental psychologists of his time, Ach was the first to conduct experiments in the area of volition. He developed the method of \\"systematic experimental introspection\\" and demonstrated experimentally the \\"determining tendency,\\" which indicates that the instructions for the execution of a task sets up in a person a predisposition to act or react in a certain way, without the individual's being necessarily aware of it. Ach was also instrumental to the understanding of concept formation. Additionally, he was considered an accomplished apparatus builder and inventor. Later in his career he would go on to apply his determining tendency theory in the study of applied psychological issues such as driver safety. In 1933 Ach signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State. In 1938, Ach was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.  Family  In 1911, Ach married his student Maria Elisabeth Mez (1891-1947), the daughter of botanist Carl Christian Mez and granddaughter of poet Wilhelm Jensen. They had six children together.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on June 13, 2014, and later released for OS X and Linux. The player assumes the role of a cargo ship pilot, and must build modules and weapons to defend their cargo from attacking ships and other hazards. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and a sequel was announced in March 2016. Gameplay The player acts as pilot for a cargo ship, performing space runs for various corporations. The ship is a flat platform made up of hexagonal tiles. The player places weapons and modules on the tiles in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards. Different structures have varying placement requirements, or may require more than one tile to be placed. For example, most weapons must be placed facing outward into empty space, while some require power to be supplied by an adjacent power source. Modules and weapons are built using a resource represented by a lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides a different type of cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons. Each mission has a timed duration that the player must beat, with two tiers of time bonus. The player is rewarded with space credits dependent on the amount of cargo that survived the mission and how quickly they completed it. Reputation, displayed as stars, is rewarded based whether or not the player met cargo or time thresholds. Space credits are used between missions in order to purchase special abilities and bonuses for modules, while gaining reputation unlocks new modules. Plot The player plays the role of Buck Mann, a space runner down on his luck. A former military pilot and racer, Buck begins to accept jobs from large corporations when his money runs out. Accompanied by the android, Addam-12, he first accepts a job from the Big Cargo corporation carrying simple cargo containers. Shortly afterwards, the Nuclear Star corporation approaches him to carry nuclear waste. After several runs, Buck Mann attracts the attention of the pirates Brown Beard and Captain Black, who continuously harass him as his missions become more and more lucrative. Development Space Run is developed by one-man studio PASSTECH Games, located in Lyon, France. Programmer Sylvain Passot founded the studio in October 2012. Passot has said that Space Run was inspired by Galaxy Trucker, a boardgame by Vlaada Chvatil, as well as accessible games like Plants vs. Zombies. A sequel named Space Run Galaxy was announced in March 2016. Galaxy will include new boss battles and cargos, as well as new online features. Reception Space Run received mixed reviews upon release. It received an aggregate score of 73 from Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from critics, while GameRankings assigned a score of 75%. GameSpot gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and challenging gameplay. However, they noted that at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered the best part of the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.

Abu Samra () is a settlement in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al Rayyan (90 km away from Doha). It used to be part of the Jariyan al Batnah municipality before the municipality was incorporated into Al Rayyan. Notable features of the area are a border post separating the southern part of the municipality from Saudi Arabia, and a well. It was previously Qatar's only land border crossing to Saudi Arabia, until its closure in June 2017 over the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Etymology The settlement derived its name from a local Samr tree. Because the area contained one of the few Samr trees in the entire region, it was named Abu Samra, meaning 'father of the Samr tree'. The tree has local significance as it is used as fodder for camels. Geography It is located in Zone 96, a largely undeveloped zone, consisting mainly of desert plains. Of the zone's 801.7 square km area, only 43 square km of land is under use. Commercial and industrial establishments occupy 2% of its land, government offices occupy 4%, farmland takes up 11% and the remainder of developed land is categorized as \\"other\\", which includes under-construction developments. Qatar's capital, Doha, is located at a distance of 97 km to the north-east. Other distances include Sawda Natheel ‚Äì 47.2 km away, Umm Salal Ali ‚Äì 124 km away, Al Khor ‚Äì 154 km away, Madinat ash Shamal ‚Äì 204 km away, Al Wakrah ‚Äì 112 km away, and Dukhan ‚Äì 127 km away.

In 2015, the government announced the upcoming construction of an extensive tourist complex in Abu Samra. It was intended to cater towards Saudi tourists, who would commonly enter Qatar through the Abu Samra border crossing on the weekends. Aside from the border crossing leading into Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Interior has an Immigrations Department office and Customs Department office in the settlement. Saudi Arabia's Salwa border crossing is more than 8 km from the Abu Samra border crossing. On 5 June 2017, when a quartet composed of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar, the border crossing was shut down. Prior to its closure, it was the main route into Qatar of building supplies for 2022 World Cup projects as well as fresh produce. A military base of the Qatar Armed Forces and a helipad are found here. Industry Sand ripples on a beach in Abu Samra. The Qatari government established a large sheep farm here in the early 1980s in a bid to improve food self sufficiency. In 1982, the farm was producing 13,000 sheep annually, of which 4,000 were reserved exclusively for breeding. A major desalination plant in Abu Samra was announced in 2010. At a cost of QAR 27 million, the plant was stated to have a potable water production capacity of 2,000 cubic meters per day, and had a projected completion date in 2011.

Plot  Debra (Patricia Heaton) is going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS); as a result, she has mood swings that make her more reactive to Ray's (Ray Romano) clumsiness and stubbornness when it comes to their house's cleanliness. Ray buys a pill meant to alleviate the symptoms, but Debra takes it as him being \\"insensitive\\" and gets even angrier before becoming calm again after going out to her once-a-month \\"Ladies Day\\" for five hours of the evening. While this goes on, Ray tries to figure out the problem, but notices that last month is when he found his golf clubs in the garbage, figuring Debra is using ladies day to torture Raymond. He vents out all of this on Debra when she arrives home, an argument that involves playing a tape he recorded of Debra complaining to Ray about lint. This pushes Debra over the edge, reminding Ray of his inabilities to help her in her most serious situations, including Ray watching sports television at the hospital while Debra birthed twin sons. She yells all of this while backing him towards a book shelf. Then, in an instant, Debra switches to a positive mood when the phone rings and she has a chat with an off-screen Amy, one of her friends, about that evening's ladies day. After the conversation, Debra apologizes to Ray and lets him know all she wants is the feeling that his husband will always be there for her during difficult moments. However, she becomes against his husband again when he offers her more PMS pills, ending the conversation on a sour note. In the episode's final scene, Ray's father Frank (Peter Boyle) attempts to play the same tape recording trick on his wife Marie (Doris Roberts) as his son did on Debra; however, the plan backfires as he accidentally records himself complaining.  Production  Writing-wise, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is the third collaboration between Ray Romano and Philip Rosenthal, after \\"How They Met\\" and the two-part \\"The Wedding.\\" It is also the first of three Raymond directing credits for Frasier creator David Lee, who also directed two fifth season episodes, \\"Net Worth\\" and \\"Frank Paints the House.\\" Romano claimed in a 2000 interview that he acknowledged \\"comments that I'm too nasty to her. That I don't show enough love. I'm not demonstrative,\\" and thought of those when writing \\"Bad Moon Rising:\\" \\"We tried to walk right in the middle, where she's being unreasonable, but he's also being a jerk. We tried to make sure not that she wasn't just a screaming crazy woman, but that I was a slob and an idiot, too.\\"  Reception  Upon its initial airing, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" was claimed by contemporaneous reviewers to be a \\"classic\\" and worthy of Emmy Awards, particularly for Heaton's performance. Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune gave it a four-out-of-four-star review, summarizing, \\"[The couple's] big, final, pre-menstrual battle royale is as funny as any sitcom scene you'll see all year. This is the stuff of sitcom immortality.\\" This level of acclaim towards the episode continued in later years, being called a \\"classic\\" and one of the best installments of the entirety of Everybody Loves Raymond. However, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" has also received criticism from psychologists for its inaccurate portrayal of premenstrual syndrome, citing it as an example of a trend in comedy television series of PMS as a comedic tactic. The episode painted Ray as suffering from Debra's PMS behavior, as if he had no responsibility for it, wrote Linda Brannon. Analyzed University of Melbourne professor Lauren Rosewarne, this is despite other episodes of Ray being irresponsible of home duties, and \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" presented PMS as causing Debra to act out of her stereotypical home wife persona \\"ways more extreme then audiences are used to seeing [her].\\" Romano and Rosenthal were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for their work on \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" the first time the series was nominated for the accolade. Heaton won the award Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, which was for acting in the episode. It was Everybody Loves Raymonds first-ever Emmy win; according to Rosenthal, the publicity of it increased the popularity of the show's cast, which was a prominent factor of \\"Italy,\\" an episode that aired a month later, garnering 22 million viewers, a record for the show.  Home media  \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is included on the fourth season DVD of Everybody Loves Raymond, released on September 13, 2005; the set also features an audio commentary track of the episode featuring Romano, Rosenthal, and Heaton (who actually had PMS during recording), and a blooper reel that includes outtakes from the episode.

After the Kosmos 133 mission failed, the rocket was moved to the launch pad on 12 December 1966 and scheduled to launch on 14 December 1966, 11:00 GMT.  Launch  At ignition, one of the strap-on boosters failed to start and so an automatic command shut down the core stage and remaining strap-ons. Launch personnel began saving the booster in preparation to take it down from the pad for examination. About 27 minutes after the aborted launch, the launch escape system (LES) suddenly activated. The Soyuz descent module was blasted free of the stack and touched down at from the pad 31. Meanwhile, the exhaust from the LES caught the third stage of the booster on fire. Flames began curling down the side of the booster as launch personnel ran for cover. After a few minutes, the core stage and strap-ons exploded, completely destroying the entire launch vehicle and causing major damage to LC-31. One person on the ground was killed and the pad was not used again for seven months following the disaster.  Investigation  Since tracking cameras around LC-31 had been turned off when the launch aborted, there was no film footage of the fire or explosion for analysis, but telemetry data found that the igniter in the Blok D strap-on had failed to activate. This was a minor problem and could have been easily fixed by simply installing a new igniter. The bigger question was why the LES activated. Initially, it was suspected that the booster had been bumped when the gantry tower was put back in place following the abort and that this somehow managed to trigger the LES, but a more thorough investigation found a different cause. During the attempted launch, the booster switched from external to internal power as it normally would do, which then activated the abort sensing system. The Earth's rotation caused the rate gyros to register an approximately 8¬∞ tilt 27 minutes after the aborted liftoff, which the abort sensing system then interpreted as meaning that the booster had deviated from its flight path, and thus it activated the LES. The abort sensing system in the Soyuz was thus redesigned to prevent a recurrence of this unanticipated design flaw. On the other hand, the LES had also worked flawlessly and demonstrated its ability to safely pull cosmonauts from the booster should an emergency arise as it did years later in the Soyuz 7K-ST No.16L abort (26 September 1983). One more mystery remained, which was why the LES had ignited the third stage on fire, something it was not supposed to do. The conclusion was that when the Soyuz descent module separated from the service module during the abort, it had inadvertently severed coolant lines in the service module, which then leaked out their highly flammable contents and started a fire when they were contacted by the LES exhaust.

It was demarcated in 1988. It used to be part of the Al Jemailiya municipality before the municipality was incorporated into Al Rayyan. In 2014, the settlement was incorporated into the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality. Etymology Nasraniya was named after a local well. Because the well was built on rocky, solid ground, locals had to dig deep under the surface for the well to function. Once the well was working, it was a described as a victory, and the locals decided to name the well Nasraniya, meaning Christianity, in allusion to the victory of Islam in superseding Christianity as the predominant religion in the Arabian Peninsula. History J.G. Lorimer mentioned Nasraniya in 1908 in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, stating that it lies \\"11 miles south of the foot of Dohat FaishsƒÅkh and 16 miles west from the coast\\" and remarked on the presence of a masonry well, 25 fathoms (150 feet) deep, yielding good water.

Strom Thurmond's final campaign re- election announcement. The NRSC in this cycle faced several challenges beyond its control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995‚Äì96, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Gingrich was turned by Democrats into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav- fav ratio in surveys); Dole frittered away an early lead, resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide. Hensley and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to cut loose from unpopular national leaders and carve their own individual profiles on issues. NRSC Chair Alfonse D'Amato remained a champion fundraiser and the committee found new legal ways to deliver assistance to Senate campaigns and local parties.Murray, Frank J., Washington Times, \\"Court Throws out \`Soft Money' Limit on Party Spending,\\" accessed thru https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-56857026 On Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Senate Republicans won open seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while losing South Dakota. In a poor GOP year, the NRSC had gained a net 2 seats (and narrowly missed another gain in the Cleland-Millner race in Georgia).

All of his work since 1997 has been through this firm, much of it for the health-care industry. That year, Hensley was hired by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) to help direct the successful special election of Vito Fossella to the Congressional seat representing Staten island, NY, vacated by retiring Rep. Susan Molinari. In 1998, Hensley was hired by the New York State Republican Committee to aid the entire GOP ticket, including Pataki, D'Amato and Attorney General Dennis Vacco.

Iconophobia is differentiated from iconoclasm in that iconophobia refers to the aversion to or hatred of the images whereas iconoclasm refers to the actual destruction of images that may arise from iconophobia. Chari Larsson wrote: > ‚ÄúIf iconophobia is defined as the suspicion and anxiety towards the power > exerted by images, its history is an ancient one in all of its Platonic, > Christian, and Judaic forms. At its most radical, iconophobia results in an > act of iconoclasm, or the total destruction of the image. At the other end > of the spectrum, contemporary iconophobia may be more subtle. Images are > simply withdrawn from circulation with the aim of eliminating their > visibility.‚Äù The history of iconophobia begins with ancient Greece and Rome and continues with the violent iconoclasms of the period 726-842 in the Eastern Orthodox Church within the Byzantine Empire. But it is the Protestant Reformation that is most associated with iconophobia: ‚ÄúThe Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517, brought iconophobia to the forefront of contemporary politics... Iconophobia was pushed to its extreme in the teachings of John Calvin... Protestant iconophobia had a huge and not exclusively negative impact on aesthetics and the history of art. It permanently affected the ways images were made, exhibited, and judged.‚Äù __TOC__ Iconophobia and the English Reformation The leading historian of English Protestantism, Patrick Collinson, applied the term iconophobia to a specific period in post- Reformation England in his 1985 Stenton Lecture, From Iconoclasm to Iconophobia: the Cultural Impact of the Second English Reformation. The arguments also informed chapter 4 of his 1988 book, The Birthpangs of Protestant England. Collinson‚Äôs work has shaped a generation of scholarly enquiry into the impact of religion on culture, and of culture on religion, in post-reformation England. Scholars have accepted, rejected, and modified Collinson‚Äôs arguments, but one way or another they continue to exert a powerful influence over reformation studies. Collinson carefully re-defined iconoclasm (generally defined as ‚Äúthe destruction of religious icons and other images or monuments for religious or political motives‚Äù) in his essay as follows: > ‚ÄúThe first generation of Protestant publicists and propagandists, the > Edwardian generation, made polemical and creative use of cultural vehicles > which their spiritual children and grandchildren later repudiated, as part > of their rather general programme of rejection. They wrote and staged > Protestant plays. They sang Protestant songs and godly ballads to secular > and popular tunes. And they made brilliant use of the graphic image, both to > attack Catholicism and to commend their own religious convictions and > values. These strategies constitute, for my purpose, what is meant by > Iconoclasm ... Iconoclasm in this sense may imply the substitution of other, > acceptable images, or the refashioning of some images for an altered > purpose.‚Äù Iconophobia, by comparison, is defined as ‚Äúthe total repudiation of all images‚Äù, which Collinson associates with a watershed moment around 1580, introducing a ‚Äúsudden and drastic‚Äù change. This ‚Äúsecondary thrust‚Äù of reform ‚Äúcame close to dispensing with images and the mimetic altogether, while disparaging the tastes and capacities of the illiterate, the mass of the people‚Äù. Collinson describes the ‚Äúage of extreme iconophobia‚Äù as ‚Äúquite short, equivalent to little more than a single generation‚Äù. Nevertheless, much subsequent scholarship has suggested that iconophobia characterised post- Reformation Protestantism from 1580 onwards.

It fought on the Western Front during World War I, and its successors served in the Mediterranean and North-West Europe theatres during World War II. Origin When the Territorial Force was created in 1908 by the Haldane Reforms, each infantry division was allocated a heavy battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). London provided two divisions, whose heavy batteries were manned by converting the existing 1st London Engineer Volunteer Corps (EVC) into the 1st London Heavy Brigade, RGA. The 1st London EVC had been raised in 1862 as the 1st City of London Engineer Volunteer Corps, nicknamed 'Old Jewry' from the quarter of the City of London where it was initially based, though the unit moved to the Barbican in 1868 and then to Islington in North London in 1877. From 1863 to 1868 it was attached for administrative purposes to the 1st Middlesex EVC based at the South Kensington museums.Beckett, Appendix IX.Westlake, p. 11.Barnes, Appendices III & IV.Litchfield pp. 162‚Äì3.Monthly Army Lists.Post Office London Directories. The engineer unit sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War in 1900, and a second section the following year.Watson, pp. 42‚Äì3. The RGA brigade formed in 1908 was an administrative unit for the 1st and 2nd London Heavy Batteries, assigned to the 1st and 2nd London Divisions respectively. Its drill hall was at Offord Road in Islington. World War I The two London divisions had just begun their annual training on Salisbury Plain when war was declared in August 1914: they promptly returned to their drill halls to mobilise. Both London heavy batteries were equipped with four 4.7-inch guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141-7. 1/1st London Heavy Battery During the autumn of 1914, the 1st London Division sent most of its infantry battalions to relieve Regular troops in Malta or to supplement the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. By January 1915, what remained of the division in the UK was broken up and its support units, including 1st London Heavy Battery, were assigned to a new 2nd Line division (the 2/1st London) that was being organised. The battery organised its own 2nd Line unit, designated 2/1st.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15. Somme The new division, now numbered 58th (2/1st London) Division, spent 1915 and the early part of 1916 training around Ipswich. On 11 February 1916, the 1/1st London Heavy Battery left the division and moved to Woolwich to prepare for independent service overseas, the 2/1st London Heavy Battery having already joined 58th Division the previous September. The 1/1st Bty disembarked at Le Havre on 3 March 1916 and joined XXVII Heavy Artillery Group, RGA. Subsequently, it passed from one mobile or mixed-gun Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) to another, supporting the various armies of the BEF as operations dictated. On 12 February 1917, the four-gun battery was made up to six guns when it was joined by a section from the 193rd Heavy Battery, a New Army unit that had just arrived from England. By now, the heavy batteries on the Western Front had adopted the 60-pounder in place of the 4.7-inch. The battery was finally posted to 42nd HAG (later 42nd Heavy Brigade) on 23 December 1917 and remained with it (apart from short detachments) for the rest of the war.Farndale, Annex E.Farndale, Annex M.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA' and 'Allocation of HA Groups', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494. 1/2nd London Heavy Battery The 2nd London Heavy Battery also formed 1st and 2nd Line units. The 1/2nd Bty landed in France with 2nd London Division (soon afterwards renamed 47th (1/2nd London) Division) on 15 March 1915. However, artillery policy in the British Expeditionary Force was to withdraw heavy batteries from the divisions and allocate them to HAGs. The 1/2nd Bty therefore transferred from the division to I Group, Heavy Artillery Reserve, on 31 March.Maude, Appendix C. It joined the 13th HAG, supporting V Corps, on 19 April 1915. =Kitchener's Wood= German soldiers with captured British QF 4.7 inch gun during World War I, apparently in Belgium On 22 April, the battery was camped at 'Kitchener's Wood' en route to Ypres to be attached to the Indian Corps when the Germans launched a surprise attack (the 2nd Battle of Ypres) behind a gas cloud and broke through the French defenders. Although reportedly armed with only seven rifles, the Londoners fought a stubborn rearguard action as the Germans entered the wood, allowing the gunners to remove the breechblocks and firing pins from their 4.7s before escaping. The guns were recaptured by the 2nd Canadian Division but the position could not be held and the guns were abandoned.McWilliams & Steel, p. 47.Sir John French's despatch at FirstWorldWar.com The Germans subsequently reported their capture of the guns marked 'London', causing 'considerable anxiety in London, from the impression thereby created that the London Division had been at Ypres in the gas attack, and had been driven back to such an extent as to lose their heavy guns'.Maude, p. 12. The battery was subsequently re-equipped. On 1 March 1917, it was made up to six guns when a section joined from 199th Heavy Battery. Like the 1/1st, the 1/2nd London Heavy Battery moved from one HAG to another as required until 8 July 1917, when it returned to become a permanent part of the mobile 13th HAG (later 13th Heavy Brigade) for the rest of the war. 2/1st London Heavy Battery Raised in 1914 from volunteers, this battery joined 58th (2/1st London) Division at Ipswich on 24 September 1915, initially serving alongside its 1st Line battery. In July 1916, 2/1st and 2/2nd London Heavy Batteries formed part of 'C' Brigade of RGA heavy batteries attached to Southern Army defending Eastern England.TNA file WO 33/765. The battery did not accompany 58th Division when it went to France in January 1917. Instead, it joined the newly formed 71st Division on 9 March 1917. On 12 February 1918, it formed part of 226th Mixed Brigade when it was transferred to 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division, and the battery served as a training unit with this formation until the end of the war, without leaving the UK.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 104. 2/2nd London Heavy Battery This battery served with 60th (2/2nd London) Division from 9 April 1915 until 24 January 1916, when it transferred to 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. It did not accompany the division to France in June 1916 but, like 2/1st Battery, it was part of 'C' Brigade RGA in Southern Army and then joined 71st Division.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 27. From then on its career was the same as the 2/1st Battery. Interwar The brigade reformed at Offord Road in 1920 as 14th (London) Medium Brigade, RGA, soon being renumbered as 53rd (London) Medium Brigade, in the Territorial Army. The reformed brigade now had four batteries, having absorbed the pre-war III London Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, (numbered CCLXXXII, or 282 Brigade during the war), which had been founded as the 2nd Middlesex Artillery Volunteers in 1861. It served as 'Army Troops' in 47th (2nd London) Divisional Area with the following composition:Litchfield, pp. 151‚Äì2.Titles and Designations. * 209 (London) Battery * 210 (London) Battery (Howitzer) * 211 (London) Battery (Howitzer) * 212 (London) Battery (Howitzer) There were minor changes in designation, in 1924 when the RGA was absorbed by the Royal Artillery (RA), and in 1938 when RA brigades were redesignated as regiments. Just before the outbreak of war in 1939, 211 and 212 (London) Batteries were split off to form a duplicate regiment, numbered \\"64th Medium Regiment\\". World War II 53rd (London) Medium Regiment On the outbreak of war in September 1939, the regiment formed part of London District.British London District on 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesLondon District 1939 at British Military History53 Med Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Once again, orders to mobilise arrived during the regiment's annual summer camp. The regiment was to be included in the first contingent of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to go to France, so it returned to Offord Road for mobilisation. On the day war was declared (3 September), it moved to Kempton Park Racecourse, where drafts of reservists arrived to replace the men who were under-age or unfit for overseas service. It embarked on 2 October.Chronology at 53rd Regt website.BBC People's War =Dunkirk= The regiment formed part of II Corps of the BEF.Joslen, p. 462.Ellis, France & Flanders, Appendix III Corps 1940 at British Military History2 Corps at RA 39‚Äì45. The BEF was deployed along the Franco-Belgian border during the months of the Phoney War, but when the Germans attacked Belgium on 10 May 1940 it began a carefully planned advance to the line of the River Dyle. 53rd Medium Regiment was in position behind this line by 15 May, firing its first shots in support of 7th Guards Brigade.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. 3 . But the Germans had penetrated the French line on the River Meuse on the night of 12/13 May, and on 16 May the BEF began retiring to avoid being cut off. By 21 May, II Corps artillery, including 53rd Medium Regt, was in position to support the infantry dug in along the River Escaut and attempting to hold off the Germans.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. IV . However, because of pressure elsewhere, the Escaut line could not be held and the BEF continued its retreat to the Ypres‚ÄìComines Canal where it halted again. The 53rd Regiment reached Marcq on 26 May. By now, German troops had broken through to the coast to the south on 20 May, and the BEF was encircled. It began a withdrawal to the seaports. The British artillery put down harassing fire to delay the German forces following up, but ammunition was running short. On the night of 26 May the Corps Commander RA (CRA) ordered the 53rd to fire off as much ammunition as possible and then put its guns out of action. The regiment joined the retreat the following day.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. VIII .Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. IX . II Corps' flank was now threatened by the retreat and later surrender of Belgian forces and on 28 May the Germans reached the extreme left of the BEF's perimeter at Nieuwpoort. Brigadier Hon E.F. Lawson, the CRA of 48th (South Midland) Division was given the task of shoring up the perimeter. Lawson seized on the gunners of 53rd Medium Regiment who were marching that way. Fighting as infantry alongside other II Corps artillery and engineer units and some French detachments, they were the only troops available to defend the line. They endured heavy mortar and machine-gun fire, and the Germans established a bridgehead in Nieuwpoort, but the gunners repulsed all subsequent attacks that day until relieved by 4th Division. This prevented a German breakthrough to the beaches east of Dunkirk where General Headquarters was positioned and where the evacuation of the BEF (Operation Dynamo) was proceeding.Butler & Bradford, pp. 158‚Äì9.Bryant, pp. 144‚Äì5, 149.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. XIII . II Corps withdrew for evacuation on the night of 31 May/1 June, destroying and abandoning all its guns, transport and equipment.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. XV . =Home defence= For the next four years, 53 Medium Regiment served in Home Forces, initially in Southern Command to defend the British Isles,Southern Command at RA 39‚Äì45. later preparing for the liberation of Continental Europe as part of 4th Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) in I Corps.British Artillery in World War 2. =D-Day= In May 1944, the regiment was assigned to 21st Army Group for Operation Overlord. For D-Day itself, the Regimental HQ of 53 Medium Regiment was attached to 3rd Division in I Corps, assaulting Sword Beach, making it the leading medium artillery unit of Second Army.Joslen, p. 585. It supported 6th Airborne Division in the fighting on the Orne Canal. The regiment then served in 4th AGRA during the campaign in North West Europe.Joslen, p. 463.Ellis, Victory, Vol I, Appendix IV & Vol II, Appendix I. In the first week of December, single guns were being used to knock down windmills and church towers that might have been used as enemy observation posts. In late January 1945, the regiment fired in support of Operation Elephant, an attack to flatten out an enemy bridgehead across the River Maas. On 15 April, it supported 49th (West Riding) Division's attack on Arnhem. The regiment was in Germany on VE-day.53 Med Rgt at RA Netherlands 53rd Medium Regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. 64th (London) Medium Regiment 6-inch 26 cwt Howitzer on World War II pneumatic tyres at Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum This regiment (the 'London' was added to the title in 1942) was created in London District just before the outbreak of war from two batteries (211 and 212 (London)) of 53rd Medium Regiment. By July 1940, the regiment had been assigned to IV Corps, first at Tetbury, later at High Wycombe. Initially, it was equipped with iron-tyred 6-inch howitzers, but in August it re-equipped with the 4.5-inch Gun Mk I (relined 60-pounders on Carriage Mk4P) for 211 Bty, and 6-inch howitzers on Carriage Mk1P for 212 Bty. By the end of August, during the Battle of Britain, it was placed on aerodrome defence, with RHQ at Haddenham, Cambridgeshire, 211 Bty less B Trp at Herringswell, Suffolk, B Trp at Hardwick, Cambridgeshire, and 212 Bty at St Ives, Cambridgeshire. The regiment reassembled at High Wycombe at the end of September.64 Med Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 =Capture of Tobruk= Tobruk, 23 January 1941 In late 1940, the regiment sailed for Egypt, joining British Troops Egypt (BTE) in January 1941 before moving out into Libya as part of XIII Corps during the capture of Tobruk.Joslen, pp. 479, 484-5. =Greece= In March 1941, the 64th was one of two medium regiments sent to Greece with I Australian Corps as part of 'W Force' in Operation Lustre to support the Greek Army in the Greco-Italian War. Before it sailed, 64th Medium Rgt exchanged 212 Bty with 234 Bty from 68th (4th West Lancashire) Medium Rgt, so that the whole regiment was equipped with 4.5-inch guns. (212 (London) Bty served with 68 Medium Rgt in Eritrea.)Playfair, Vol II, p. 79. The Germans invaded Greece and Yugoslavia at dawn on 6 April, beginning the Battle of Greece. The Commonwealth commander, Lt-Gen Henry Maitland Wilson, had anticipated the German advance through Yugoslavia, and had placed a force to protect this dangerous flank. Known as the Amyntaion detachment, it included 64 Medium Regiment (less one Troop) alongside 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, 27th New Zealand Machine-Gun Battalion and 1st Australian Anti-Tank Regiment (less one battery), initially under the commander of the Corps medium artillery, Brig E.A. Lee.Playfair, p. 80. As the campaign developed, Wilson expanded the Amyntaion detachment to cover the Greek retreat: on 10 April it shelled the advancing Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Brigade.Playfair, p. 87. But within days 'Force W' was withdrawing to the Thermopylae position. The roads over the Pindus mountains were entrusted to Brig Stanley Savige of 17th Australian Infantry Brigade, whose 'Savige Force' included 64th Medium Regiment as well as New Zealand field guns and Australian anti-tank guns.Playfair, p. 90. On the night of 17/18 April Savige Force withdrew towards Larissa. Germans tanks appeared in front of the New Zealand rearguard at mid-day on 18 April, and were engaged for the rest of the day by a troop of 64th Medium Regiment.Playfair, p. 93. The decision to withdraw the Commonwealth forces was made on 21 April and evacuation was carried out over the following week. When ordered to evacuate, most of the regiment was taken off the beaches at Marathon by HMS Carlisle and landed at Suda Bay, Crete, but some were taken by other ships back to Egypt. The guns were lost. =Crete= On Crete, 234 (West Lancashire) Bty and A Trp of 211 (London) Bty were equipped with captured Italian 100 mm howitzers and 72 mm guns to defend Heraklion airfield. The rest of the regiment was stationed near Canea as infantry. The Germans launched an airborne attack on Crete on 20 May 1941, launching the Battle of Crete, and after fierce fighting the Commonwealth forces were once again forced to evacuate. The gun party of 64 Medium Rgt from Heraklion were evacuated on the night of 29/30 May, while the remainder marched over the mountains to Sphakia, where they were evacuated the following night. =Middle East= After the regiment had been evacuated to Egypt, 234 Bty rejoined 68 Medium Rgt. 212 (London) Bty, which had participated in the campaign in Eritrea, returned, and 64th Medium Rgt re-assembled in Syria under the command of I Australian Corps when it was re-equipped with 6-inch howitzers.Joslen, p. 482. In October, the regiment returned to Egypt, where it joined Eighth Army in December, with 211 Bty attached to 2nd South African Division during the capture of Bardia.Joslen, p. 486. =North Africa= 212 Battery firing 155mm Howitzers in North Africa 1942 In February 1942, the regiment was re-equipped with 16 French-built 155mm howitzers obtained from the US under Lend-Lease and its first two of the new Mk 2 4.5-inch guns.8th Army Medium Artillery stats at the Crusader Project. It was with X Corps in June 1942 and fought with the 2nd New Zealand Division at the Battle of Mersa Matruh, when the division was surrounded and had to break out. 211 Bty was reduced to five guns and 212 to four guns; the regiment lost over 250 men during the withdrawal. At Ruweisat Ridge, 211 Bty had received three new 4.5-inch guns, but 212 lost two more to air attack and was withdrawn to Cairo to refit, where it was issued with the new 5.5-inch gun. In August, 212 Bty was with 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division at the Battle of Alam Halfa 64th Medium Rgt was attached to XXX Corps for the Second Battle of El Alamein, by which time it had been fully re-equipped with eight 4.5-inch and eight 5.5-inch guns.Joslen, p. 574. During the pursuit after Alamein, 211 Bty operated with 2nd New Zealand Division during November, detaching B Trp to 4th Light Armoured Brigade. The regiment then fought its way across North Africa and into Tunisia under Eighth Army, including the Battle of the Mareth Line. By now, Eighth Army was forming its medium artillery into Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs). In Tunisia, 64th Medium Rgt joined 5th AGRA, and remained with this headquarters for the rest of the war apart from a short spell with 1st AGRA in May 1943. =Sicily= For the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, 5th AGRA supported 51st (Highland) Division, attacking towards the Gerbini airfields and Randazzo. At the close of the campaign, XXX Corps did not participate in the invasion of mainland Italy, but was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Overlord. 64th Medium Rgt handed over its heavy equipment and embarked on 9 November for Algeria, re-embarking on 29 November for the UK and landing at Liverpool on 9 December. =Normandy= When the Normandy landings took place in June 1944, there were only two batteries of 4.5-inch guns in 21st Army Group: 211 Bty of 64th Medium Rgt, and one battery of 7th Medium Rgt. The gun had a lighter shell but longer range than the 5.5-inch, and XXX Corps wanted both batteries landed first. 211 Battery was therefore exchanged with 25/26 Bty of 7th Medium for the assault phase, returning to 64th by 11 June.Ellis, Victory, Vol I, p. 542. As part of 5th AGRA, 64th Medium Rgt supported 21st Army Group throughout the Normandy campaign and the advance across Belgium.Ellis, Victory, Vol 1, Appendix IV & Vol II Appendix IV. =Arnhem= On 20 September 1944, the regiment was ordered to move up behind the advancing troops of XXX Corps, and the following day it assembled four miles south of Nijmegen. Here it picked up wireless transmissions from the RA of 1st Airborne Division, which was isolated at Arnhem with few working radios. The regiment responded to appeals for fire support with the 4.5-inch battery, firing at extreme range. The battery moved up about 4000 yards about midday to shorten the range, while a 155 mm battery was being hurried up the road and attached to 64 Medium Rgt about 16.00, while an officer was sent out with a relay wireless as far forward as possible. The following day the regiment engaged 31 targets for 1st Airborne, and the regiment's 5.5-inch battery, which had been supporting the advance of XXX Corps, was brought up and positioned with the 4.5s by first light on 23 September. A battery of 3.7 inch Heavy Anti-Aircraft guns and a further 4.5-inch battery came under command, but the road behind them had been cut, so ammunition supply became a problem, as 25 targets were engaged. By the night of 25 September, 1st Airborne could hold out no longer, and the remnants were evacuated across the Nederrijn under cover of a heavy barrage from 64 Medium Rgt and its attached guns.64 Med Rgt at RA NetherlandsSupport 1st Airborne at RA Netherlands. =Rhineland= 5.5-inch gun of 64 Med Rgt firing at Bremen, 24 April 1945. 64th Medium Rgt continued to support 21st Army Group as part of 5th AGRA until the end of the war in Europe. For example, it was part of XXX Corps' artillery concentration for the clearance of the Reichswald (Operation Veritable),Ellis, Victory, Vol II, pp. 256 & 269. After VE Day, the regiment handed in its guns and undertook occupation duties in Germany. 64th Medium Regiment was placed in suspended animation on 1 April 1946 and was formally disbanded in 1947. Postwar When the TA was reformed in 1947, 53 Medium Regiment was reconstituted at Islington as 353 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (London), and was adopted by the Borough of Islington.

Mizrahi Jews are descended from Jews in the Middle East and Central Asia, from Babylonian and Persian heritage, who had lived for many generations under Muslim rule during the Middle Ages. The vast majority of them left the Muslim-majority countries during the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, in what is known as the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. Some 607,900 Jews are immigrants and first-generation descendants by paternal lineage of Iraqi, Iranian, Yemenite, Egyptian, Pakistani and Indian Jewish communities, traditionally associated with the Mizrahi Jews. Many more Israeli Jews are second and third generation Mizrahi descendants or have a partial Mizrahi origin. The other dominant sub-groups are the Israeli Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardic Jews. Often Mizrahi and North African Sephardic Jews in Israel are grouped together due to the similarity of their history under Muslim rule and an overwhelming migration out of their countries of residence during the 20th century. As of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews were of full or partial Mizrahi ancestry.Jews, Arabs, and Arab Jews: The Politics of Identity and Reproduction in Israel, Ducker, Clare Louise, Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands History Post-1948 dispersal After the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, most Mizrahi Jews were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel. According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardic origin.Statistical Abstract of Israel, 2009, CBS. \\"Table 2.24 ‚Äì Jews, by country of origin and age\\" (PDF). Retrieved 22 March 2010. Anti-Jewish actions by Arab governments in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of the founding of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East. 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt left after the 1956 Suez Crisis, led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees and most went to Israel. Today, as many as 40,000 Mizrahim still remain in communities scattered throughout the non-Arab Muslim world, primarily in Iran, but also Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.The Jewish Population of the World, The Jewish Virtual Library Absorption into Israeli society Refuge in Israel was not without its tragedies: \\"in a generation or two, millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity,\\" had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat.Ella Shohat: \\"Sephardim in Israel: Zionism from the Standpoint of its Jewish Victims,‚Äù Social Text, No.19/20 (1988), p.32 The trauma of rupture from their countries of origin was further complicated by the difficulty of the transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (Ma'abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in Moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships. Mizrahi immigrants arrived with many mother tongues. Many, especially those from North Africa and the fertile crescent, spoke Arabic dialects; those from Iran spoke Persian; Mountain Jews from Azerbaijan arrived with Azerbaijani; Baghdadi Jews from India arrived with English; Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan arrived with Bukhari; the Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India arrived with Marathi, Mizrahim from elsewhere brought Georgian, Judaeo-Georgian, Juhuri and various other languages with them. Hebrew had historically been a language only of prayer for most Jews not living in Israel, including the Mizrahim. Thus, with their arrival in Israel, the Mizrahim retained culture, customs and language distinct from their Ashkenazi counterparts. =Disparities and integration= The cultural differences between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews impacted the degree and rate of assimilation into Israeli society, and sometimes the divide between Eastern European and Middle Eastern Jews was quite sharp. Segregation, especially in the area of housing, limited integration possibilities over the years. Intermarriage between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim is increasingly common in Israel and by the late 1990s 28% of all Israeli children had multi-ethnic parents (up from 14% in the 1950s).Barbara S. Okun, Orna Khait-Marelly. 2006. Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Behavior of Adult Multiethnics: Jews in Israel. It has been claimed that intermarriage does not tend to decrease ethnic differences in socio-economic status, however that does not apply to the children of inter-ethnic marriages. Although social integration is constantly improving, disparities persist. A study conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), Mizrahi Jews are less likely to pursue academic studies than Ashkenazi Jews. Israeli- born Ashkenazim are up to twice more likely to study in a university than Israeli-born Mizrahim.http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/educ_demog_05/pdf/t16.pdf Furthermore, the percentage of Mizrahim who seek a university education remains low compared to second-generation immigrant groups of Ashkenazi origin, such as Russians.Adva Center The average income of Ashkenazim was 36 percent higher than that of Mizrahim in 2004.Hebrew PDF Notable people * Aryeh Bibi ‚Äì politician, Iraqi Jewish member of Knesset for Kadima.

The film is based on real events and tells of the rise to fame of the Soviet hockey player Valeri Kharlamov and about the first match of the Summit Series USSR ‚Äî Canada 1972.–°—É–ø–µ—Ä—Å–µ—Ä–∏—è –°–°–°–† ‚Äî –ö–∞–Ω–∞–¥–∞ 1972 –≥–æ–¥–∞ The film was awarded with six Golden Eagle awards, including the best Russian film of the year. The filmmakers received the State Prize of the Russian Federation for the year 2013 in 2014. Plot The picture begins set in 1956 with children's experiences during the Running of the Bulls in Spain where Kharlamov's mother originally was from. Then the action is transferred to Moscow in 1967, where the young hockey player gets acquainted with the famous trainer Anatoli Tarasov, who sends Valeri along with his friend Alexander Gusev to the city of Chebarkul, Chelyabinsk Oblast, where they will play for the local \\"Zvezda\\" team. Having overcome the difficulties of adaptation in the lower league team, Valeri displays effective hockey skills and returns to Moscow at the end of the season where Tarasov invites him to join HC CSKA Moscow, but at first Anatoli tests Kharlamov's character and his ability to dedicate his life to hockey. Kharlamov passes all of Tarasov's trials and gradually becomes one of the leading attackers of CSKA, and then the USSR national team. The trainer constructs an attack trio of Mikhailov-Petrov-Kharlamov. At the same time intrigues are waged around Tarasov by the curator of hockey from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Eduard Balashov, whose son the coach once expelled from the team. Balashov tries to drag Kharlamov to his side, stressing Tarasov's excessive rigidity, but the hockey player refuses to sign any papers against his coach (Kharlamov later tells Tarasov everything but Anatoli responds that he already knew everything). Against the background of the development of Kharlamov's hockey career, the story of his acquaintance and love with Irina Smirnova is shown, who tries to support the hockey player in difficult moments. After the scandalous match between the USSR national team and HC Spartak Moscow, when Tarasov led the team away from the ice in a protest against refereeing, the upset Kharlamov gets into a car accident and seriously injures his leg (in the film this biographical episode of the hockey player was shifted to be four years earlier). After the operation Valeri begins to exercise his leg in order to return to the ice as soon as possible since the first Summit Series in history between the USSR national team and the Canadian professionals is scheduled for 1972. Overcoming his injuries Kharlamov begins to train, and the new coach of the national team Vsevolod Bobrov, appointed instead of Tarasov, includes Valeri in the team that flies to play in Canada. Tarasov comes to escort the team to the airport and says parting words to Kharlamov. The Soviet hockey players arrive in Montreal. The Canadians are confident in the victory of their team and are trying in every possible way to prove this to the USSR: at a press conference a Canadian journalist says that he will eat the evening edition of his newspaper if the Soviet team wins, and on a television show two leaders of the Canadian national team, Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke, hint that the Soviet team has no chance of victory. In conclusion, before the match a newspaper is slid under the door of Bobrov's room with a caricature depicting the Soviet hockey players as \\"snotty\\" pupils who learn to play hockey with the Canadian \\"teacher\\". The match begins. The Canadians win the first face-off and in half a minute open the score. At the sixth minute the score is 2:0. But soon the USSR team makes the score even, and in the second period, Kharlamov leads the team ahead 2:3. Valeri stickhandles through several opponents and scores his second goal. After this goal all spectators give a standing ovation to Kharlamov. During the intermission, the Canadian coach tells his players that this is not a match, but a war, and instructed Bobby Clarke to deal with the \\"Number Seventeen\\". During the game Bobby Clarke slashes Kharlamov's previously injured knee with a stick. However, Valeri refuses to leave the game despite danger of aggravating his injury and ending his hockey career, and returns to the ice. At the end of the match, Valeri rushes with the puck towards the Canadians' goal, aggravates his injury and falls down, but while sliding in prone position, passes the puck to one of this teammates who scores the seventh goal for the Soviet team. After the match Phil Esposito tells Kharlamov that he is impressed by his game, speed, and the two goals. The USSR squad scores several more goals with Kharlamov's active participation and wins with a crushing score 7:3.

Reception The film received approval and high ratings from the overwhelming majority of Russian critics and publications about cinema: from 55 reviews on it 47 were positive and only 6 negative. \\"Legend ‚Ññ 17\\" was praised by the magazines Empire, Afisha, the newspaper Trud, sites ru.IGN, Colta, Gazeta.ru. Among the few reviewers who sharply condemned the film, was Andrei Bodrov in the newspaper Sovetsky Sport. Valeri Kharlamov's best friend, Alexander Nikolaevich Maltsev disapproved of the film and said that he does not intend on seeing it. Film critic Elena Stishova wrote that \\"Adrenaline is the key word for Nikolai Lebedev's picture\\" and notes that \\"The success of 'Legend' ... \\"strongly tests the spiritual deficiencies of the \\"silent majority\\". There is a need for a hero who is \\"one of us\\", for the \\"life affirming\\" story, for the happy end not in a glossy Hollywood style - but in the society's sense: when everything is fair\\". The picture took 97th place in the list of 100 major Russian films according to the magazine \\"Afisha\\".

Background Tomlinson was born in Hampton in Calhoun County in southern Arkansas, one of five children of Carl Jackson Tomlinson (1901-1974) and the former Myrtle May Wilson (1906‚Äì1986). Because of a devastating flood, the Tomlinsons moved southwest by 1941 to Minden, Louisiana. When his older brother, Willie C. \\"Bill\\" Tomlinson (1926‚Äì2004), entered the United States Navy and left behind his guitar, Gerald soon mastered playing the instrument. In 1951, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War and was wounded in both legs during his three years of service. It was in the military that his fellow Marines gave him the nickname \\"Tommy\\", a shortened form of \\"Tomlinson\\". Career Even before he went into the Marines, Tomlinson had worked sporadically in music, for a time with Hank Williams, who died in 1953, when Tomlinson was still in the military. After his military years, Tomlinson began playing his Gretsch guitar in 1954 as back-up for musicians of the Louisiana Hayride, sponsored by KWKH radio in Shreveport. He joined Johnny Horton with such hits as \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\" and \\"North to Alaska\\". On May 31, 1959, Tomlinson, Horton, and Tillman Franks of Shreveport, dressed in frontier clothing, performed \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\" on CBS's The Ed Sullivan Show. He was a songwriter for Johnny Horton (\\"You're My Baby\\") and for Dolly Parton and Norma Jean (Heaven's Just A Prayer Away\\"). When Horton took a break on stage, Tomlinson often played such selections as \\"Wildwood Flower\\" and \\"Honky Tonk\\". In 1962, he worked with Claude King who was climbing the charts with \\"Wolverton Mountain\\" and, in August 1963, he backed David Houston, who also lived for a time in Minden, Louisiana, with \\"Mountain of Love\\". Prior to the 1960 accident, Tomlinson had returned from Nashville, Tennessee, where he had taped four instrumental albums for Mercury Records with Jerry Kennedy of Shreveport. The albums titled \\"Tom & Jerry\\", cover all genres of music, also included Hank Garland, Boots Randolph, Bob Moore, and Harold Bradley. The songs on the albums include \\"Sugar-Foot Rag\\", \\"Raunchy\\", \\"My Blue Heaven,\\" and \\"Unchain My Heart\\". The first single from the album, released in August 1961, was \\"Wildwood Flower\\". In the car wreck, Johnny Horton was killed while Tomlinson sustained multiple leg fractures and was unable to work. A benefit to raise funds on his behalf was held in December 1960, with Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash taking the lead. Coincidentally, the Tomlinson farm in Hampton was near that of the Cash family between Kingsland and Tinsman, Arkansas. Whereas the Tomlinsons moved to Minden, the Cashes relocated to Dyess in Mississippi County in eastern Arkansas. Death In 1962, eighteen months after the accident, despite various hospital procedures, Tomlinson lost his left leg. He died in Shreveport of heart failure twenty years later in the spring of 1982 at the age of fifty-one. Still active, he had performed with his band, the Country Connection, the night before his death. On April 27, 1967, Tomlinson married the former Katherine Seward (born 1931) in Harrison County in East Texas, thirty-five days after the birth of his youngest child, Thomas Tillman Tomlinson (born March 23, 1967), who resides in Shreveport. At the time of his death in 1982, Tomlinson had in addition to Thomas Tillman four other living children, Del Marie, Jackie, Donna, and Doug. He had a younger brother, Houston E. Tomlinson (1933‚Äì1996), who served in the United States Army during the Korean War. Along with their parents, Tommy and Houston Tomlinson are interred at Gardens of Memory Cemetery in Minden. Brother Bill Tomlinson is interred at Lane Memorial Cemetery in Sibley in south Webster Parish.

In 1874 Koch and his colleague August Hermann organized what is believed to be the first-ever football match in Germany, between pupils from their school Martino-Katharineum. However, according to other sources, earlier games of football might have taken place in other German cities, possibly between members of the Dresden English Football Club. In 1875, Koch published the first German version of the rules of football, although Koch's version of the game still closely resembled rugby football. The new game was quickly adopted by other schools in Braunschweig and spread to other cities during the late 1870s, including Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg, and G√∂ttingen.Hoffmeister (2011). p. 57. In 1876, a newspaper in Hamburg wrote that Koch had learned about football during a trip to England. This is likely false, as there are no sources that indicate that he had visited England before 1895.Hoffmeister (2011). pp. 80‚Äì81. Koch did speak English, however, as he had been taught from a young age by his father, an English teacher. Personal life Koch was a close friend of novelist Wilhelm Raabe, and like Raabe, C.F.

S. acidocaldarius was the first Sulfolobus species to be described, in 1972 by Thomas D. Brock and collaborators. This species was found to grow optimally between 75 and 80 ¬∞C, with pH optimum in the range of 2-3. Isolation S. acidocaldarius was first isolated from thermal soils and hot springs with low pH in the United States of America (specifically in the Yellowstone National Park), in El Salvador, Dominica and Italy. The springs where this species was isolated had a pH less than 3 and temperatures in the range of 65-90 ¬∞C. Morphological Description S. acidocaldarius is, as all Archaea, unicellular. Cells belonging to this species are spherical, albeit irregular, and usually possess lobes. The diameter of the cells fall in the range of 0.8-1 Œºm, with little size variation. Cell Replication S. acidocaldarius possess a mechanism of replication homologous to the eukaryotic ESCRT. Metabolism S. acidocaldarius is a facultative autotroph. When growing autotrophically this organism oxidises sulfur to sulfate, while fixating carbon from carbon dioxide. The doubling time of cultures growing on sulfur alone falls between 36.8-55.3h. This species can also grow on complex organic substrates. When growing on 0.1% yeast extract the growth is faster, and the doubling times are between 6.5 and 8h. Genome In 2005 the complete genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain DSM639 was published. The genome of this crenarchaeon is composed of a single circular chromosome with 2,225,959 bp, with a G+C content of 36.7%. The authors predicted 2292 protein-coding genes. The genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is very stable, with little, if any, rearrangements due to mobile elements. The authors found the genes necessary for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, as well as for all amino acids except for selenocysteine. Genes for glucose metabolism suggest the existence of two alternative pathways. This Sulfolobus species grows on a more limited range of carbon sources, relative to other Sulfolobus species, and this might be due to the lack of adequate transporters. The ups operon UV-irradiation increases the frequency of recombination due to genetic exchange in S. acidocaldarius. The ups operon of Sulfolobus species is highly induced by UV irradiation. The pili encoded by this operon are employed in promoting cellular aggregation, which is necessary for subsequent DNA exchange between cells, resulting in homologous recombination. A study of the Sulfolobales acidocaldarius ups operon showed that one of the genes of the operon, saci-1497, encodes an endonuclease III that nicks UV-damaged DNA; and another gene of the operon, saci-1500, encodes a RecQ-like helicase that is able to unwind homologous recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions. It was proposed that Saci-1497 and Saci-1500 function in an homologous recombination-based DNA repair mechanism that uses transferred DNA as a template. Thus it is thought that the ups system in combination with homologous recombination provide a DNA damage response which rescues Sulfolobales from DNA damaging threats. Significance The thermostable restriction enzyme SuaI is obtained from this organism.

The village is located about north of Al-Shahaniya City and the same distance south of Al Jemailiya. It is connected to both places by road. It used to be part of the Al Jemailiya municipality before the municipality was incorporated into Al Rayyan. In 2014, the village was incorporated into the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality. Etymology Al Utouriya's name is derived from the Arabic word atar, which translates to 'perfume' or 'aroma'. It was given this name due to the scent emanating from a nearby rawdat (depression) which hosts a number of aromatic herbs. Various alternative transliterations of the name exist, such as Al \`A≈£≈´rƒ´yah, Al Atoriya, Al AthƒÅrƒ´yah, Latariyah, and Leatooriya. History Main road to Al Utouriya Settlers first came to the region in the 1960s, despite being cut off from many essential services. In the 1980s, the village was connected to Qatar's power grid system. Mixed-use farms comprise the livelihood of some residents, while others commute to the capital Doha and elsewhere for work. As a result of poor living conditions, many of the original residents have migrated to Doha. In 2016, it was estimated that around 500 inhabitants occupied the village, with an overall 47 homes being recorded, all of which are resided in by more than one family. Infrastructure The village is primarily rural community centered on agriculture. No health care or educational facilities were recorded in the 2010 census. The village also lacks parks, schools, supermarkets and gas stations. For public services and food items, most residents travel to Al Jemailiya. Agriculture An experimental farm was established here by the government in the early 1980s in an initiative to boost food self-sufficiency. The farm's greenhouses successfully extended the growing season of cucumbers, resulting in a yield of 140 kg in 1982, and a pursuance to build similar greenhouses elsewhere in the country. There is a large government-owned plant nursery in the village which covers 2,500 sq meters. Plants from the nursery are used in research and also distributed to government ministries. It was established in 2003. Numerous privately-owned farms have also been established in the area, most of which are mixed-use and grow fodder crops in addition to raising livestock.

In his first term in office, he was a member of the Christian Historical Union, which he left because the party would not support the left-leaning Den Uyl cabinet; in his second term, he sat as an independent member under his own banner of Groep- Huijsen. As a member of the House of Representatives in 1976, Huijsen came out as gay, making him the country's first openly LGBT politician and the first known openly gay member of a national legislature in the world.\\"Harvey Milk's legacy\\". Washington Post, May 21, 2014. In 2016, Huijsen published an autobiographical account of his coming-out, in the context of a changing Dutch society in the 1970s: *Homo Politicus. De eerste parlementari√´r ter wereld die uit de kast kwam (\\"Homo Politicus. The First MP Worldwide Who Came Out of the Closet\\" - autobiography) In this book, Huijsen describes how he participated in the Dutch gay rights movement in the years after his coming-out, when he co-founded the Foundation for Free Relationship Rights (Stichting Vrije Relatierechten). The goal of this foundation was to make the gay community address the larger public and the political establishment, by appealing to their sense of humanity. Gay rights were human rights, and, as such, were to be put on the political agenda. It paved the way to legal equality for same- sex relationships, and, finally, in the introduction of same-sex marriage in the Netherlands (2001). After leaving parliament, Huijsen worked as a school teacher and director. He also switched parties again, becoming a member of the Dutch Labour Party in which he was active until 2000; he left that party because he found the party put too little work into education and gay emancipation. He then pursued a career as a historian, with a specific interest in the cultural-historical context of democracy. His first book, Nog is links niet verloren (\\"The left is not yet lost\\"; 1982) described the widening gap between the elites of progressive political parties and their popular, traditional base. Later, Huijsen wrote multiple books about the relations between the Dutch national narrative and the royal dynasty, the House of Orange, including: *De oranjemythe, een postmodern fenomeen (\\"The Orange Myth, a postmodern phenomenon\\"), *Beatrix: De kroon op de republiek (\\"Beatrix, crown on the republic\\"; 2005) and *Nederland en het verhaal van Oranje (\\"The Netherlands and the story of Orange\\"; originally a PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 2012).

He was raised in considerable poverty and which led him to become a Communist. He was arrested by the Nazis in 1939 due to his membership in Communist Party. He was initially imprisoned in Dachau and then in Buchenwald. The Germans started to destroy the concentration camps in Eastern Europe as Red Army advanced. The remaining prisoners were sent on death marches to other camps farther west. Some of them reached Buchenwald where Kalina was imprisoned. Around 100,000 people came to Buchenwald in 1944-1945.

Kalina used his position in the camp's resistance to become an elder of Block 66, which people started to call the Kinderblock (children's block). Kalina, his deputy Gustav Schiller and other co-workers started to locate the boys to the Bloc. They tried to make their stay in the camp less uncomfortable. They managed to spare the younger children the hard work and physical abuse routine in the camp. Kalina also managed to get them better blankets and, sometimes, additional food. He also organised lessons for them. When the front approached the camp, all Jews were ordered to convene but Kalina falsified the documents of the Jewish boys and hid their Yellow badges. When SS men came for the prisoners, Kalina persuaded them that there were no Jews in the Block. Kalina returned to Czechoslovakia after the war. He lived and worked in Prague. He was not recognised during his lifetime as he never talked about his actions during the war and boys he had saved did not like to talk about their experiences. Kalina died in Prague on January 1, 1990. Legacy Kalina was recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations on June 3, 2012 due to the efforts of some of \\"Kalina's Children\\", the American Historian Kenneth Waltzer and the release of the document Kinderblock 66: Return to Buchenwald that told story of Kalina and the boys he had saved.

Life Rosa Lie Johansson was born in Gothenburg, Sweden at an unknown date. She first studied painting in her hometown in the 1940s with government support. In 1952, she continued her art studies at the Academie Belle Arti under Ferruccio Ferrazzi, an Italian painter and sculptor. Johansson spent much of her life traveling. In 1951, she moved to Italy and traveled in the region, until late in 1952, when she moved to New York. There she joined the Art Students League, collaborating with Will Barnet, known for his graphic work and mural collaboration with Jos√© Clemente Orozco. She remained in New York until 1951, when she moved to Mexico, first living in San Miguel Allende, traveling around states such as Guanajuato and Michoac√°n to study the architecture and culture of central Mexico. During this, economic policy in Mexico allowed Swedish businesspeople to invest in Mexico. A small Swedish community formed in the Colonia Anzures neighborhood of Mexico City. Johansson moved here to find economic and moral support, moving to Mexico's capital, but living alone in her own apartment, with only the company of her cat, Cassandra. She continued to travel in Mexico for much of her life, often in the company of her close friend Alma Reed. She also toured Indonesia in 1969, attracted by its color and mysticism. Johansson eventually identified as Mexican, dressing in Mexican traditional garb, with a particular affinity for Mayan culture, past and present. Career Her first major collective exhibition was also government-sponsored in 1949 at the Konsthalen. During her career, Johansson had over 200 exhibitions of her work in museums and galleries Mexico, Sweden, Italy, India, Indonesia and Colombia, in cities such as Delhi, Washington, New York and Bogota. Her more important venues includes the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1958) and the Museo Nacional in Bogota, Colombia (1968). She exhibited in various parts of Mexico, in venues such as the Juarez Museum of Art in 1976, and represented Sweden at the Selected Works of World Art exhibit at the Museo de Arte Moderno, part of the 1968 Olympics. Her last exhibition while alive was called Acuario, held at the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana in 2001. She was inducted into the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana in 1962, with the individual exhibition called Vista de Estudio. Artistry Rosa Lie was noted for her careful preparatory work, planning the composition of her paintings, both of elements and of spaces, through drawing and other techniques. Her works are primarily in oils on canvas with some in gouache and ink on amate paper and commercial paper, in medium and large formats. However, she did create small-scale works on amate paper, usually as gifts. Her images are figurative with influences from the Expressionist and Cubist movements, although elements of abstract art appear. The New York Times described her work as ‚Äú‚Ä¶ subtly primitive with reminiscences of Gaugin and the flavor of Nordic motifs.‚Äù Her images are often drawn from mythological and metaphysical allegory along with urban landscapes. Details from Mexico‚Äôs pre Hispanic and colonial past also appear, becoming relatively dominant but traces of Nordic designs can still be found. After a trip to Indonesia, elements from this culture also appeared in her works. Her later works incorporated warmer colors, such as yellow and red.

He was primarily involved in the mining industry in New Mexico and Arizona, as well as shipping and supplies in support of that industry.  Biography  Zeckendorf was born in Hanover, Germany on April 6, 1838. After growing up in Hanover, in 1854 he immigrated to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to join his brother Aaron, with his younger brother William joining them a year later. Louis and Aaron became members of the historical society, with Aaron being a charter member. They founded their first store with financial support from the Spiegelbergs, their former employers. Under the banner of A. & L. Zeckendorf, Wholesale and Retail, Aaron opened a Sante Fe branch, and Louis opened one in Albuquerque (an additional branch was opened in Deming, and stores near mining camps along the Rio Mimbres). The store was moderately successful; but suffered a downturn in business at the start of the Civil War. When the South invaded New Mexico, their businesses suffered heavy taxes, as they were loyal to the Union, and their brother William was an officer in the Union army. Their success was renewed when the southern troops were driven out of New Mexico. In 1865, heavy snow in the Raton Mountains caused them to lose a large amount of dry goods. In 1866, Louis sold $50,000 worth of goods to Charles T. Hayden. Upon improved business prospects, he went to New York City, and established a purchasing branch of the company in 1867. The brothers hired their nephew, Albert Steinfeld in 1872 After his older brother Aaron died in 1872, Louis sold his share of the business to William and a brother in law, Theodore Welisch. The partnership soon failed, and Louis reluctantly partnered with his younger brother, William, to form Zeckendorf brothers. When Louis bought William's share of the business in 1878, he reformed the business with his nephew, Albert Steinfeld to create L. Zeckendorf & Company. By 1889, their Tucson business was the largest retail and wholesale merchandising business in the Arizona Territory. He sold furniture to the Santa Rita Hotel.Arizona Daily Star, Santa Rita Hotel Opens to the Public, Feb 2, 1904 At its peak, the company had $1.5 million in annual revenue (about million dollars in ). Louis was also one of the founding members of the Copper Queen Mining Company. He gained the rights to freighting supplies and equipment into Mule Gulch, and the rights to shipping ore and bullion westward. In addition, Louis was the first treasurer of the company and also served as a secretary and manager. Louis also invested in the Ray mine, heavily in silver and gold mining in Monatana and the Silver Bell mine. Around 1872, William's wife, Julia Zeckendorf had become owner of the Old Boot mine. William asked his nephew to become a trustee of the mine, and he agreed. In 1897, he leased the mine to Carl S. Nielsen. Nielsen was allowed to mine and smelt ore, providing he bought supplies from L. Zeckendorf and Co., and paid a royalty of $1.25 a ton. After six months, Nielsen was $16,000 in debt. On January 14, 1899 a subsidiary of L Zeckendorf and Co, Nielsen Mining & Smelting Corporation was founded to manage the Old Boot mine. James Curtis was appointed to oversee the operation. The endeavor quickly lead to a rift in the relationship between Louis and Albert, and in November of 1902, Louis announced his intention to leave the partnership in May 1903. In April, the Imperial Copper Company of Arizona agreed to buy the mine for about $515,000 (roughly million dollars in ). Louis filed suit over money he believed had been defrauded from him, and the subsequent lawsuit eventually made its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, first in the 1912 term and again in the 1915 term, with the Court ultimately deciding in Louis' favor. Louis' involvement in the company ended in 1904, When Albert bought his share of the company. At the end of Zeckendorf's involvement in the company, The Tucson Citizen wrote that \\"the great name of L. Zeckendorf & Co. is no more.\\" For thirty-five years, it had been \\"synonymous with enterprise, business sagacity and sterling integrity throughout the commercial world of Arizona and Northern Sonora, Mexico.\\" He married Matilda Z.

While still a student, Gering began selling art out of her home in Oyster Bay, Long Island. In 1988, she moved to Manhattan and began organizing exhibitions in her West Village townhouse. This period was notable for introducing long-lasting relationships with artists Dove Bradshaw and William Anastasi, as well as the architect Simon Ungers.  Career  Gering opened her first gallery in 1991 on Broome Street in Soho. She held exhibitions there by conceptual artists Janine Antoni, Orlan, Xavier Veilhan, Jose Antonio Hernandez-Diez and George Condo. In 2001, she relocated to New York‚Äôs Chelsea neighborhood, adding a new focus on technology and diverse media artists John F.

From 2006 to 2013, Gering partnered with the Madrid gallerist Javier Lopez, expanding and relocating the gallery to the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, its large exhibition space designed by the architect Joel Sanders. Gering & Lopez Gallery added pop-influenced artists and exhibitions during this period, including KAWS, Ryan McGinness, Peter Halley, David Levinthal, Michael Bevilacqua and Todd James. Sandra Gering Inc. is currently located at 14 East 63rd Street in Manhattan‚Äôs Upper East Side. Gering has positioned herself as both a gallery and a launching pad for national and international projects.

The modernist villa was designed and built by Gray and Jean Badovici between 1926 and 1929. Gray - a pioneer of the modern architecture movement - combined built-in furniture and specific spatial planning to engage the user with the building and site, incorporating the sun and the sea into the house. Arriving at the site in 1998, Gering found the house in a state of disrepair after years of neglect and vandalism. With Gering's help, the house was purchased by the Conservatoire du littoral, a coastal conservancy agency, and subsequently classified as a French National Cultural Monument in 2000, which insures its survival and recognition as an important site in the world of architecture and design. Friends of E.1027 has earned not-for-profit status as a sponsored project of the New York Foundation for the Arts, and continues to work with the French government and the township of Roquebrune-Cap Martin. Friends of E.1027 will open to the public 2015 as The Eileen Gray Museum, and has a long-term goal of creating a study center and travel grant for architecture and design students.

Life Kathleen Fox was born in Glenageary, County Dublin, on 12 September 1880. Her father was Captain Henry Charles Fox of the King's Dragoon Guards and her mother was Mary Rebecca Colclough. Fox attended the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, studying under William Orpen. Owing to her talent, she also worked as Orpen's assistant. Whilst in London, Fox met British army Lieutenant Cyril Pym, marrying him in 1917. Pym was killed in action in 1918, and Fox gave birth to their daughter later that year. She inherited the family home, Brookfield, Richmond Avenue South, Milltown, Co. Dublin moving there in 1947, dying there on 17 August 1963. Early artistic work Fox studied enamelling under Oswald Reeves. She created an enamelled cup entitled Going to the feast for which she won a gold medal in a 1908 British competition. The cup was later exhibited with the other prizewinners at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and at the 1924 Tailteann Games exhibition in Dublin. In 1909, Fox was awarded a national prize for Music, an enamelled copper plaque. Whilst working under Alfred E. Child she worked in stained glass. Her 1909 window depicting St. Tobias is part of a family memorial in St. Joseph's church, Glenageary. Fox was working during a period of the Celtic Revival, which had a distinct emphasis on craft- work and drew inspiration from medieval and Celtic design. Child also exposed her to the arts and crafts movement, and some of her pieces such as Shaving mirror with pendant on stand (1910) shows a familiarity with the art nouveau style. Fox spent some time in London and Paris before the outbreak of World War I. During the events of the 1916 Easter Rising, she traveled to Dublin to paint the events there. This earned her the nickname \\"little rebel\\" by the students of the Dublin Metropolitan School while she worked as an assistant to Orpen. One of her best known pieces of this period was the surrender of Constance Markievicz, The arrest 1916, the Royal College of Surgeons, which is now in The Niland Collection in The Model, Sligo. At this time Fox painted a portrait of her friend Grace Gifford. From 1911 to 1923 and 1944 to 1957, Fox exhibited 81 with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA). One submission in 1911 was Science and Power and depicted her friend, sculptor Albert Power, working on Science for the new College of Science, Merrion St. She later donated a version of this piece to the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin. Later artistic work Fox focused on oil painting in the 1920s, establishing herself as a portrait painter. Her portrait of Lady Rosamund Gallwey-Robertson from 1921 was received very favourably when it was shown alongside works of Orpen and John Lavery at the National Portrait Society exhibition in London. Fox exhibited a portrait of Archbishop Mannix in the same year at the Royal Academy. Her work was shown in London at the New English Art Club, the Society of Women Artists, and the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Pieces were occasionally exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. One of Fox's enamel plaques was featured in an exhibition of Irish art in Brussels in 1930. Some of her paintings were also exhibited at Oireachtas exhibitions in Dublin. Fox became known for her paintings of interiors and flowers in the 1940s and 1950s, examples of which were exhibited at the Dawson gallery in 1946. In the early 1950s she created the stations of the Cross for the Jesuit House of Studies, Milltown Park, Dublin in oils. Her work was included in the exhibition of contemporary Irish art at Aberystwyth, Wales in 1953. Fox worked in numerous materials over the course of her career including painted china, wood carving, silver working, and costume design.

The film centers on the political life of Senator Bola Tinubu, the former Lagos State Governor and the National leader of the All Progressives Congress. It was first aired on March 1, 2015, but then stopped from further airing on March 6, 2015, following a N150 billion libel suit filled by Tinubu against AIT. Controversies and criticisms The airing of the documentary film on March 1, 2015, generated several controversies, leading to a N150 billion libel suit against AIT by Chief Bola Tinubu. The hour-long documentary film revealed the personal life of the former governor, showing him participating in a certain level of corruption during and after his tenure in office as governor of Lagos State. It revealed properties and companies owned by the Senator across Lagos State, describing him as ‚ÄúNigeria‚Äôs biggest landlord‚Äù. The film also revealed that he was charged for drug trafficking in 1993 by the United States Government. The film's release was described by critics as an attempt to tarnish Tinubu's image as a leader of a ruling party, the All Progressives Congress. Abimbola Adelakun, a Nigerian writer and columnist of The Punch newspaper, strongly criticized the film's release in her publications on March 5, 2015, describing the airing of the film as \\"libelous and defamatory\\", accusing the People's Democratic Party of being an accomplice. In the same vein, a Nigerian lawmaker, Hon. Michael Opeyemi Bamidele, in an article entitled ‚ÄúMy hatred for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu‚Äù, criticized the documentary film and the opposition party's role in its release. Law suit On March 6, 2015, Bola Tinubu instituted a N150 billion suit against AIT on alleged defamation of character. Bola Tinubu claimed that the documentary film was politically sponsored in order to tarnish his reputation as a Nigerian politician. Justice Akinkugbe of the High Court of Lagos State presided over the case. On April 1, 2015, the court restrained the AIT from further airing of the controversial documentary pending the outcome of the suit. AIT, in a counter claim made through its chairman, Raymond Dokpesi, speaking under oath, refuted the claim by the Senator, saying that the film was not designed to attack his personality or aired out of malice. He emphasized that the broadcasting station was empowered and entrusted by Section 22 of the Constitution of Nigeria to hold those in government accountable and responsible to Nigerians. He further stressed that the content of the film were facts which had been in the public domain for over twenty years and were independently published prior to the airing of the documentary, and had remained unchallenged. The parties in the suit subsequently entered terms of settlement and amicably resolved the suit without proceeding to trial.

In 2001, Kilzie established the first independent industry-specific information agency RCC (Russian Chemical Consulting) GmbH, which has become one of the most authoritative corporate information portals in Russia in the area. In 2002, CREON Group was founded and Kilzie supervised the process of elaboration and estimation of the business plans, worked on technical and economical grounds of investment projects, conducted condition researches and prospects of development of separate oil and gas chemical companies and enterprises, and estimated the commercial potential of new technologies and products (ethylene, propylene, associated petroleum gas, liquefied hydro carbonic gas, liquefied natural gas). In 2012 Kilzie took charge of CREON Energy, which has been the official adviser of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation throughout several years, in particular in the classification of questions regarding liquefied hydro carbonic gas, which is considered to be the basis for customs-tariff regulation.Mayor is againstincreaseofexporttaxesforliquefied hydrocarbon gases till 2017‚Äî2018 // Tass. 16.12.2013 At the same 2012, a unique company entered the market - OJSC INVENTRA, focusing on consultancy services exclusively for polymers industry and the related produced products. And 2017 saw the rise of the company CREON Chemicals specializing in agro chemistry and special chemistry. In 2016, Kilzie took the lead in the establishment of a direct investment fund, CREON Energy Fund SICAV-SIF, focused on investments in the chemicals sector in the Russian Federation. The estimated overall amount of fund investments exceeds ‚Ç¨100mln. The Fund is investing in the projects at their initial stage, in growing and expanding Russian and CIS companies, as well as in eco-projects of 'green' economy and alternative energy. The managing company and the unlimited partner is CREON Capital S.a.r.l. with the head office located in Luxembourg. The partners of CREON Capital are Caceis Bank Luxembourg S.A., Ernst & Young S.A., Arendt & Medernach S.A. Kilzie speaks fluent Russian, English, German, Arabic and Spanish. He is married and has five children.  Professional experience  As the head of CREON Group, Kilzie took part in management of some projects. Thus, since 2014 CREON Group has acted as the adviser and the operator of the civil-engineering design of methanol manufacturing factory Methanol Serverny which is implemented by NGSK company in Ust-Luga (Leningrad region), and is responsible for full-scale project realization.Ust-Luga will accept double methanol // Kommersant. 13.10.2014 Moreover, after several years of cooperation, CREON Group developed a separate Gazprom Eastern Gas Program including a Feasibility Study (FS), offers on production technologies selection and evaluation of licensed extraction facilities. One of the most important factors of this program was an increase in helium production, based on the hypothesis that the development of Chayadinsk and Kovyktinsk extraction facilities might change dramatically the situation on the world gas market. Moreover, the estimation of the Vladivostok LNG was conducted ‚Äì the liquefied natural gas manufacturing factory (LNG) with the capacity of at least 15 mln tonnes per year. Within the frames of work on the KazAzot project (unique producer of ammonia and ammonium nitrate in the Republic of Kazakhstan) the efforts of the Group's consultants were focused on execution of a full technical and technological company audit (due diligence). The strategy for the company's further development was also elaborated together with the choice of licenses and company's management schemes. For Sibmethachem company from Tomsk, the Group prepared the site development with due consideration of new tendencies in methanol production. As a result, in 2015, Sibmethachem hit the record production figures for methanol (874 thousand tonnes). At the instructions of GazpromNeft Company, the CREON Group developed a strategy for the development of oil technologies sector with identification of priority directions in development and analysis of existing and projected products portfolio. At the request of one of the largest oil-producing companies in Russia, the CREON Group worked out the justification of the investment project on the basis of market analysis for benzene production facilities across Russia and the CIS countries, with a forecast up to 2035. Overall working experience amounts to more than 20 years of experience in investments and international petrochemicals consulting industry, including sixteen years of heading the Board of Directors of CREON Group of Companies.  Public activities   Rating of oil&gas; companies in Russia performed together with WWF  In 2014, together with WWF, Kilzie and Creon Energy organized The first Environmental Responsibility Rating of Oil & Gas companies of the Russian Federation, within Rational Approach Project. Rating included 19 leading companies on volumes of oil and natural gas extraction. Rating grade was calculated for each company as average for 28 rating criteria. According to calculations, Surgutneftegaz Company became the winner; Sakhalin Energy comes second place, Gazprom is on the third place.Presented environmental rating of oil-and-gas companies of Russia // ¬´Mir novostei¬ª. 06.01.2015¬´Common sense¬ª of oil companies // ¬´Nezavisimaya gazeta¬ª. 14.04.2015 The principal idea behind this rating is to encourage companies to make good use of hydrocarbon resources, to ensure environmental protection and an ecologically and socially responsible business in Russia. This project was developed in order to provide ‚Äògreening‚Äô of the petrochemicals industry, to include environmental operations into the list of priorities of Oil&Gas; Companies and to develop regulatory activities amongst the State authorities of the Russian Federation. Today, this is the only rating in Russia that serves as a tool in evaluation of levels of environmental responsibility of all companies extracting more than 1.5 mln tonnes of oil per year. When the results of the second Rating (end of 2015) were published, the national petrochemical industry journal Neftegazovaya Vertikal admitted that over just one year, the Rating has been recognised by the companies of this industry, which was particularly reflected in the meeting between representatives of the petrochemicals sector at the premises of CREON Group, which was dedicated to the methodology correction. This meeting was attended by representatives of 11 companies, who put forward more than 70 proposals. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RUIE) included the Rating in its compilation of corporate practice named ‚ÄúBusiness. Russia. Ecology. People.‚Äù The methodology of the research, which has no equivalents, has already attracted interest from abroad, and this helps in reinforcing a positive image of Russia overseas.WWF: The rating of eco-responsibility of oil and gas companies is publishedCARTE BLANCHE. The price of oil ecology is not a hindrance? // Nezavisimaya Gazeta The Rating is carried out annually and its publication is considered as a major event in the ecological field of petrochemicals sector in the Russian Federation. It includes such companies as Arktik Gaz, Bashneft, BelkamNeft, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Zarubezhneft, Irkutsk Oil Company, LUKOIL, NNK, Novatek, Rosneft, RussNeft, Salym Petroleum Development, Sakhalin Energy, Slavneft, Surgutneftegaz, Tatneft, Tomskneft, Total Razvedka Razrabotka Rossiya, Transneft, and Exxon NL. All expenditures for elaboration, estimation, corrections and drawing results are financed by Kilzie.  Partnership with the RIAC  In October 2015, The Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), in association with the Centre for Strategic Studies (SAM) of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with the support of CREON Group, held an international conference: ‚ÄúRussia & Turkey ‚Äì Forging Multidimensional Partnership‚Äù. The purpose of the conference was to discuss current aspects of collaboration between Russia and Turkey, mechanisms for implementation of joint infrastructure projects, approaches of the two countries to regional problems.Russia and Turkey ‚Äî together against instability // RIAC In May 2016, RIAC also held in cooperation with CREON Group and Russian-Chinese Committee for Friendship and Development, the second international conference: ‚ÄúRussia & China ‚Äì Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations‚Äù. The event was held with the support of governmental agencies of the Russian Government and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this conference was to assess the status and development tendencies of Russian-Chinese relations, to identify main achievements and unsettled issues of bilateral cooperation and to prepare proposals for the leaderships of both China and Russia on further development of strategic partnership. The conference became a significant event in the preparation process of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China at the end of June 2016, and received massive coverage in the Russian, Chinese and English-language media.‚ÄúRussia & China ‚Äì Towards New Quality of Bilateral Relations‚Äù // RIAC  International industry-related events  In general, for all working experience of the CREON Group and by Kilzie personally, more than 300 business conferences, congresses and forums have been held, dedicated to the issues of extraction and processing of fossil carbon fuels, processing of polymers, and development of agrochemicals. Some of the events have contributed to formation of an innovative vector of development in extracting and recycling branches of the Russian economy. In 2007 the Group organized the first conference in the country on associated petroleum gas in last decade for subject and complex discussion of problems on effective processing liquefied natural gas (LNG) that subsequently promoted the adoption of law, forcing all oil companies by 2012 to provide 95 percent useful recycling of associated petroleum gas on all of their sites. By the seventh international conference \\"Associated petroleum gas 2016\\", a number of leading players of oil branch had already reached recycling level of 95% or have come close to it. However, there were complexities with recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the remote, complex or new sites, and the level of recycling liquefied natural gas (LNG) became one of the key parameters of the rating of ecological safety of the oil and gas companies of the Russian Federation.Efficiency without sanctions // Vedomosti 2010 witnessed the organization of unique in Russia debatable platform on coverage of helium market, which has no analogues in Europe. As a result, development of manufacture of helium in Russia has justified CREON Group predictions about a high export potential of this product. The director for development and strategy of Gazprom Marketing and Trading France Didier Lebo at the conference \\"Helium 2016\\" has informed that with the start of Amur gas recycling factory of Gazprom for the first time one source of manufacture will be enough to cover predicted deficiency in the world market at various scenarios within the next 30 years. Among other key themes of the actions organised by CREON company and Kilzie manufacture may be highlighted LNG/CNG, LCG, petrol,Petrol stability // Vedomosti diesel, mineral fertilizers,How does the Russian mineral fertilizer market go through a crisis? // Echo of Moscow caustic soda, sulfur and sulfuric acid,The market of sulfur and sulfuric acid: what should manufacturers do in the context of surplus products? // Business of Russia etc. In March 2012, Creon Company organized ¬´Caustic Soda 2012¬ª Conference. The key issue of the conference was cartel agreement case, initiated by the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) against manufacturers of caustic soda and chloric production headed by United Trade Company (UTK).Vaccination against cartel plague// Expert Online. 19.03.2012  The Plastics of Russia award  In 2014, Creon Energy Group organized the Plastics of Russia National Forum and established the self-titled award aimed at encouragement of Russian companies and enterprises engaged in the formation of the country's plastic industry. First annual Forum was supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation and Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation. According to Kilzie, plastic converting became the national basis and is able to be a key point for development of a significant segment of the Russian industry. Speeches at this forum proved the significant opportunities for development of domestic market of plastics production in all segments of the national economy.Huge possibilities of the internal market // Expert Online. 08.10.2013 In 2016, the Plastics of Russia Award had eleven categories for polymer products producers and processors. Among the winners of the award were recognised market leaders (including Kazanorgsintez, Ufaorgsintex, SIBUR and Mosoblgaz companies) together with new market players, such as the recently opened polymer film plant in Rostov Region Waterfall Pro. The award ceremony was covered by leading trade publications and business media, including Expert magazine, the Prime agency for economic news, the PRO-Business television network, and other major organizations.

It used to be part of the Jariyan Al Batnah municipality before the municipality was incorporated into Al Rayyan. In 2014, the village was incorporated into the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality. The Dhal Al Misfir cave is located in the area. Etymology In Arabic, rawdat refers to a depression where rainfall runoff accumulates. The second part of the name, \\"Rashed\\", was given in honor of a man named Rashed who died in the rawdat. Geography Rawdat Rashed is situated in central Qatar. The villages of Wadi Al Jamal Al Shamali and Umm Wishah are nearby. Barwa Group launched a planned community named Madinat Al Mawater (literally 'Motor City') on the outskirts of Rawdat Rashed, near the junction of Rawdat Rashed Road‚ÄìSalwa Road. The community will host residential units, workshops, car showrooms, and apartment complexes. Industry The area contains the most substantial supply of fresh groundwater in the southern zone of the country. A government wellfield is found in the area, and was previously used as a water source for Umm Bab's cement industry. Rawdat Rashed is also one of five sites for the government- sponsored project to develop reservoirs in the country. Once completed, the reservoirs are expected to be the largest in the world in their category, with a total length of 650 km and constructed at a cost of QR 14.5 billion. Rawdat Rashed's water reservoir is built at 50 ft above sea level, and will be used as the main water supply for the capital of Doha in the scenario of an electricity outage at the other stations. In June 2018, the first phase of the project was completed. Rawdat Rashed is one of the three major landfill sites in the country, being used mainly for construction and demolition waste. Transport Rawdat Rashed Road, a 33 km road stretching through the city connected to Dukhan Highway, which links Dukhan and Doha, is known locally as the 'road of death' due to the large number of fatal accidents which occur on the road. After announcing a redevelopment plan for the road in 2014, the Public Works Authority commenced redevelopment work in 2015. The redevelopment project, due for completion in late 2019, will also link the road with Salwa Road.

She took part in 1808 in one action that in 1847 the Admiralty recognized with a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal. One month later cannon fire from a shore battery sank her. Career Lieutenant Thomas Gwillim commissioned Rapid in November 1804. During the blockade of Brest, on 30 May 1805 Rapid was near the Penmarks where Gwillim observed several small vessels anchored under the protection of a battery. Gwillim sent in a boat that was able to cut out the chasse maree Paix D√©sir√©e, which was carrying a cargo of salt. The other French vessels moved closer to the battery, which kept firing at Rapids boat. Lieutenant Henry Baugh replaced Gwillim on 2 January 1806. In May Rapid sent into Plymouth the Prussian vessel Edward, Drawse, master, which had been sailing from St Andero.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4052. On 26 October was in sight of Rapid as she captured the brig Conductor. In late February or early March 1807, the Spanish schooner St Domingo, carrying fish, arrived at Falmouth. She was a prize to Rapid.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4181. In mid- December Rapid sent the Spanish vessel San Pedro Pascual into Plymouth. San Pedro Pascual was carrying a cargo of salt.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4210. On 23 April 1808, , Commander Thomas Searle, and Rapid encountered two Spanish vessels from South America, sailing under the protection of four gunboats. After a short chase, the convoy anchored under the guns of a shore battery near Faro, Portugal. Searle anchored Grasshopper within grapeshot (i.e., short) range of the Spanish vessels and commenced firing. After two and a half hours, the gun crews of the shore battery had abandoned their guns, and the British had driven two gunboats ashore and destroyed them. The British also captured two gunboats and the two merchant vessels. Grasshopper had one man killed and three severely wounded. Searle himself was lightly wounded. Rapid had three men severely wounded. Spanish casualties were heavy, numbering some 40 dead and wounded on the two captured gunboats alone. Searle put 14 of the wounded on shore to Faro as he did not have the resources to deal with them as well as his own casualties. Searle estimated the value of the cargo on each of the two merchant vessels at ¬£30,000.If Searle's estimate was correct, the capture would have made him a wealthy man. A conservative estimate would put his share at in excess of ¬£7,500. This action also resulted in the Admiralty awarding clasps to the Naval General Service Medal marked \\"Grasshopper 24 April 1808\\" and \\"Rapid 24 April 1808\\". Loss On 18 May 1808, Rapid was cruising off Cape St. Vincent in company with . They saw and chased two merchant feluccas that took shelter under the protection of a shore battery. The British decided to try to cut out the feluccas nonetheless, with Rapid leading the way. Fire from the battery struck Rapid, opening two holes in her bow so that she filled quickly with water. Still, that evening Primrose was able to save Rapid's entire crew. The subsequent court martial praised Bough for his zeal and gallantry.

Description The event began with the idea of taking a photograph in front of the White Stag sign (pictured in 2010). The \\"Burnside Burn\\" was organized by Portland NORML, the local chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, in celebration of the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Oregon and to circumnavigate a temporary limit on recreational sales. According to Russ Belville, the chapter's executive director, the event began with the idea of taking a photograph in front of the White Stag sign. He recalled: \\"It evolved from me saying that when legalization happens, I want to take a photo under the Portland, Oregon sign. Other people said, 'Can we give marijuana away?' [and] I said, 'I can't stop you!'\\" On the evening of June 30, beginning as early as 8pm, and into the morning of July 1, 2015, between a few hundred and a few thousand people gathered on the Burnside Bridge's north sidewalk for the free event. The crowd sometimes spilled into the road and blocked multiple traffic lanes, resulting at one point in the complete blockage of west-bound traffic. Activists chanted \\"Free the weed\\" and \\"Fuck the DEA\\". Cannabis was shared and consumed openly. Russ Belville (left), executive director of Portland NORML, at Seattle Hempfest in 2010; Belville shared an ounce of marijuana at the event. The crowd was larger than anticipated and spanned the entire length of the Burnside Bridge. Belville had initially expected \\"between 50 and 5,000 people\\", but details of the event spread online and through word of mouth, and ultimately it was estimated that \\"thousands\\" had turned out. Some attendees said they were there to commemorate an historic moment, while others admitted having come for free marijuana and cannabis seeds. One man, known as \\"Pork Chop\\" (or \\"Porkchop\\"), reportedly announced over a megaphone that he had 420 pounds of marijuana to distribute, though his claim was not supported by news outlets. Two women with Ideal Farms, who wished to \\"share the love\\", distributed joints to attendees who could prove that they were of legal age. One man distributed drops of hash oil, and Belville himself shared an ounce of marijuana (the maximum allowed under Oregon Ballot Measure 91). Some participants did receive free marijuana, seeds, and/or starter plants, but many did not, due to the larger than expected crowd. Coupons were also distributed for later redemption. Participants smoked openly and without fear. No fines were issued for consumption in public. Patrol vehicles drove by the scene a few times but did not stop. Prior to the event, police urged residents to avoid calling 9-1-1 to report public consumption, which they did not consider an emergency. Commentary The event was covered by cannabis publications, Note: Original article by Shelby Sebens for Yahoo! News. local and national media outlets, and the HBO documentary television series Vice. The Oregonian described the event as \\"loud and energetic\\", attracting a diverse and \\"eclectic\\" crowd of activists, marijuana enthusiasts, and first- time consumers, some from as far away as Canada and San Diego. According to Willamette Week, attendees ranged from octogenarians to \\"tweens with rainbow hair\\" and the crowd was \\"generally happy\\". The newspaper summarized, \\"All and all, the mood was celebratory as befit such an historic occasion.\\" NORML's Kaliko Castille told The Huffington Post he was \\"happy to see a community able to come together‚Äîpeacefully‚Äîover something positive. It's great to see people from all walks of life out here, handing out joints to each other and getting to know their neighbors.\\" The Huffington Post Andy Campbell called the event a \\"smoke-out with a message\\" and opined, \\"Legalization is so much more than being able to smoke a joint in your home without being a criminal. It's a health care issue; it's a tax revenue issue; it saves states millions in the court system; and it ends the hidden costs of prosecution, which emerge when someone can't get a job because there's a possession charge on their record.\\" The Washington Post called the \\"Burnside Burn\\" an opportunity for marijuana enthusiasts to \\"celebrate their new freedom together\\".

They number 2.8 million (full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and constitute one of the largest Jewish ethnic divisions in Israel, in line with Mizrahi Jews and Sephardi Jews. Ashkenazi Jews are Jews whose ancestors had settled in Central and Eastern Europe, as opposed to those who remained in the Middle East and North Africa region, or settled in other places. History In Israel, the term Ashkenazi is now used in a manner unrelated to its original meaning, often applied to all Jews who settled in Europe and sometimes including those whose ethnic background is actually Sephardic. Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the Iberian Peninsula, have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and Sephardi/Mizrahi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews. The Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel is an honored leadership role given to a respected Ashkenazi rabbi. The Chief Rabbi may make determinations regarding matters of halakha that affect the public and this position also has political overtones. Some religiously affiliated Ashkenazi Jews in Israel may be more likely to support certain religious interests in Israel, including certain political parties. These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the Knesset, a unicameral legislature with 120 seats. In 2018, 31.8% of Israeli Jews self-identified as Ashkenazi, in addition to 12.4% being immigrants from the former USSR, a majority of whom self-identify as Ashkenazi.https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/noah/files/2018/07/Ethnic-origin- and-identity-in-Israel-JEMS-2018.pdf They have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politicsAs of 2013, every President of Israel since the country's foundation in 1948 has been an Ashkenazi Jew of Israel since its founding. During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the \\"melting pot\\". That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to \\"melt down\\" their own particular exilic identities within the general social \\"pot\\" in order to become Israeli.Yitzhaki, Shlomo and Schechtman, Edna The \\"Melting Pot\\": A Success Story? Journal of Economic Inequality, Vol; 7, No. 2, June 2009, pp. 137‚Äì51. Earlier version by Schechtman, Edna and Yitzhaki, Shlomo , Working Paper No. 32, Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem, Nov. 2007, i + 30 pp. Political trends The majority of Ashkenazim in Israel today tend to vote for left-wing and centrist parties, favoring especially Blue and White (political alliance), while other Jewish subdivisions such as Mizrahi Jews in Israel tend to favor more right-wing parties such as Likud, with the distinction sharpening since 1980. Ashkenazi prominence on the left has historically been associated with socialist ideals that had emerged in Central Europe and the kibbutz and Labor Zionist movements, while Mizrahim, as they rose in society and they developed their political ideals, often rejected ideologies they associated with an \\"Ashkenazi elite\\", with the flood of Mizrahim into the ranks of Likud beginning as many enthusiastically Menachem Begin who made overtures to the community despite not being a Mizrahi himself. Although these tensions were initially based on economic rivalries, the distinction remained strong even as Mizrahim increasingly moved up the socioeconomic latter around 1990, entering the middle class, and the disparity between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim diminished (but did not completely disappear), with Mizrahi political expression becoming increasingly linked to the Likud and Shas parties; Shas was founded as a party to represent Mizrahim while Likud, the largest right-wing party, in Israel became increasingly influenced by Mizrahi political articulation, with the Mizrahi middle class' political coming-of-age held by political science commentators to be embodied by the rise of Mizrahi Likud politicians such as Moshe Kahlon and Miri Regev. The Ashkenazi vote has, aside from electorally limited majority-Ashkenazi ultra- religious parties such as Habayit Hayehudi and UTJ, long been associated with secularism and social liberalism and Ashkenazi Israelis are overall less devout, more socially liberal, and have more favorable opinions towards improving relations with Arab peoples, and greater opposition to settlements in the West Bank, than Israelis of Sephardic and Mizrahi extraction. Today, the most influential party among Ashkenazi Israelis appears to be Blue and White (political alliance).

It operated under the academic auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and its alumni received an undergraduate degree from Hebrew University until 2001. The college was established by Emek Hefer Regional Council Head Rani Idan, former vice president of the Technion, Professor Danny Wolf, Professor Micha Spira of Hebrew University and Daphna Pergament, who headed its administration until 2007. A nonprofit organization operated alongside the college to raise funds for it and guide it toward its goals. The organization's members were experts in various aspects of oceanography hailing from industry, academia, and the military. In 2003, the college became the third school of the Ruppin Academic Center, joining what were then the School of Social Sciences and Management and the School of Engineering. At that point, its name changed to the School of Marine Sciences and it became an integral part of this public college approved by the Israeli Council for Higher Education (CHE).

However, the extent of King's contribution is debatable; songwriter Tillman Franks, who Escott writes \\"had more or less invented payola in the country record business,\\" later recalled a fishing trip he took with Williams and country singer Webb Pierce: :I'd given Nelson King half of \\"Three Ways of Knowing\\" and Hank said, \\"Franks, you and Pierce have done fucked up business giving these deejays songs.\\" I said, \\"Hank, I didn't start it. Nelson told me you'd given him half of 'There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight.'\\" Hank said, \\"I didn't mean to, I was drunk.'\\" Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass).

It is illegal for Muslims, with apostates from Islam facing a maximum sentence of the death penalty under the country's anti-blasphemy law. As such, there have been questions regarding freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates. Atheism in the region is mainly present among foreign expatriates and a very small number of local youth. According to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, due to Islam being founded in the Arabian Peninsula over 1,400 years ago, the Persian Gulf region enjoys a long Islamic history and tradition, and it is strongly associated with national identity; thus, any distancing or criticism of religion \\"equates to distancing oneself from national identity\\". Al-Qassemi notes that the use of social media via the internet remains the strongest medium of expression for Gulf atheists, while providing anonymity; a pioneering Gulf blogger is the Emirati atheist Ahmed Ben Kerishan, who is known in the Arabic blogosphere for advocating atheist and secular views.

It carries Interstate 94 (I-94) over eight lanes of US Highway 24 (US 24, Telegraph Road). The bridge itself is six travel lanes wide.  History  The Gateway Bridge was developed by the Detroit Regional Gateway Advisory Council (DRGAC) in preparation for Super Bowl XL, hosted in nearby Detroit in February 2006. It was one of several improvements made in the mid-2000s along of Interstate 94. The bridge cost $14 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was part of an approximately $520 million (equivalent to $ in ) I-94 improvements. The unique design meant that the cost was $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) higher than conventional plate-girder bridges, causing public controversy. Private funds were largely used to cover the increase. Inspiration for the bridge came from a 1987 article by Frank Peters in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch about a tied- arch bridge over the Mississippi River. Construction began in May 2004 while I-94 traffic continued to utilize existing bridges. C.A. Hull Company was contracted to construct the bridges and Dan's Excavating Inc. performed demolition work. Ruby+Associates provided construction engineering and proposed an alternate construction method that eliminated the need for large shoring. A steel delivery delay caused work to slow at one point. The beams were fabricated by PDM Bridge. The bridge was covered with three coats of blue paint and one clear coat to prevent fading. The bridge was completed in Fall 2005. It is known as the Gateway Bridge, because it acts as the \\"gateway to Detroit\\" for those traveling on I-94 from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport to the City of Detroit.  Design  Engineers from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) worked with Alfred Benesch & Company to create the bridge design. The bridge features twin tied-arch steel spans featuring two large blue ovals, augmented with additional ovals, meant to evoke images of footballs, to commemorate Super Bowl XL. The arches reach above I-94 and above US 24. The bridge is long and wide. The six-lane bridge carries I-94 over the eight-lane US 24. The design introduced a single-point urban interchange, a new design in Michigan at the time. That interchange was completed in December 2005. Each span uses approximately of steel. The bridge is topped with a concrete deck‚Äîwhich is standard in Michigan‚Äîand a micro slice concrete overlay to protect the concrete's structural integrity. addition of a micro alive concrete overlay was unusual in Michigan at the time of the bridge's construction. Special lighting is used to illuminate the bridge at night. In 2007, the National Steel Bridge Alliance awarded the design in its medium span category.  Maintenance  Prior to the bridge's opening, Wayne County and Detroit governments pledged $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ) per year to maintain the improvements made to I-94 that prompted the bridge's construction. MDOT is responsible for maintenance of the bridge itself.

He is the lead songwriter and guitarist of Oceans Red and former songwriter and guitarist of Make Me Famous.  Music career  2010-12: Make Me Famous The first major project Jimmy involved himself in was metalcore act Make Me Famous which he helped form in 2010 with members Denis Stoff on vocals and guitar, Serj Kravchenko on lead vocals, Sergei Hohlov on bass and Dusty Boles on drums. The band gained recognition on the video sharing website YouTube. After releasing the first music video for the song \\"Make it Precious\\", they submitted it to Ukrainian national Tuborg's VideoFun Music Contest in 2011. 167 bands from all over Ukraine with their music videos were involved in this contest project, but only Make Me Famous won the victory among them all by taking the first place. The band released their debut album in March 2012 via Sumerian Records and successfully charted in the US top 200, peaking at 151., No. 5 on the Heatseekers Chart. In late 2012 Make Me Famous was officially disbanded. The remaining four members went on to form a new band called Oceans Red. 2012-present: Oceans Red The band wrote and self-produced their debut EP \\"Hold Your Breath\\" in early 2013. After the EP was released, lead vocalist quits the band due to health issues, two other members Dusty and Nick decided to split their ways with the band too. After almost a year since the debut EP was released the band with an updated line-up drops their single along with the video for \\"Misguided\\". The music video for this single were shot in 3 different countries at 4 different forests, since the band members were spread across the globe at that time. Jimmy had to combine and smooth the video between different forests at post-production stage, which he also did for the band for this music video. A few months later the band releases their second new single along with the video for \\"Black Spot\\". To keep things up, the band releases their acoustic version of the already existing song \\"Riot\\" on the New Year. On 8 October new single \\"Home\\" was exclusively released on KERRANG! website following Jimmy's quote, saying: \\"I had goose bumps writing Home and everyone in the band passed this music through their hearts. That‚Äôs why it came up so epic, it‚Äôs pure emotions. Being different people from different countries we‚Äôre an example of how music connects people better than any other thing in the world.\\". On 6 November, the band premieres their debut album \\"Anevidence\\" on UTG website along with a short Q&A; with guitarist and songwriter Jimmy X Rose. 2015-present: Solo career On 1 July Jimmy released his first solo acoustic single named \\"Homesick\\". Based on emotion and longing this track is about him being far from home and missing all his family and friends during the time that he was in the United States with Make Me Famous and Oceans Red.

The abbey gave rise to the village of Assen (which was not a town until the 19th century). It was devastated by a fire in 1418. In 1460 it joined the Trinitarian Order. The community ceased to exist during the Protestant Reformation, around 1596; its formal dissolution took place in 1602. In 1601 the church tower collapsed, and badly damaged the church, which was rebuilt in 1662: of the mediaeval structure only the south wall remained. In 1848 the church was sold to the municipality, which used it as a community centre. Since 1982 it has been used as part of the Drents Museum.

Built in 1946, it is one of the city's most notable examples of Streamline Moderne architecture, and representative of the boom in automobile-oriented commercial development in the immediate post-war period. The building was one of the last completed works by architect T. Charles Gaastra. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1999 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History The Hendren Building was constructed in 1946 by J.L. Hendren, a local grocery store owner who saw the potential for further commercial development in the rapidly growing Nob Hill area. At the time, the city was expanding further away from the downtown core, and residents of the new developments wanted shops and businesses nearer their homes. In particular, Hendren believed a building containing doctors' offices and a pharmacy would be welcomed by area residents. Hendren commissioned T. Charles Gaastra to design the building, which ended up being one of the architect's last works before his death in 1947. Supposedly the Streamline Moderne design was based on a photograph Hendren had seen of a building on a similarly shaped lot somewhere in the Midwest. Construction began in early 1946 and lasted approximately nine months. Hendren's venture proved successful, and the property was fully leased within a year. The initial tenants of the building included a pharmacy, an electrical supply company, a luggage shop, and doctors' offices. The Hendren Building has housed a number of businesses over the years but remains in use for its original purpose as of 2015. The building was remodeled in the early 2000s, removing the black Carrara Glass cladding among other modifications. Architecture The Hendren Building is a one- story, flat-roofed commercial block located on the acute corner formed by Dartmouth Drive and Monte Vista Boulevard. The building is V-shaped with wings extending along both streets, containing a number of small commercial spaces. The building's strongly horizontal lines and rounded corner entrance are typical of the Streamline Moderne architectural style. The exterior was originally faced with pink stone and black Carrara Glass, though the latter was removed in the early 2000s. Large block letters above the roof line spell the name of the building.

The band released three singles during its existence and were popular particularly in Los Angeles, California for their song, \\"(I'm Just A) Lonely Guy\\". The group formed as the vocal ensemble, the Echoes, in 1952, when the band members were enrolled in Edmond Meany Junior High School, and performed in a local teen club called the Strokers, among other venues. Initially, the band went through several personnel changes, but the solidified line-up included Jimmy Pipkin (lead vocals, piano), Bobby Dixon (first tenor), \\"Tiny\\" Tony Smith (second tenor), and Ernie Rouse (baritone). In 1957, the group, now going by the moniker, the Gallahads, performed their original tune, \\"Gone\\", over the telephone to DJ Steve Wray. Impressed, Wray became the band's first manager, buying them matching white outfits, and arranging performances at the Catholic Youth Organization --which were, at the time, some of the only teen dances allowed in Seattle. In one of their gigs, record producers Larry Nelson and Chuck Markulis, owners of Nite Records, saw the Gallahads and immediately signed the band, after recently issuing the label's debut record, \\"Love You So\\", by Ron Holden and the Thunderbirds. A recording of \\"Gone\\" and another original song, \\"So Lonely\\", were complete in Northwest Recorders, in the summer of 1959. However, local radio stations would not play the tracks. Nonetheless, the band demoed another composition, \\"(I'm Just A) Lonely Guy\\", and passed the recording over to Bob Keane of Del-Fi/Donna Records. In September 1959, the Gallahads relocated to Los Angeles, signed to a five-year contract with the record label, and re-recorded the song, along with \\"Jo Jo the Big Wheel\\". In February 1960, the two songs were issued as a single on the Donna label, and in August 1960 it was also released on the Del-Fi label. On August 15, 1960, \\"Lonely Guy\\" bubbled under the Hot 100 at number 111, reached number four on Cashbox, and spent ten weeks at number one on Los Angeles's KFWB Fabulous Forty. By the time of the Gallahads' next release, Smith and Dixon had departed, and were replaced by Leo Robinson, Ray Robinson, and Charles Wright, who would later go on to lead the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. The new line-up was featured weekly on the Wink Martindale Show for a few months, and appeared on American Bandstand. In 1961, the group's second single \\"Without A Girlfriend\\" was released and received extensive airplay in Los Angeles. However, after a performance managed by DJ Alan Freed, the band was not compensated and filed a complaint against Freed. With Freed's connections in the music industry, he had the single pulled from any further promotion. In addition, the B-side \\"Be Fair\\" was met with resistance by radio stations for its lyrics pertaining to a blind man. After returning to Seattle, the band, under the billing Jimmy Pipkin and the Gallahads, released a third and final single, \\"This Letter To You\\" in 1962, but it was largely ignored. The band performed at the Seattle World's Fair, but disbanded by the end of the year. Pipkins continued to perform with a variation of line-ups under the Gallahads' name, and occasionally, the first time of which was 1974, the original members reunited. Smoth formed a R&B; group called the Statics, which morphed into the psychedelic rock band, International Brick. The band released the single \\"Flower Children\\" in 1968.

In the late 1990s, Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions. As of 2007, the museum began adopting cats needing homes. In 2011, the museum began a \\"Catfest\\", a celebration of its cat population. \\"Catfest\\" has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children.

He was elected chairman for six two-year terms. Woodfill was the longest-serving and youngest ever elected as Harris County chairman. He is known for social and fiscal conservative positions. In 2015, he was named Houstonian of the Year by KRIV Fox 26. In 2015, Jared Woodfill became the spokesman for Campaign For Houston,Campaign for Houston, Facebook the group that opposed former Houston Mayor Annise Parker's equal rights ordinance and prevailed, 61 to 39 percent among the electorate. He has tried environmental law, family law, personal injury, condemnation, and business disputes in courts around the country. He has also worked on numerous mass tort cases, including EIFS (Exterior Insulating Finishing System) cases, Hurricane Ike, Masonite Hardboard Siding, LP Inner Seal, dioxin exposure cases, creosote cases, and homeowners mold claims. Background Woodfill's father, Jared, IV, is a former employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Houston who helped to return home the crew of the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. His mother, the former Betty Beck, is a former instructor at San Jacinto College. Woodfill graduated from Clear Lake High School, the University of Texas at Austin, and St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas. Woodfill is affiliated with the firm Woodfill and Pressler, LLP. His law partner is the retired conservative jurist Paul Pressler. Woodfill is married to the former Celeste Marie Ponce. Party politics Prior to his election as county chairman in 2002 to succeed Gary M. Polland, Woodfill had been vice- chairman for State Senate District 17 and the legal counsel for the Harris County Republican Party. In 2010, Woodfill won his third term as county chairman over Donald Jeffrey Large, who had run for the District 140 seat in the Texas House of Representatives in 2004 and received just under one third of the vote. Large's candidacy for county chairman did not become viable in part because of a lack of campaign fundraising. Large polled only 7,099 votes out of 117,757 votes cast, or 6 percent of the total. Woodfill ran into trouble in his 2014 race for a fourth term though he carried the vigorous backing of his predecessor, Gary Polland, and other conservative leaders in the party. He was unseated by the Houston engineer-turned-lawyer Paul Simpson, who received a $90,000 donation from County Judge Ed Emmett, who was unopposed for the Republican nomination for his office. Woodfill and Emmett became politically estranged in 2012. Emmett claims that Woodfill took personal credit for the establishment of \\"victory centers\\" when the sites were actually the work of Emmett and the state Republican party. Simpson supporters claimed that Woodfill had grown lackluster in campaign fundraising and had accented \\"social issues\\" as chairman, including a lawsuit against Mayor Parker regarding benefits for same-sex couples employed by the city. Woodfill also carried the support of State Senator Dan Patrick, who was elected lieutenant governor to succeed David Dewhurst, and Paul Bettencourt, the former Harris County tax assessor-collector and Patrick's successor in the District 7 seat in the state Senate. In the state Senate race, Bettencourt was an easy winner and was endorsed by Polland, Woodfill, Richard J. Trabulsi, Jr., the chairman of the political action committee, Texans for Lawsuit Reform, and pastor Rick Scarbough of Vision America. In 2015, Woodfill was named Local Person of the year by Fox 26 Roundup. In 2016 Wood!ll was named one of Houston‚Äôs top lawyers by Houstonia Magazine. He has also received the TRL Defender of Life Award, Texas Values‚Äô Kelly Shackleford Award, San Jacinto Republican‚Äôs Patriot Award, and Vision America‚Äôs Local Hero of the Faith Award. To retain the chairmanship, Mechler was again elected in 2016 by delegates to the regular state Republican convention. The race became heated when Steven F. Hotze, a Woodfill supporter from Katy in Harris County, who heads the group Conservative Republicans of Texas, claimed that Mechler supports a \\"disgusting homosexual agenda\\". Former chairman Steve Munisteri called Hotze's allegation \\"despicable.\\" Woodfill withdrew when twenty-seven of the thirty-one state Senate districts supported Mechler's retention and declared his own backing of Mechler. A resolution over secession from the United States, which Mechler opposed, was debated and rejected by the convention delegates.Mike Ward and Bobby Cervantes, \\"After loud debate, Texas GOP rejects platform call to secede: U. S. politics that 'impair' states' rights are cited,\\" San Antonio Express-News, May 14, 2016, p. A3 In this second race against Mechler, Woodfill carried the backing of such conservative groups such as the Texas Home School Coalition, Texas Right to Life, Eagle Forum, the National Organization for Marriage, Concerned Women for America, and the Houston Area Pastors Council. In 2017, as editor-in-chief of the group Conservative Republicans of Texas, Woodfill endorsed State Senator Lois Kolkhorst's bill to require persons to use public restrooms corresponding to their genitalia at birth. He called upon Joe Straus, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from San Antonio, to allow the lower chamber to vote on the legislation. On March 9, 2017, he wrote: As Straus continued to block a vote on the Kolkhorst bill, Woodfill and Hotze in May 2017 placed a statewide call for conservative Christian candidates to run for state representative in the primary elections scheduled for March 6, 2018, against intra-party opponents of the legislation, whose opponents include most liberals, transgender persons, and many businesses and sports teams. Hotze called Republican opponents of the bill \\"spineless, yellow-belly Texas Republican state representatives who have not had the courage to ... protect the privacy and safety of their mothers, wives, daughters, and granddaughters. ...If a man does not have the courage to protect women and girls and keep them from harm's way, then he is as worthless as chaff that the wind drives away ...\\" Hotze questioned the extent of Republican opposition to the bill, which he claims carries the backing of 84 percent of Texas Republicans in a recent survey. Woodfill has published articles in the St. Mary‚Äôs Law Journal and Villanova Law Review. He has also been quoted in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Los Angelas Times, Time Magazine, Texas Lawyer, Weekly Standard, Human Events, National Review and numerous other periodicals. He has appeared on numerous television shows and radio stations.

Their coding bootcamp is currently offered in 12-week Full-Time and 9-month Part-Time formats, in-person in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and Austin, as well as remotely, live online. Cofounder Drost has described the program as, \\"optimized for people who want to be software engineers as their main, day-to-day work. Their life's work.\\" The curriculum focuses on JavaScript and associated technologies including the Relational/NoSQL databases, Node.js, Express.js, jQuery, React, Redux. In 2015 Hack Reactor acquired Austin-based MakerSquare as \\"their first deal in a plan to develop a network of coding bootcamps\\" in an effort to \\"make a large dent in transforming the old education system into one that focuses on student outcomes.\\" The following month, a pair of Hack Reactor alumni partnered with the company to open Telegraph Academy \\"to teach software engineering to under- represented minorities\\" and create a \\"growing community of diverse software engineers.\\" In November 2016, Hack Reactor rebranded all of its schools to share the Hack Reactor name.  Admissions process  Hack Reactor's admissions standard has been described as \\"highly selective, only accepting ten to fifteen percent of applicants for each cohort.\\" Though many applicants who do not pass the first admission interview are encouraged to try again when they feel they are better prepared. As of 2017, Hack Reactor has two admissions paths. Students can either self-study and pass a technical interview or join their Structured Study Program, a live class which includes preparation, readiness assessment and admittance. The technical interview tests both technical skills (JavaScript basics such as objects, arrays, functions and the ability to solve basic coding problems using JavaScript) and soft skills, such as the student‚Äôs willingness and ability to learn. Hack Reactor has created financial partnerships with SkillsFund and Climb Credit and to assist students with paying tuition. As of 2016, WeFinance and Reactor Core (Hack Reactor's parent company) have launched a platform that allows anyone to lend to incoming students.  Course Structure  Accepted students are assigned pre-course work, which takes \\"at least 50-80 hours\\" and is due prior to the start of their cohort. Hack Reactor‚Äôs course is offered in 12-week full-time and 9-month part-time formats. During the first half of the program, students work in pairs on two-day ‚Äúsprints.‚Äù Pair and group work helps teach communication and collaboration skills. During this part of the course, the day typically starts with a ‚Äútoy problem,‚Äù which is a programming challenge designed to illustrate core concepts. This is followed by a lecture in which the instructor frequently checks in with students to assess how well they understand the material. The JavaScript tools and technologies taught at Hack Reactor include Angular, Node, MongoDB, Express, React, Backbone and ES6. The goal of this part of the course is for students to become ‚Äúautonomous learners and programmers.‚Äù The second half of the course focuses on projects. Students complete ‚Äúincreasingly elaborate‚Äù coding projects of their own design, using whatever languages and frameworks they choose. Students often adopt technologies not taught in the course using ‚Äúfundamentals and self- teaching methods‚Äù taught in the first half of the course.  Student Outcomes  Co-Founder Shawn Drost says that Hack Reactor is \\"committed to being the leading coding immersive in terms of quality, student experience and student outcomes.\\" In 2017, they joined a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization called the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) as a founding member. CIRR requires members to report \\"the outcomes of every enrolled student must be reported in a single, simple, clear report\\" using common standards and follow \\"CIRR Truth in Advertising policies\\".  Hack Reactor Remote  In July 2014, Hack Reactor launched an online program, Hack Reactor Remote. This program has the same curriculum, course structure and teaching method as Hack Reactor‚Äôs onsite program. Students attend and participate in the lectures at the same time as the other students, work on the same assignments, and benefit from the same job search and placement resources as the onsite program. Hack Reactor's Remote program has comparable student outcomes to its in-person campuses. In 2017, Hack Reactor began offering a part-time version of their remote program, known as Hack Reactor Remote Part-Time.  MakerSquare Acquisition  In January 2015, Hack Reactor acquired coding bootcamp MakerSquare, which had locations in Austin and San Francisco. MakerSquare has since expanded into Los Angeles and New York City. MakerSquare has the same admissions process, hiring partner network, and the same curriculum with a few small modifications. In November 2016, they rebranded to share the Hack Reactor name.  Social Responsibility   Code.7370  In collaboration with The Last Mile, Hack Reactor launched Code.7370, a coding program in San Quentin State Prison. Inmates have to apply to be a part of the program. Once accepted, they learn HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week. Hack Reactor instructors volunteered as teachers. In addition to class time students are also given time to work on personal projects. Because inmates are not permitted access to the internet, Code.7370 operates by a proprietary programming platform that simulates a normal web environment. The goal of Code.7370 is to reduce recidivism and help felons reenter the workforce.  ReBootKAMP  Hack Reactor helped launch ReBootKAMP, a coding bootcamp in Jordan that focuses on Syrian refugees. ReBootKAMP uses Hack Reactor‚Äôs curriculum, and received volunteer assistance from Hack Reactor staff and alumni. ReBootKAMP executives also received training on coding bootcamp best practices from Hack Reactor and Reactor Core.  Hola\`\`  In December 2017, Hack Reactor supported the launch of Hola\`\`, a coding bootcamp based in Mexico City focused on bringing new opportunities to recent returnees. Hola\`\` is powered by Hack Reactor curriculum and Hack Reactor alumni have been part of their teaching team.

It is small, transparent, and a simultaneous hermaphrodite.  Biology  Macrostomum hystrix is capable of hypodermic insemination. In this process, sperm is injected through the epidermis into the parenchyma of the mating partner. This is done by a needle-like stylet, which is the male copulatory organ. The stylet has a rigid and pointed distal thickening, as well as a subterminal stylet opening which can puncture the epidermis of the mating partner. The sperm are highly motile, small and simple, but have no flagellates. The female antrum shows a simple anatomy and is only involved in laying eggs. Sperm of Macrostomum hystrix The needle-like stylet of Macrostomum hystrix. The seminal vesicle is visible, as are the developing eggs. In isolated worms, it has been shown that Macrostomum hystrix does not only use hypodermic insemination for outbreeding but also self-fertilization, or \\"selfing\\". To achieve this, they inject their sperm into themselves ‚Äî mainly into their own heads, due to physical constraints. From there, the sperm apparently migrate to the site of fertilization. Worms that were isolated showed significantly more sperm in their heads, compared to worms that had the opportunity to cross-fertilize. Macrostomum hystrix prefers outbreeding if partners are available because selfing also has costs. The amount of offspring of worms that selfed is reduced, as is the offspring's survival. As a consequence, Macrostomum hystrix only begins selfing in the extended absence of mating partners: delayed selfing represents a conditional reproductive strategy which allows them to deal with periodic conditions of low mate abundance.

The driving force behind the show was a long running storyline between CMLL's regular roster and a group of \\"outsiders\\" known as Los Invasores (\\"The Invaders\\") who had shown up over the summer of 2010. In the main event Negro Casas represented CMLL against Charly Manson, who had worked for CMLL's rival promotion AAA for decades. For the show both competitors put their hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, which in lucha libre is considered the ultimate way to setting an issue in the ring. Three of the remaining five matches on the show also saw Invasores and CMLL loyalists wrestle on opposite sides, the only exception being the Mini-Estrella opening match and the \\"Lighting Match\\" (One fall, 10 minute time-limit match) between Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. defeated Valiente. The final three matches of the show were broadcast two days later on Mexican television. Background Entre el Cielo y el Infierno featured six professional wrestling matches, in which some wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others were teamed up with no particular backstory. Wrestlers themselves portrayed either heels (referred to as \\"Rudos\\" in Mexico, wrestlers who portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (\\"Tecnicos\\" in Mexico, the \\"good guys\\") as they competed in matches with pre-determined outcomes. The focal point of four out of six matches for the evening was the ongoing storyline feud between the CMLL loyal wrestlers and a group of \\"outsiders\\" called Los Invasores that had shown up over the course of 2010. On April 12, 2010 a contingent of former AAA wrestlers including Psicosis II, Histeria, Maniaco, El Alebrije and Cuije showed up during a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) show in Puebla, Puebla. The group drove into the arena driving a black SUV and attacked La Sombra, El Hijo del Fantasma and La M√°scara after they just finished a match. Following the attack the former AAA wrestlers returned to the SUV and left the arena. The group was dubbed \\"Los Independientes\\" (Spanish for \\"The Independents\\"), referring to the fact that they all worked on the independent circuit and claimed to be better than the CMLL wrestlers, never actually stating that they represented AAA in any way. After weeks of run-ins the group wrestled their first match for CMLL on April 26, 2010. In their debut El Alebrije, Histeria and Psicosis defeated El Hijo del Fantasma, La Mascara and La Sombra. The group's name was subsequently changed to \\"LosS√∫per Luchas\\", before they finally settled on the name \\"Los Invasores\\" (Spanish for \\"the Invaders\\"). On May 16, 2010 Mr. √Åguila and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. made surprise appearances after an Invasores match, Mr. √Åguila returned to CMLL to side with Los Invasores while Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. ended up siding with the CMLL workers in their war against the outsider group. During a trios match against Los Invasores (represented by Alebrije, Histeria and Maniaco) H√©ctor Garza turned on his partners, Brazo de Plata and Toscano, and joined sides with Los Invasores. It was later announced that Garza and Mr. √Åguila were the co-leaders of Los Invasores. During a press conference Ol√≠mpico was revealed as part of the Invasores group, making him the only member to have never worked for AAA before. Los Invasores featured in four of the six matches at CMLL's 2010 Sin Salida show. The following month the Promociones Guti√©rrez 1st Anniversary Show featured a series of \\"CMLL vs. outsiders\\" matches, some featuring fully fledged Los Invasores members and some featuring wrestlers who did not regularly work for CMLL making a special appearance. One of the wrestlers who had not worked for CMLL up until that point was Charly Manson, who would parlay his appearance at the anniversary show into a full-time contract with CMLL as part of Los Invasores. The main event was a 5 team Ruleta de la Muerte elimination match that came down to M√≠stico and El Oriental (representing Los Invasores) wrestling in a Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match which M√≠stico won, forcing El Oriental to unmask. Over the summer of 2010 Psicosis II began to develop a feud with M√≠stico, which was used as the driving force behind booking a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta match that was the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show on September 4, 2010. El Alebrije, Histeria, Ol√≠mpico and Psicosis represented Los Invasores in the cage. The unmasked members of Los Invasores, specially Mr. √Åguila, Garza, Manson and El Oriental began a feud with La Peste Negra, which quickly led to a Lucha de Apuesta, a hair vs. hair match. The 14-man steel cage saw Histeria and El Alebrije leave the cage in the early parts of the match and Psicosis II escaping the cage as the 12th and las tman, all keeping their masks safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Ol√≠mpico to unmask him. In the weeks following the 77th Anniversary show Negro Casas and the rest of La Peste Negra (\\"The Black Plague\\") began to face off against various Invasores trios, oftentimes across from Charly Manson. During those matches the storyline that emerged was the personal rivalry between Casas and Los Invasores newest member Charly Manson, one that often saw Los Invasores either cheat to win or get intentionally disqualified as they attacked Casas. After several weeks of fighting Casas laid out a challenge to Manson for him to \\"bet\\" his hair on a Lucha de Apuestas between the two, a challenge Manson accepted, noting that he had never lost a Luchas de Apuestas match in his career. Event Despite the show featuring a major match in the main CMLL storyline of 2010 the show failed to sell out Arena M√©xico drawing around 8,700 people in the 16,500 seat venue. During the second match of the night female wrestler Estrellita tried to perform a Moonsault to the floor, a move which she leaps off the top rope and flips over, unfortunately she was not able to actually get enough distance on the leap to hit her target and instead hit the floor face first without anyone being able to try to protect her during the move. Shortly after the accident the match ended with La Amapola, Princesa Blanca and Princesa Sujei winning the match in two straight falls, allowing Estrellita to be helped to the back shortly after hitting the floor. The fifth match of the night, the third to feature CMLL and Invasores on opposite sides, was centered around the personal issues between CMLL representative La Sombra and Invasor Ol√≠mpico, focusing on the fact that La Sombra had won Ol√≠mpico's match at the previous month's CMLL 77th Anniversary Show and Ol√≠mpico was eager to gain his revenge. La Sombra teamed up with M√°scara Dorada and La M√°scara to take on Ol√≠mpico, Alebrije and Psicosis. The first fall ended after just over six minutes of wrestling as Psicosis pinned La M√°scara and Alebrije pinned M√°scara Dorada. In the second fall M√°scara Dorada pinned Ol√≠mpico, followed by La Sombra pinning El Alebrije to even the match between the two teams. In the closing moments of the match Ol√≠mpico tried to kick La Sombra in the groin, but Sombra caught the foot to prevent it. Instead Ol√≠mpico pulled off La Sombra's mask in full view of the referee to draw the disqualification, then he kicked La Sombra in the groin. Los Invasores ignored the referee and proceeded to beat up La M√°scara and M√°scara Dorada as well, stealing the masks of all three tecnicos and then challenging the team to a future Luchas de Apuestas match, a challenge that was ignored as the three tecnicos tried to cover up as best they could. A large part of the CMLL roster accompanied Negro Casas as he made his entrance in Arena M√©xico, showing that the tecnicos and rudos of CMLL were largely united against the \\"outside force\\". The CMLL wrestlers left ringside before the match could start to allow Negro Casas and Charly Manson to focus on each other. The official referee for the match was El Tirantes, a referee that actually came to CMLL with Los Invasores and that played the part of a crooked referee that favored the rudos, especially Los Invasores. In the opening minutes Casas and Manson both engaged in mat wrestling, both trying to apply some sort of submission hold on each other. After about four minutes of wrestling Manson was able to apply a modified Boston Crab on Casas who was forced to give up the first fall. The pro-CMLL crowd was pleased when Negro Casas quickly evened the score, pinning Charly Manson after just over a minute of wrestling. The third fall was very evenly matches, with neither gaining and advantage early on. About 10 minutes into the fall Casas manages to lock in a submission hold and forces his opponent to tab out, but El Tirantes had his back turned and intentionally ignored it as part of the match storyline. Moments later as Casas runs across the ring El Tirantes \\"Accidentally\\" points to something in the corner so that Negro Casas is clothes lined by the referee. The surprise move gives Manson enough of an opening to quickly roll Casas up and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match Charly Manson grabbed the scissors and made the first couple of cuts to Casas' hair, then proudly displayed it as a sort of trophy while Casas had his hair shaved off. During the celebrations the rest of Los Invasores came to the ring, including Estrellita who seemed to not be hurt too badly from the earlier fall. Aftermath Manson would only work a handful of matches for CMLL after Entre el Cielo y el Infierno, leaving the promotion by the end of November. On December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes Manson made a surprise return to AAA, when Cibern√©tico announced him as the newest member of his stable, Los Bizarros. Following the show Casas' La Peste Negra teammate stepped up to try to get revenge for his teammate as he began working opposite Manson and the rest of Los Invasores, after only a couple of shows the focus changed to Bucanero and Los Invasores co-leader Mr. √Åguila. The storyline between the two led to the main event of Sin Piedad (\\"No Mercy) on December 3, 2010 where Rey Bucanero defeated Mr. √Åguila in a Luchas de Apuestas match, forcing the co- leader to be shaved bald as a result. In 2011 the Los Invasores storyline was de-emphasized making them just another group in CMLL, not dominating the storylines. At the next major event after Sin Piedad, Homenaje a Dos Leyendas Los Invasores were not even represented on the show. Los Invasores would later hold the Mexican National Trios Championship on three occasions between 2011 and 2013. Reception S√∫per Luchas Magazine writer Israel Velazquez noted that the fifth match of the night was the best match of the night, which included both great team work and spectacular flying moves. He also pointed out that the entire crowd was shocked when Estrellita's moonsault to the outside came up short and she hit the floor. He felt that the homage to Blue Panther for 32 years of lucha libre was very emotional and well deserved. A reporter for the sports website MedioTiempo noted that the main event was a good fight and had a very vocal crowd through out the match, especially after the controversial finish. Following the show Gerardo Cu√©llar, a journalist who wrote for the sports website \\"Deportivoros\\" wrote an article stating that the show was a \\"goodbye to the serious and stable\\" stating that the rudo referee actions of El Tirantes was not in line with serious lucha libre shows that CMLL was known for, stating that they were becoming a circus.

The film stars Tye Sheridan, Kaitlyn Dever, Austin Abrams, Beau Mirchoff, Paula Malcomson and Annabeth Gish.  Plot  Conrad (Sheridan), Hunter (Abrams) and Tim (Lee) are close friends living in a small town. Grace (Dever) takes a liking to Conrad and they start spending a lot of time with each other, which stresses Conrad's relationship with Hunter and Tim. Having promised Hunter and Tim that they could hang out on The 4th of July, Conrad declines an invitation to watch the fireworks with Grace's family. The three boys drive around the town stealing garden ornaments and Conrad ‚Äì on a dare ‚Äì goes to steal a plant from the porch of Grace's house. Unbeknownst to them, Grace had earlier had a fight with her brother Eric, who has consequently stayed home while Grace and her parents went to see the fireworks. The boys are nearly caught and Eric gets in his car, chasing them to the outskirts of the town. The boys narrowly avoid a deer that wanders onto the road, but Eric hits the deer and crashes into a tree. The boys argue about whether to call for help, as he is still breathing, but leave the scene hoping that someone would pass along soon. The next day, word spreads through the town that Eric succumbed to his injuries and has died. Grace is ridden with guilt due to her fight with Eric and finds comfort in Conrad, who has fallen out with Tim and Hunter due to their refusal to help Eric at the scene of the accident. Conrad tries to tell Grace the truth but is interrupted by her parents. As Grace finds comfort in Conrad, the two become close. On the night that Grace's parents go away to Eric's college to pack up his dorm room, she loses her virginity to Conrad. Grace leaves to go to church the next morning, telling Conrad that he would have the house to himself, but her parents return early. Grace's parents discover the discarded condom wrapper and, feeling betrayed, tell Conrad to leave. Grace has a fight with her parents and goes to look for Conrad, finding him in an abandoned house he had shown her earlier. Conrad, now in distress, confesses the truth to Grace and she leaves, telling him that she never wants to see him again. Conrad goes home and tells his mother what had happened. Following this talk, he goes to see Grace's parents to tell them the truth and return the plant.

Career A native of Hainan, Chan was a Midshipman in Canton city (now \\"Guangzhou\\") during the final years of the Qing Dynasty when he became a committed republican. Throughout the Warlord Era he participated in several naval engagements in Southern China. In 1923 he was appointed Commander-in- Chief of the Guangdong Fleet, later renamed the 4th Fleet of the ROC Navy. At the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War Chan was given the additional position of Commander of the Fortresses of Humen; during a battle there in 1938 his left leg was wounded which eventually necessitated its amputation. In 1939 Chan, then a Rear Admiral, was sent to Hong Kong as Liaison Officer of the Nationalist Government. Under the cover as a stockbroker, he arranged for the transportation of materiel into China despite the Japanese blockade, and at the same time liaised with British colonial authorities, keeping the local Chinese population on-side, controlling the Triad gangs and identifying Japanese sympathisers. On 8 December 1941 the Battle of Hong Kong began; on Christmas Day the Governor, Sir Mark Aitchison Young, informed Chan of his intention to surrender to the Japanese. Chan decided to flee Hong Kong, and was given command of the five remaining Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats. In Aberdeen Harbour he and his entourage boarded the motor launch Cornflower II; while on the way to a rendezvous with the torpedo boats waiting south of Ap Lei Chau it was fired upon by Japanese forces. Chan ordered ‚ÄúAbandon Ship‚Äù, threw off his artificial leg, only to be shot at the left wrist; barely able to swim with one arm and one leg (he gave his life jacket to his bodyguard, who did not know how to swim), he was dragged ashore by his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hsu. The torpedo boats came to their rescue, then headed towards Mirs Bay at high speed. From there the escapees, with the help of Chinese guerrillas, walked for four days through Japanese-occupied territories towards Huizhou in unoccupied China. Altogether sixty eight British, Chinese and Danish intelligence, naval and marine personnel were saved in the breakout, including David Mercer MacDougall, who had worked with Chan on intelligence matters. For this feat Chan was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1942. From September 1945 to June 1946, Chan was the Mayor of Guangzhou. He died in Guangzhou on 31 August 1949, during the final weeks of the Chinese Civil War, officially from a stomach ulcer, although there was speculation that he was poisoned by agents of Chiang Kai-shek.

History seal 1950-1994 seal Upon the creation of Occidental Mindoro in 1950, a seal was adopted for the province. The 1950 seal resembles that of its neighboring province of Oriental Mindoro.

Present seal  The present seal was adopted through the initiatives of Governor Josephine Ramirez-Sato started in early 1992. The provincial government organized a seal design competition in an effort to find a new design to replace the 1950 seal. Five final designs were chosen from the entries submitted on November 15, 1992 and was three designs were chosen from the five. Augusto Viray Jr. was announced first-place winner of the competition and his design was chosen as the primary basis of the current seal. At the beginning of 1993, Governor Sato organized a committee to finalize the design of the new seal base on the designs of the finalists of the 1992 competition through Executive Order No. 93-02. The final seal design was submitted to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for approval. During the regular session of the provincial council held on June 21, 1993, Resolution No. 106, Ss. 93 was passed and approved by the Board adopting the new and modified official seal of the province. The draft seal along with relevant documents were submitted to the Department of Interior and Local Government on July 20, 1993, where it was studied for two months. The draft seal was then forwarded to the department's Bureau of Local Government Services and on October 13, 1993, it was submitted to the National Historical Commission. On November 4, 1993 the draft was returned to the Office of the Governor of Occidental Mindoro for final comment and possible revision. No revisions were made and the draft design was submitted to the National Historical Institute. In a telegram sent by the National Historical Institute dated February 11, 1994, Governor Sato was informed that the design for the new seal design was approved. On March 2, 1994, the seal was publicly presented by Governor Sato at the Provincial Developmental Council meeting held on March 2, 1994. By March 21, 1994, the seal was officially adopted for use of the provincial government.

It was considered to be a spiritual successor to P.T., the playable teaser for the cancelled video game Silent Hills. Before being funded by Team17, the game's development was fan-based. On 4 June 2016, the Allison Road Twitter account announced the game's cancellation. Two months later, on August 22, 2016 an announcement was made on the Twitter account indicating that work on the game had resumed. However, no further progress has been reported by the game's creators since. Gameplay The gameplay of Allison Road is similar to that of P.T., presenting a minimal storyline which the player must solve. While not wanting to reveal too much of the actual game, developers stated the full version may be slightly different. According to the development team, \\"pretty much all of our core mechanics are in place, however, some actually didn't make the cut-off for the video; the inventory is one of those things.\\" Most of the objects found by the player in the house can be interacted with or inspected, and the player is shown in the teaser being able to equip bladed weapons such as a meat cleaver. Plot The player controls an unnamed protagonist who awakens in his townhouse with a splitting headache, who exclaims that he needs to find some Aspirin. Exploring the ground floor of his house, the protagonist expresses confusion at seemingly-familiar objects and photographs, suggesting that he is also suffering from amnesia. After retrieving a packet of Lemsip tablets from the master bedroom, the protagonist exclaims that he needs water (to drink with the tablets), and ventures further around the house, gradually becoming stalked by a supernatural entity of some sort. As the player explores the house, evidence gathered from letters and photos suggest his family has been the victim of a heinous crime. Most rooms, including the back garden and patio of the house, can be explored by the player. Though some doors are initially locked, some eventually open as the teaser progresses. In the final moments of the trailer, the player discovers a ghoulish figure, assumed to be the ghost of his wife, which attacks him just before the screen cuts to black. Development On 1 July 2015, a 13-minute-long pre-alpha video was released. The style was considered a homage to P.T., the playable teaser for Silent Hills. The game was being developed on Unreal Engine 4. To fund the game, developer Lilith Ltd. created a Kickstarter asking for ¬£250,000. However, the campaign was cancelled, as Team17 became the game's publisher, which would provide funds for the team to develop the game. The Switch releases were not certain, as Team17 had not yet promised that it would be released on those platforms. It was thought that it might when the game was being funded by Kickstarter. According to their website, the developers were aiming to a Q3 2016 release. On 4 June 2016, the Allison Road Twitter account announced the game's cancellation. Two months later, on August 22, it was announced that development would resume without Team17 involvement as a publisher and under the newly formed studio Far From Home, consisting of the game's creator, Chris Kesler, and his wife.

Ten Koreans and the Chinese bus driver were killed, and another 17 were injured (eight seriously). A Korean government official who traveled to China after the accident committed suicide on July 5, 2015 in Ji'an. Location Ji'an is a popular tourist area in Northeast China due to the province's location on the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border, with the two countries separated by the Yalu River, and is the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom. It has eight tourist routes to accommodate tourists, many en route to the DPRK. South Korean officials said the accident victims were part of a 140-person delegation of mainly government employees, on a training program organized by the Local Government Officials Development Institute, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, travelling in a six-bus caravan. The group was in China to tour historical sites, including places where Korean independence fighters resisted Japan's colonial rule before the end of the Second World War. Accident On July 1, 2015, a bus carrying 26 South Koreans and two Chinese in Ji'an drove off a bridge into a river some below. The South Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the initial report. The accident occurred around 15:30 (3:30 p.m.) local time, while the bus was traveling on the Ji-dan Highway () towards the Chinese border city of Dandong. The bridge was on a highway that links Yanji, Jilin province, with Dandong in the neighbouring Liaoning province. A screenshot from CCTV footage (with a timestamp of 15:36:21) shows the bus crashing through the north side of the bridge. The bus was owned by the Xinshiji Tour Agency. All 28 passengers were injured or killed: eight died at the scene, one died after arriving at the hospital and the Chinese driver died at the hospital the following day. The remaining 17 passengers were injured, with eight reported in intensive care. One 36-year-old passenger's injuries were described as life-threatening. The injured were initially treated at a Ji'an hospital, then transferred to the First Hospital of Jilin University in Changchun on July 2. Eighteen students majoring in Korean at the Jilin Huaqiao University of Foreign Languages in Changchun volunteered to serve as interpreters for each of the injured and their families, who began arriving from South Korea. Investigation The cause for the accident is under investigation. Speeding and driver error may have led to the crash, which was captured on CCTV, Yonhap News Agency reported. No oncoming traffic was present on the bridge. A South Korean consular official in the nearby city of Shenyang was sent to the accident scene and an accident response team was formed. South Korea's Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn made provisions for relevant authorities to work with China for the handling of the case. The China's Foreign Ministry reported they had contacted Seoul and would take care of funeral arrangements for the victims. On July 5, 2015, in a preliminary report, Ji'an officials said they had determined speeding and improper turning to be the cause of the accident. The speed limit on the mountain road was 40 km/h (approximately 25 mph), in the section of the road, and the driver was reported to be travelling a speed of 64 to 88 km/h. City officials said that tests ruled out the possibility the driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Suicide of Choi Doo- yeong On July 5, a Republic of Korea official coordinating the aftermath of the accident was found dead in Ji'an in a suspected suicide. Choi Doo-yeong, 55, was president of the Republic of Korea's Local Government Officials‚Äô Development Institute that organized the trip. He was found on the ground outside his hotel around 3 a.m. and is believed to have jumped to his death. Yonhap News Agency reported Chinese officials had ruled out homicide based on surveillance images and witness testimony. Choi had accompanied Chung Chae- gun, Korea's Vice Minister of Government Administration and Home Affairs, to Ji'an after the accident to provide assistance.

Life Born in Rome, Ferrazzi was the eldest son of the sculptor Stanislao Ferrazzi. In 1904, he was trained in the studio of Francesco Bergamini, a former pupil of Michele Cammarano. The following year he attended the Scuola Libera del Nudo and at the Accademia di Francia. He first exhibited at the 1907 Exhibition (LXXVII Esposizione Internazionale di Belle Arti) in Rome. In 1910, he won a scholarship to the Instituto Catel which allowed him to take up art as a career. In 1913, he exhibited Genetrix at the First Roman Secession Exhibition (Prima Esposizione internazionale d'arte della Secessione Romana). In December, he was granted the national art pension which gave him financial security and allowed him to set up a studio in Via Ripetta. A visit to the Louvre in Paris revealed his interest in Georges Seurat whose style was similar to his own. In 1926, he became a professor at the Accademia di San Luca. The same year he was the first Italian to win the Carnegie Prize. In the spring of 1933, he was elected to the Italian Academy. After the war, he created mainly religious works, both paintings and sculptures. In the 1950s, he spent most of his time at the Casa di Santo Stefano in Monte Argentario where he created his ambient sculpture Il Teatro della Vita (The Theatre of Life). After taking an early interest in Futurism, Ferrazzi finally moved back to Neoclassicism. He is remembered in particular for his interest in encaustic painting which he used in his murals.

United States, 15 Ct. Cl. 162, 167 (1879) (describing United States v. Barker as a case involving a \\"motion for costs\\"); Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 224 (D.C.

Jardine, 81 F.2d 747, 748 (5th Cir. 1936). Background In English common law, parties to litigation could never receive costs unless costs were specifically provided for by statute.Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 223 (D.C. June 3, 1889). The first law to provide plaintiffs the possibility of recovering costs was the Statute of Gloucester (6 Edward I), which allowed for costs in a limited range of cases. The first statute providing costs for defendants was 23 Henry VIII, and costs for penal actions were made available by the statute of 4 James I. However, \\"because of its position as sovereign suing in its own courts,\\" costs were never available against the government. William Blackstone noted in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that the King would never pay or receive costs at trial.3 Blackstone, , 400. In the 1796 case United States v. La Vengeance, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of a citizen who claimed the government had unlawfully seized his ship, and the Court affirmed his judgment \\"with costs\\" charged against the federal government.United States v. La Vengeance, 3 U.S. 297, 3 Dall. 297 (1796). However, the day after the Court issued its ruling in La Vengeance, Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth ordered the words \\"with costs\\" be struck from the opinion.. According to Chief Justice John Marshall, Ellsworth \\"observed, in doing this, the court did not mean to be understood as at all deciding the question, whether, in any case, they could award costs against the United States, but left it entirely open for future discussion.\\" Although this question remained unsettled for twenty years after La Vengeance, the Court's opinion in United States v. Barker \\"finally disposed of the question forever.\\"Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 224 (D.C. June 3, 1889).

History  The web site was launched in 1999 by Illya D'Addezio with the purpose of highlighting new and unique resources available to genealogists. Within the next three years, several niche web sites would be acquired and integrated, and a team of writers was assembled to create original content. In 2001, Genealogy Today acquired the rights to and archived materials of a newsletter with the same name that had been launched in April 1997 by The Genealogy Lady, along with responsibility for the GenToday-L mailing list. At the same time, a collection of online databases, references, and articles co-hosted with that newsletter at Enoch.com was also acquired. As the free information available on Genealogy Today grew, so did the demand for (and interest in offering) more exclusive articles and vital records. In the Fall of 2003, a database of transcribed records from original sources‚Äîmostly smaller in size and published in limited quantities than a genealogist would find elsewhere‚Äîwas soft-launched, and in the Spring of 2004 formally released.

He is notable for defending the city of Puebla from the French army March 16, 1863 to May 16, 1863. . Early life Ortega was born on January 20, 1822 in San Mateo, in Valpara√≠so, Zacatecas, he moved his residence to the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he began his law studies, same as for family reasons could not conclude. While still very young, he came to the town of San Juan Bautista of Te√∫l (today Te√∫l Gonzalez Ortega), where he served as a clerk at City Hall. Since his youth he was a fervent supporter of the Liberal Party. Military career General Jesus Gonzalez Ortega tomb located in the Pante√≥n Civil de Dolores Cemetery in Mexico City. Although Gonz√°lez Ortega was not a career soldier, he was head of the army of President Juarez in 1860 and lead his them to victory in the desisive battle of Calpulalpan. In March 1861, he was appointed Minister of War, but due to differences with some cabinet members, he resigned but remained in command of the division of Zacatecas. In August 8, 1861 the Battle of San Felipe del Obraje took place under his command. Following the 1861 murders of Melchor Ocampo, Santos Degollado and Leandro Valle, he returned to Mexico City and was appointed president of the Supreme Court of the Nation, a position that placed the holder as successor to the president of the republic.

History Planeta 99.1 logo used from 2015-2018 and in June and early July 2019 XHEPR's concession was awarded to Javier Moreno Valle, a Mexican businessman and founder of Mexico City television station XHTVM-TV, on September 30, 1994. In 2000, Moreno Valle, facing difficulty with a dispute over the Mexico City station, sold the station to Radio Integral, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo ACIR), which had already been operating the station as grupera \\"La Comadre\\". That year, in partnership with US company Clear Channel Communications, which at the time owned 40% of ACIR, XHEPR became \\"99.1 The Bandit\\", playing classic rock in English. It later became classic hits-formatted \\"The Eagle 99.1\\". Eventually, ACIR sold XHEPR to Grupo Radiorama (with operation handled by Grupo Radio M√©xico), though the concession remained in the name of Radio Integral until late 2015.

The film is produced under Sri Sravanthi Movies banner. The film stars Ram Pothineni and Raashi Khanna in the lead roles. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and it was a box office failure. Plot Shiva (Ram) is a young and happy-go-lucky guy who supports love marriage and keeps helping couples to get married against their parents will. One day when he is in a train, he sees Tanu (Rashi Khanna) proposing to him loudly. He eventually jumps out. Tanu runs away after her friend Rishitha (Himaja) said her acting was good, but asked to whom she proposed. Shiva finally follows Tanu in a school. Tanu was doing rehearsal for her acting in theatre. He thought that Tanu fell in love with him. But she continuously rejects him. He makes Rishi's marriage with her lover and asks Tanu to turn back if she loves him, or he would never come into her life. But Bhoji Reddy's (Vineet Kumar) men come to beat him because he had beaten up his son. He says that if she turns back, he would beat them up; if she doesn't, he would come with them. Eventually, Abhi (Abhimanyu Singh), who was looking for Shiva, takes Tanu with him. Shiva beats them up after a man says that she turned back. Abhi reveals that Tanu was always lucky for him and wants to marry her. Shiva takes her away at her wedding, leaving a fight between Abhi and Bhoji. They both unite and search for Shiva. Tanu and Shiva go to Goa. In that time, Tanu falls for him. When she is about to propose to him, he fights with some goons to make two lovers unite. As he is seriously wounded, she asks him either she or they. Shiva eventually supports them, which makes her emotional. Bhoji kidnaps her. Shiva's father (Posani Krishna Murali) reveals that his son's real name is Ram. Ram and Shiva were best friends, until Shiva committed suicide. Ram learns that he loved a girl who also committed suicide. He hid this because Ram would risk his life to get them married. After hearing this, Tanu realizes her mistake, Bhoji too gives up, and Abhi goes through memory loss. As the film ends on a happy note, Tanu meets Shiva at a mall, falls in love with him and they live happily together.

Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that prosecutors may use a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol test as evidence of guilt and that the introduction of such evidence at trial does not violate the suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.South Dakota v. Neville, . Background In Schmerber v. California (1966), the Supreme Court held that the extraction and analysis of blood samples does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.Schmerber v. California, . However, in the years following Schmerber, a split of authority emerged in state courts with regard to whether the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self incrimination prohibited the use of a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt.Neville, 459 U.S. at 558 (\\"we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict\\"). South Dakota, for example, passed a statute that stated a person's refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol test ‚Äúmay be admissible into evidence at the trial.‚ÄùNeville, 459 U.S. at 556 (citing S.D.Comp.Laws Ann. ¬ß 32‚Äì23‚Äì10.1). Arrest of Mason Henry Neville On the evening of July 19, 1980, Mason Henry Neville was stopped by two Madison, South Dakota police officers after they observed Neville's car drive past a stop sign without stopping.Neville, 459 U.S. at 554; see also Brief for Petitioner, South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (U.S. 1983). When officers asked Neville to step out of his car, he \\"staggered and fell against the car to support himself.\\"Neville, 459 U.S. at 554. After failing several field sobriety tests, officers placed Neville under arrest.Neville, 459 U.S. at 555. Officers asked Neville if he would submit to a blood-alcohol test, but he refused, stating ‚ÄúI'm too drunk, I won't pass the test.‚Äù At trial, Neville filed a motion to suppress all evidence associated with his refusal to take a blood alcohol test on the grounds that it violated his privilege against self incrimination.Neville, 459 U.S. at 556. The Supreme Court of South Dakota agreed that admitting evidence of Neville's refusal to take the test violated his privilege against self incrimination,State v. Neville, 312 N.W.2d 723 (S.D. 1981). and state prosecutors appealed to the United States Supreme Court.South Dakota v. Neville, (granting certiorari). Opinion of the Court In a 7-2 opinion, the Supreme Court held that prosecutors could use a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt, and the introduction of this evidence at trial does not violate the suspect's Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. Writing for the Court's majority, Justice O'Connor concluded that \\"the state did not directly compel respondent to refuse the test.\\"Neville, 459 U.S. at 562-63. Additionally, Justice O'Connor wrote that a \\"simple blood-alcohol test is so safe, painless, and commonplace\\" that a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse the test. Justice O'Connor also ruled that suspects who refuse to submit to a blood test are not entitled to Miranda warnings about the consequences of refusing the test because officers made it clear that a refusal to submit to a test may lead to \\"adverse consequences.\\"Neville, 459 U.S. at 566. Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Marshall wrote a dissenting opinion in which they argued that the Court in Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.Neville, 459 U.S. at 570 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Thompson (June 15, 1926 ‚Äì April 1, 2016), also known as Yelena Vladimirovna Mayakovskaya (), was an American philosopher and author of more than 20 books. She was one of the two known children of the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, the other being Gleb-Nikita Lavinsky (1921‚Äì1986). This fact was kept a secret until 1991. Biography In summer 1925 Mayakovsky visited New York, where he met Russian √©migr√© Elli Jones (born Yelizaveta Petrovna Zibert), an interpreter who spoke Russian, French, German and English fluently. They fell in love, for three months were inseparable, but decided to keep their affair secret. Soon after the poet's return to the Soviet Union, Elli gave birth to Patricia. Mayakovsky saw her just once, in Nice, France, in 1928, when she was three. By the time Thompson was born, her mother married George Jones, who treated Thompson as his own daughter, both privately and officially ‚Äì Patricia had his last name in her youth. He taught English to Patricia, who then spoke a little bit of Russian, German and French. Later, when she gave birth to a son, she named him George after her stepfather. Thompson became a professor of philosophy and women's studies at Lehman College in New York. She published a book describing her parents' love affair, based on her mother's unpublished memoirs and their conversations. In 1991, after the death of her mother and the collapse of the Soviet Union, she traveled to Russia with her son, where they were welcomed with respect. Since then she keeps a dual name, Patricia Thompson and Yelena Vladimirovna Mayakovskaya. As of 2015 she wished to learn Russian, which she could not speak anymore, and obtain Russian citizenship.

It is a cinematic portrait of Siddheshwari Devi, a Hindustani classical music singer from Varanasi, India. It was produced by the Films Division of India. The film was awarded the National Award for the Best Documentary for that year in India. Synopsis Although the film defies a linear plot structure, it begins with a bilingual scrolling text in Hindi and English that indicates the dominant thematic that film is knitted with. The narrative meanders between the biographic moments of Siddheshwari Devi's life, that describes her relationship with her guru and her benefactor, intertwined with the mythic history of thumri and tappa as a musical form located in the medieval ghats, gullies and mansions of Varanasi.

In a review for The New York Times, Caryn James compared the film with an abstract painting, \\"wildly open to interpretation\\".

Thanu. The film stars Vijay, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, and Amy Jackson. Featuring music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar and cinematography handled by George C. Williams. The story revolves around a baker who holds a secret identity as former Deputy commissioner of police and he is on a secret Ghost Protocol mission organised by the Commissioner of police. The film began production in Chennai during early July 2015. Action scenes were filmed throughout November, though the shoot was disrupted by the heavy flooding in Chennai. In addition, poor climatic conditions in China meant that the team had to abandon their idea of filming sequences there and instead opted to shoot in Bangkok. The film had a worldwide release on 14 April 2016. The film was also dubbed into Telugu and was released as Policeodu on 15 April 2016. By the end of its first 6 days in theaters, Theri had grossed . In the United Kingdom, it broke Enthiran's (2010) box office collection for the first weekend. Vijay won the Entertainer of the Year award for his performance in the film at the 6th South Indian International Movie Awards in 2017. The film was adapted into Assamese as Ratnakar (2019). Plot Joseph Kuruvilla (Vijay) leads a happy life in Kerala with his daughter Niveditha alias Nivi (Baby Nainika), and runs a bakery with Rajendran (Rajendran). He meets Annie (Amy Jackson), Nivi's class teacher, and they both become good friends. After a series of mishaps and run- ins with local gangsters, Annie finds out that Joseph is none other, but, the \\"late\\" Vijay Kumar. Joseph reveals his past as Vijay Kumar to Annie but warns her not to tell Nivi about it. Five years ago, Vijay Kumar was an honest and upright DCP in Chennai. He takes up a case involving the rape and subsequent death of an IT employee named Raji. He finds out that the rapist is Ashwin, the son of Labor Minister Vanamaamalai (J. Mahendran). Vijay kills Ashwin and reveals himself as the murderer to Vanamaamalai, who swears to take revenge on him for killing his son. Meanwhile, Vijay falls in love with a medical student named Mithra (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), and both eventually get married and lead a happy life. Unfortunately, Vijay's happiness is short-lived as Vanamaamalai, his younger brother Ratnam (Azhagam Perumal), and their henchmen barge into his house one night and kill Mithra and Vijay's mother (Raadhika). They brutally assault Vijay and attempt to drown his baby daughter, Nivi, in the bathtub. A dying Mithra manages to rescue Nivi and asks Vijay to take care of her, but not before making him promise that he will quit the police force and become a peaceful and loving father to Nivi, before dying in Vijay's arms. Vijay fakes his death, changes his name to Joseph Kuruvilla and maintains a low profile by moving to Kerala with Nivi and his constable friend Rajendran to protect Nivi from Vanamaamalai and his gang. One day, while Nivi is on an excursion, the brakes of the school bus in which Nivi is traveling fails, and the bus plunges into the backwater. Vijay, with the help of Annie, Rajendran, and the local people, manages to rescue Nivi and the other children. He finds out that Vanamaamalai, who has realized that he and Nivi are still alive, was responsible for the bus plunging into the backwater in order to kill Nivi. Enraged, he decides to abandon his nonviolent principles and destroy Vanamaamalai and his gang once and for all. Vijay, posing himself as the \\"ghost\\" of Vijay Kumar, starts eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen one-by-one. He first kills Inspector Karikalan (Stun Siva), who is one of Vanamaamalai's henchmen and was present at the night when Mithra was killed. The police are baffled at the murder as it was done within the police station and refuse to believe that Vijay committed the murder since they think that he is dead. The \\"mysterious deaths\\" continue, with Vijay pushing Ratnam to his death from a high-story building being constructed by him. Vanamaamalai is accused of killing Ratnam since both had fallen out, forcing him to go into hiding. Finally, Vijay allows himself to be captured by Vanamaamalai's henchmen in order to enter his hideout. After eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen, Vijay kills him. The police soon arrive at Vanamaamalai's hideout, only to see his dead body hanging from the ceiling, and with nobody else around, his murder also gets sensationalized in the media as a mysterious murder. It is soon revealed that the Chennai commissioner of police Sibi Chakravarthi (Prabhu) is aware that Vijay is alive and secretly re-employs him in the police to reduce crime in Chennai in his \\"ghost\\" form, taking advantage of the fear the negative elements of the society have for Vijay, while publicly denying that he is still alive. A few years later, Vijay, an older Nivi (Divya Saasha), Annie and Rajendran have moved to Ladakh, with Vijay having changed his name to Dharmeshwar. But he continues to work secretly for the Chennai Police, eliminating crime in his \\"ghost\\" form. Cast * Vijay as D. C. P.

Thanu signed on to finance a project directed by Atlee, which would feature Vijay. Atlee continued to script the film through late 2014, while it was announced that Vijay would join the team to start filming after the completion of his other venture, Puli (2015). Actresses Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Amy Jackson were reported to have signed the film in January 2015, after a few Hindi actresses turned down the opportunity to work on a Tamil film. Several of the technical crew involved in Atlee's previous film, Raja Rani (2013), were also added to the team including music composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematographer George C. Williams, editor Ruben and art director T. Muthuraj. An official launch event was held at the Kerala Club House on the East Coast Road in Chennai, with several members of the cast and crew in attendance. Alongside the lead actor, it was revealed that Prabhu, Raadhika, director Mahendran, and actress Meena's daughter Nainika would be a part of the film. Several titles for the film including Moondru Mugam, Vetri, Thuppaki 2, Khakee and Thaarumaaru were considered, before the makers finalised Theri in late November 2015. Filming The film began production in Chennai during early July 2015 and an introductory song for Vijay was shot in the city, followed by scenes featuring the actor and Samantha Prabhu on the East Coast Road. Further scenes in Chennai were shot at Adityaram Studios and at Binny Mills, where art director T. Muthuraj had erected a huge set. Raadhika was also a part of the shoot, while actress Sunaina shot for one day in the schedule which ended in mid July 2015. The second schedule for the film restarted in Chennai during August 2015 and went on for twenty five days. Vijay and Samantha Prabhu participated in shooting of the month, while production was briefly delayed owing to a strike held by the Tamil Film Producers council against FEFSI employees. MGM Dizzee World on the East Coast Road was also used as a location to film sequences during August 2015. A further schedule began again for a month long shoot in September 2015 in Chennai. In November 2015, it was revealed that the film was \\"seventy percent complete\\" and portions involving Samantha Prabhu had finished being shot. Thereafter, Amy Jackson subsequently joined the team in Chennai to shoot for her part during a new schedule. Action scenes, choreographed by Dhilip Subbarayan were filmed throughout the month, with the shoot disrupted by the heavy flooding in Chennai. Hollywood action choreographer Kaloyan Vodenicharov worked with the team in early December 2015 to help shoot the climax portions for the film. Poor climatic conditions in China meant that the team had to abandon their idea of filming sequences there and instead opted to shoot in Bangkok. Sets were erected in a factory in Chennai to shoot the climax scenes, with stunt choreographer Kaloyan Vodenicharov recruited to help train artistes and film the sequences during December 2015. Release The film had a worldwide release on 14 April 2016 It was dubbed into Telugu and was released as Policeodu ( Police Man}}) also on 15 April 2016, however, the title was later on altered to Police and was to be remade in Telugu with Ravi Teja. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sun TV. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. IndiaGlitz.com rated the film 3 out of 5 and called it \\"An entertaining revenge drama from Atlee and Vijay\\". Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times rated the film 2.5 out of 5, saying, \\"When I walk into a Vijay film, I know exactly what I would be pounded with-- cyclonic action, humongous heroism, nobility and syrupy romance.

Sify also rated the film 3 out of 5 stars saying that \\"Vijay's scorching screen presence and his infectious energy is the highlight.\\" Behindwoods also rated the film 2.75 stars out of 5, stating that \\"The Theri man has given his best.

It was adopted on March 11, 1970 by the virtue of Provincial Board Resolution No. 319. Cagayan is one of the few Philippine provinces to have a distinctly- designed flag, deviating from the standard flag design of the provincial seal on a colored field. The flag has a proportion of 1:2, the same as the flag of the Philippines. Symbolism The colors of the flag has the following symbolisms: *Sky blue: signifies justice, honor, and nobility of the province's inhabitants, their sincerity and traditionally peaceful ways. Also represents the azure skies. *Gold: symbolizes the wealth of the province and represents the color of the bright sun. *Green: depicts the fertile soil of the province and also seeks to inspire hope among the people. It also represents the verdant mountains and plains of the province. The 29 white, five-pointed stars ringing the coat-of-arms represent the 29 component city and municipalities comprising the province. The coat-of-arms has the following symbolisms: *Yellow (or Gold) color: symbolizes the wealth of the province *Blue color: stands for justice, honor, nobility of the people, their sincerity and traditional peaceful ways; *Blue column dividing the shield: depicts the Cagayan River, which served as the border between the two original congressional districts of Cagayan; *Small islands at the top portion of the shield: represent the small islands on the northern part of the province; *Tobacco plants (left) and rice stalks (right): represent agriculture; rice and tobacco‚Äîalong with corn and peanuts‚Äîare the province's main agricultural crops, and are major sources of income for its people. Specifications Provincial seal of Cagayan. The length of the flag is twice its width, and the horizontal stripes are of equal size. The coat-of-arms (shield) is drawn in black outline, and placed off-centered towards the hoist of the flag. The shield's height is approximately 1 and 1/4 the width of any of the stripes (or 5/12 of the flag width). The shield's width is calculated to be at 5/14 of the flag width (or 5/28 of the flag length), given that the specification for the width-to-height ratio of the shield is set at 6:7. The position of the shield in the flag is determined by first measuring two shield widths (5/7 of the flag width, or 5/14 of the flag length) from the edge of the fly, and then centering the shield in the remainder of the field. The exact horizontal position of the center of the shield is therefore at the point measuring 9/28 of the flag length from the hoist. The shield abuts the blue stripe, straddles the gold stripe, and extends into the green stripe.

She gained many fans after releasing the song, Irja Ilyya (Return to Me), based on a poem by Nizar Qabbani whose sister had committed suicide rather than enter into an arranged marriage. The song's feminist lyrics struck a chord with fans. During the 1970s, Najat added original lines to the song during 1970s‚Äô performances, demonstrating her capacity for \\"inspired interpretation\\".Nouraie-Simone, F. (ed), On Shifting Ground: Muslim Women in the Global Era, The Feminist Press at CUNY, 2014, p. 101 In a recorded interview,, Recorded Najat 1960s Interview in the mid-1960s for Egyptian TV with the presenter Ms Salwa Hegzi, Nagat stated that she had, at that time, eight brothers and sisters. Lately, some media outlets are indicating double that number; the most frequently mentioned is seventeen brothers and sisters., British Broadcasting Corporation \\"BBC\\", 2001/06/28: \\"Egyptians mourn screen Cinderella\\". The discrepancy between eight and seventeen siblings can be readily explained by the nature of an extended family. Najat is one of eight siblings (four boys: Ezz Eddin, Nabil, Farooq and Sami; and four girls: Khadiga, Samira, Najat herself and Afaf) from her father's first marriage; as well as three half-sisters from her father's second marriage to Gawhara (Kawther, Soad, Sabah). Following Gawhara's divorce from Hosni and remarriage to Abdel Monem Hafez, another six children were born (three boys: Jaheer, Jaser and Jalaa; and three girls: Gehan, Janjah and Jeely). The grand total of 17 is made up of eight full siblings; three half- sisters and six step-siblings. In the same interview, Nagat confirmed that she was brought up in a home where most of her brothers and sisters were artists., Alsharq Al Awsat newspaper, 2001/08/03, No. 8284: Article on Soad Hosni and her family by Mayad Beloun. Home of artists Her father's household was known as \\"the home of the Artists\\". Leading artists from across the Arab world regularly visited Hosni's home in Khan el-Khalili, Cairo. He nurtured his children's talents and encouraged them to pursue careers in the performing and visual arts.It may be worth noting that some sources, especially Arabic media report, occasionally repeat stories that Hosni was cruel father and denied his daughters an education. These rumours appear to be based on a largely fictionalised TV drama, but have been repeated occasionally in the Arabic media, and in at least one Dictionary of Biography (Ginsberg, T. and Lippard, C., Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema, Scarecrow Press, 2010, pp 181‚Äì182). Hosni's son, Ezz Eddin, dismissed these rumours about his family life, stressing that he and his siblings were raised in a supportive and artistic household where their talents were nurtured from a very young age.

Soad Hosni performed in more than 80 films the last of which was released in 1991, and had five marriages and no children. Marriages Nagat had two marriages. Her first marriage was at young age, in 1955, when she was 16 (or 17) years old to an Egyptian man called Kamal Mansi who was a friend of her brother. She was divorced around 1960 and remarried in 1967. Nagat also divorced from her second husband, Egyptian film director Houssam El-Din Mustafa (1926‚Äì2000), shortly afterwards and has remained single to date. Media reports suggest that she made a decision to devote her life to raising her only child, Waleed, from her first marriage, and to her work. Vocal development and style In the first 10 years of her singing career Nagat imitated other singers. Renowned Egyptian journalist Fekry Abaza (1896‚Äì1979) demanded the State should support the young gifted Nagat. According to her family that period \\"trained\\" her voice. However, in 1949, the iconic Egyptian music composer Mohamed Abdel wahab (1902‚Äì1991) actually filed an official complaint at the Police station against Nagat's father. He claimed that such training hindered the natural process of her voice development and that she should be left alone to develop freely without it. , Arabic newspaper \\"Al Watan\\" in Qatar, 2012/10/03: Article on Nagat El Sagheera's retirement., 2009/07/20 2 \\"Mohammed Abdul-Wahab\\", latest update 2015/06/30. Nagat broke away from imitating other singers when she released her own first song in 1955 at the age of 16 years. In the above-mentioned 1960s interview, Nagat herself indicated her first song was \\"Why did you allow me to love you?\\" Thereafter she released several other songs for Radio stations. Each song had duration of 7 to 8 minutes. She began to deliver \\"long-duration\\" songs. Each of these songs tells a story and each typically lasts for some 20‚Äì40 minutes in studio recordings. To hold onto her audience for the longer durations on stage Nagat turned her attention to people like Nizar Qabbani. His classic poetic styles combine simplicity and elegance in exploring themes of love and feminism.\\"Nizar Qabbani: From Romance to Exile‚Äù, Muhamed Al Khalil, 2005, A dissertation submitted to the faculty of the Department of Near Eastern Studies in partial ulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Graduate College of the University of Arizona, USA., Art and information: text of ‚ÄúMata?‚Äù as written by Nizar Qabbani and as sung by Najat Al Saghira., Arabic news channel \\"Al Arabiya\\" in Saudi Arabia, original Article in December 2006 (latest update: 2011/11/01): ‚ÄúNajat Al Saghira: This is my story with Nizar‚Äù.

In total, Nagat El Sagheera may have recorded more than 200 songs;, Najat songs (about 200 recordings). top 53 of which are available on Apple's iTunes web site, Najat Al Saghira Albums. She built on this success in subsequent years, despite the difficulty of finding new outstanding poems and corresponding music compositions. To combat this shortage, she was forced to rely on her own abilities in performance. For example, in 1976, at the age of 37, she performed several songs in her last film \\"Dried Tears\\". One of these songs was \\"Mata?\\" derived from the poem written by Nizar Qabbani with music by Abdul Wahab. The duration of this song in the film was less than ten minutes. In the years that followed, Nagat sang it several times on stage; the last time was in 2002. One of those repeats was in the 1980s when she was in her 40s. In this performance, she extended the delivery of this song from below 10 minutes in the film to about one hour on the stage. Many consider this specific performance on the stage one of her lifetime bests. It was recorded and can be easily found on YouTube., Najat singing \\"Mata?\\" on stage Recognition and legacy Nagat's stage performances are at the core of her legacy.

Shown are Binay (left) and Jonvic Remulla (right) who is the incumbent governor of Cavite. In May 2014, Binay began his search for a running mate. As his potential running mate Senator Jinggoy Estrada in jail due to his implication in the PDAF scam, Binay's offers were declined by JV Ejercito, Manny Villar (via wife Cynthia Villar), Vilma Santos (via husband Ralph Recto), Mar Roxas, Grace Poe, Rodrigo Duterte and Joseph Estrada. Binay's daughter Abigail, also the Representative from Makati, said that Binay would accept anyone as his running mate except for Antonio Trillanes, and that she prefers Grace Poe. On June 12, Independence Day, speech in Iloilo, President Aquino said that he could only offer Binay the conduct of a clean and honest election, but not an outright endorsement. On June 22, Binay resigned from the Aquino cabinet, both as presidential adviser on Overseas Filipino Workers' concerns and as chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, but did not say why. Two days later, Binay addressed the public from his Coconut Palace offices, branding the current administration as \\"manhid at palpak\\" (insensitive and bumbling), but did not mention Aquino by name. He also accused the administration of committing sins against him and the people. In June 2015 he polled first among expected presidential candidates for the 2016 Philippine general election. However, in the September 2015 Pulse Asia he placed third after Senator Grace Poe and Mar Roxas, the ruling Liberal Party presidential candidate. His trust rating had also dropped 19%. According to Inquirer.Net, his numbers have steadily eroded after corruption allegations came out against him in the Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearings. In September 2015, Binay tapped the services of former Secretary of Interior and Local Government Ronaldo Puno as the campaign strategist and adviser for its presidential bid.

In his appearance in the 9th Biennial National Convention of the Chinese Filipino Business Club on February 19, 2016, Binay want to separate the DENR into two separated agencies, The Department of Environment and The Department of Natural Resources (the role of DA will also be moved to DNR). The same scenario will also be used for the DOTC which will be splitting into Department of Transportation and the Department of Information and Communication Technology. On his planned administration, he will create the Department of Housing and Urban Development which focused on the construction of housing projects in the country. If he is elected president, Binay vows to appoint a new Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) 30 minutes after the oath of the office, to replace Kim Henares.  Controversies  Corruption allegations hounding him have been the subject of 22 hearings by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee since August 2014, which has ventured into tackling other Makati projects and partnerships that were supposedly carried out through anomalous deals as well. Among the names floated during the series of Senate inquiries to be linked with Mr. Binay's questionable deals include the housing agency Pag-IBIG, the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, and a listed firm owned by businessman Antonio L. Tiu, who is said to have acted as a dummy for Mr. Binay's wealth. The Office of the Ombudsman upheld its decision to indict Vice President Jejomar Binay, his son dismissed Makati mayor Jejomar Erwin \\"Junjun\\" Binay Jr, and 22 others over the alleged overpricing of the Makati city hall parking building II.

Starring Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine, Glenn Close, and Sennia Nanua, the film depicts a dystopian future following a breakdown of society after most of humanity is wiped out by a fungal infection. The plot focuses on the struggle of a scientist, a teacher, and two soldiers who embark on a journey of survival with a special young girl named Melanie. Plot In the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a disease caused by a parasitic fungus transmitted by bodily fluids. The infected have turned into fast, mindless zombies, called \\"hungries.‚Äù Mankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid second-generation children who crave living flesh, but retain the ability to think and learn. The children are imprisoned by a group of soldiers led by Sergeant Eddie Parks, and go to school at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Among them is an exceptional girl named Melanie. Melanie is brought into a lab by Caldwell to be dissected to develop a vaccine for the disease. When the base is overrun by hungries and the operating lab is breached, Melanie escapes and wanders outside, where soldiers are being violently attacked. She is stunned by what she sees, but attacks and bites two soldiers who are trying to restrain Justineau. Justineau and Melanie board an escaping truck with Sergeant Parks, Caldwell, and two surviving soldiers, Gallagher and Dillon. The soldiers want to shoot Melanie, but Justineau and Caldwell protect her. Melanie is restrained and muzzled to prevent her from biting the others. Dillon is killed when hungries attack as the group stops for water, and the truck is disabled. The group reaches London by foot and makes their way through a swarm of dormant hungries using a \\"blocker\\" gel that masks their scent, rendering them largely invisible. They take shelter in an abandoned hospital for the night. Caldwell reveals that second-generation hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. In the morning, the group realises they have been surrounded by hungries. Melanie, as a second-generation hungry, is ignored by the hungries. She eats a stray cat and then explores abandoned houses. She helps the group by leading the hungries away with a stray dog so the group can escape. As they progress through London, they come across piles of infected bodies encircling the BT Tower, which has been overgrown by a massive fungal growth. Caldwell explains that the growth contains seed pods which, if released, could release airborne spores that would end mankind. They take shelter in an abandoned mobile laboratory that was sent into the city earlier by the military authorities. Caldwell, injured and dying of sepsis, reasons that she can save the human race by sacrificing Melanie to complete her vaccine research in the lab. As the group runs out of food, Gallagher ventures into the city on a supply run, but is killed by a tribe of feral hungry children who have learned to track uninfected people, despite the blocker gel. When the rest of the group is surrounded by the feral children, Melanie kills the leader with a bat. The remaining children back off, allowing them to escape. Caldwell attempts to dissect Melanie upon the group's return to the lab, imploring her to sacrifice herself for Justineau. Melanie comes to the realisation that she is not an experiment and that her kind, human-zombie hybrids, will be the future of the world. She escapes and sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to release an immense cloud of spores. Caldwell chases after her, but is killed by the tribe of children. Parks leaves the lab in search of Melanie, but becomes infected by the spores. He hands Melanie his gun and tearfully asks her to shoot him, as he does not want to turn into a hungry. Melanie obliges and shoots Parks as he is about to turn. In the lab, Justineau stands inside the sealed door, watching the spores fall. The film ends with a tearful Justineau, safe but confined to the sealed mobile lab due to the lethal environment. Outside, the hybrid children of the army base, along with the feral children, sit together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Justineau speaks through a microphone, once again educating them.

Colm McCarthy came aboard as director for his first major feature. The movie was originally titled She Who Brings Gifts but was later retitled, matching the book. On 23 March 2015, casting was announced for the film. Of whether or not the film would be similar to the novel, Carey stated: Half of the film's ¬£4 million budget came from the BFI Film Fund and Creative England, making it the biggest investment that the latter had ever made and one of the largest ever for the BFI. Filming Principal photography began on 17 May 2015 in The West Midlands, taking place in Birmingham city centre, Cannock Chase, Dudley and Stoke-on-Trent. Filming lasted seven weeks. Aerial views of a deserted London were filmed with drones in the abandoned Ukrainian town of Pripyat, which has been uninhabited since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Release Warner Bros. bought the United Kingdom distribution rights, while the film is being distributed in the United States by Saban Films. Reception The Girl with All the Gifts received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86%, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 7.15/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Girl with All the Gifts grapples with thought-provoking questions without skimping on the scares‚Äîand finds a few fresh wrinkles in the well-worn zombie horror genre along the way\\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Dave Robinson of Crash Landed described the film as a \\"tense and intriguing experience\\" noting that whilst its final act \\"goes a little off the reservation\\" the performance of lead Sennia Nanua will \\"make you both care [for her] and simultaneously feel on edge\\" along with the \\"smart choices\\" in the CGI department to create a \\"grounded feel\\" that offers clear similarities to 28 Days Later.

Over time, a circuit split emerged where some courts ruled that a gun must be \\"loaded and operable\\" to qualify as a \\"dangerous weapon,\\"United States v.

McLaughlin \\"displayed a dark handgun\\" and ordered patrons to put their hands up. McLaughlin's companion then jumped over the counter and placed approximately $3,400 in a brown paper bag. When McLaughlin and his companion attempted to leave the bank, they were immediately apprehended by police. Officers seized McLaughlin's gun, but discovered it was not loaded. At trial, McLaughlin pleaded guilty to charges of bank robbery and bank larceny.McLaughlin, 476 U.S. at 17. He was also found guilt of assault during a bank robbery ‚Äúby the use of a dangerous weapon\\" based on the district court's determination that the unloaded gun was a \\"dangerous weapon\\" within the meaning of federal bank robbery statutes.McLaughlin, 476 U.S. at 17 (citing 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2113(d)). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed McLaughlin's conviction. McLaughlin appealed again to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on November 4, 1985.McLaughlin, 476 U.S. at 17; McLaughlin v. United States, (granting certiorari). Opinion of the Court Writing for a unanimous court, Justice John Paul Stevens provided three reasons why an unloaded gun is a \\"dangerous weapon\\" under the federal bank robbery statute. First, Justice Stevens argued that \\"the law reasonably may presume that such an article is always dangerous even though it may not be armed at a particular time or place.\\" Second, he argued that \\"the display of a gun instills fear in the average citizen,\\" even if it is not loaded, and \\"creates an immediate danger that a violent response will ensue.\\"McLaughlin, 476 U.S. at 17-18. Third, he argued that an unloaded gun \\"can cause harm when used as a bludgeon.\\"McLaughlin, 476 U.S. at 18.

The Jagannath Temple, also known as Qilla Ramalayam or Raghunath Temple, is on top of the fort and is a tourist attraction and religious place for Hindu devotees. The temple has spacious halls which are spread over an area of 3,900 sq. ft, the halls has a unique system of ventilation that keeps it cool always. The place has a 53-feet high pillar, which used to be lit every day. It is said that after seeing this lamp, the surrounding villagers used to light lamps at their homes. History The fort is said to have been built by Rashtrakuta Kings in around 10th century. Later it was occupied and renovated by Kakatiyas and ruled it. In 1311, the fort was occupied by Alauddin Khalji who was the second ruler of the Khalji dynasty reigning from 1296 to 1316 and later it was captured by Musunuri Nayaks who revolted against Delhi Sultanates and eliminated them out of Telugu land. Qutub Shahis and then the Asaf Jahis who were the Nizams of Hyderabad, who then renovated the fort. The Fort The fort has a large area surrounded by masonry walls which has huge bastions at the corners which resembles Muslim architecture. There is a huge compound inside the walls of the fort which houses a mosque, a school and on the way up to the fort there is a jail which was used by the Asaf Jahi's dynasty. As visitors go up, they can get a glimpse of the scenery around and a view of the entire city of Nizamabad. There is a temple situated on the top.

A commander under Hulagu, Teguder staged a rebellion against Abaqa, the Ilkhan of Iran, from his base in Georgia in the late 1260s. Defeated, Teguder surrendered and was imprisoned, but he was eventually pardoned and released. Teguder's name has often been misread as Negudar and linked, erroneously, with the Negudaris, a Mongol tribe under the Jochid princes. Biography Teguder, at the head of a Chagatai contingent, accompanied Hulagu to Iran. He was given a fief in Georgia. In the winter of 1267‚Äì68, Teguder accompanied the emissaries of his relative, Baraq, the ruler of the Chagatai Khanate, to Abaqa, the Ilkhan of Iran. With a conflict between Baraq and Abaqa brewing in the east, Teguder attempted to make his way into the Chagatai khanate by way of the pass of Darband, which he found barred and returned to Georgia. The Ilkhan sent the noyan Shiramun, son of Chormaqan, in his pursuit. Teguder was overtaken and defeated near Q'ueli. He was then given shelter by the Georgian king David Narin of Imereti, from where his men ravaged the territories of Georgian nobles loyal to Abaqa. The Ilkhan eventually persuaded David to withdraw his support to the fugitive prince. Defeated once more by Shiramun, Teguder surrendered in late 1269. He was imprisoned for a year on an island in Lake Urmia and then pardoned and released after Abaqa's victory over Baraq.

During his active sports career he competed at international level and for eighteen years was President of the Czech Rowing Association. He graduated from the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague and is married with three children. Sports career Ji≈ô√≠ Kejval is a multiple national champion in rowing and for many years he also competed internationally for Czechoslovakia and then the Czech Republic. In the years 1992 and 1993 he won the R√∂ssler-O≈ôovsk√Ω Spring Sculls race, which is part of the Prague Prim√°torky regatta. In 1991 he finished 10th in the World Championships. In 1992 he was selected to compete at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, but because his partner in the two-man crew fell ill he did not compete in the end. He retired from competitive rowing in 1994. He continues to row regularly and a new challenge for him in recent years has been participation in cross country skiing races. Public office In the years 1996‚Äì2014 Ji≈ô√≠ Kejval held the position of President of the Czech Rowing Association. In the years 2009 to 2012 he was Vice-president of the Czech Olympic Committee for Economics and Marketing. In 2012 he succeeded Milan Jir√°sek as President of the Czech Olympic Committee. He was re-elected by the Czech Olympic Committee Plenary Session four years later, and his current term ends in 2020. He devised the Olympic Festival (originally Olympic Park) concept, which since 2014 during the Olympic Games has promoted sport and brought sport closer to the general public, and children in particular. The project has been adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is being expanded to other countries. In February 2018 at the IOC Session held during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Ji≈ô√≠ Kejval was elected a member of the International Olympic Committee. He is also Chairman of the IOC Marketing Commission and Chairman of the Board of IOC Television and Marketing Services, and a member of the Medical Commission of the Association of National Olympic Committees. In 2017 he was appointed a member of the Executive Committee of WADA. All Kejval‚Äôs roles in sport administration are non-paid. He has also applied the same voluntary principle to all elected members of the Czech NOC leadership.  Business activities Ji≈ô√≠ Kejval sees his activity in sport as a part of social responsibility. He is able to do this thanks to his successful business career, which he commenced in 1991. In that year he established, together with business partner Martin Kul√≠k, the company TECHO a.s., which from a small producer of interior lighting grew into, over a period of five years, a leader in the area of office furnishings in the Czech Republic. At the current time around 30 per cent of all offices in the Czech Republic have furnishings from Techo. In addition the company is also a leading creator of commercial interiors in Europe and beyond. It has even supplied furniture, for example, to Buckingham Palace. His stake in the company, worth hundreds of millions of crowns, was sold in 2008 to the group Royal Ahrend, the number three office furniture producer in Europe. Even after selling the company Kejval has continued as Managing Director and in 2012 he was appointed one of the three board members of Royal Ahrend. Relationship to art and education In 1998 Ji≈ô√≠ Kejval co-founded the non-profit organisation Prostor ‚Äì architektura, interi√©r, design, which aims to promote Czech architecture, interior design and design. He also supports the DOX Centre for Contemporary Art. At the Czech NOC he has championed a connection between sport and culture in the spirit of Olympic values and ideals. He was also active in the American Fund for Czech and Slovak Leadership Studies, which supports talented Czech and Slovak students. In 2012 he initiated establishment of the Czech Olympic Foundation. This helps children from disadvantaged family backgrounds to take up sport. He has strived long-term to improve the situation in the area of corporate social responsibility and sport.

She was contestant Number 9. It was from her number that people from the Volta Region are called Number 9. She was born to Augustus Amekoafia and Anastasia Apau in June 1934 at Alavanyo in the Trans-Volta Togoland in the Gold Coast. She later married a Ghanaian diplomat, Henry Kofi Marrah in London, United Kingdom. At the time of the marriage, Monica had two sons from a previous relationship. Henry already had three children, a son and two daughters from his previous marriage. Between them they had four children, Henrietta, born in London in October 1958, Kofi, also born in London in June 1960, and Vivien, born in Prague in the then Czechoslovakia in August 1963. The fourth and last born, Edward, was born in Accra in March 1969. Following his appointment by the first President of Ghana as Ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1961, the Marrah family moved to Prague that year. In 1963 Monica's husband was posted to Hungary where she and her family lived until 1966. Following the coup d'√©tat that replaced the Nkrumah government with the military National Liberation Council on 24 February 1966, she returned to Ghana with her family. Monica settled down to life in Ghana where though basically a housewife, she engaged in different trades working from home. Her primary trade being dressmaking, she also engaged in the tie and dye business and soap making among others. In her final years of her life she ran a drinking bar at a place called Kokomlemle near the Kwame Nkrumah Circle. Monica's fame was evident when she appeared at public places such at the popular Makola Market in Accra where market women flocked to see and hailed her when she went shopping. When the family took time off to relax at the popular Labadi Beach in the late 1960s, it was not unusual for the Master of Ceremonies at the dance bandstand to announce her presence to the crowd. Her husband, Henry who had gone into private business after his diplomatic career, died in September 1985. Monica, however, only outlived him by five years, dying from a fatal asthmatic attack on 24 June 1990. Monica Marrah, the former Monica Amekoafia, remains a relevant figure to this day evidenced by frequent references to her in the news media and her immortalisation on newsreels and documentaries from the independence period. During the celebration of Ghana's 50th independence anniversary, she was a number of activities were organised in her name to which her children were invited.

The Governor of Sakarya (Turkish: Sakarya Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Sakarya. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Sakarya is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Sakarya. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Sakarya provincial police force and the Sakarya Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Sakarya is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Sakarya is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Sakarya. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Sakarya, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Sakarya Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Sakarya has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

It was recorded only a few months before Jones's death in May 2010. It was Haden and Jones's second album in this vein since 1994's Steal Away. Come Sunday peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart, 10 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums Chart and at 6 on Billboard Top Gospel Albums Chart. Reception The album was positively reviewed by Thom Jurek at Allmusic who wrote that \\"Ultimately, Come Sunday might have fared a little better by replacing the carols with more hymns, because the former are so staid. But that's a small complaint. At its best, Come Sunday is lovely, elegant, and even stirring.\\" Jurek also critiqued the quality of recording writing that its predecessor Steal Away writing that \\"...digital recording has been vastly improved upon since the 1990s. On Steal Away some of the warmth afforded a duo like this naturally was blunted because any sense of real depth was virtually unable to be captured on tape, reducing the sense of intimacy. On Come Sunday, it looms large; the studio room itself becomes an equal participant in these sessions - it reflects back everything, from the sounds of piano pedals and fingers on keys to bass strings being pulled and plucked. This is a huge plus; that spaciousness allows the listener to get front-pew close and hear the natural warmth in the playing.\\" Mark F. Turner reviewed Come Sunday for All About Jazz and wrote that the album \\"...serves as a reminder of his [Jones's] lyrical touch, accompanied here by Haden's empathy and resonance. ...At 91, his melodicism and technical abilities continue to astound, whether swinging gracefully on \\"Down by the Riverside\\" or gently on \\"Bringing In The Sheaves,\\" as Haden's workmanship guides with unassuming assurance. The two seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely, keeping the tunes pretty much intact but also illuminating their inner qualities, as the swanky cadence of \\"Give Me That Old Time Religion\\" silently echoes the song's sentiment, \\"It's good enough for me.\\" ...From the duo's unobtrusive interpretations to the way in which the Jones and Haden communicate, the melodies contain a quiet magic whose crowning jewel is found in the beloved title track, written by the great Duke Ellington.

The Governor of Kilis (Turkish: Kilis Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Kilis. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Kilis is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Kilis. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Kilis provincial police force and the Kilis Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Kilis is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Kilis is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Kilis. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Kilis, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Kilis Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Kilis has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

The PAR was founded in early June 1916 and spread rapidly across the country, along with the general demobilization imposed by the Entente Cordiale on King Constantine I.Mavrogordatos, G. (1996). p. 135. The precursor and nucleus of the PAR was the Association of Reservist Non-Commissioned Officers, which was founded in November 1913.Mavrogordatos, G. (1996). p. 25. That association succeeded in thwarting a draft law proposed by Eleftherios Venizelos' liberal government which excluded the reservist non-commissioned officers of older classes from the right of promotion to the rank of officer. After that, the reservist sergeant Georgios Kamarinos seems to have conceived the idea of organizing all the conscripted reservists in the spring of 1916. On May 30, the organization's charter was signed by 20 founding members. The charter was written by I. Theofilakis and the vote was held on June 5. The purpose of the PAR, as stated in its charter, was twofold: the provision for the reservists and their families, and the education of the Greek people on national issues.Mavrogordatos, G. (1996). p. 26, 44. Membership and identity of the movement The movement had, informally, the character of a militia and at the same time the formal structure of a mass political organization. It had many similarities with the first Italian, German and Austrian fascist movements, such as the use of violence, the former military status of their members as a common basis, their aversion to liberalism and their petite bourgeoisie membership. The movement's failure to develop into a fully-fledged fascist movement is due to the fact that in their fight against Venizelism, the Epistratoi relying in some way on the working class, that they were against Greece's entry in World War I, and strongly supportive of the monarchy. Ioannis Metaxas is considered the main organizer and behind-the-scenes leader of the Epistratoi movement.Mavrogordatos, G. (1996). p. 141. The members of the Epistratoi would take an oath and promise faithful loyalty to King Constantine. Activity The Epistratoi emerged and acted during the period of the National Schism in Greece. The movement was a state-sanctioned paramilitary group from 1916 to 1917 and continued its action until 1920, the year in which the royalists returned to power. Its spread was rapid. The official activity of the Epistratoi was initially limited to presence at church events, e.g. on the rescue of the king from the fire at Tatoi Palace, but from the first moment it was clear that their goal was the suppression of Constantine‚Äôs opponents. The movement's role became clear in November 1916, when they defended the king and the capital by repelling the landing of British and French troops in Athens and Piraeus.Mavrogordatos, G. (1996). p. 95. They then started violent mass persecutions against Venizelists,Ventiris, G. ¬´Œó ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨œÇ œÑŒøœÖ 1910 ‚Äì 1920. ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒºŒµŒªŒ≠œÑŒ∑¬ª, vol. 2.

It differs from the related ideas of rock uplift and surface uplift in that it is explicitly measured relative to the surface of the Earth, rather than with reference to some absolute reference frame, such as the Earth's geoid. Exhumation of buried rocks should be considered as two different categories namely, exhumation by denudation/erosion or exhumation by tectonic processes followed by erosion. In the latter case, rocks (or rock packages) from deeper crustal levels (meter to kilometer depths below the Earth's surface) are brought towards the Earth's surface (i.e.shallower crustal levels) by crustal thickening (see compared also tectonic uplift) and/or extensional tectonics and are subsequently exposed by erosion. Often exhumation involves a complex interaction between crustal thickening, extensional tectonics and erosion. Notably, there are overlapping characteristics between the different modes of burial and exhumation and distinction and between them relies on a series of parameters such as: *The spatial and temporal distribution of the finite strain pattern * The metamorphic field gradient * The spatial distribution of cooling ages (see for example radiometric dating of hornblende) * The spatial distribution of metamorphic pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) paths Detailed and integrated geologic modelling, structural geology, geochronology and metamorphic geological disciplines are key to understanding these processes.  Denudation  Exhumation through denudation could be considered as the process of exposing rock packages solely through the removal of their overlying unconsolidated sediments or solid rock layers. Denudation is here considered as a process that removes parts of the Earth's upper crust by physical processes that occur naturally (e.g. glaciers, wind, water, landslides). Through this form of exhumation, something previously buried in sediments, for example a landform, is uncovered and can be exposed.  Exhumation by tectonic processes  Exhumation by tectonic processes refers to any geological mechanism that brings rocks from deeper crustal levels to shallower crustal levels. While, erosion or denudation is fundamental in eventually exposing these deeper rocks at the Earth's surface, the geological phenomenon that drive the rocks to shallower crust are still considered exhumation processes. Geological exhumation occurs on a range of scales, from smaller-scale thrusts typically occurring within the shallow crust (less than ca. 10 km deep) which results in exhumation in the order of centimeters to meters scales, to larger- scale features originating at deeper crustal levels along which, exhumation is in the order of hundreds of meters to kilometers. The geological mechanisms that drive deep crustal exhumation can occur in a variety of tectonic settings but are ultimately driven by the convergence of tectonic plates through subduction. Depending on the type of convergent boundary, exhumation occurs by thrusting in the accretionary wedge, by obduction and/or as a process during the orogenic cycle (i.e. mountain building and collapse cycle).  Obduction  During the subduction of an oceanic plate underneath the continental crust, some fragments of the oceanic crust can be trapped above the continental crust through obduction. The resulting rocks obducted on the continental crust are called ophiolites. While the exact mechanism behind the formation of ophiolites is still up for debate, those rocks still show an example of rocks being exhumed and exposed at the surface by the tectonic process of obduction and then exposed.  Exhumation of the deep crust during an orogenic cycle.  Exhumation of deep crustal rocks during an orogenic cycle occurs mainly during continental collision or during post-collision extension and is thus, is broadly grouped into the three mechanisms which are used to describe the burial and exhumation of the cycle namely, syn-convergent orogenic wedges, channel flow (also known as ductile extrusion) and post- convergence gravitational collapse. = Syn-convergent orogenic wedge = During the subduction to the collisional phases of the orogenic cycle, a tectonic wedge forms on the prowedge (side of the subducting plate) and commonly the retrowedge (continental side) of the orogen. During the continued convergence, the wedge maintains its shape by maintaining its critical angle of taper by the interaction of thickening through basal accretion or foreland propagation (frontal accretion) and thinning through normal faulting and erosion at the upper part of the wedge. Erosion of the wedge significantly impacts the dynamics within the wedge, which promotes exhumation by thrusting mid-crustal rocks to the hanging wall of the wedge. Characteristics of this mode of exhumation include, evidence for strong non coaxial reverse-shearing, pro-grade metamorphism, cooling ages are progressively younger towards deeper structural levels and that exhumation at higher structural levels is coeval to burial of the structural levels. Tectonics of this kind result in fold and thrust belts or if they are built up over long periods, can form thick-stacked long-hot-orogens, such as the Himalayas. = Channel-flow = Channel flow typically occurs in long-hot orogens when the orogen is sufficiently thick to promote partial melting in the middle-lower part of the orogen to a point where the rocks reach a critically low viscosity enabling them to flow. Subsequently these rocks can decoupled from their base and begin to flow to higher crustal levels along lithostatic pressure gradients that can be caused by melt-induced buoyancy or differences in topography and lateral density contrasts. both of which are affected by erosion. Characteristics of this mode of exhumation include simultaneous normal shearing and reverse shearing along the roof and the base of the channel respectively, high-temperature retrograde metamorphic assemblages, cooing ages should be younger to the front of the channel and P-T-t paths suggesting prolonged burial and synchronous exhumation throughout the channel. = Post-convergent gravitational collapse = Post- convergent gravitational collapse (extension) occurs once the convergence forces can no longer support the gravitational force of the orogen that was built up during collision. During collapse, high-grade rocks from the core of the orogen are exhumed through upward flow towards now thinned crustal areas forming domal shaped metamorphic core complexes. Alternatively, or in conjunction with the extension of the center of the orogen, propagation of the rock-mass towards the margin may lead to exhumation along a series of brittle or ductile thrusts and normal faults and ultimately the formation of fold and thrust type belts along the margins of the collapsed orogen. Characteristics of gravitational collapse include outward verging, normal sense shear zones along the margins of the core complexes and exhumation-only type P-T-t paths.

It is sorted by country. Egypt * The Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo is home to one of the world's most impressive collections of Islamic art. It includes over 100,000 pieces that cover the entirety of Islamic history. The Cairo site was first built in 1881 and underwent a multi- million dollar renovation between 2003 and 2010. : On January 24th, 2014 a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It is estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the buildings facade, wiping out intricate designs in the Islamic style. The Egyptian National Library and Archives in the same building was also affected. Iraq The Mosque after the first bombing, 2006. * Al-Askari Shrine was severely damaged in a bombing in 2006 by unknown, masked assailants which resulted in the complete destruction of its golden dome. Dair Mar Elia monastery * Dair Mar Elia, also known as Saint Elijah's monastery. The Christian monastery near Mosul was founded in the late 6th century, and its sanctuary was built in the 11th century. The monastery was damaged during the invasion of 2003, before being completely destroyed by ISIL in 2014. * Great Mosque of Samarra. Once the largest mosque in the world, built in the 9th century on the Tigris River north of Baghdad. The mosque is famous for Malwiya Tower, a 52-meter minaret with spiraling ramps for worshipers to climb. The site was bombed in 2005, in an insurgent attack on a NATO position, destroying the top of the minaret and surrounding walls. * Nimrud. The ancient Assyrian city around Nineveh Province, Iraq was home to countless treasures of the empire, including statues, monuments, and jewels. Following the 2003 invasion the site has been devastated by looting, with many of the stolen pieces finding homes in a museum abroad. * Tomb of Jonah. The purported resting place of the biblical prophet Jonah, along with a tooth by some believed to be from the whale that consumed him in the myth. The site dated to the 8th century BC, and was of great importance to Christian and Muslim faiths. It was entirely blown up by ISIL militants in 2014 as part of their campaign against perceived apostasy. Lebanon * Old Beirut suffered through a brutal 15-year civil war, successive battles with Israel, and sweeping urban development. It is referred to as the \\"Paris of the Middle East\\" and is known for its impressive landscape Ottoman, French and Art Deco architecture. Officials report that just 400 of 1200 protected historic buildings remain. Libya * Cyrene (Libya). A key city for the Greeks and Romans, established in 630 BC. Famed as the basis for enduring myths and legends, such as that of the huntress heroine of the same name and bride of Apollo. The ruins were some of the best preserved from that period. : In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Cyrene in 1917 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in Benghazi were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artefacts which were part of the so-called 'Benghazi Treasure' . The whereabouts of these objects are currently unknown. : Parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Cyrene were destroyed in August 2013 by locals to make way for homes and shops. Approximately 200 vaults and tombs were leveled, as well as a section of a viaduct dating to the third century BC. Artifacts were thrown into a nearby river. Palestine * Al-Omari Mosque, Gaza. Ancient monument in the heart of Jabalya's old town that dates back to the Mamluk Era. The walls, dome and roof were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes during the 2015 fighting in Gaza, along with dozens more historic sites. Mosques were targeted by Israel due to their use as launch sites for rockets and mortars. Syria * Armenian Genocide Memorial Church (Der Zor). Memorial site to the 1.5 million killed between 1915 and 1923, the Deir Ez-zor became a yearly destination for pilgrims from around the world. The site included a church, museum, and fire that burned continuously. On 21 September 2014, the memorial complex was blown up by militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. * The ancient city of Bosra. Continually inhabited for 2,500 years, and became the capital of the Romans' Arabian empire/ The centerpiece is a magnificent Roman theatre dating back to the second century that survived intact until the current century. Archeologists have revealed the site is now severely damaged from mortar shelling. The fortified entrance of the Citadel of Aleppo * Citadel of Aleppo. The fortress spans at least four millennia, from the days of Alexander the Great, through Roman, Mongol, and Ottoman rule. The site has barely changed since the 16th century and is one of Syria's most popular World Heritage sites. : In August 2012, during the Battle of Aleppo of the Syrian civil war, the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Army to gain control over the citadel. : During the conflict, the Syrian Army used the Citadel as a military base, with the walls acting as cover while shelling surrounding areas and ancient arrow slits in walls being used by snipers to target rebels. As a result of this contemporary usage, the Citadel has received significant damage. * Al-Madina Souq. The covered markets in the Old City are a famous trade center for the region's finest produce, with dedicated sub-souks for fabrics, food, and accessories. The tunnels became the scene of fierce fighting and many of the oldest are now damaged beyond recognition. This was described by UNESCO as a tragedy. * Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge. This French-built suspension bridge was a popular pedestrian crossing and vantage point for its views of the Euphrates River. The bridge was destroyed by Free Syrian Army militiamen during the Syrian civil war in May 2013. * Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque. Among Syria's most famous Ottoman-style mosques, which also shows Mamluk influence through its light and dark contrasts. As of 2007, activities in the mosque were organized by shaykhs Haytham al-Sa'id and Ahmad Mithqan.Rougier, 2007, p. 258 Stamps depicting the mosque have been issued in several denominations. : The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque has been a symbol of anti-government rebels during the Syrian civil war. According to The New York Times, Syrian security forces killed 10 protesters participating in a funeral procession as they were leaving the mosque on 18 July 2011. The mosque, which the Syrian government stated had been turned by the rebels into an \\"arms and ammunition depot\\", was abandoned by the rebels on 27 July 2013. Shelling by government forces damaged Khalid's tomb inside the mosque. Following its capture by the Syrian Army, state media showed heavy damage inside the mosque, including some parts of it being burned, and the door to the tomb destroyed. * Krak des Chevaliers. The Crusader castle from the 11th century survived centuries of battles and natural disasters, becoming a World Heritage site in 2006 along with the adjacent castle of Qal'at Salah El-Din. : During the Syrian Civil War which began in 2011 UNESCO voiced concerns that the conflict might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers. It has been reported that the castle was shelled in August 2012 by the Syrian Arab Army, and the Crusader chapel has been damaged. The castle was reported to have been damaged in July 2013 by an airstrike during the Siege of Homs, and once more on the 18th of August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown. The Syrian Arab Army recaptured the castle and the village of al-Hosn from rebel forces during the Battle of Hosn on March 20, 2014, although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear. * Palmyra. An \\"oasis in the Syrian desert\\" according to UNESCO, this Aramaic city has stood since the second millennium BC and featured some of the most advanced architecture of the priod. The site subsequently evolved through Greco-Roman and Persian periods, providing unique historic insight into those cultures. Main shrine of the Temple of Bel : As a result of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra experienced widespread looting and damage by combatants. During the summer of 2012, concerns about looting in the museum and the site increased when an amateur video of Syrian soldiers carrying funerary stones was posted. However, according to France 24's report, \\"From the information gathered, it is impossible to determine whether pillaging was taking place.\\" The following year the facade of the temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns have been damaged by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition soldiers stationed themselves in gardens around the city. : On 13 May 2015, the ISIL launched an attack on the modern town, sparking fears that the iconoclastic group would destroy the site. On 21 May, ISIL forces entered the World Heritage Site. Local residents reported that the Syrian air force bombed the site on 13 June, damaging the northern wall next to the Temple of Baalshamin. The Temple of Baalshamin and the Temple of Bel were demolished by ISIL in August 2015. * The Great Mosque of Aleppo. A world heritage site originally built in 715 by the Umayyad dynasty, ranking it among the oldest mosques in the world. The epic structure evolved through successive eras, gaining its famous minaret in the late 11th century. right : On 13 October 2012 the mosque was seriously damaged during clashes between the armed groups of the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Army forces. President Bashar al-Assad issued a presidential decree to form a committee to repair the mosque by the end of 2013. : The mosque was seized by rebel forces in early 2013, and, as of April 2013, is within an area of heavy fighting, with government force stationed away. : On 24 April 2013 the minaret of the mosque was reduced to rubble during an exchange of heavy weapons fire between government forces and rebels during the ongoing Syrian civil war. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported that members of Jabhat al-Nusra detonated explosives inside the minaret, while opposition activists said that the minaret was destroyed by Syrian Army tank fire as part of an offensive. Countering assertions by the state media of Jabhat al-Nusra's involvement, opposition sources described them as rebels from the Tawhid Brigades who were fighting government forces around the mosque. The opposition's main political bloc, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), condemned the minaret's destruction, calling it \\"an indelible disgrace\\" and \\"a crime against human civilization.\\" Yemen Sana'a, city center * Sana'a old city. Yemen's capital city of Sana'a has been struck by suicide bombings (for which ISIL has claimed responsibility) and air-strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. These have affected the old fortified city‚Äîinscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List since 1986‚Äîand the archaeological site of the pre-Islamic walled city of Baraqish, causing, according to UNESCO, \\"severe damage\\".

Gandelsonas (born December 14, 1938 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an American architect and theorist whose specializations include urbanism and semiotics. Gandelsonas is a founding partner of Agrest and Gandelsonas Architects, based in New York City, with Diana Agrest. In addition to his professional work, Gandelsonas is a scholar. He currently serves as the Class of 1913 Lecturer in Architecture at Princeton University and previously taught at Yale University and Harvard Graduate School of Design. Education and early work Mario I. Gandelsonas was born on 14 December 1938 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Lithuanian immigrants. He was educated at the University of Buenos Aires where he received a Diploma Architect in 1962, and at the Centre de Recherche d‚ÄôUrbanisme in Paris, from 1967-1968. In 1971,the American Architect Peter Eisenman invited Gandelsonas to travel to New York as a Visiting Fellow to the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies(IAUS). Gandelsonas became a fellow in 1972 and served as one of the founding editors of the Institute's architectural journal, Oppositions. Gandelsonas currently serves as the acting dean and the Class of 1913 Lecturer in Architecture at Princeton University School of Architecture. Professional practice In 1980, Gandelsonas became a founding partner of Agrest and Gandelsonas Architects with Diana Agrest. A unique perception of the city has formed the basis of his work. As a theorist, Gandelsonas is known for his approach to urbanism based on reading the plans of cities like they are text. His striking analytical diagrams of American cities have become a trademark for investigations into urban morphology. In the early 1990s, he developed the concept of \\"Vision Planning\\" as a new approach to his urban planning work for the city of Des Moines. The Des Moines Vision Plan contained two major propositions: Western Gateway Park and the Martin Luther King Parkway. In 2007 Gandelsonas built upon his original vision plan by developing a new Downtown Des Moines Planning Project and completing Gateway Park with the John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park.Downtown Des Moines Planning Project. Approved by the Des Moines City Council, March 10, 2008 (resolution 08-110) Other projects by Agrest and Gandelsonas Architects are Liberty Street in Liberty Harbor, Jersey City; the master plan and urban design for Xu Jia Hiu in Shanghai, China; and the master plan for the West Side of Manhattan and the Melrose Houses Community Center in New York City. Teaching and research Gandelsonas taught at the Institute for Architecture and Urban studies from 1973 until 1984 and was the Director of Educational Programs from 1981 until 1984. Later, as a Fellow of the Chicago Institute for Architecture and Urbanism (1988-1990), he refined his approach to urbanism‚Äîbased on reading the plans of cities as if they were text‚Äîwith a computational analysis of the Chicago plan and published it under the title The Urban Text (1992). Throughout the decade, Gandelsonas continued to apply his unique approach to urbanism on projects in several American cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Des Moines, New Haven and Atlantic City. He published the results of his research in the book X-Urbanism (1999), presenting his theory on the relationship between architecture and the American City. After working as a professor at Yale University and as a guest professor at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University, Gandelsonas joined the faculty at Princeton University in 1991, where he serves as a full professor and the Class of 1913 Lecturer in Architecture. In 1995, Gandelsonas developed a joint international studio with Tongji University in Shanghai. The China Studio, which continued until 2012, provided advanced graduate students from the School of Architecture the opportunity to explore another culture's architectural and urban existence first-hand. In 2013, he started a new joint program with the University of S√£o Paulo incorporating design studios and research on urban infrastructure. Gandelsonas became the first director of the Center for Architecture, Urbanism and Infrastructure (CAUI) at Princeton University in 2007 and remained in the post until 2013. With funding from Princeton University's Council for International Teaching and Research, the mission of CAUI is to build a global network of research focusing on the impact of rapid urban growth in the twenty-first century. He also published the first two CAUI books, In search of the public (2013), a collection of essays that examine the question of public space at the beginning of the twenty first century; and Garden [City] State (2013), a proposal for a slow infrastructure that takes as a case study the state of New Jersey. Currently, Gandelsonas is the Princeton University lead of the research network \\"Fluvial Metropolis\\" in partnership with the University of S√£o Paulo, an program funded by the Council for International Teaching and Research. On July 1, 2015, he was named the acting dean of the School of Architecture, effective until December 31, 2015 as Monica Ponce de Leon assumes the role of dean on January 1, 2016. Honors and awards Gandelsonas has lectured extensively and participated in workshops, conferences and symposiums in North, Central and South America; Europe; Asia and Australia. His work has received numerous awards including Excellence in Design Awards from both the New York State AIA and the New York City Chapter AIA. Gandelsonas received the Masterwork Award from the Municipal Art Society for the \\"Best Building in New York City\\" as well as the Society of Registered Architects NY Chapter Award of Merit. In 2006 he was advanced to Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Exhibitions Gandelsonas' work has been exhibited in museums, galleries, and universities throughout the world. Notable exhibitions include the following: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; The Dallas Museum of Art; The Fogg Museum, Harvard; Leo Castelli Gallery, New York; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Milano Triennale; Frankfurt Architecture Museum, West Germany; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; The Architectural League, New York and the Yale University School of Architecture Gallery.

Life Joseph Paul Anthony Selmersheim was born on 2 June 1871 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Yvelines. His parents were Antoine Paul Selmersheim, an architect, and Madeleine (or Marie) Victorine Louise Eug√©nie Naples. His brother was Pierre Selmersheim. He became an architect, and worked with Charles Plumet. Selmersheim worked at La Maison Moderne of Julius Meier-Graefe, whose showrooms displayed rooms decorated in Art Nouveau style, with designers such as Henry van de Velde, Victor Horta, Charles Plumet and Maurice Dufr√™ne. By the start of the 20th century the partnership of Selmersheim and Plumet had become the leading Art Nouveau company in Paris. They tried to combine British and Belgian design innovations with French taste. The results could be graceful. However, the buildings they made were not particularly innovative apart from the addition of curvilinear ornamentation, which was unusual at the time. Frantz Jourdain wrote a positive article on Selmersheim in 1904. He noted that Selmersheim felt an architect should also be a designer. He discussed a complete room that Selmersheim had designed, including the structure, decoration and furniture, which succeeded by relieving the inhabitant of the need to concern himself with making his home habitable. Gustave Soulier considered Plumet and Selmersheim were truly innovative in their furniture designs, which combined workmanship, elegance and functionality. Selmersheim became a member of L'Art dans Tout, a group of decorative artists. Tony Selmersheim died on 16 August 1971 in Ussy-sur-Marne, Seine-et-Marne.

Early years Franco Giuseppucci was born in the Trastevere district of Rome. When he was a teenager he began working at his father's bakery, and from this he gained the nickname \\"Er Fornaretto\\" (The Little Baker), however he soon left this job after his father, who was also a robber, was killed in a shootout with the Polizia di Stato. A strong fascist sympathizer, with a bust of Benito Mussolini at home, through the propagandist actions for the Italian Social Movement (MSI) Giuseppucci was able to meet up with fellow neo-fascists such as Massimo Carminati, Alessandro Alibrandi and other members of the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR) group that he would later involve in the criminal projects for the Banda della Magliana. Storia criminale del figlio di un fornaio, Misteri D'Italia After leaving the job as a baker he soon found employment as a bouncer for a gambling house in the area of Ostia. It is here that Giuseppucci first made contact with the criminals operating in Rome at the time. Unlike other neo-fascists such as Carminati, Giuseppucci was more interested in money and wealth and thus closer in mentality to non-political criminal groups. In those years, the underworld of Rome was disorganized, with many small groups called batterie, each independent and usually containing 3-4 people, dealing mostly in gambling and some robberies. Rome was considered land of conquest for other, already well established criminal organizations such as the Camorra and Cosa Nostra. There was a group, the Marsigliesi clan, led by Albert Bergamelli and Laudavino De Sanctis, that had started gaining considerable money through kidnappings and by first introducing small-scale drug trafficking. But this was an isolated case in the otherwise bland criminal landscape of the city. Giuseppucci in 1974 joined one of these batterie operating in the Trullo district, and since the beginning became respected for his charisma, organizational skills and resourcefulness, which soon allowed him not only to lead the group, but also to befriend several other members of other batterie and make a name for himself in the Roman underworld. Giuseppucci was also an avid gambler himself who regularly spent time at betting shops for horse racing, and used to lend the money acquired from robberies on usury, with interests ranging up to 20%/25%. This not only allowed him to \\"clean\\" the money, but also guaranteed safe and regular profits. It is in one of these betting shops that Giuseppucci met and befriended Vincenzo Casillo, lieutenant of NCO boss Raffaele Cutolo, whose group also had interests in Roman betting shops. As Giuseppucci owned a mobile home, it became often used by the various batterie, as well as by his NAR friends, as a hiding place for their weapons, with Giuseppucci, who by now had been given a new nickname, Er Negro, due to his dark skin, keeping an eye on them. Though in 1976 this hiding place was eventually discovered by the Carabinieri who arrested Er Negro, he was released from jail after only a few months. This was only a minor setback for Giuseppucci who simply chose to store the weapons of his associates elsewhere, while continuing to expand his criminal ventures in new activities and ideas. In the same year, he participated, along with several neapolitan associates of Casillo, in the kidnapping of jeweler Roberto Giansanti: the role of Er Negro was to study the victim's habits so that the Camorristi could then carry out the kidnapping. After 52 days, during which Giansanti had become sick, the hostage was freed but the ransom obtained was only 350 million lire, a far lower amount than the originally requested 5 billions, which had to be split in multiple parts due to the number of people involved in the kidnapping.Angela Camuso, Mai ci fu Piet√† (There has never been mercy) Banda della Magliana The original core of the gang was formed almost by accident ‚Äî not long after being released from jail Giuseppucci was given a stash of weapons by his friend and associate, Enrico De Pedis, another well respected criminal who ran a batteria in the Testaccio district but was at the time in jail. Giuseppucci had placed the weapons in the trunk of his car and as he was going to hide them, he stopped at a caf√® to buy a snack. In the meantime another street criminal, Giovanni Tigani, better known as Paperino (Donald Duck), noticed the car with the keys left inside and, unaware of who the owner was or what the car contained, stole it. \\"Er Negro\\" immediately began searching for the car and weapons and he discovered they were given to Emilio Castelletti, a criminal working for the batteria of another notorious criminal operating in the Magliana neighborhood: Maurizio Abbatino, known as \\"Crispino\\".Giovanni Bianconi, Ragazzi di Malavita The encounter between Giuseppucci, Abbatino and De Pedis thus set the stage for the formation of a new, larger batteria, much larger than most conventional groups at the time and which allowed them to no longer be confined to marginal roles in the criminal underworld. Each of them brought in the members of their own groups and slowly recruited and gathered more from others, becoming steadily larger. The organization operated under the principle of the \\"stecca para\\", which meant members obtained equal shares and lived off dividends gained from the criminal association. The largest percentage of the gains however was kept in the \\"cassa comune\\", a common fund that was needed for anything that benefited the organization, be it for purchase of weapons or drugs, corruption of state figures, and so on. If members were imprisoned, money continued to be sent to them through their families - while successful members had to keep up their criminal activities, thus remaining \\"crime laborers\\" (operai del crimine). Despite the organization being rather decentralized and allowing members to enjoy a good degree of independence, Giuseppucci virtually became the leader of the gang as he was the one to propose further operations and expansions. The first major criminal act of the Banda della Magliana was the kidnapping of duke Massimiliano Grazioli Lante della Rovere on 7 November 1977, against a ransom. Once again it was Er Negro who set up the kidnapping by getting in touch with a friend of the duke's son, who acted as the mole inside Grazioli's family. Due to the inexperience in the kidnapping for most of the members and the difficulty in finding a safe location to keep the hostage, they asked for the help of a small gang from the Montespaccato area, who then hid the duke in the campanian countryside. The Banda della Magliana first requested 10 billions in cash to release the hostage, but over time and through negotiations the request was lowered to about 1.5 billion. On 14 February 1978, the duke's son, after following a complicated set of instructions, delivered the money to Abbatino's henchmen, but the duke was nowhere to be found. There had been in fact a setback: one of the members of the Montespaccato group had been seen unmasked by the duke, which meant the duke had to be killed to prevent them from being identified: Giuseppucci and his men did not take part in the execution but did not oppose it, and so the duke was murdered and buried somewhere in Campania. His body was never found. Even though the duke was dead, the ransom was still obtained and ended up being far more profitable than the one obtained for the Giansanti kidnapping. Instead of spending everything, the group decided to keep the savings and instead invest in the drug trade. It is at around this time that Giuseppucci met for the first time Nicolino Selis, known as Er Sardo (because he was born in Nuoro), a close associate and godson of Raffaele Cutolo. He, too, was in control of a rather large batteria and had begun seeking to achieve the same unity between criminal groups that Er Negro was trying to achieve. Selis and his group soon joined up with Giuseppucci and the others and became the main link between the Banda della Magliana and the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, which was the first supplier of drugs for the organization. Not wanting to limit themselves to the drug trade however, Giuseppucci ordered the assassination of Franco Nicolini, a notorious bookmaker who had an effective monopoly on the betting shops in the city. On 25 July 1978, Nicolini was gunned down as he exited the Tor di Valle Racecourse. Following this Giuseppucci assumed total control of the city's betting shops. The Banda became more and more powerful, soon taking control of virtually the entire city's drug trade and gambling operations, by either employing or killing anybody who competed, as well as establishing close links with neo-fascist terrorist groups such as Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari and Ordine Nuovo (mostly thanks to Giuseppucci who was a fascist himself), allying themselves with Cosa Nostra's main contact in Rome Pippo Cal√≤, with Michele Zaza and other Nuova Famiglia camorristi through Claudio Sicilia, with 'Ndrangheta families through Gianfranco Urbani, and finally, enlisting the help of several criminals of the \\"old guard\\" who were active under the Marsigliesi, most importantly the powerful boss Danilo Abbruciati who entered the gang as soon as he exited jail in 1979. Links to politics The period in which Giuseppucci and the Banda della Magliana first rose to power was also a period in Italian history marked by political instability and violence, which is historically referred to as the Years of Lead. The Banda della Magliana over its existence left several marks in this historical period that are even now subject to debate. Neo-fascist terrorists of the NAR were heavily involved in the waves of political violence of the time, and as they were associates in crime of Giuseppucci several of the weapons the two groups used were shared. Giuseppucci, with the help of one of his most loyal men, Marcello Colafigli, eventually found a permanent and safe place for their weapons: the weapons were hidden in the basements of the Ministero della Sanita building in the EUR district by paying off the people who worked there to keep an eye on them. The discovery of the Banda's arsenal several years later in a governmental building made a scandal in Rome, and ballistic reports much later would confirm that the weapons found in the building were involved in several assassinations and massacres of the time, including the killing of Mino Pecorelli (for which a Banda della Magliana/NAR member, Massimo Carminati, was sent to trial) and the Bologna Massacre. Giuseppucci's power and influence was not recognized in the underworld alone. Besides making friends with personalities involved in cinema and music (frequent visitors of the gambling houses he operated), he eventually was approached by the state itself. On the morning of 16 March 1978, the car of Aldo Moro, former prime minister and then president of Christian Democracy (DC, Italy's relative majority party at the time), was assaulted by a group of Brigate Rosse terrorists in Via Fani in Rome and Moro was kidnapped. The authorities immediately began seeking for where Aldo Moro was being kept, and asked for the assistance of several criminal organizations in finding the location of Moro's hideout: they asked Cosa Nostra, the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta and the Banda della Magliana. Giuseppucci was summoned for a meeting with DC politician Flaminio Piccoli in the outskirts of Rome, who requested Er Negro's help in finding Moro as he and his group had an extensive knowledge on the city's underworld. In return, Giuseppucci and his friends would receive \\"adjustments\\" in any trials that involved their crimes. Giuseppucci, with the help of Selis, was able to locate the hideout of Moro but when he delivered the news, he was instead told that those who wanted to help Moro were no longer interested in his rescue. Moro's corpse was found in the trunk of a car in Rome on 9 May 1978. Giuseppucci's interest in finding ways to \\"fix their trials\\" did not end with Moro, however. One of their first contact with the Italian neofascist movement Ordine Nuovo was in summer 1978 ‚Äî a few months after Aldo Moro's murder ‚Äî in a villa of Rieti owned by criminologist, psychiatrist and neofascist professor Aldo Semerari. Semerari originally wanted to employ the Banda della Magliana to carry out terrorist acts in Rome to help bring about a coup d'etat. The Banda della Magliana strongly refused taking part in terrorist activities, but a deal was worked out nonetheless: in exchange of financing his political activities, Aldo Semerari proposed psychiatric expertise to arrested gang members in order to help them be released. It was the first in a series of such cooperations between psychiatrists which allowed several gang members to effectively avoid any jailtime by being declared \\"completely unsound of mind\\". Death Under Giuseppucci, the Banda della Magliana rose from being a small group of robbers to becoming a massive criminal organization that by this point effectively had a monopoly on all crime in Rome. One of the very few groups remaining who remained independent and competed with the Banda della Magliana was the Proietti Clan, an association of several brothers and cousins who had a heavy influence in Roman betting shops (they were particularly close to Franco Nicolini) and had their own (albeit small) activity of drug trafficking. Tensions between the two groups were already high and a war at one point seemed inevitable. When Nicolini was murdered and the Banda della Magliana took complete control over Roman betting shops, the Proietti's suddenly and completely lost all privileges derived from them. On 13 September 1980, Giuseppucci was about to return home after a meeting with other members of the Banda della Magliana. As he parted with them and entered his car, he was approached by a motorbike and the passenger fired a single bullet that struck Giuseppucci. Er Negro was wounded fatally but immediately set the car in motion and drove to the nearest hospital, but once he arrived he died in the arms of the doctors just as they were about to intervene. Giuseppucci has become a legendary figure in the Roman underworld, sometimes being even referred to as the \\"Eighth King of Rome\\". Ironically it was through his own death that his dream of unifying the batterie became a reality, as their union became even stronger precisely in order to hunt down and kill those responsible for his murder. His death sparked Rome's first major gang war, which led to the Proietti clan being destroyed with several of its members killed.

Life Alodie-Virginie Paradis was born in Quebec in 1840 as the sole daughter - the third of six children, only three of whom survived to adulthood, - of Joseph Paradis and Emelie Gregorie. She was educated by the Sisters of Notre Dame. Paradis received the sacrament of Confirmation and First Communion in 1849 and 1850 respectively. On 21 February 1854 at the age of fourteen, she joined the Marianites of Saint-Laurent in Montreal, a female branch of the Holy Cross Congregation . Despite her frail health, she was nevertheless admitted and pronounced her vows on 22 August 1857. She received the name of \\"Marie-L√©onie\\", formally known as \\"Marie de Sainte-L√©onie\\".

She remained there until 1870, when she joined the Sisters of the Holy Cross, the American branch of her order, located at Notre Dame, Indiana. There she taught French and needlework to the sisters training to become teachers. In 1874, Paradis was appointed Mistress of Novices at the Coll√®ge Saint-Joseph in Memramcook, New Brunswick. The school was in need of basic support in the housekeeping and culinary departments. She was eager to support the Holy Cross Fathers in their mission of educating young Acadians. She established the Little Sisters of the Holy Family on 31 May 1880. On a number of occasions she asked Bishop Sweeny of New Brunswick to grant approval to the small community, but it was not forthcoming. In 1895, she persuaded Bishop Paul LaRocque of Sherbrooke, who was himself looking for domestic staff for his seminary, to receive the motherhouse and the noviciate of the Little Sisters into his diocese and to give them diocesan approval. The community moved to Quebec and Larocque granted canonical approval on 26 Jan. 1896. Paradis continued to wear the habit of her order but relinquished it on 2 October 1904 in favor of the one instituted in the new congregation.Holb√∂ck, Ferdinand. New Saints and Blesseds of the Catholic Church, Volume 2, Ignatius Press, 2003, p. 20 In 1905 it was Pope Pius X who relieved her of her obligations towards the Holy Cross Congregation. Paradis soon became seriously ill with a malignant cancer, and her health slowly declined. On the morning of her death, she received permission to publish the Rule of the new congregation. She died suddenly following dinner and after receiving the last sacraments on 3 May 1912. Her remains were exhumed on 4 October 1935. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Sherbrooke in 1952 with the commencement of a local process to assemble documentation and testimonies; the process concluded in 1952. The formal introduction of the cause for the Servant of God came on 13 June 1966 under Pope Paul VI. A second process was convoked and spanned for a mere three months in 1968.

As a two-year-old he was trained in England and showed good form, winning the National Stakes and the Mill Reef Stakes and being placed in both the Prix Morny and the Railway Stakes. In the following year he was moved in Ireland and was even better: he won the St James's Palace Stakes, finished second in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Breeders' Cup Turf and was rated one of the best three-year-old colts in the world. He was then retired to stud and had some success as a sire of winners before being exported to India in 2013. Background Excellent Art was a dark-coated bay horse with a white star and snip bred in England by the Newmarket-based Cheveley Park Stud. Her sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Farhh, Kyllachy (Nunthorpe Stakes) and Immortal Verse. Excellent Art's dam Obsessive won one race and finished third in the Musidora Stakes. She was a third-generation descendant of Miss Carmie, a broodmare who was also the female-line ancestor of Chief's Crown, Special Duty and Winning Colors. As a yearling, the colt was sent to the Doncaster sales in September 2005 where he was bought for 76,000 guineas by the trainer Neville Callagham. He entered the ownership of the art dealer Matthew Green and was trained by Callaghan in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 2006: two-year-old season Excellent Art began his racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 20 April 2006. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he started the 9/4 second favourite and won by one and a quarter lengths from the Barry Hills-trained Nittan's Spirit. Dettori was again in the saddle when the colt contested the Listed National Stakes over the same distance at Sandown Park Racecourse on 29 May. starting the odds-on favourite against three opponents, Excellent Art took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by nine lengths despite being eased down by Dettori in the closing stages. Callaghan described the winner was \\"a straightforward colt, who has a chance of being very good\\". In July, Excellent Art was sent to Ireland and moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Railway Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh. Ridden by Mick Kinane, he started the 11/8 favourite but after reaching second place in the straight but could make no further progress and finished third behind Holy Roman Emperor and Drayton. Dettori regained the ride when the colt was sent to Deauville Racecourse for the Group One Prix Morny on 20 August and started second favourite behind the Prix du Bois winner Sandwaki. Racing on heavy ground, he was amongst the leaders from the start before finishing third, beaten a length and a head by Dutch Art and the filly Magic America. On 16 September, ridden by Kerrin McEvoy, Excellent Art contested the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. He started the 15/8 second favourite behind Doctor Brown, a colt who had defeated Cockney Rebel in a valuable sales race at York in August. Excellent Art tracked the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs out and held off a sustained challenge from Doctor Brown to win by a short head despite being hampered by the runner-up in the closing stages. Callaghan commented \\"He's not far off the best and today's race was a bit messy. I'm sure if he could ride the race again Kerrin would have gone on a bit earlier. Seven furlongs will suit him better\\". In December 2006, a controlling share in Excellent Art was bought by the Coolmore Stud, and the colt was sent to Ireland to be trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. The purchase followed a visit to Callaghan's stable by Coolmore's bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, during which the trainer allegedly tried to hide the colt by ordering that he should be kept in his stable box. 2007: three-year-old season On his first appearance for his new connections Excellent Art was sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 13 May and was ridden for the first time by Jamie Spencer. In a race dominated by Irish-trained colts, Excellent Art recovered after struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight and finished fourth behind Astronomer Royal, Creachadoir and Honoured Guest. The 162nd running of the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot attracted a field of eight runners. Cockney Rebel the winner of the 2000 Guineas and Irish 2,000 Guineas, started even money favourite, whilst Excellent Art started at odds of 8/1. The other runners included Astronomer Royal, Creachadoir, Dutch Art, Duke of Marmalade and He's A Decoy. Excellent Art was held up at the back of the field by Spencer before making progress in the straight. He overtook Duke of Marmalade inside the final furlong and won by a neck, with Astronomer Royal taking third ahead of Dutch Art. The first three finishers were all trained by O'Brien. After the race, Spencer commented \\"In France I did what I felt what was best for the horse. I thought he would have won easily there had he got the gaps. Today he's proved it. I got settled lovely towards the rear. They didn't go quick and that was my only concern, but once he got the split a furlong down he was always going to win\\". On his next appearance, the colt was matched against older horses for the first time in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and started 15/8 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Asiatic Boy and the five-year-old Ramonti. As at Ascot, he was restrained in the early stages before finishing strongly, but failed by a head to overhaul Ramonti. In September Excellent Art met Ramonti again and again started 15/8 favourite ahead of his older rival, with the other runners including Darjina and Duke of Marmalade. In a closely contested finish, he recovered after struggling to obtain a clear run and finished half a length behind Ramonti, just ahead of Duke of Marmalade and the six-year-old gelding Cesare. A month later he was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Monmouth Park and started 2/1 favourite against twelve opponents. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, he raced at the back of the field before moving up to sixth on the final turn. He was switched to the outside in the straight and made steady progress to finish second, a length behind the four-year-old Kip Deville. On his final appearance, the colt was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse contest the Hong Kong Mile on 9 December. He started second favourite but never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the thirteen runners behind the locally trained Good Ba Ba. Assessment In the 2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Excellent Art was rated the seventeenth best racehorse in the world, and the best three-year-colt over one mile. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Excellent Art became a breeding stallion at the Cheveley Park Stud. His best winners have included Graphic (Prix Messidor), Hazel Lavery (St Simon Stakes) and Lady Lara (Honey Fox Stakes). In January 2013 was sold to continue his breeding career at the Poonawalla Stud in India.

Later he completed his philological studies at the University of Leipzig and the University of Berlin, which gave him a chance to engage in palaeography in France and in Italy. Afterwards, he returned to Greece, winding up as principal of the Gymnasium of Mytilene (1880‚Äì94) and continuing afterwards to an appointment at the Zariphios School of Philippopolis (1895‚Äì98). In 1898, he became a regular professor of Greek literature at the National and Capodistrian University of Athens, where he taught continuously until 1923.[ŒªŒÆŒºŒºŒ±] ŒìœÅŒ∑Œ≥œåœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒíŒµœÅŒΩŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ œÑœåŒº. 2, œÉ. 260, Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒø ŒíŒπŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒπŒ∫œå ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå, , ŒïŒ∫Œ¥ŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ Œë.Œï., 1984 Scholarly works The principal work for which Bernardakis was known in his philological career was a seven-volume edition (1888‚Äì96 Bibliotheca Teubneriana editio minor) of Plutarch's Moralia (Ethics), based on a previously-unknown codex (Codex Athous Gr. 268) which he had found in a monastic library on Mount Athos. He never completed the major edition, a task which was left to his son, Demetrios Bernardakis, and grandson, Panagiotis Bernardakis, who finally finished the family project in cooperation with Heinz Gerd Ingenkamp. Later editors of the minor edition, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Max Pohlenz and Konrat Ziegler disagreed with Bernardakis and the latest (1959) minor edition does not reflect his editorial choices and the full range of manuscripts that he citied. Bernardakis's minor edition contains essays known by the Latin translations of their titles: De liberis educandis, Consolatio ad Apollonium, and Septem sapientium convivium, that are regarded as spurious by most scholars because of stylistic differences from other preserved works of Plutarch, although not all scholars regard the issue as definitively settled. One reviewer of the editions found some minor disagreements with various editorial choices, but found the typeface employed in the major edition a refreshing change from the fonts commonly used in other classical texts, and that overall, the major edition supersedes the previous edition of Vasilis Mandilaras, especially in its treatment of lectiones difficiliores, and koinisms, while still reflecting the moderate Atticism of Plutarch.Redondo, Jordi, \\"Review of Panagiotes D.

The song, which alludes to \\"fussin' and fightin'\\" and contains the line \\"You ain't never bin known to be wrong, and I ain't never bin right,\\" was likely inspired by Hank's tumultuous relationship with his wife at the time, Audrey Williams, with biographer Colin Escott musing, \\"Audrey's thoughts can only be guessed at as she heard the substance of their domestic disputes on the radio, particularly as only one side ever got aired.\\" Williams recorded the song on August 30, 1949 at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio (the same session that produced the B-side \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\"). He is backed by members of the Pleasant Valley Boys ‚Äì Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Innis (rhythm guitar) ‚Äì as well as Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Ernie Newton (bass).\\" Cover versions *George Jones recorded a version for his 1962 album My Favorites of Hank Williams on United Artists. *In 1965 the song appeared as an overdubbed duet by Williams and his son Hank Williams, Jr. *Also in 1965, a version by Johnny Horton was released and was likely recorded about 1960. https://www.discogs.com/Johnny-Horton-I-Just-Dont-Like-This-Kind-Of-Livin- Rock-Island-Line/master/509400  References  Bibliography * 1949 songs Songs written by Hank Williams Hank Williams songs MGM Records singles ","title":"I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living"},{"id":"47135948","text":"Left is Change (Sinistra √® Cambiamento, S√®C) was a social-democratic faction within the Democratic Party (PD), a political party in Italy.

It extends for about 1.5 km along the valley of a stream which joins the Zschopau river ca. 1.5 km west of Warmbad. The nearby H√ºttengrundm√ºhle (site of a former water mill) is also part of the village. The mountain Dreibr√ºderh√∂he lies ca. 3 km east of Gehringswalde. Bundesstra√üe 101 forms the main road of the village, at whose western end it is joined by Bundesstra√üe 171. A county road connects Gehringswalde with Warmbad.  History  Gehringswalde was first mentioned in 1427 as Geringiswalde. After the Protestant Reformation it became part of Wolkenstein parish in 1536/37. In 1540 it was known as Gerichtswalde. From this time on there are reports of ore mining in Gehringswalde. The village was centred on the demesne of the prince-elector. In 1693, possibly as a consequence of the Thirty Year's War, of the need for water in the mines, and of damages due to increasing numbers of wild animals, there were only 5 Hufners, 8 half-Hufners, and 10 cotters, signifying pronounced poverty, and causing the local judges to ask for reductions of taxes.Gehringswalde In: Neue S√§chsische Kirchengalerie, Ephorie Marienberg.

The road through the village was renewed between 1823 and 1829. The first school is mentioned in 1824, a new schoolhouse was built in 1874. In 1846 the grange of Huth was transferred from Gro√ür√ºckerswalde to Gehringswalde. Until 1856 the village was part of Amt Wolkenstein. Municipal offices were built in 1925, the volunteer fire department was formed two years later. An aerial attack in the night from 14 to 15 February 1945 destroyed 26 buildings.

William Clark Cowie (8 April 1849 in Friockheim, Forfarshire; ‚Äì 14 September 1910 in Bad Nauheim) was a Scottish engineer, mariner, and businessman who helped establish British North Borneo and was Chairman of the British North Borneo Company.  Personal life  Born on 8 April 1849, Cowie was the oldest of four children of the flax producer David Cowie (1825‚Äì1896) and Ann Cowie (1819‚Äì1906) in Scotland, where his mother ancestors had lived for generations. His three siblings were Mary, Andson and Edward. The family moves to Arbroath on the Scottish east coast. His father was a director in the Wardmill Works of M.C. Thomson & Co., and Cowie trained as an engineer. He received private lessons with the aim of following his grandfather, an engineer in one of the first mills in Scotland. Around 1873, Cowie married Flora Davidson. They had two children; Flora de Cruz (born 1874) and William Anson Edward Cowie de Cruz (born 1875). His wife died suddenly, aged 25, shortly after the birth of their second child. Cowie then married Amy Constance Pead, and they had two children; Muara Gladys (born 1888) and Andson Gordon (born 1891). Career until 1878 Cowie with the Sultan of Sulu. From April 1870, Cowie was hired as the chief engineer of Argyle under Captain Peter Orr and left Glasgow for Singapore on his 21st birthday. He then began to lead life as an adventurer in the pirate-infested waters of the Malay Archipelago. His career as chief engineer for Argyle ended at the end of 1872 when he was hired by Carl Schomburgk as captain of the Far East, and was commissioned to break the Spanish naval blockade to deal with the Sultan of Sulu, who ruled parts of the northern Borneo. His successful efforts forged a deep friendship with the Sultan of Sulu. Cowie convinced the Sultan that to achieve a lasting success in overcoming the Spanish blockade he would need access to a safe harbour; from there he could wait until the shipping route to Sulu was free from Spanish warships. The Sultan permitted Cowie to build a port for his goods at Timbang Island in Sandakan, creating a British presence in Borneo. Cowie, along with two friends - Carl Schomburgk and John Dill Ross - founded the Labuan Trading Company, whose main task was to evade the Spanish naval blockade and bring weapons, opium, tobacco and goods to Sulu. No company ships were ever caught by the Spaniards. North Borneo Chartered Company Cowie and party travelling beyond the railway limit in North Borneo. Cowie with officials of the British North Borneo Company. In 1878, Baron von Overbeck and Alfred Dent approached Cowie knowing he has friendly with the Sultan of Sulu, asking for help in arranging land concessions in Borneo. Cowie agreed as he had plans to occupy territory as part of the British Empire. As the political situation was favourable to unilateral treaties, Cowie told the Sultan to leave the Spaniards to his country, helping foreign powers to take parts of the Sultan territory while expecting the Spanish would wish to avoid diplomatic involvement with the interests of other colonial powers. Cowie managed to get the Sultan to surrender his lands in north-eastern Borneo on 22 January 1878 for an annual payment of ¬£1,000; which was later given to Overbeck and Dent as they received the full power of government and territorial rights to the possessions in Borneo, including the islands. The rights from this treaty were then transferred to the newly-founded British North Borneo Company in 1881. In March 1882, Cowie purchased a 40 year- concession for the exploitation of coal fields in Muara in Brunei and founded Cowie Brothers, based in Singapore. From Labuan, he rented a shipyard for 99 years from which he shipped his coal. On 12 July 1887, Cowie handed over his franchise rights to the British North Borneo Company and returned with his family to England. Charles Brooke, who later acquired the mine, renamed it as \\"Brooketon\\" (today's Brooke Town). In 1887, Cowie, together with Edmund Ernest Everett, was commissioned to conduct the company's business in Borneo. Due to the lack of transportation to move goods in the island, Cowie sought a concession to build a rail network from the West Coast Division to Sandakan. The company initially agreed and appointed Cowie as the Supervisory Board in 1894. In 1896 construction of the North Borneo Railway began but financial difficulties prevented the company fully connecting to northern Borneo; Cowie was unable to raise the necessary funds especially after company officials refused to borrow more money. In 1893, under the patronage of Cowie and his brother Andson, a dictionary for the Sulu and Malay languages was created.Andson Cowie, William Clark Cowie: \\"English-Sulu-Malay Vocabulary: With Useful Sentences, Tables, Etc.\\" Kessinger Publishing's Photocopy Edition, 1893 He was appreciated for his extensive knowledge of the territory and the people of Borneo. He rose to the position of Director General in 1897. In North Borneo in 1898 he met with Mat Salleh to bring an indefinite solution of the so-called Mat Salleh Rebellion. On 15 October 1909, after the retirement of Charles Jessel, he became Chairman of the Supervisory Board.  Death  Memorial to William Clark Cowie, in Charlton cemetery. Toward the end of his life, Cowie suffered from heart disease. In July 1910, he travelled to Germany to undergo surgery. After his condition worsened, Cowie died on 14 September 1910 in Bad Nauheim. His body was returned to England and he was buried on 23 September in Charlton cemetery, near to his home, Mayfield, in Blackheath Park, Blackheath. His gravestone reads: { cellpadding=\\"4\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #999; border-collapse:collapse; margin:1em 0\\"  By his instrumentality 31,000 square miles of territory in British North Borneo were added to the British Empire.

For his work at Housing.com, Yadav made the Forbes India list of \\"30 Under 30\\" young entrepreneurs. Called \\"bad boy of Indian startups\\", he is often compared with Steve Jobs for his product skills and brash behaviour with investors and media. Citing \\"I‚Äôm just 26 and it‚Äôs too early in life to get serious about money\\" for an interview in Financial Express, he distributed all of his personal equity in Housing.com, worth around 200 crore rupees, to its 2,251 employees. His dismissal as CEO by Housing.com's board of directors attracted considerable media attention. Subsequently, Yadav announced his latest venture, Intelligent Interfaces which would assist companies and organisations in automating processes. The company is backed by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, co-founders of the Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart and Youwecan ventures also announced that they would be participating in the seed round as well. Early life and career Yadav was born to middle-class parents from Khairtal, Rajasthan. He enrolled at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2007, specialising in metallurgy. He served as the representative and secretary for the university's student association. After first building Exambaba.com, an online question bank of old exam papers that IIT Bombay asked Yadav to close, Rahul dropped out of college in his final year. In the process of building Exambaba.com, he had learned programming, which enabled him to subsequently design a series of Google applications. In 2012, he along with eleven other classmates co-founded Housing.com, after they had a difficult time finding accommodation in Mumbai. He came up with a new venture related to virtual, augmented reality, and interfaces. Housing.com Housing.co.in was founded in 2012, and was later renamed Housing.com. Yadav says that he started up Housing.com in response to a severe housing shortage in India. By mid-2015, under Yadav's leadership, Housing.com had three offices in Powai, a suburb of Mumbai. The site aims to increase transparency in the real estate market. Its original line-up of products include map-based rental search, verified purchase of apartments, buildings and even land in villages and rural areas and 'Slice View' which allows customers to take a virtual tour of chosen properties of big real estate companies. Having successfully solicited major investors to back the site, Yadav retained only a five per cent share in the business which later made it possible for investors to oust him. Housing.com was named one of the hottest tech startups in 2012. SoftBank was among its funding partners, and the fledgling company also partnered with Tata Housing and Tata Value Homes. According to Forbes India, Housing.com sold eight million dollars' worth of real estate in its first week. In June 2015, Rahul was fired by the company board citing \\"his behaviour towards investors, ecosystem and the media\\". The shares of his business that Yadav donated to his former employees was considered to be the equivalent to a year's salary. In an apparent explanation of his actions, Yadav said, \\"I'm just 26 and it's too early in life to get serious about money, etc,\\" in an interview with the Financial Express.  Intelligent Interfaces  In September 2015, Rahul announced his new venture Intelligent Interfaces. The company had secured angel investment from co-founders of Flipkart, Paytm, YouWeCan and Micromax. Intelligent Interfaces is reportedly a data analytics company and visualisation company catering to e-commerce companies.

The ninth named storm of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season, Chan-hom developed on June 29 from a westerly wind burst that also spawned Tropical Cyclone Raquel in the southern hemisphere. Chan-hom slowly developed while moving to the northwest, aided by warm waters but disrupted by wind shear. The storm meandered near the Northern Marianas Islands, passing over the island of Rota before beginning a steady northwest track. While near the island, the storm dropped heavy rainfall on neighboring Guam, causing flooding and minor power outages. Chan-hom intensified into a typhoon on July 7, and two days later passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima. There, strong winds left 42,000 people without power, while 27 people were injured. Around that time, the storm caused a surge in the monsoon trough, in conjunction with Tropical Storm Linfa, which caused flooding and killed 16 people in the Philippines. After passing by Okinawa, the typhoon reached peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. It passed north of Taiwan, where it brought beneficial rainfall that replenished reservoirs. On July 11, Chan-hom became the strongest typhoon to make landfall in the Chinese province of Zhejiang. About 1.1 million people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and across the country, the storm left ¬•9.84 billion (US$1.58 billion) in damage, as well as one death. Later, the storm turned to the northeast toward the Korean Peninsula. Jeju Island offshore South Korea recorded of rainfall, and one person died due to a thunderstorm in the country. On July 12, the storm struck the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The remnants later caused flooding and power outages in the Russian Far East. Meteorological history During June 2015, a near record strength pulse in the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation, lead to a period of significant weather across the Western Pacific. This significant weather included a major westerly wind burst during late June, which caused a set of twin tropical cyclones to develop. The first tropical cyclone developed in the Southern Hemisphere during June 28, before it later developed into Tropical Cyclone Raquel during June 30. The second tropical cyclone was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a tropical disturbance during June 25, while it was located about to the south-southeast of Pohnpei State in the Federated States of Micronesia. Drifting generally northward, the disturbance slowly organized within a region of low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft. The circulation was enhanced by a surge of westerly winds to the south. At 06:00 UTC on June 29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Following further organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22:30 UTC with the system located about 345 km (215 mi) northeast of Pohnpei. Convection steadily deepened over the center and banding features began consolidating around the periphery. On June 30, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Chan-hom. The JTWC assessed Chan-hom to be slightly weaker at this time, initiating it as a tropical depression. Situated along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, Chan-hom moved steadily to the west. Upper-level ventilation allowed for growth of the cyclone, but moderate wind shear displaced the center from the deepest convection for much of July 1. That day, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm. Early on July 2, the large circulation of Chan-hom absorbed a smaller disturbance to its southeast, and the storm turned to the west-southwest. Dvorak satellite classifications indicated that the system reached typhoon intensity following an expansion of the central dense overcast; the JTWC classified Chan-hom as such by 15:00 UTC, although the JMA maintained it as a severe tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, strong wind shear from a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the northeast dramatically weakened the storm. Convection was stripped away from Chan-hom's center and the storm's forward motion abruptly slowed. Alongside the shear, subsidence over the cyclone, a trough to the north, and a remnant vortex to the northeast all served to suppress convection. By 12:00 UTC on July 3, Chan- hom had weakened to a tropical storm with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Tropical Storm Chan-hom over the Mariana Islands on July 5 Coinciding with Chan-hom's abrupt collapse on July 3, the system turned northeast as it entered a weakness in the steering ridge. Later that day, the broad circulation turned north-northwest. Wind shear eased early on July 4 as the TUTT cell retreated to the north and the subtropical ridge steadily re-established itself. Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm. Late on July 4 into July 5, the center of Chan-hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands. While near the island, Chan-hom executed an unusual counter- clockwise loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough. Once clear of the Mariana Islands, steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow. Early on July 7, Chan-hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA, following to a burst in central convection. Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eye as convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation. On July 7, the typhoon entered the Philippine area of Responsibility and was assigned the local name Falcon. Chan-hom's eye briefly improved in structure before entering a state of flux and collapsing later that day; convection on the northern side of the storm diminished simultaneously. The 65 km (40 mi) wide eye soon re-established itself and slowly contracted to a diameter of 40 km (25 mi) by July 8. A large storm, gale-force winds extended 445 km (275 mi) from Chan-hom's center on July 9. Late on July 9 into July 10, Chan-hom passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima. The typhoon reached its peak strength during this time with estimated winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar (hPa; 27.61 inHg). Featuring multiple intense feeder bands and a well-defined 27 km (17 mi) eye, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have peaked as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale with one-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). An eyewall replacement cycle and weakening convection along the northern side resulted in steady weakening starting on July 10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July 11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning to the north and later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140 km (80 mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40 UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155 km/h (100 mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160 km (100 mi) of Shanghai in at least 35 years, and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00 UTC on July 11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July 12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00 UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). By 00:00 UTC on July 13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea. Preparations and impact China Typhoon Chan-hom hours before making landfall in China on July 11 Due to the typhoon, about 1.1 million people evacuated from areas along the coast. Nearly 30,000 ships were called back to port, and 600 flights were canceled within the area. Over 100 train rides were also canceled, and portions of the Shanghai Metro was shut down. The storm caused a concert for Chinese singer Wang Feng to be canceled. While moving over eastern China, Chan-hom produced sustained winds of 119 km/h (74 mph) and gusts to 177 km/h (110 mph), both at a station south of Shanghai called Shipu. Shanghai Pudong International Airport recorded wind gusts of . Gusts were strongest along the coast and along offshore islands. Rainfall from the storm peaked at in Yuyao, Ninghai, and Xiangshan, all parts of Ningbo city within Zhejiang. The rains caused widespread flooding in eastern China; 11 rivers in Zhejiang surpassed the warning level of . The storm produced high waves from Fujian to Jiangsu provinces, reaching five storeys high in Wenling, washing fish ashore and flooding the coast. Winds from Chan-hom were strong enough to knock down street signs across Zhejiang, as well as destroying an unoccupied building in Cixi City. The storm's heavy rainfall caused a landslide in Ningbo and necessitated flood gates to be opened. Also in the city, storm rains caused a hotel roof to collapse, killing one person and injuring two. Throughout Zhejiang, Chan-hom wrecked 700 homes and damaged another 1,400. In neighboring Jiangsu, 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, causing ¬•120 million (US$19.3 million) in economic losses. The storm wrecked greenhouses and irrigation systems while also damaging crops. Storm impacts mostly affected agriculture and transportation in the country; over of crop fields were impacted. In the Nanhui District of Shanghai, 20% of peaches and 40% of pears were lost after being damaged by the storm's winds. In Shanghai, the winds knocked down over 3,000 trees. The high agriculture damage - estimated at ¬•3.62 billion (US$582.9 million) - was mostly due to the typhoon's concurrence with the local harvesting of vegetables and melons. Overall, Chan-hom affected 3.9 million people in eastern China, causing about ¬•9.84 billion (US$1.58 billion) in damage. Elsewhere Before the storm affected the Marianas Islands, the National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch and tropical storm warning for Guam and Rota, as well as a typhoon warning for Tinian, and Saipan. The United States Department of Defense issued a Condition of Readiness 3. While looping near Rota, Chan-hom produced gusts of . On the other side of the Rota Channel, Andersen Air Force Base on northern Guam recorded wind gusts of 117 km/h (72 mph). Rainfall on the island totaled over , based on radar estimates from the University of Guam, and possibly as high as . On Guam, the storm caused minor power outages and flooding. Although Chan-hom did not directly affect the Philippines, both Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced the monsoon for several days, which caused severe flooding throughout the country. Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas, with various events resulting in five deaths. Four people also went missing when their boat sank amid strong winds off the coast of Pangasinan. A brief tornado caused minor damage in Iba, Zambales. Nearly 34,000 people were affected by the monsoon event, which killed 16 people and caused ‚Ç±3.9 million (US$86,000) in agricultural losses. Fallen trees in Kadena Air Base, Japan On July 9, the outer rainbands of Chan- hom began affecting the Japanese island of Okinawa. Between July 9 and 10, 326 flights were canceled at Naha Airport, affecting more than 32,000 people. A total of 176 people sought refuge in public shelters. American military bases on the island were placed under Condition of Readiness 1, the highest level. Early on July 10, a station near the southern end of Okinawa recorded peak wind gusts of , along with sustained winds of . Strong winds affected other Japanese islands in the region, and Miyako-jima recorded peak gusts of . The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at in Nago, Okinawa. At the height of the storm, 42,000 people lost power across Okinawa Prefecture. The storm injured 27 people in Okinawa, three seriously. Two buildings were damaged. Agricultural damage across Okinawa reached ¬•524 million (US$4.27 million), most of which was sustained by the mango crop. Passing north of Taiwan, the threat of Chan-hom caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange and other public buildings to close, as well as canceling several flights. The storm brought ultimately heavy rainfall, reaching in Taipei. The Shihmen Dam, which had dropped to 55% capacity before the storm, rose to 90.26% of its capacity due to the storm's rains. In South Korea, 574 flights were canceled and 163 boats were forced to remain at port. The large circulation of the storm dropped heavy rainfall throughout the Korean Peninsula, beneficial in easing drought conditions. Notably, Mount Halla on the offshore Jeju Island recorded of rainfall during Chan-hon's passage. Wind gusts reached in Muan County in southwestern South Korea. Thunderstorms killed one person in the country. When Chan-hom made landfall along North Korea, winds were generally less than 40 km/h (25 mph), with gusts reaching up to 54 km/h (33 mph). The storm dropped heavy rainfall, reaching over in North Hamgyong Province along the east coast. Flooding was limited, as most of the country received about of rainfall from the storm. The remnants of Chan-hom later impacted southern areas of Khabarovsk Krai, producing heavy rain and high winds, peaking at . The winds downed numerous trees, some of which fell on cars, and uprooted tombs in a graveyard in Khabarovsk. The towns of Bikin, Sovetskaya Gavan, and Vyazma, saw of rain or roughly 60‚Äì70 percent of their average monthly precipitation for July during the storm's passage. Flooding affected dozens of homes in the region as rivers rose by . Power and telephone service was lost in 34 communities. Ferry service between Vanino and Kholmsk was suspended, temporarily stranding 1,300 passengers.

Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Isparta, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Isparta Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Isparta has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

Smyth was born in Southbury, Conn., Oct. 24, 1804. He was the son of Richard and Lovine (Hebert) Smith. He was fitted for college under John H. Lathrop, at the Weston (now Easton) Academy. He graduated from Yale College in 1827. On the completion of his collegiate course he began the study of law with Hon. Edward Hinman, of Southbury, and Heman Birch, Esq, of Brookfield, finishing his course in the Yale Law School, then under the care of Judges David Daggett and Samuel Johnson Hitchcock. He was admitted to the bar in 1831, and immediately settled in Guilford, Conn., where he spent the rest of his life. In January, 1844, he was appointed judge of the Probate Court. In 1859 he represented his adopted town in the Connecticut General Assembly. From 1848 to 1854, he was engaged in chartering, constructing, and conducting the New Haven and New London, and the New London and Stonington railroads. He earned the reputation of a thorough office-lawyer, conscientious in the performance of his professional duties. His favorite outside studies were in the departments of history and genealogy, and of English literature. His collection, in manuscript, of genealogies of the families of Guilford, and of thei ramifications in the Connecticut Valley, is very large and valuable. The lives of the early graduates of Yale also claimed much of his spare time, and he left in manuscript a series of more or less complete biographical sketches of these, from the beginning to the class of 1767. The sketches of the graduates of the first eight years were printed in the College Courant in 1868. During the spring of 1874, he began to lay aside his favorite pursuits, retaining, however, to the last, his ardent attachment to Yale, whose Commencement exercises he attended in June. After this date, his health began to fail rapidly, until death released him from his sufferings, September 11, 1874. Smyth was married, October 13, 1837, to Rachel S., daughter of Amos Seward, of Guilford, who, with a married daughter, survived him. Their two sons, graduates of Yale in 1863 and 1866, died in 1863 and 1868.
