Gradually, these nomadic people adopted a more settled, agricultural lifestyle and began to build multi-story stone or adobe dwellings now known as pueblos by 750 CE. The Albuquerque area was settled the Tiwa people beginning around 1250. By the 1500s, there were around 20 Tiwa pueblos along a stretch of the middle Rio Grande valley. The region was visited by Spanish conquistadores beginning with the expedition of Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado in 1540‚Äì41, and began to be settled by Spanish colonists after the expedition of Juan de O√±ate in 1598. By 1680, 17 Spanish estancias were reported along the Camino Real in the Albuquerque area. The settlers were driven out by the Pueblo Revolt in 1680. When they returned in 1692, they were able to re-settle the abandoned estancias. In 1706, the recently appointed governor of New Mexico, Francisco Cuervo y Vald√©s, officially designated the community as a royally chartered town and named it Alburquerque. The settlement remained small and dispersed throughout the 1700s, eventually coalescing into a series of plazas of which the largest was today's Old Town. Possession of the town, along with the rest of New Mexico, passed to Mexico in 1821 and then to the United States in 1846. These developments brought increased commerce and Albuquerque prospered as a trading hub and U.S. Army post. In 1880 the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached Albuquerque, but the establishment of the depot some distance from the plaza led to the creation of a rival \\"New Town\\" that quickly outstripped the older community. New Town was dominated by recently arrived Anglo-Americans and European immigrants who modeled its buildings and institutions on those they remembered back home. Albuquerque soon resembled a typical small American city, and was incorporated in 1891. The city grew rapidly in the early 20th century, spurred in part by the tuberculosis treatment industry, and then even faster after World War II when it became a major scientific and military hub. Since the 1940s, the city has seen major urban sprawl with a focus on decentralized, auto-oriented development. As the city has continued to grow, officials have tried to encourage denser development, revitalization of the Downtown area, and improved transportation. Native American presence Folsom points are some of the earliest artifacts found in the Albuquerque area Archaeological sites in the Albuquerque area show evidence of Paleo-Indian cultures dating back up to 12,000 years, including Folsom points and mastodon remains found at Sandia Cave. Gradually, the nomadic hunter-gatherers who roamed the area began to adopt a more settled, agrarian lifestyle, coinciding with the introduction of cultivated maize from Mexico during the Early Basketmaker II Era (1500 BCE‚Äì50 CE). By 750 CE, these Ancestral Puebloan people had begun to build multi-story stone or adobe dwellings now known as pueblos. Images carved by Pueblo people can be found at Petroglyph National Monument The middle Rio Grande valley was settled by Puebloans, specifically the Tiwa people, beginning around 1250. By the 1500s, there were around 20 Tiwa pueblos along a stretch of river from present-day Algodones to the Rio Puerco confluence south of Belen. Of these, 12‚Äì13 were densely clustered near present-day Bernalillo and the remainder were spread out to the south. The Pueblo people left thousands of petroglyphs carved into the basalt cliffs west of the city, now preserved as Petroglyph National Monument. The Navajo, Apache and Comanche peoples are also likely to have visited the Albuquerque area, as there is evidence of trade and cultural exchange between the different Native American groups going back centuries before European conquest. Early colonists Coronado's expedition as depicted in a c. 1900 painting by Frederic Remington European exploration of New Mexico began with the expedition of Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado in 1540‚Äì41. A small party led by Hernando de Alvarado reached the central Rio Grande valley in September 1540, followed later by Coronado himself. The explorers called the area Tiguex Province after its Tiwa inhabitants. Alvarado described the province as a \\"broad valley planted with fields of maize and dotted with cottonwood groves. There are twelve pueblos, whose houses are built of mud and are two stories high.\\" The Spanish were welcomed at first, but relations became more hostile after Coronado's men commandeered one of the Tiwa pueblos for their winter quarters, forcing the inhabitants out without any supplies. The conflict culminated in the Tiguex War, in which Coronado attacked and burned several of the Tiwa pueblos. The surviving inhabitants were forced to flee and only returned to their pueblos after Coronado had left in 1542. The first colonizing expedition into New Mexico was led by Juan de O√±ate in 1598, after which settlers began to trickle into the middle Rio Grande valley along the Camino Real. In the vicinity of modern-day Albuquerque, missions were established at Isleta Pueblo in 1613 and Sandia Pueblo in 1617. In 1630 the Tiwa province was reported as having a population of 7,000 living in 15‚Äì16 pueblos. Subsequently, the number of Native Americans dropped drastically due to famine, Apache raiding, and a severe smallpox epidemic in 1636‚Äì1641. By the 1640s the Tiwa population was concentrated into four major pueblos: Isleta, Sandia, Puaray, and Alameda. The population loss of the pueblos opened new territory to Spanish settlers, who established scattered estancias along the Rio Grande. By 1680, 17 estancias were reported in the Albuquerque area. While the Native Americans had reluctantly accepted the Spanish presence at first, they grew increasingly resentful after decades of poor treatment. The Spanish demanded tribute from each Pueblo household in the form of corn and blankets or hides, often seizing the goods by force, and Native laborers were conscripted into all manner of projects, often on an extralegal, unpaid basis. Furthermore, the Franciscan missionaries outlawed the native religion and burned sacred artifacts. After years of famine, mistreatment, and unchecked Apache raiding, the Native Americans rose up in a coordinated attack, the Pueblo Revolt, in 1680. The revolt succeeded in driving the Spanish out of New Mexico for the next 12 years. Founding of Alburquerque 10th Duke of Alburquerque The Spanish returned in 1692 and were able to recapture the territory without much resistance. Returning settlers established communities at Bernalillo and Atrisco in the late 1690s. In 1705, Francisco Cuervo y Vald√©s arrived in Santa Fe as the newly appointed governor of New Mexico. Eager to prove himself, Cuervo decided to establish a villa, or royally chartered town, in the Rio Abajo region. This would be only the fourth New Mexican town to hold the prestigious title, after Santa Fe, El Paso (now in Texas), and Santa Cruz de la Ca√±ada. Cuervo chose a good site on the Camino Real, near a ford of the river, and stationed a detachment of soldiers there in order to encourage settlers to move in. On April 23, 1706, he drafted a formal document declaring that he had founded La Villa de San Francisco Xavier de Alburquerque. The town was named after Cuervo's superior, Viceroy of New Spain Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque, with whom Cuervo clearly hoped to curry favor. In order to also honor the recently crowned King Philip V, colonial authorities had the name changed to San Felipe de Neri de Alburquerque. (The first \\"r\\" in Alburquerque was later dropped by early English-speaking visitors and this misspelling has persisted.) The Spanish Laws of the Indies dictated that a villa should be a compact settlement organized around a plaza, with a minimum of 30 families. In his report, Cuervo asserted that the new villa had 35 families with 252 residents and that the plaza and streets had been laid out, houses built, and the church was finished, thereby meeting the requirements. However, it later emerged that many of these claims were exaggerated. According to depositions recorded during an official inquiry in 1712, there had only been 19 founding families, which together with the ten soldiers and their families numbered 129 citizens in total. Furthermore, rather than building a new town, the settlers had just re-inhabited old haciendas abandoned during the revolt. These houses were spread out over a distance of unlike the compact town Cuervo had described. Despite these findings, the villa's charter was never revoked. Spanish and Mexican rule San Felipe de Neri Church, originally built in 1793 The Albuquerque plaza evidently was still not finished at the time of the 1712 hearings, but eventually the settlers did lay out a real town. Like other Spanish colonial settlements, the villa consisted of a central plaza surrounded by houses, government offices, and a church. For much of the 18th century, the homes around the plaza were inhabited only on Sundays as the residents spent the rest of the week on their farms. It was not until the late 1700s that a permanent population was established at the plaza. According to a 1776 report by Fray Atanasio Dom√≠nguez, the villa had 157 families with 763 total inhabitants. Dom√≠nguez also gave a brief description of the community: Frequent Apache and Navajo raids compelled the settlers to consolidate their scattered dwellings into a series of outlying plazas, which were easier to defend. Upriver from the main plaza, these included Los Duranes, Los Candelarias, Los Griegos, Los Gallegos, Los Poblanos, and Los Ranchos. The Spanish census of 1790 lists 248 families for all seven plazas (84 at the main plaza) with a total population of 1,136. The range of occupations listed shows that most of the residents were involved in farming or sheep-herding, with few specialized trades. The census records show that most of the inhabitants were mestizos and that interracial marriages were common. The villa's population was estimated as 2,625 in 1810 and 4,075 in 1816. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain following the Mexican War of Independence. While change was slow to come to the remote province of New Mexico, one major effect was the opening of the region for the first time to American trade. Beginning in the 1820s, the Santa Fe Trail brought American goods and merchants to New Mexico in ever-increasing numbers. Albuquerque's location on the Camino Real also made it a stopover for traders traveling south to the Mexican interior. The Mexican census of 1827 gives a population of 2,547, and shows a more diverse range of occupations than in 1790, including merchants, craftsmen, and a teacher. Territorial period In 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, U.S. forces under Stephen W. Kearny entered New Mexico and were able to take control of the territory without resistance. Kearny marched into Albuquerque in September to raise the U.S. flag and administer an oath of allegiance to the local residents. Kearny's troops established a U.S. Army post near the plaza, which brought an influx of goods and people over the next twenty years. In general, the townspeople welcomed the American military presence, which stimulated the local economy and helped put an end to decades of Native American raiding. An account of the town was given by U.S. Attorney William W.H. Davis in 1853 as he traveled the territorial District Court circuit: The 1860 Census showed a population of 1,608, of which the army garrison made up about a third, and indicated that some Albuquerque residents had amassed considerable wealth. During the U.S. Civil War, Confederate troops under Henry Hopkins Sibley captured Albuquerque in March 1862 during the New Mexico Campaign. The Confederates continued on to the north, but were later forced to retreat back to Texas after losing most of their supplies at the Battle of Glorieta Pass. When they occupied Albuquerque for a second time on April 8, Union forces under Edward Canby engaged them in the Battle of Albuquerque, a long-range artillery skirmish with few casualties. In general, the war did not have much of an impact on the community. stereogram from the 1880s Railroad era The late 1870s saw the building of New Mexico's first railroad, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. As construction proceeded south from Raton Pass, survey crews were trying to find a site for a planned locomotive maintenance facility. Meanwhile, real estate speculators in Albuquerque hoped to profit from the railroad's arrival. Three local businessmen, Franz Huning, Elias S. Stover, and William Hazeldine, formed the New Mexico Town Company to buy up land for the railroad and related development. Ultimately the company was able to assemble a parcel which today is known as the Albuquerque Original Townsite. However, the site was actually a considerable distance from the existing community around the plaza‚Äîabout ‚Äîwhich meant that in effect the new development was a completely separate town. It became known as New Albuquerque, or just New Town. The first train pulled into Albuquerque in April 1880, and development of New Town began immediately. Unlike Old Town with its long-established, primarily Hispanic population, New Town was dominated by recently arrived Anglo-Americans and European immigrants, and its built environment reflected their tastes and attitudes. Civil engineer Walter G. Marmon was hired to lay out the town, creating an orderly grid with numbered streets like those in the Midwest. Stores, hotels, and saloons sprang up, operating out of flimsy wooden buildings or even tents at first, then more substantial brick structures. A mule-drawn street railway was built to ferry passengers between Old Town and New Town along Railroad Avenue (now Central Avenue). Albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885, and Henry N. Jaffa was elected as the first mayor. The town's early development was described by Sylvester Baxter in an article for Harper's: Main Building in 1904 The 1890 Census reported a population of 3,785, and Albuquerque was incorporated as a city the following year. A public school system also started in 1891, and primary schools were built in each of the city's four wards. Most of the city's early residential development took place in the Second Ward, which included Albuquerque's first subdivision, the Highland Addition, and the Third Ward, which was an ethnically diverse area home to a large number of railroad employees and other working-class citizens. In 1892, the University of New Mexico began operation. Its campus, consisting of a single building for almost a decade, occupied a remote location on the high ground known as the East Mesa, more than east of downtown. Early twentieth century By 1900, Albuquerque had a population of 6,238, with another 1,200 recorded for Old Town; in 1910, the population was 11,020. The city's largest employer was the American Lumber Company sawmill, which employed over 850 people in 1906. Many others worked at the AT&SF; Railroad Shops, the stockyards, or the Southwestern Brewery and Ice Company. In 1904, the venerable horse-drawn trolley was replaced by a modern electric streetcar line. By 1916, the streetcar system had of track with multiple lines connecting Old Town, the railroad depot, Barelas, the sawmill, the Highland Addition, and the university. In order to attract more riders, the streetcar company developed Traction Park in Old Town, which hosted horse racing and baseball as well as the Territorial Fair. In 1905, it was reported that 60,000 people rode the streetcar during the week of the fair. The Southwest Presbyterian Sanatorium in 1911 A major factor that brought many people to Albuquerque in the early 20th century was the dry climate, which was believed to be ideal for tuberculosis patients. The first sanatorium opened in 1902, and eventually there were as many as 16. These facilities were concentrated in the sandhills leading up to the East Mesa, particularly on East Central Avenue which became known as \\"TB Row.\\" Two of the largest were St. Joseph Hospital (now Lovelace Medical Center Downtown) and the Southwest Presbyterian Sanatorium (now Presbyterian Hospital), both of which are still in operation. In 1915, it was estimated that tuberculosis patients made up more than 20% of the city population, with the percentage including family members possibly as high as 50%. One such newcomer was Clyde Tingley, who would come to play a major role in the city's development during five decades in local politics. An advocate for active city government, Tingley was responsible for a wide range of civic improvements including parks, roads, landscaping, and other projects. Clyde Tingley was an important civic leader from the 1920s through the 1950s By 1920, Albuquerque had a population of 15,157, and housing subdivisions had begun to extend eastward along Central Avenue. In 1922, the city saw construction of its first skyscraper, the nine-story First National Bank Building. At the same time, the number of automobiles in the city was rapidly increasing. A study from 1928 recorded thousands of vehicles per day on the major roads, with less than 5% consisting of horse-drawn traffic. As cars became common, the city saw a shift from compact streetcar- and pedestrian- oriented development to a more suburban land-use pattern. Between 1925 and 1941, the city quadrupled in area. Streets started to be paved, and the streetcar system was replaced by buses in 1928. In 1926, U.S. Route 66 was established. The highway initially ran through Albuquerque on a north‚Äìsouth alignment along 4th Street, but in 1937 it was rerouted to its more famous east‚Äìwest alignment along Central Avenue. Over the next several decades, the road brought a steady stream of travelers through town, and dozens of motels, diners, and gas stations were built to accommodate them. At its peak, 98 motels lined the road from one end of the city to the other. Another transportation-related development to come to Albuquerque in the 1920s was air travel, with the first airport beginning scheduled service in 1928. The Tewa Lodge is one of many motels built on Route 66 in Albuquerque During the Great Depression in the 1930s, Albuquerque saw a wide variety of public works projects thanks to the New Deal programs enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Under the influence of Clyde Tingley, who took office as Governor of New Mexico in 1935, some of the projects included new fairgrounds for the New Mexico State Fair, a new Albuquerque Municipal Airport, three grade- separated railroad crossings, and a variety of schools, community centers, and other public buildings. The city continued to grow, reaching a population of 35,499 in 1940. Postwar growth Albuquerque Army Air Base in 1942 World War II brought a great deal of activity to Albuquerque. In 1941, the army took over the old Albuquerque Airport, then known as Oxnard Field, and converted it into Albuquerque Army Air Base (now Kirtland Air Force Base). Concurrently, the top-secret Manhattan Project put New Mexico at the center of nuclear weapons research. After the war, this research continued at Sandia Base, now Sandia National Laboratories. With the combined effect of these large government employers and a broader population shift toward the western cities, Albuquerque's population exploded. From 1940 to 1950 the population nearly tripled, to 96,815, and then doubled again to 201,189 by 1960. Local developers struggled to keep up with the runaway growth, building nearly 12,000 new houses during the 1940s. Houses spread into the Northeast Heights in increasingly large subdivisions, where new homeowners were able to take part in the suburban lifestyle idealized at the time. The largest of these was Princess Jeanne Park, with over 1,600 houses. Built by local developer Dale Bellamah starting in 1954, the neighborhood epitomized 1950s suburban living so well that one of its houses was replicated in a Smithsonian exhibit in 1994. As the city continued to annex these new subdivisions, its area increased almost sixfold between 1940 and 1960. Although Albuquerque did not have a strong tradition of institutionalized racism, many of the postwar suburban developments were racially segregated with covenants prohibiting black or Asian people from buying property there. Instead, the city's small African American population was concentrated in the inner city, particularly the South Broadway neighborhood. In the 1950s, the city's first suburban black neighborhood was built in the East End Addition, although it never grew very large. Albuquerque passed a civil rights ordinance barring racial discrimination in public accommodations in 1952, and segregated housing was banned in 1963. Old Albuquerque, which had remained a separate town since the arrival of the railroad, was finally absorbed into the city in 1949. The community had struggled during the early 20th century as most of its businesses and institutions moved to New Town: the county courthouse was moved in 1926, and by the 1930s barely any businesses were still operating around the plaza. Things began to improve in the 1940s as Albuquerque citizens started to take note of Old Town's historic value, and the Old Albuquerque Historical Society was established in 1946. Subsequently, Old Town gradually developed into a popular tourist attraction, with most of the adobe houses re- purposed into shops, restaurants, and galleries. Nob Hill Business Center was a model for decentralized commercial development in Albuquerque In the 1940s, Downtown was still the city's commercial center, but this began to change as residents of the new suburban developments increasingly preferred to shop in their own neighborhoods. One of the first suburban commercial projects was the Nob Hill Business Center, which opened in 1947. Its developer, Robert Waggoman, was initially mocked for building a large commercial center far from Downtown, but it was Nob Hill's decentralized strip mall model and not the large downtown department stores that would guide future development. The migration of people and businesses out of the inner city to the suburban Heights mirrored broader urban flight trends throughout the U.S. During World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Albuquerque on training flights. The city served as a stand-in for the British for Warsaw, Poland which is the same distance from London, England as Albuquerque is from Terrell.AT6 Monument 1960s and 70s Pan-American Freeway was built during the 1960s Albuquerque continued to expand in the 1960s, though the pace of new construction was slower than in the 1950s. Contiguous subdivisions gave way to even greater urban sprawl as far-flung developments like Paradise Hills and Rio Rancho started to appear on the West Side. Planning for an urban freeway system began shortly after passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act, and construction on the north‚Äìsouth Pan-American Freeway and the east‚Äìwest Coronado Freeway began in the late 1950s. The last link in the project, the Big I interchange, was dedicated in 1966. The freeways improved access to the suburbs, but also diverted most traffic away from Downtown and the traveler- oriented Route 66 corridor. Another new development in the 1960s was the opening of Albuquerque's first shopping malls, Winrock Center in 1961 and Coronado Center in 1965. Downtown Albuquerque in the late 1960s, prior to most of the urban renewal projects Much like other cities throughout the U.S., Albuquerque experienced urban decay in the inner city as economic activity continued to shift toward the suburbs. Beginning in the late 1960s, city officials tried to tackle the problem with a variety of urban renewal projects. The prevailing urban planning philosophies of the day, which drew on the ideas of Le Corbusier, favored a top-down, monumental approach rather than more organic development. In Albuquerque, as in many other cities, this led to wholesale demolition of older buildings in favor of large new projects like Civic Plaza and the Albuquerque Convention Center. Almost no pre-1900 buildings were left standing, and some of the city's most notable landmarks were razed, including the famous Alvarado Hotel. Albuquerque also experienced its share of social turbulence during the 1960s and 1970s. While crime had not been much of a problem during the 1950s, by 1969 the Albuquerque metropolitan area was reported to have the second highest crime rate in the country behind only San Francisco. At the same time, activism was on the rise, including Chicano groups like the Brown Berets and La Alianza as well as anti-Vietnam War protests, African American civil rights, and other causes. Relations with police were often tense. An antiwar protest at UNM in 1970 saw National Guard troops mobilized to disperse the crowd with teargas and bayonets, while two people were shot by police at another protest in 1972 which shut down Interstate 25. In 1971, a confrontation between police and a large crowd at Roosevelt Park devolved into a full-blown riot, with violence and looting in several parts of the city. Things calmed down later in the 1970s as the police department made an effort to improve community relations and some of the more militant groups started to be discredited. The Altair 8800 computer designed by MITS Other changes between 1960 and 1980 reflected Albuquerque's increasing stature as a city with over a quarter million inhabitants. The Sunport was upgraded to an international airport, with a new terminal built in 1965 and expanded in 1971. In 1966, the popular Sandia Peak Tramway and UNM's well- known basketball arena The Pit opened. The city's most famous annual event, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, began in 1972, the same year the Albuquerque Dukes began play in the highest level of Minor League Baseball. During the 1970s, Albuquerque found itself at the center of the fledgling personal computer industry when MITS, a local electronics company, attracted attention with their $400 Altair 8800 computer. Microsoft, now one of the world's largest software companies, was founded in 1975 when Paul Allen and Bill Gates came to Albuquerque to write software for the Altair. The company's headquarters remained in the city until 1979. Since 1980 Albuquerque's population has continued to grow since the 1970s, reaching 545,852 in 2010. Much of this growth has occurred on the West Side, creating traffic problems and demand for more river crossings. However, construction of new bridges was opposed by North Valley residents who wanted to preserve the area's rural character. Two new bridges were approved by the state government in 1980, but took years to materialize due to legal wrangling. After making some design compromises, the city managed to complete the Paseo del Norte Bridge in 1987, while the even more controversial Monta√±o Bridge was not finished until 1997. Increasing traffic also affected the freeways; by 1999 the Big I interchange was reported to be the 10th worst traffic bottleneck in the entire country. In order to alleviate the problem, the interchange was completely rebuilt in 2000‚Äì02 at a total cost of $293 million. Downtown Albuquerque has seen more infill construction since the 1970s Revitalizing Downtown has continued to be a topic of discussion. Since the failure of the 1970s urban renewal projects, the city has placed more emphasis on infill and smaller-scale development. Some of the earlier changes have been undone, including restoring the original traffic flow on a number of streets. Downtown has seen a number of new residential and commercial projects and has succeeded in developing a busy nightlife district, but other challenges remain. The city has also paid more attention to historic preservation, including purchasing buildings like the De Anza Motor Lodge and El Vado Auto Court to keep them from demolition. A notable success of this effort was the redevelopment of the abandoned Old Albuquerque High School in the early 2000s. Attempted redevelopment of the vacant Rail Yards property has been ongoing for some time as well. The New Mexico Rail Runner Express began operation in 2006 Along with a focus on denser development, the city has tried to improve mass transit options, particularly along the busy Central Avenue corridor. Restoring streetcar or light rail service along Central was an idea promoted by Mayor Martin Ch√°vez in particular, though it never came to fruition. Instead, the city has focused on improving bus service along the corridor. The Rapid Ride express bus service was established in 2004, eventually expanding to three lines. In 2016, construction began on the Albuquerque Rapid Transit project, a bus rapid transit line with dedicated lanes and stations. Another transit-related development was the inauguration of the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter rail system in 2006. The Albuquerque Police Department became a focus of headlines in the early 2010s due to the rate of shootings by police officers, with 27 people killed and 15 others wounded between 2010 and 2014. This was reported as the highest rate of fatal police shootings in the country. Many of those shot were dealing with mental illness, calling into question officers' preparedness for dealing with such situations. Criticism intensified even more after the shooting of James Boyd in early 2014, which sparked protests and vigils after lapel camera footage of the incident was made public. Later that year, the U.S. Department of Justice completed a 16-month investigation, concluding that APD had demonstrated a \\"pattern or practice of use of excessive force\\". While the rate of shootings has decreased since federally mandated changes were enacted, the department has struggled with officer recruitment and retention, falling to just 820 officers in 2016. This has been blamed in part for the city's rising crime rate and was a major issue in the 2017 mayoral election.

There is only one species known in this genus, Agkistrognathus campbelli. The genus name translates to \\"hook jaw\\" while the species name refers to Bob Campbell, who discovered the only known specimen.  Description  Agkistrognathus is a thalattosaurian, a group of marine reptiles with long, paddle-like tails and independently movable digits. Agkistrognathus can be distinguished from other thalattosaurians due to having conical, closely spaced teeth which are smallest in the middle of the jaw and deep dentaries with hooked front ends. These features may have given it a powerful bite . The dentaries are also bifurcated at their posterior ends, with the both forks being the same length but the dorsal one being much deeper. This combination is unique to Agkistrognathus. Agkistrognathus is probably closely related to Thalattosaurus and Paralonectes due to having conical teeth at the mandibular symphysis.  History  Agkistrognathus was discovered in the Sulphur Mountain formation in eastern British Columbia. It was described in a 1993 article along with several other new thalattosaurs from the same locality: Thalattosaurus borealis, Paralonectes merriami, an additional specimen referred to Paralonectes, and an unnamed species. Based on the conodont fauna, this locality is believed to be early to mid triassic in age, probably from the late Anisian to early Ladinian. Thus, these species may be the oldest thalattosaurians known. The holotype of Agkistrognathus campbelli, TMP 89.127.6, is a disarticulated skull including a maxilla, premaxilla, vomer, dentaries, angular, splenial, and other unidentified fragments.

Life  In 583 BCE, Xianzi of Han gave his political support to Zhao Wu and made him the successor of Zhuangzi. However, Zhao Wu did not enter the aristocratic rank of Qing(Âçø) during the reign of Duke Li of Jin. After Duke Li's death, Duke Dao appointed Zhao Wu a Qing upon his accession.

According to his own words, \\"Wars can finally come to an end\\". In 547 BCE, the state of Wey was in the chaos caused by a civil war.

State voters chose twenty electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Ever since statehood, Texas had been very nearly the strongest state for the Democratic Party owing to its initial history being as a Deep South state based around Negro slavery. Even during Reconstruction when Negroes were briefly enfranchised, the Republican Party won just one statewide election, and after Redemption and the passing of a new constitution in 1876 the GOP became confined largely to areas of abolitionist German refugee settlement in the Hill Country,Bass, Jack; The Transformation of Southern Politics: Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945, p. 25 and to a few South Texas counties where local Republican bosses could outcompete their Democratic equivalents.Weeks, O. Douglas; 'The Texas Mexican and the Politics of South Texas'; The American Political Science Review, vol. 24, no. 3 (August 1930), pp. 606‚Äì627 The Terrell Election Law created a poll tax disenfranchised the remaining Negro voters from 1902, the vast majority of Mexican-Americans, and also most poor whites.Davidson, Chandler; Race and Class in Texas Politics, p. 21 Voter turnout among males over twenty-one fell from over eighty percent to under thirty percent following the poll tax.Davison; Race and Class in Texas Politics, p. 24 The period following this disfranchisement, nonetheless, saw a considerable amount of typical \\"Progressive\\" reform under Governors James Stephen Hogg and Thomas M. Campbell, and despite this progressive faction ceding power in 1906 to the conservatives, Texas proved solid in its support for Woodrow Wilson at the 1912 Democratic National Convention.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, pp. 50‚Äì52 Another populist, James Ferguson, took the governorship in 1914 on an anti-Prohibition platform, but was impeached for misappropriation of public funds. Nonetheless, this impeachment actually was to spur James to run in the ensuing presidential election,Warren, Kenneth F.; Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior, p. 788 although despite attempting to do so he did not obtain ballot access in any of the other forty-seven states. The 1916 presidential election had seen Democrat Woodrow Wilson establish firmer control over the machine-dominated areas of South Texas, but hostility towards Wilson's peace promises caused some losses amongst the German population, where Lee County went Republican for the first time.Murrin, John M.; Johnson, Paul E.; McPherson, James M.; Fahs, Alice; and Gerstle Gary; Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People (Concise Edition), p. 532 By the time the 1920 presidential election season was to begin, President Wilson was hated by German and Irish Americans for his entry into the war and his role in drafting the Treaty of Versailles and supporting many anti-German groups during the \\"Red Scare\\".Hough, Jerry F.; Changing Party Coalitions: The Mystery of the Red State-blue State Alignment; pp. 83‚Äì86 His League of Nations proposal was also opposed in the South where isolationism had long been very powerful.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, p. 211 Vote Despite the hostility towards Wilson and James M. Cox ‚Äì who had banned German-language instruction in public schools as Governor of Ohio ‚Äì amongst German-Americans and some isolationists, Texas was too solidly Democratic for there to be any threat from even the largest popular-vote landslide in United States presidential election history. It is true that Cox' performance was the worst by a Democrat since the complete disfranchisement of Texas' black population by the 1902 poll tax,Dave Leip's U.S. Election Atlas; Presidential General Election Results Comparison ‚Äì Texas but losses from hostility to Wilsonian foreign policy were much less pronounced than in French Louisiana or the Ozarks. Favorite son James E.

Northeast Texas between Reconstruction and the Great Depression, p. 197 but these were few enough that he did not crack double figures for the state as a whole, and his presence cut into support for imprisoned Socialist Eugene V.

Its ears are rounded with smooth margins, measuring long. The ears are brown in color, with the base of the ear a lighter brown. The tragus is white and short, at long. Their dorsal fur is ashy-gray, with some hairs tipped in a reddish-orange tint of brown. Other dorsal hairs are tipped in a charcoal black color. Their heads, backs, uropatagia, and feet have silver-gold guard hairs. On their ventral side, their hairs are dark gray at the base, but whitish gray at the tips. Their thumbs are relatively long, at long. The calcar is well-developed, but lacks a keel.Soisook, P., Karapan, S., Satasook, C., & Bates, P. J. (2013). A new species of Murina (Mammalia: Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) from peninsular Thailand. Zootaxa, 3746(4), 567-579. Biology It eats insects, foraging for them only above the forest floor. It likely roosts in leaves or hollow trees. Range and habitat It occurs in moist, evergreen lowland rainforests in the Narathiwat Province of southern Thailand. It has only been encountered in the Bala Forest of Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary. Conservation It is currently evaluated as critically endangered by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this evaluation because its area of occupancy and extent of occurrence are both very small, at less than . Also, there is a projected decline in the quality and extent of their habitat. It is threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and the expansion of agriculture.

The first successful solar sail spacecraft was the Japanese IKAROS mission, launched on 21 May 2010. Overview The project is further developing technologies first tested on their STRaND-1 CubeSat, launched in February 2013. CubeSail will deploy a 25 m2 solar sail, which will be used to demonstrate the propulsive effect of solar radiation pressure and the de-orbiting capabilities of the sail as a drag augmentation device.Surrey Space Centre ‚Äì UK CubeSail Satellite. AMSAT- UK. 11 July 2014.CubeSail. University of Surrey. Accessed on 6 July 2019. Attitude control CubeSail will be a three-axis stabilised solar sail satellite. Attitude control (orientation) is necessary because the orientation of the sail relative to the Sun direction will determine the propulsion force. Full three-axis attitude control will be performed by means of a centre of mass/centre of pressure offset technique, complemented by three magnetorquers and a reaction wheel. Attitude control can be enhanced by using the solar radiation pressure force on the sail to generate rotation torques.CubeSail - Sailing. University of Surrey, UK The radiation pressure can also be used to induce a change of altitude as well as orbital inclination. The spacecraft will be deployed in a low Earth orbit (800 km altitude) on a Sun-synchronous orbit. Configuration The CubeSail nanosatellite is a CubeSat of the 3U format.CubeSail - Satellite. University of Surrey, UK The satellite bus occupies approximately 1U, and the remaining 2U house the two-axis translation stage and sail-deployment subsystem. Objectives The objectives of the CubeSail mission are to demonstrate the concept of solar sail propulsion of a 3-axis stabilised 25 m2 solar sail for one year while in low Earth orbit; and to demonstrate the use of gossamer structures (very light gauze-like fabric) as a drag augmentation device for satellite de-orbiting.

It is located in the town ≈†vihov in the Plze≈à Region of the Czech Republic.  History  ≈†vihov castle was built by the House of R√Ωzmberk ze Sk√°ly (noble family). It was besieged by the Hussites during Hussite wars, the garrison surrendered after their water moats were siphoned. It was rebuilt between 1480 and 1489 by the order of the castle's owner, Puta Schwihau von Riesenberg, in the Late Gothic style. His sons continued in rebuilding the castle after he died and invited a famous architect Benedikt Reid. In 1598 Kavkov√© z ≈ò√≠ƒçan (noble family) took the control of the castle, but were forced to sell it to Czernins of Chudenitz 50 years later in 1598, due to their poor management. Then the Thirty Years' War came and the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedish army. Benedikt Reid invented the castle's moat system with massive bastions (horseshoe shaped ground plans opened into the keep). He finished his works until 1520. He used the same system when he designed the fortification of one of the largest castles in Bohemia called Rab√≠. After the war, Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III. ordered the demolition of the castle, possibly out of fear for it being an \\"unconquerable fort of anti-Habsburg resistance\\". Luckily, thanks to constant postponing of the demolition, only a part of rampart was damaged. Castle palaces, chapel and other parts of the bastion were used as a granary, devaluating the whole complex, yet protecting it from being rebuilt. The castle stayed in Czernin's hands until the nationalization in 1945.  Architecture  Architecture The castle consists of two residential palaces, five-level entrance tower and a chapel built on top of the bastion. Only small parts of the rampart remained undamaged with four bastions -The Red Bastion, The White Bastion, The Green Bastion and The Gold Bastion (whose remains were discovered in 1951). There were two water moats around the castle. The inner moat was placed where today's inner courtyard is and the outer moat was between the inner and outer rampart (of which a part is still standing). If needed, the moats could be filled with water from three nearby ponds. The castle's interior consists of typical late Gothic and Renaissance furnishings: furniture, rich tapestries, pewter and copper kitchenware, weapons and arms. Valuable wall paintings from the 16th century can be found in The Red Bastion, the chapel and in other rooms. Open to public are the castle's armory, the kitchen (with original furnishings that originate mainly from the 18th century), the feast hall, the chapel, the bed chambers and The Great Hall with wooden cassette ceiling that originates from Dobrovice Castle. Ground plan (chapel) The castle's chapel was built between 1480 and 1489 by P≈Øta von Schwihau The exterior of the chapel remained mostly undamaged, the interior in the other hand was until its reconstruction in 1890. The stairs leading to the chapel were destroyed as well. The entrance hall has a net vault, it's ribs lean onto decorated consoles and converge into one paint keystone. The nave of the chapel is also vaulted, but all four ribs were rough-hewed for unknown reasons.

First and foremost an abstract painter, she also pursues numerous projects that investigate the effect and impact of painting in architectural spaces and the process of painting including site-specific settings. Von Gaza lives and works in Munich, Venice and Zurich.  Life  The Hamburg-born artist Sylke von Gaza was first taken to Italy as a three- year-old by her great-grandmother, whom she accompanied on long journeys to Venice and the Emilia-Romagna. It was during those childhood visits to the churches of Ravenna, Assisi and Venice, to name but a few, that she first came to appreciate painting and architecture. The experience made a lasting impression and continues to inspire her work to this day.Giloy-Hirtz (2008): From the Grey to the Colourful. Sylke von Gaza's first university degree is in _engineering_. Later, as a student of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 2002 to 2007 under the Irish painter Sean Scully, she found herself drawn to the Old Masters and Abstract expressionism.Giloy-Hirtz (2008): From the Grey to the Colourful & Drexler (2013): Sylke von Gaza in Conversation. She completed her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich in 2007, graduating with a Meistersch√ºler diploma (\\"summa cum laude\\").\\"Matrikeldatenbank\\" (in German). Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste M√ºnchen. Retrieved 2017-07-24. In the German academy tradition, \\"Meistersch√ºler\\" is the title awarded only to exceptionally talented students who successfully complete a postgraduate masterclass, equal to \\"summa cum laude\\".  Work  Netherlandish and Italian Renaissance painting has always been a key source of inspiration for Sylke von Gaza. With her large-scale abstract oil paintings she positions herself within the tradition of the Old Masters without, however, referencing them directly in her formal language. Oscillating between past and present, Venice provides an ideal creative environment for the artist, whose works not only probe the questions of tradition and identity in painting, but also provoke a discussion of the intrinsic value of art and society.Schmidt (2007): Die Schleier der Sylke von Gaza & Giloy-Hirtz (2008): From the Grey to the Colourful & Drexler (2013): Sylke von Gaza in Conversation & Sinninghe Damst√© (2013): Sacraments of a Deeper Reality. Her work thus far can be divided into different strands. Her principal body of work consists of Early Works, individual works, themed groups of works, site-specific works and the series of Veil Paintings, among them the Grey Veil Paintings and Red Veil Paintings. In Sylke von Gaza's creative practice, the veil, the metaphor for transcendence and permeability, plays a central role.Sinninghe Damst√© (2013): Sacraments of a Deeper Reality. The ability to disclose by concealing, to render visible by shrouding ‚Äì the artist has internalised this fundamental potential of painting and made it central to her work. Since 2012, the artist has been working on projects that focus on painting in sacred spaces, primarily in Venetian churches. Since 2013, in collaboration with Curia Patriarchale di Venezia, von Gaza has been painting in the Chiesa San Fantin (2014), the Chiesa San Lio (2015), the Cappella Santissima Trinit√† (2016).Ackermann (2015), Venedig wird abstrakt, S. 111. To mark the Venice Biennale of 2015, the Venetian Curia commissioned von Gaza with a site-specific work for the Renaissance chapel of the Gussoni family in the church of San Lio. Working on site inside the chapel during the Beyond the Veil project, the artist created the Gussoni Red Veil Paintings Triptych, which is now permanently installed in the Renaissance chapel designed around 1479 by Tullio and Pietro Lombardo. The famous Venetian painter of Veduta Giovanni Antonio Canal (1697‚Äì1768), better known as Canaletto, is buried in the chapel. At the invitation of the Seminario Patriarcale di Venezia von Gaza was creating the project Il Nido.

Unlike other defences, including antivirus software and sandboxed execution, it does not rely on being able to detect threats. Similarly to Content Disarm and Reconstruction, CTR is designed to remove the threat without knowing whether it has done so, and acts without knowing if data contains a threat or not. Detection strategies work by detecting unsafe content, and then blocking or removing that content. Content that is deemed safe is delivered to its destination. In contrast, Content Threat Removal assumes all data is hostile and delivers none of it to the destination, regardless of whether it is actually hostile. Although no data is delivered, the business information carried by the data is delivered, but using new data created for the purpose.  Threat  Advanced attacks continuously defeat defences that are based on detection. These are often referred to as zero day attacks, because as soon as they are discovered attack detection mechanisms must be updated to identify and neutralise the attack, and until they are, all systems are unprotected. These attacks succeed because attackers are skilled in finding new ways of evading detection. Polymorphic code can be used to evade the detection of known unsafe data and sandbox detection allows attacks to evade dynamic analysis.  Method  A Content Threat Removal defence works by intercepting data on its way to its destination. The business information carried by the data is extracted and the data is discarded. Then entirely new, clean and safe data is built to carry the information to its destination. The effect of building new data to carry the business information is that any unsafe elements of the original data are left behind and discarded. This includes executable data, macros, scripts and malformed data that triggers vulnerabilities in applications. While CTR is a form of content transformation, not all transformations provide a complete defence against the content threat.  Applicability  CTR is applicable to user-to-user traffic, such as email and chat, and machine-to-machine traffic, such as web services. Data transfers can be intercepted by in-line application layer proxies and these can transform the way information content is delivered to remove any threat. CTR works by extracting business information from data and it is not possible to extract information from executable code. This means CTR is not directly applicable to web browsing, since most web pages are code. It can, however, be applied to content that is downloaded from, and uploaded to, web sites. Although most web pages cannot be transformed to render them safe, web browsing can be isolated and the remote access protocols used to reach the isolated environment can be subjected to CTR. CTR provides a solution to the problem of Stegware. It naturally removes detectable steganography and eliminates symbiotic and permutation steganography through normalisation.  Availability  Deep Secure have pioneered the development of CTR. A number of their products and services incorporate CTR, including application layer proxies for email and web services and ICAP (the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) sidecar servers for uploaded and downloaded content. Garrison provide a remote Desktop isolation solution where the display content is converted to a video signal that is then recoded as a video stream, using separate hardware chips. This process removes any threat from the content of the display content.

The perpetrator was identified as Emanuel Kidega Samson, a 25-year-old native of Sudan.https://www.yahoo.com/news/trial- tennessee-church-shooting-suspect-start-monday-050544263.html Samson was arrested after getting into an altercation with a bystander, and charged with first-degree murder and 43 other charges. The suspect indicated that the attack was revenge for the 2015 Charleston church shooting. Shooting The gunman carried two handguns, and after fatally shooting Melanie Crow outside, he entered the church from the rear, according to police. He then walked through the church, shooting six more people. At this point, according to police, the gunman was confronted by an usher, 22-year-old Robert Engle, whom he pistol-whipped. During the ensuing struggle, Samson accidentally shot himself in the chest. Engle ran to his car to get his own gun and pointed it at the wounded Samson until police arrived to arrest him. Engle was called a \\"hero\\" by police. Around 50 parishioners were in the church at the time of the shooting, which was reported at 11:15 a.m. local time as church services were ending. Victims The deceased woman was identified as 38-year-old Melanie Crow. She was first shot in the face, then suffered additional gunshot wounds to the back when she attempted to flee the gunman. Six other people aged between 60 and 83 were injured by gunfire; their injuries were non-life- threatening. Perpetrator The gunman, Emanuel Kidega Samson, was a 25-year- old Sudanese native residing legally in the United States, having arrived as a child in 1996. He was allegedly carrying two handguns, a 9mm and a .40-caliber, and was wearing a ski mask at the time of the attack. Samson had been licensed to work as an unarmed security guard from 2014‚Äì16, although his license was expired and he had been seeking its reinstatement. Samson is a former member of the Burnette Chapel Church. A review of Samson's Facebook page by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found sympathies and interests to black supremacist figures and groups like the New Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam, as well as an affinity for conspiracy theories. In the days leading up to the shooting, he posted \\"several cryptic messages\\" on his Facebook page. Samson had had two domestic disputes with his girlfriend in Murfreesboro in January and February earlier that year, but was not arrested. Three months earlier, he reportedly told his father that he was about to commit suicide, which prompted a police response. Samson was charged with first-degree murder immediately subsequent to the shooting. In a police interview, Samson suggested he was hearing voices and had a vision of the Burnette Chapel Church. A psychiatrist testified in April 2019 that Samson suffered from schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. Samson was scheduled to appear in Davidson County General Sessions court on September 27, and is being held at a county jail without bond. He allegedly had additional weapons in his vehicle, as well as a note that referenced the Charleston church shooting of 2015, in which a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans. The prosecution later claimed that Samson hoped to \\"kill at least 10 white people\\" in the shooting as revenge for the Charleston church shooting. On October 6, it was reported that a preliminary hearing had been set for October 23, 2017. Aftermath and reactions Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said, \\"This is a terrible tragedy for our city. My heart aches for the family and friends of the deceased as well as for the wounded victims and their loved ones.\\" Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam said he was \\"praying for the victims and committed to supporting the Antioch community in the aftermath of this tragedy.\\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice have both launched civil rights investigations. Trial Samson was indicted on 43 charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated assault, and civil rights intimidation. His trial began on May 20, 2019. Prosecutors argued that Samson arrived at the church with the intention of killing 10 white churchgoers as retaliation for the 2015 Charleston Church shooting, in which 9 African-American churchgoers were killed by a white supremacist.

It was designed in c.1897 by architect C. W. Stephens. It has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since September 1988. History Winkfield Lodge In 1896 the house had six bedrooms and a ha-ha divided the house from its neighbour, Wressil Lodge. The house was owned by a Charles Anthony Mills in 1896; Mills named the house Winkfield Lodge after winning ¬£20,000 on a horse named Winkfield's Pride that had been a 200 to 1 gamble at a race at Newmarket. Prior to Mills's renaming it had been known as Tudor House. The Wimbledon Borough News later described Mills in 1908 as 'the great turf man who lives in splendid style in Parkside'. In 1914 Winkfield Lodge was sold to Arthur Warwick Sutton JP (1854-1925). Sutton was senior partner in his family‚Äôs seed business, Suttons Seeds (formerly Sutton & Sons), which had been founded in 1806 in Reading, Berks by his grandfather, John Sutton (1777-1863). Arthur‚Äôs father, Martin Hope Sutton (1815-1901), joined the firm in 1837 and Suttons became a huge international business, receiving a Royal Warrant in 1858. It played a crucial role in the country‚Äôs vegetable production during World War One, though the effects of the War on the business were devastating: Arthur‚Äôs brother, Leonard Goodhart Sutton (1863-1932), who like his father served as Mayor of Reading, lost four of his five sons in the conflict. Suttons Seeds is still in business though it is now based in Paignton and no longer in the ownership of the Sutton family. Arthur was a Fellow and Councillor of the Linnean Society of London and received the Victoria Medal of Honour from the Royal Horticultural Society, of which he was also a Council member. He was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal (a special court set up to reconsider a decision by another court) for the County of Berkshire in 1916. One of his friends was William Bateson (1861-1926), an advocate of the ideas of Gregor Mendel who introduced the term ‚Äògenetics‚Äô to describe the study of heredity and whose 1894 book Materials for the Study of Variation was one of the earliest formulations of the new approach to genetics. Sutton provided the means for Bateson to carry out extensive studies into genetics using the species Primula sinensis. Arthur Sutton later moved to Bournemouth where he was tangentially involved in a notorious murder. His chauffeur, Thomas Henry Alloway, had lured Irene Williams to Bournemouth where he murdered her. The police obtained the telegram he sent to Miss Williams but Alloway had destroyed all copies of his handwriting before the crime (or so he thought) and had changed his script. An impressive detective operation had persuaded the police that he was the culprit but without handwriting evidence they could not make a case. The crucial break came when Alloway, short of funds, forged ¬£96 worth of cheques from his employer ‚Äì signing them ‚ÄúArther Sutton‚Äù was a bit of a give-away. This crime gave police permission to enter Alloway‚Äôs home, where they found several letters in Alloway‚Äôs hand going back some years. This was enough to convict him and he was hanged in August 1922. Sutton leased the house to Captain Edward Kendrick Bunbury-Tighe and his family in 1917. Tighe was a wealthy Irish landowner and British Army officer who had served in the Anglo- Burmese Wars. On 13 November Tighe was found by his wife with severe head wounds in his bedroom at the lodge. A bloodied poker was found nearby, and some small objects had been stolen, including a pocket watch. Tighe died a few days later on 17 November having never regained consciousness; his body was identified by Francis Younghusband. A burglar, Arthur Henry de Stamir, was later found with Tighe's possessions at his lodgings. Stamir was found guilty of Tighe's murder and was hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 18 February 1918. Captain Tighe's bloodied body found, as imagined by The Illustrated Police News, 22 November 1917. Following Tighe's death the house was owned by the British businessman and politician Joseph Hood. Hood served as the member of parliament for Wimbledon from 1918 to 1924 and as Mayor of Wimbledon from 1930 until his death in 1931. The house has been the home of the Apostolic Nunciature to Great Britain, the diplomatic representative of the Vatican City to Great Britain, since 1938. It is the only diplomatic residence south of the River Thames. Pope John Paul II once stayed at the house and Pope Benedict XVI stayed at the house from 17‚Äì19 September 2010 during his visit to the United Kingdom. He celebrated Mass in the Apostolic Nunciature's chapel on the morning of 17 September. Benedict also privately met five victims of Catholic clerical sexual abuse during his stay at the house. The house is 2 storeys in height, made from Portland stone and has a steeply pitched green slate roof with tall chimneys. Divided into 11 bays, the entrance to the house is in the fourth bay, under a projecting porch.

Dihosana involves the invitation of ancestors through trance to pray for rain. It is a rain making dance. Dihosana is a dance heritage which has been inherited from the fore fathers by those practising it. People living in the north, approximately about 20 to 30 km north of Francistown, Botswana are believed to be the veteran elders of the Dihosana dance, in a village called Makobo. Hosana is a Kalanga term an old and wise person. The dancers usually dance in groups and wear black skirts, and long strings of beads in their necks. The beads are grouped in many different colour categories from red, black and white, a myriad in the body and waist. Hosana is part of the Kalanga culture and not everyone qualifies to be a Hosana dancer.  How Hosana begins  Hosanas at Domboshaba cultural festival For one to be a Hosana, the person should have an ancestral calling. It comes not as a choice or preference. One becomes possessed with sickness that cannot be healed at the hospital. The person will then be taken to a hill called Ka Mwale where they meet up with their ancestors for initiation ceremony. When they arrive at Ka Mwale, they will meet up with a traditional doctor who will diagnose the patient for the availability of hosana spirits. Once they are done and the patient is declared to be having the spirits, they will start helping out with the steps for initiation.The person will be healed and will be a complete hosana after being attended by a traditional doctor. The person will now join other veteran hosanas to pray for rain. It is believed that when there is drought in a village, the chief will approach the leader or elder of hosana so that they can pray for rain. The elder from veteran hosana will release someone to start by cleaning or sweeping the ground known as Sebata.

At a young age he became a galley captain, and served with distinction as a military commander, with a long record of battles against the Ottomans, from the naval expeditions to aid Thessalonica, to the Crusade of Varna, and the opening stages of the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War of 1463‚Äì1479, as well as the Wars in Lombardy against the Duchy of Milan. He also served in a number of high government positions, as provincial governor, savio del consiglio, and Procuratore de Supra of Saint Mark's Basilica. Early life Alvise Loredan was born in 1393 in the parish of St. Canciano in Venice, the only son of Giovanni Loredan, son of the Procurator of St Mark's Alvise Loredan. The name and origin of his mother are unknown. At the age of 21 he married Andriola, daughter of the merchant Cristoforo Negrobon, who, although wealthy, was apparently not a member of the patriciate, the upper stratum of the Venetian aristocracy. This marriage involved Loredan in commercial activities, but without much success; the death of his father in 1420, while he was away as duke (governor) of Crete, forced Loredan to assume the leadership of his household, and by 1423 Alvise had entered the service of the Republic as sopracomito (captain) in one of the war galleys, although in September of that year he was allowed to lay aside that duty due to a grave illness. Service during the defence of Thessalonica In 1425 he appears again as sopracomito in the fleet under the command of Fantino Michiel, during the operations in defence of Thessalonica against the Ottoman Empire. In July 1425, Michiel led ten galleys east from the city: the Venetians raided Ierissos and other forts in its vicinity, and then onto Christopolis (modern Kavala). The Venetians found the castle held by a 400-strong force of Ottoman sipahis, under the command of a certain Ismail Bey. Loredan led the first attack, which was repulsed, and only after all the ships mustered their forces were the Venetians able to overcome Ottoman resistance in a four-hour long battle: 41 Turks were killed, including Ismail Bey, and 30 taken prisoner. The Venetians occupied the fortress, but their success was temporary, as the Turks soon returned with a larger force and stormed the castle, killing or taking prisoner its Venetian garrison. Loredan remained active in the area, for on 22 February 1429, an act of the Great Council of Venice named him as captain of a large cog, equipped with towers, that was to be sent to Thessalonica. Loredan and his ship was assigned a major role in the attack by the Captain general of the Sea Andrea Mocenigo against the Ottoman naval base at Gallipoli on 1 July: his great ship would approach the Ottoman fortifications and engage the garrison with crossbows at close range, while the rest of the fleet broke through the palisade protecting the harbour and attacked the Ottoman ships moored there. In the event, although Mocenigo with his flagship managed to break into the palisade, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Loredan captained a ship in next year's fleet as well. The fleet left Venice on 5 March, but a few weeks later, while still under way, learned of the fall of Thessalonica to the Ottomans (29 March). Captain general Silvestro Morosini decided to avenge the city's fall by attacking an Ottoman fortress in the Dardanelles. The fort was largely destroyed after being bombarded by the fleet from 6 to 16 June; much of the work was done by Loredan's ship, which was specially equipped with large artillery pieces. Nevertheless, on 4 September, the Venetians concluded a peace treaty with the Ottomans. Military and civil service in Lombardy and overseas In 1431, the third war against the Duchy of Milan, ruled by the ambitious Filippo Maria Visconti, began. On 19 May, Loredan was elected captain of the squadron sent to harass Genoese shipping in the waters of the Levant. In this capacity, Loredan executed a landing against the Genoese colony of Chios. On 27 January 1432, he was elected as a sopracomito in the Tyrrhenian Sea fleet, and thus came under the command of his uncle, the celebrated admiral Pietro Loredan. In 1433‚Äì34, he assumed his first civil post as podest√† (governor) and captain of Belluno. In 1435, he was elected as captain of the muda (trade convoy) to \\"Romania\\" (the lands of the Byzantine Empire and the Black Sea). From December 1436 to September 1438 he was provveditore (commissioner, charged with both civil and military affairs) at Bergamo. His tenure coincided with the start of the fourth war against Milan, and the Visconti offensive under Niccol√≤ Piccinino in Lombardy; in the event, however, Piccinino turned towards Brescia rather than Bergamo. At around this time his first wife, with whom he had two sons, Francesco and Giovanni, died, and in 1441, Lordan married Isabella Cocco di Nicol√≤, herself a widow from a first marriage to Benedetto Foscarini. She bore him another two sons, Marco and Nicol√≤. In the same year, Loredan became head of the sestiere of Dorsoduro, after moving his residence from his family's traditional parish of St. Canciano to the island of Giudecca. The Loredans were proponents of Venice's traditional, maritime orientation, and viewed with distrust its expansion on the Italian mainland (the Terraferma), which had brought it into conflict with Milan. Alvise Loredan shared this view, as can be seen from a proposal he brought before the Great Council in February 1442, ordering the governors of Bergamo to demolish its fortifications as a sign of goodwill and trust towards Visconti, following the conclusion of peace with Milan at the Treaty of Cremona. The proposal failed to pass; nevertheless he was voted as admiral of the Gulf for the year. Throughout the summer and autumn of 1442 he led operations against Aragonese corsairs in the waters off Albania and southern Italy, as well as subduing the towns of Zenta (now a suburb of Split) and Budva. On 3 February 1443, Loredan was elected as Procurator of St Mark's de Supra (in charge of the cathedral itself), but allowed to continue to reside in Giudeccain exchange for an annual rent of 70 ducats. Crusade of Varna At the same time, he was elected as Captain general of the Sea, as part of the anti-Ottoman crusade being organized by King Ladislaus III of Poland and Hungary and John Hunyadi; however, the Venetians did not engage in any serious activity for the year, and on 11 November Loredan instead was appointed as one of the savii alle acque (officials charged with supervising the waterways of the Venetian Lagoon). On 25 April 1444, Loredan was appointed commander of the Venetian and Papal squadrons that would sail to take part in the crusade. His instructions, received on 17 June, were to obstruct the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, from crossing with his army into Anatolia and moving against the Karamanid ruler Ibrahim, who was allied with the Christian league. In the event, Loredan reached the Turkish Straits too late to stop Murad. As the Christian offensive in the Balkans was delayed, on 9 September he received instructions from Venice to abstain from offensive actions and open secret negotiations with the Sultan, who in the meantime defeated the Karamanids. Once the Crusader army began its invasion, however, he was charged with hindering the Ottoman army from returning to Europe. Loredan blockaded the Dardanelles, but Murad chose to cross the Bosporus north of Constantinople. As a result, on 11 November, at the Battle of Varna, the Ottomans inflicted a crushing defeat on the Crusader army. While Venice negotiated for a peace with the Sultan, Loredan spent the next year cruising with his fleet in the Aegean, in order to protect Venice's possessions and allies from Ottoman reprisals. Later career In late 1445, Loredan returned to Venice to disband his fleet. In October 1446, he became a savio del consiglio, and on 28 November he became a member of the zonta (extraordinary judicial committee) of the Council of Ten on the issue of Jacopo Foscari, the son of Doge Francesco Foscari: he was allowed to return from exile to Nauplia in Greece to Zelarino, in close proximity to Venice. On 23 February 1447 he was elected provveditore in campo (commissioner to the captain general of the army) for the new war against Milan, but declined to take p the post on account of ill health. On 17 March, he went to Rome as part of an embassy to congratulate the new Pope, Nicholas V. After his return, he was again elected provveditore in campo on 25 August, in order to assist his colleague Gherardo Dandolo. He accepted, but his poor health continued, and on 14 November he returned to Venice. Following the Milanese victory at the Battle of Caravaggio, on 8 November 1448 he was elected ambassador, along with Pasquale Malipiero, to the Milanese commander, Francesco Sforza, with whom Venice made a pact: in exchange for promising him rule over Milan, Sforza allied himself with Venice. After a brief period as provveditore in campo of Brescia, Loredan returned to Venice, where on 6 February 1449 he became a member of a zonta convened to try some Paduan rebels. In July, after he was once more elected as Captain general of the Sea in the war launched by Alfonso V of Aragon, who as King of Naples claimed the Ionian Islands, a Venetian dominion. Loredan led a fleet of 35 galleys to raid Messina and the coasts of Sicily, and scored a major success when he forced entry into the harbour of Syracuse, and destroyed the ships he found there. He returned to Venice in November 1449, when he was elected as one of the commissioners of salt (provveditori al Sale). The conflict ended on 2 July 1450 by a compromise peace. Loredan reappears in August 1453, as provveditore of the Venetian Arsenal; following the Fall of Constantinople, he and his colleague Vettore Cappello were charged with constructing new war galleys. In October he was again elected savio del consiglio until March 1454, and again in October 1454 until March 1455. In this capacity he was sent to Bartolomeo Colleoni to offer him the post of captain general of the Venetian armies, but with a reduced salary (condotta) on account of the prevailing peaceful conditions. During the following years, he was almost continuously among the savi del consiglio. In April 1457 he received permission to leave the city for four months on account of the plague. In October 1458, he argued against the Pope's proposal to hold a general meeting of Christian princes at Udine for the purpose of preparing another anti-Ottoman crusade. In December 1460 he was charged with investigating the sentences passed by the Auditori alle Sentenze. In January 1461 he was again one of the salt commissioners. First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War and death On 4 February 1463, while serving again as a savio del consiglio, Loredan was elected as Captain general of the Sea in the conflict with the Ottomans in the Morea. As the Venetians hoped to contain the conflict, his initial orders were marked by caution: he was to patrol the Aegean and defend any Venetian territories, but limit offensive actions to at most capturing Genoese ships. Following the Ottoman capture of Argos on 3 April, however, the situation changed, and Venice declared war on the Ottomans. Between June and August, Loredan landed an army under the Marquis Bertoldo d'Este off Modon and Nauplia. The campaign initially made rapid gains: Argos was recaptured in early August, and the Venetians refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Morea. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with the relief army under Turahanoƒülu √ñmer Bey, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of d'Este. The Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion. Following the arrival of substantial Ottoman reinforcements under the Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá the Venetians, whose army had been depleted by dysentery, abandoned the Hexamilion without a fight and retreated to their coastal fortresses. The Ottomans razed the wall yet again and advanced into the Morea. Argos surrendered and was razed, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance. After the Venetian retreat, Loredan attempted to gain an advantage for Venice by capturing Lemnos, and then brought the fleet of anchor at the colony of Negroponte. Loredan requested to be repatriated, whereupon the Senate elected Orsotto Giustinian as his successor. The transfer of authority took place at Modon on 28 February 1464, and Loredan returned home. On 5 September he was elected as envoy to congratulate the new Pope, Paul II (a Venetian), but he refused to accept; the government allowed him to postpone the embassy until the next spring, but in the end, they chose another to replace him. On 4 September 1465 he was again, for the fourth time, elected as Captain general of the Sea, in the ongoing war with the Ottomans. Despite his poor health he accepted, but soon his situation deteriorated to such an extent that on 7 February 1466 Vettore Cappello was elected to replace him. Loredan died in Venice on 6 March, and was buried in the .

A specialist sprinter, he won six of his thirteen races in a track career which lasted from April 1992 until September 1993. As a two-year-old he won the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and the valuable Racecall Gold Trophy as well as being placed in the Middle Park Stakes, Coventry Stakes and July Stakes. In the following year he won the Leisure Stakes and the Grosser Preis von Berlin before being retired from racing at the end of the year. He made a very promising to his start career as a breeding stallion but died at the age of six. Background Pips Pride was a chestnut horse with a small white star bred in England by Ronald Popely. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold for 15,000 guineas. During his racing career he was owned by Mrs V S Grant and trained by Richard Hannon Sr. at East Everleigh in Wiltshire. He was sired by Efisio, who won seven races including the Horris Hill Stakes, Challenge Stakes and Premio Emilio Turati. Efisio, who was also owned by Popely for part of his stud career, sired the winners of almost a thousand races including twelve at Group 1 level. Pips Pride's dam Elkie Brooks showed little racing ability, failing to win in eight starts. She was distantly descended from the influential British broodmare Black Cherry. Racing career 1992: two-year-old season Pips Pride made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 18 April when he was ridden by Willie Carson. Starting at odds of 11/2 he too the lead soon after half way and quickly drew away form his ten opponents to win by eight lengths. Eleven days later, with Pat Eddery in the saddle, he followed up in the Garter Stakes at Ascot, leading from the start to win from two rivals. Pips Pride was then stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and finished third behind Petardia and So Factual. In the following month he ran third to Wharf in the July Stakes at Newmarket, but then ran disappointingly when coming home fifth of the six runners behind his stablemate Son Pardo in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood. The colt was then sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 9 August and started at odds of 10/1 behind Son Pardo, who was made the 2/1 favourite. The other fancied runners included Tropical (Curragh Stakes), Splendent (winner of his last two races) and Ivory Frontier (Railway Stakes). Partnered by Frankie Dettori, who had never ridden at the course before, Pips Pride was among the leaders from the start and won by three quarters of a length and a neck from Shahik and Darbonne. Commenting on the colt's improved form, Richard Hannon said \\"Pips Pride loves to get out and bowl along. They didn't go fast at Goodwood, he pulled hard and gave himself no real chance. This time he was drawn on the right side and Frankie let him stride on\\". In September Pips Pride ran in the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and finished fourth of the seven runners behind Forest Wind, Marina Park and Sharp Prod. In the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on 1 October the colt started at odds of 12/1 and led for most of the way before being overtake in the closing stages and beaten a length into second by the French-trained Zieten. The Racecall Gold Trophy, a handicap race run over six furlongs at Redcar Racecourse on 27 October was one of the most valuable juvenile races in Europe and attracted a field of twenty-four runners. Unlike a conventional handicap, the weights were determined by the prices fetched by the offspring of the runners sires at auction, giving an advantage to the progeny of cheap or unfashionable stallions. The race was run in exceptionally testing conditions on very heavy ground on a cold, wet day. Ridden by Dean McKeown and carrying 117 pounds Pips Pride was made the 6/1 second favourite. Racing up the left hand side of the course (from the jockeys' viewpoint), he was amongst the leaders from the start, opened up a clear advantage a furlong out and kept on well to win by a length from his stablemate Revelation. 1993: three-year-old season Pips Pride began his second campaign on 22 May at Lingfield Park in the Listed Leisure Stakes in which he was matched against older horses. Ridden by Steve Raymont he led from the start and held off a strong challenge from the four-year-old filly Branston Abby to win by a head. In the Group 3 Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot he started third favourite but faded badly in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind College Chapel. After a break of seven weeks Pips Pride returned for the Group 3 Grosser Preis von Berlin (not the current race of the same name) over 1300 metres at Hoppegarten in Brandenburg, Germany. With Raymont in the saddle he took the lead soon after the start and pulled clear in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Nasr Allah. On his final appearance Pips Pride started a 16/1 outsider for the Haydock Sprint Cup on firm ground and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Wolfhound. Stud record Pips Pride was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion but died in 1996 at the age of six after siring only three crops of foals. Despite the brevity of his stud career he had considerable success, siring winners including Pipalong, Cortachy Castle (Sprint Stakes) and Guinea Hunter (Stewards' Cup).

This family of attractive interactions has been modeled as an electron donor interacting with the œÉ* orbital of a C-X bond (X= hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, etc.). Electron density mapping is often invoked to visualize the electron density of the donor and an electrophilic region on the acceptor, referred to as a œÉ-hole. Chalcogen bonds, much like hydrogen and halogen bonds, have been invoked in various non-covalent interactions, such as protein folding, crystal engineering, self-assembly, catalysis, transport, sensing, templation, and drug design.  Bonding   Origin  Chalcogen bonding is comparable to other forms of œÉ-hole interactions. However, the specific contributions to this interaction are still a matter of debate. The contributing forces can be broken down into dispersion/van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and orbital mixing interactions. These contributing attractive forces are invoked to explain the differences in bonding strength associated with different donor-acceptor pairs. Some argue that electrostatic interactions dominate only in the case of harder chalcogen atoms as acceptors, specifically O and S. The chalcogen bonding of heavier group 16 congeners are thought to be attributable more to dispersion forces. In a separate camp, these contributions are considered minor compared to the orbital mixing/delocalization between the donor n orbital and acceptor œÉ* orbital. Given the dual ability of chalcogens to serve as donor and acceptor molecules for œÉ-hole interactions, a geometric schematic has been generated to distinguish between the differing bonding character. The œÉ* orbital is exactly opposite the œÉ bonds to a chalcogen bond. It is the region between the œÉ-holes in which the lone pairs localize in a donor region. These regions have been referred to as the nucleophilic gate, the œÉ-hole regions which are electron depleted, and the electrophilic gate, the donor region which is electron enriched. Orbital mixing picture for n ‚Üí œÉ* interaction as seen in various œÉ-hole interactions. Visualization of the nucleophilic and electrophilic gates on S(CN)2.  Evaluation  = AIM = Any electron donor can donate electrons into the œÉ-hole of a bonded chalcogen, including halogen anions, amines, and œÄ electrons (such as benzene). Similar to halogen bonding, chalcogen bonding can occur between two chalcogens, resulting in a chalcogen- chalcogen bond. Non-covalent interactions are well characterized by Bader's atoms in molecules (AIM) model which defines a bond as any bond-critical point (BCP) existing between two nuclei. This can be understood simply as a saddle point on an electron density map of a molecule. Hydrogen and halogen bonds are both well characterized by this method. The same analysis has been performed on chalcogen bonds, as shown below. The BCP's between S and Cl‚àí in these molecules are evidence of the non-covalent interactions, in this case chalcogen-halogen bonds. Atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis on various chalcogen-halogen bond containing systems. Bond critical points (BCP) evidence the chalcogen bond between S and Cl‚àí. = NBO = Another method used to evaluate chalcogen bonding specifically and a wide range of bonding generally is natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. NBO analysis distinguishes between covalent, Lewis-type bonding interactions and non-covalent, non-Lewis bonding interaction. The chalcogen bond will be evaluated based on the natural population of the n ‚Üí œÉ* orbital. A higher population of this orbital should then also be reflected in changes in the geometry. = Geometry = Both electrostatic mapping and molecular orbital explanation for chalcogen bonding result in a predicted directionality for the bonding interaction. In a hydrogen or halogen bond, the electrophilic region/œÉ* orbital are located opposite the œÉ bond, forming a single œÉ-hole. Optimal hydrogen or halogen bonds thus are linear in geometry. Chalcogen bonding is a result of the same interaction. However, it is possible for chalcogens to form multiple sigma bonds and thus multiple œÉ-holes to form such bonding interactions. Evaluations of x-ray crystal structures or structure determinations based on vibrational spectroscopy can provide evidence for chalcogen bonding based on proximity and orientation of atoms. Surveys of the Cambridge Structural Database have revealed a high frequency of likely chalcogen bonding interactions in protein structures and solid state crystals of molecules.  H-bonding vs. chalcogen bonding  Due to a chalcogen's ability to function as an electron donor, many systems will balance between hydrogen bonding with the chalcogen as a donor or chalcogen bonding. This balance can be observed in a series of self- bonding intermolecular interactions between various substituted chalcogens. In cases with hard chalcogen atoms as acceptors, the balance favors H-bonding between chalcogen and methyl H. However, as the acceptor atoms move down the group, chalcogen-chalcogen bonding will be favored. It is hypothesized that electrostatic forces should only dominate in a chalcogen-chalcogen bond with lighter congeners, and instead that dispersion forces dominate in the cases of heavier congeners A means of comparing the chalcogen-chalcogen bonding forces with H-bonding is to compare the effect of various solvent environments on the chalcogen-chalcogen bond. This has been done on a series of molecules featuring a chalcogen-chalcogen intramolecular bond in one conformation (closed) and exposed to solvent interactions in another (open). One such study found that the preference for the closed conformation showed almost no dependence on the solvent environment. This was taken to mean that changes in solvent dipole moment, polarizability, or H-bonding character did not influence the balance between chalcogen-chalcogen bonding and solvent interactions. Such a conclusion would mean that the dispersion forces and electrostatic forces involved in chalcogen-chalcogen bonding do not majorly influence the interaction. Instead, this would mean that the orbital interaction dominates the bonding interaction.  Applications  A wide range of applications have been proposed for designing chalcogen bonds into systems where weak interactions are crucial. This can include areas dependent on specific recognition or molecules, sort of a lock and key model, as seen in drug design, sensing, and highly selective catalysis. Additional applications are in solid-state and materials science where particular packing of molecules can dramatically impact bulk properties.  Drug Design  Drug design is a broad umbrella which includes molecular design to vary biologically relevant characteristics. With regard to weak interactions, the design is aimed at tuning ligand docking/binding of drugs to biologically relevant molecules or proteins and associated biological effects from various binding modes. The weak interaction dictating the specific binding can be interatomic between the target and drug, or they can be intramolecular in the drug itself, typically affecting a conformational preference. There are very few examples known of intermolecular chalcogen bonding between a drug and its target. However, clear conformational preferences have been shown in drug molecules which are attributed to the stabilization from chalcogen bonding interactions. These are most typically involving chalcogen heterocycles as chalcogen bond acceptors. The conformational preference can be derived from various classes of intramolecular chalcogen bonding, including 1,4, 1,5, and 1,6 O‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢S interactions, 1,4 and 1,5 N‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢S interactions, and S‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢aromatic interactions. Each class of these interactions is made up of large classes of drugs in which chalcogen bonding has resulted in up to a 1500 fold difference in potency of some compounds. It is hypothesized that intramolecular chalcogen bonding out competes intermolecular interactions since divalent sulfur will direct œÉ* orbitals at angles flanking the molecule rather than directly outward as is seen in halogen bonding.  Catalysis  Chalcogen bonding in catalysis has been used to pre-orient substrate, allowing for asymmetric/stereoselective catalysis on the preferred conformation of the substrate. Examples include an asymmetric acyl transfer on an enantiomeric mixture catalyzed by a chiral isothiourea. The acyl group is first transfer on to the chiral catalyst which is purported to go through a transition state featuring a 1,5 chalcogen bonding interaction on the catalyst which orients the acyl group prior to transfer on to the substrate. This resulted in one enantiomer of the substrate acylated and the remaining substrate enriched in the other enantiomer. Similar interactions have been invoked in stereoselective Michael additions and Œ≤-lactonizations. Stereoselective acyl transfer via an isothiourea catalyst. #  References  Chemical bonding ","title":"Chalcogen bond"},{"id":"55333935","text":"Government Arts College for Women, Salem, is a women's general degree college located in Salem, Tamil Nadu.

Biography  Kidner was born on 16 March 1914, the son of civil servant Arthur, and Mabel. His love of railways stemmed from being given a few Locomotive Publishing Company postcards in primary school. He attended Westminster School where he struck up a friendship with Michael Robbins. The two bonded over a shared interest in railways, and in 1931, they founded The Four Os to publish a newsletter called Locomotion. Both were still at school, and the company operated out of Kidner's parents' garage.  In 1935, Kidner and Robbins changed the name of their nascent publishing house to The Oakwood Press and published their first book, Railway Bibliography by Canon Fellows. This was followed in 1936 by L.T. Catchpole's The Lynton and Barnstaple Railway which is still in print in its 9th. edition. Meanwhile, after a year at the London School of Economics Kidner was working as an editor of travel guides for Benn Brothers. In 1938, Oakwood published the first train spotter's guide, called How to Recognise Southern Railway Locomotives written by Kidner. Kidner travelled widely to research the railways that his authors wrote about. He visited the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway in 1935 with Catchpole, and the Welsh Highland Railway in 1926 and 1934. The Oakwood Press suspended publication during the Second World War, and Kidner served in the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment where he rose to the rank of Major. He also married Beryl Walton in 1943. After the war he resumed publishing, though was initially restricted by paper rationing. He published James I. C. Boyd's seminal series on the narrow-gauge railways of north Wales, starting in 1949 with Narrow Gauge Rails to Portmadoc which drew attention to the then-closed Ffestiniog Railway and was instrumental in its eventual restoration. Michael Robbins dropped out of the business in the 1950s. In 1972, Kidner retired from his work in public relations to focus full-time on The Oakwood Press. He broadened the range of subjects covered, to include biographies of railwaymen and books about trams, traction engines, buses and canals. He sold The Oakwood Press in 1984, but kept in close contact with the new owner, writing and editing books. He died of cancer in 2007.

She is Head of the Stable Light Isotope Laboratory and Professor of Archaeological Science and Bioarchaeology at the University of Oxford. Lee- Thorp is most well known for her work on dietary ecology and human origins, using stable isotope chemistry to study fossil bones and teeth. Early life and education Lee-Thorp was born on 20 April 1951 in Cape Town, South Africa. Studying at the University of Cape Town, she graduated with Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc) with a major in chemistry, and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. Her doctoral thesis, titled \\"Stable carbon isotopes in deep time: the diets of fossil fauna and hominids,\\" was completed in 1989 and demonstrated a method by which to significantly increase the applicable time-span of carbon isotopic analysis by using the mineral form of calcified animal tissue (apatite) as the sample material instead of traditionally used collagen. Academic career Lee-Thorp remained at her alma mater, working as a senior research officer at the University of Cape Town's Archaeometry Research Unit (1991 to 1997). She was a senior lecturer in its Faculty of Science from 1998 to 2000 and an associate professor from 2001 to 2004. She was appointed Professor of Archaeology in 2005. In 2005, she moved to the United Kingdom to take up the post of research director of Archaeological, Geographical and Environmental Sciences at the University of Bradford. She joined the University of Oxford in 2010 as Professor of Archaeological Science and a Fellow of St Cross College, Oxford. She has served as Vice-Head of the School of Archaeology from 2014 to 2016, and has been its Head since 2016.  Research  Lee-Thorp has been involved in a number of projects in Africa, South America, and Europe. In addition to diet, her more recent research has focused on the role of changing environment, climate, and farming techniques on ancient human societies. Currently, she is involved in the Paleodeserts Project, The Agricultural Origins of Urban Civilization (AGRICURB), and Building a Better Eggtimer. Honours In 2013, Lee-Thorp was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

The referendum was marked by a low turnout and the majority of voters voted in favor of the proposed law. The results were annulled by the Supreme Court in March 2018, resulting in a new referendum being held in 13 May 2018. Background Train on the Divaƒça‚ÄìKoper Railway On 8 May 2017, the National Assembly of Slovenia passed a law that deals with the construction of the second railway track from Koper to Divaƒça, in particular regarding the financial plans for the project. The second railway track should help the development of Port of Koper, a major port in the Northern Adriatic Sea, as the existing track was in bad condition and already nearing the traffic limits. The law was opposed by civil activist Vili Kovaƒçiƒç who, supported by several political parties and civil initiatives, called for a referendum to repeal the law. After collecting 40,000 voter signatures, the referendum was set to take place on 24 September 2017. Per article 90 of the Constitution, 40,000 voters can require the National Assembly to call for a referendum to reject a law that was ratified by the Assembly. The law is rejected if a majority of voters who have cast valid votes vote against the law, provided at least one fifth of all qualified voters have voted against the law.Constitution of Slovenia Constitutional Court A minimum of 20% of the voters (around 343,000 voters of about 1.7 million registered voters) are required to cast a valid \\"no\\" vote for a negative result of the referendum to be valid. In the referendum campaign, both sides in principle agreed that the second track is required. Opinions differed on the details of the law. Among the concerns of the opponents were the alleged lack of transparency regarding the finances, questions regarding the proposed track route, and the involvement of Hungary as a potential partner in the construction project. Supporters of the law cited the already approved financial contribution of the EU, new job creation, the fact that the rejection of the law would result in the beginning of construction being delayed for several years, and the fact that the proposed route is optimal, based on a series of expert studies and agreed upon by all Slovenian cabinets since 2004. Among major political parties, the law was supported by the coalition partners Modern Centre Party and Social Democrats. DeSUS, also a coalition partner, remained neutral. Among the parties represented in the National Assembly, the law was opposed by the Slovenian Democratic Party, New Slovenia, and The Left. Numerous smaller political parties and civil initiatives took part in the referendum campaign on both sides. Results Early voting began on 19 September. 14,201 voters (0.83%) took part in early vote, which was a considerably smaller number than in the previous referendum on same-sex marriage that took place in 2015. In the early vote, 54.14% supported the law and 45.86% opposed it. The referendum was marked by a low turnout. By 4:00 p.m., only 14.3% voted. Early results showed that the majority of people supported the law. At 9 p.m., with over 98% of the ballots counted, there were 53.3% of supporters. Commenting on the results, the Prime Minister Miro Cerar stated that the results reflect the fact that the voters support the project and that they are fed up with political intrigues. He also stressed that this project will not turn into \\"another Te≈° 6\\", referring to the construction of a new power plant in ≈†o≈°tanj which was marred by a series of corruption affairs.Rotnik je na dopustu in pravi, da za vabilo v DZ ni vedel Dnevnik, 7 July 2017 Peter Ga≈°pariƒç, the Minister of Infrastructure, labeled the referendum as an \\"unnecessary experiment\\". The Slovenian Democratic Party stated that they will keep closely monitoring the project and that the positive outcome of the campaign was that the estimated project costs were significantly reduced. The project was expected to open first public tenders for construction in 2018. Aftermath Following the results of the referendum, Vili Kovaƒçiƒç contested the results in the Supreme Court, claiming that the law regulating referendums and civil initiatives were not compatible with the constitution, citing the fact that the government had used ‚Ç¨97,000 of public funds on the campaign in support of the proposed law.Referendum o zakonu o drugem tiru je razveljavljen Delo, 14 March 2018 On 14 March 2018 Supreme Court delivered a judgement, annulling the results and ordered a new vote, which was set for 13 May. The railway link was the biggest project of the Cerar cabinet. On the same day, Cerar announced his resignation as the Prime Minister, months before the conclusion of his term in office. Cerar stated that the court verdict was \\"one blow too far\\" by those who wanted to block the development of Slovenia, mentioning tensions in the coalition among reasons for his resignation.Miro Cerar je odstopil, odnesel ga je drugi tir Delo, 14 March 2018 The referendum was repeated on 13 May 2018, and a slight majority of voters chose no (50.06%). However, the number of registered voters choosing no was too low (at 7.50%), meaning the law remained in force.Pobudnikom referenduma znova ni uspelo, Kovaƒçiƒç ≈æe napovedal prito≈æbo na izid RTV, 13 May 2018 See also *Divaƒça‚ÄìKoper Railway *Port of Koper References 2017 in Slovenia 2017 2017 referendums September 2017 events in Europe Rail transport in Slovenia ","title":"2017 Slovenian railway referendum"},{"id":"55334175","text":"The National Inventory of Dams (NID) is a congressionally authorized database documenting dams in the United States and its territories.

It was begun in 1994 in response to a Congressional mandate to study adolescent health, and was initially called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The first wave of the study, funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, involved administering a questionnaire to a nationally representative sample of 7th- through 12th-graders during the 1994-95 school year. In the first wave of the study, the questionnaire was administered to about 20,000 adolescents, making it one of the largest longitudinal surveys of adolescents ever conducted. The participants were then re-interviewed in 1996 (wave II), 2001‚Äì02 (wave III), and 2008 (wave IV), with a fifth wave of data collection underway since 2016. The first three waves included, among other information, detailed and sensitive interviews, and the 11,500 participants in wave III also provided urine and saliva samples. Objectives The purpose of Waves I and II was to examine factors associated with health behaviors among adolescents. The purpose of Wave III, which was conducted when almost all participants were aged 18 to 26, was to determine the relationship between behaviors and experiences during adolescence and behaviors during the adjustment to young adulthood. The purpose of Wave IV, conducted when almost all participants were aged 24 to 32, was to assess developmental and health trajectories over the lifespan.

He was a French theater director, poet, journalist and publisher. The Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot in Paris has been named after him since 1940. Early life The family of Andr√© Daviel counted among his ancestors the Jacques Daviel, a doctor, known not only for having been the friend of Denis Diderot, but also for being the surgeon of Louis XV of France, and for having performed the first extracapsular cataract extraction; another ancestor was Alfred Daviel, lawyer and magistrate, Minister of Justice in 1851, senator of the Empire, first honorary president of the Court of Appeal of Rouen, specialist of Norman customary law. The young Andr√© Daviel was born in Rouen and studied at the Catholic college Join-Lambert in the same city, and then in various colleges in Paris. Career Resolutely anti-conformist, Jacques H√©bertot frequented the theaters of Paris and mingled with young people of the artistic circles and the poets of the time. His artistic and literary ambitions worried his father who feared for the good name of the family. This is why, in 1903, when he was 17 years old, Andr√© Daviel changed his name to Jacques H√©bertot; Jacques for his ancestor, Jacques Daviel, and H√©bertot, because he liked the name of this small village close to the family property located in the hamlet of Beaumoucel a short distance from Beuzeville. He received his first successes with Ballade for the purchase of the house of Pierre Corneille which was awarded by the Revue Picarde et Normande. During this period he wrote several plays, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue Mauve, founded the magazine L'√Çme Normande, published Po√®mes de mon pays, and founded the \\"Th√©√¢tre d'Art R√©gional Normand\\". In 1909, at 19 years old, he became a member of the Soci√©t√© des Auteurs. After his military service in 1911, he was engaged as a dramatic critic by the magazine Gil Blas. In 1912, he gave lectures on Scandinavian dance at the Alliance Fran√ßaise. From now on he was linked to the avant-garde artistic movement, and he frequented the d√Æners de Passy where he met his young friend Guillaume Apollinaire, as well as Max Jacob, Oscar Milosz, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, and Fernand L√©ger. While he was a journalist with Gil Blas, he was forcibly enlisted in August 1914 in the World War I. He was assigned to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, Group 5, and became Field Marshal. He fought on the Somme, Champagne and Verdun. His courage under fire made him to be quoted in the order of the regiment on 15 September 1917. Registered under number 012195, he was decorated with the Croix de Guerre. Throughout his period on the front he wrote his notebooks, various notes, articles for the newspaper Le Matin, political reflections, poems, and a description of the horrors of war. In 1919 he was responsible for the literary and theatrical tour organized in Scandinavia on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thanks to Nils Dardel, whom he had known for several years already, he met the mecenate Rolf de Mar√© and his companion, the dancer Jean B√∂rlin. This meeting was the occasion for the birth of the idea of the future Scandinavian Ballets, which will later become the Ballets su√©dois. Rolf de Mar√©, who was an admiror of the Ballets Russes, and was eager to launch a new troop, felt that Jacques H√©bertot was the man of the situation. He proposed him to try a solo presentation of Jean B√∂rlin in Paris. Jacques H√©bertot rented the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es for three evenings, from 25 to 27 March 1920, and engaged an orchestra of 45 musicians under the direction of D√©sir√©-√âmile Inghelbrecht. Without any decoration, Jean B√∂rlin danced several compositions, in particular Danse c√©leste inspired by Siam and the Negro Sculpture inspired by the Cubist movement where the dancer transforms into an African statue. It was a great success for B√∂rlin who was unanimously hailed. Rolf de Mar√©, convinced, decided to entrust Jacques H√©bertot to find in Paris a bigger venue to present the Ballets su√©dois. After attempting to sign the Paris Opera and the Th√©√¢tre Sarah Bernhardt (now Th√©√¢tre de la Ville) on 1 August 1920, Jacques H√©bertot signed the lease contract for the entire Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. The theater was to become the Parisian base of the Ballets su√©dois, while Rolf de Mar√© managed the world tours. Jacques H√©bertot continued to animate the Parisian theater, now under his responsibility. The Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es became an important artistic center, particularly in the theatrical and musical fields, bringing together high-quality personalities: theatre directors like Georges Pito√´ff and Ludmilla Pito√´ff, Louis Jouvet and Gaston Baty, authors like Jean Cocteau, Paul Claudel, Blaise Cendrars, Francis Picabia, Anton Chekhov, Jules Romains, and Luigi Pirandello, composers like Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric, Germaine Tailleferre and Erik Satie. In the field of painting, the Montaigne Gallery hosted the first exhibition of Amedeo Modigliani and the first Dada events. At the same time, he created the periodicals Th√©√¢tre et Com≈ìdia illustr√©, Paris- Journal, La Danse, Monsieur (with the collaboration of Louis Aragon, Georges Charensol and Ren√© Clair). Following financial problems Jacques H√©bertot left the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in 1925, abandoned the direction of the Com√©die √† Louis Jouvet, gave the direction of the Studio to Gaston Baty, and quarreled with Rolf de Mar√©. He created a record business and recorded, among others, the first records of Petits Chanteurs √† la croix de bois. In 1938 he joined his friends Georges and Ludmilla Pito√´ff at the Th√©√¢tre des Mathurins, and produced Sei personaggi in cerca di autore by Pirandella and Cr√©ation de un ennemi du peuple by Henrik Ibsen. In 1938 his friend Paulette Pax, having health issues, proposed him to support her in the direction of the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre. He took over the lease of the theater in 1942, after having declared: \\"I will resume the continuation of the efforts of my predecessors. I give the assurance that the work will remain an exceptional scene. The work will be a theater of research and experience, in a way, the theater of tomorrow.\\" After producing a number of shows, most of which were retained, the creation of a play by Pierre Brasseur and his desire to devote himself to the theater which now bears his name, pushed him to sold the lease of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Oeuvre in 1944 to Raymond Roll. In 1940, H√©bertot took over the direction of the Th√©√¢tre des Arts, an old Batignolles theater, built in 1838, and renamed it Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot. There he produced his creations, attracting the greatest authors and the greatest comedians. Later life In July 1952, in parallel with his theatrical activity, he became the owner of the spa resort of Forges-les-Eaux, in his native Normandy. The resort had been badly damaged by four years of occupation during World War II. His intent was to create a regional artistic center and to open a sort of international academy: \\"We will go from the Opera to the mystical drama. We will play Claudel as well as Meyerbeer, Beethoven and Strauss. Classical and modern.\\" Jacques H√©bertot wanted to carry out a project that was close to his heart as he was a relative of one of the Carm√©lites de Compi√®gne guillotined during the Revolution: he bought the abandoned facade of the convent of the Carmelites of Gisors, disassembled it stone by stone and then built it up again close to the casino at Forges-les- Eaux, along the road that led to Dieppe. The facade is still there today even if, in 1959, due to a lack of resources, H√©bertot had to renounce to his costly and ambitious undertaking. In spring 1957, H√©bertot founded a national weekly magazine Artaban (\\"Because we are proud!\\") devoted to the arts in general. Despite the anxieties of his friends Albert Camus and Maurice Clavel, he embarked on an expensive adventure that will not go beyond the autumn of 1958 but that will leave interesting archives. Shortly before his death, he told Diego Fabbri, in an interview published in the program of the spectacle Bienheureux les violents, that \\"with the theater, it was poetry that had been essential to his life.\\" He died on 19 June 1970. Bertrand Poirot-Delpech wrote in Le Monde, on 21 June 1970: \\"The death of the master has the effect of a very old tree that falls to the bottom of a family park. This time, it is there, the theater of the elite no longer exists\\". He is buried in the monumental cemetery of Rouen in the cellar of the Family Pinel which was that of his mother. Legacy The central part of the Boulevard des Batignolles (8th and 17th arrondissements), opposite the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot, has been called promenade Jacques H√©bertot since 16 January 2014. The Paris Council unanimously voted this decision at the deliberation on 4 October 2011. The Biblioth√®que historique de la ville de Paris maintains a \\"Jacques H√©bertot\\" fonds, which includes programs, posters, war books, items from his personal library, objects and a portion of the H√©bertot Theater books. This collection was entered thanks to the Association de la R√©gie Th√©√¢trale, following a donation from Serge Bouillon, manager of the Soci√©t√© Immobili√®re Batignolles- Monceau (owner of the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot's walls). Since the death of Serge Bouillon, on 31 July 2014, his wife, Danielle Mathieu-Bouillon, President of the Association of the Th√©√¢tre R√©gie, became the beneficiary of Jacques H√©bertot.

The Russian healthcare system is funded by the federal government, social spending and the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund. However, the industry expects a big shift towards the private healthcare spending. Russia is a net importer of pharmaceuticals, importing $8.9 billion while exporting $635 million of medicines. Close to 80% of imports come from Europe, mostly from Germany and France. Local market The Russian pharmaceutical market can be divided by prescription drugs and over the counter drugs. The prescription drugs sales historically took the biggest share of the market, capturing 61% of the market in 2016. The sales of generic drugs dominate in the prescription category at 64.5%. Out of all pharmaceutical sales they constitute only 39.4%. The most widespread diseases in Russia are cardiovascular diseases, cancer and HIV. As a result, pharmaceutical products addressing these ailments are the leading sub-sectors for the pharmaceutical industry in Russia. The largest manufacturers by retail sales include Sanofi, Bayer, Novartis, Servier. Pharmstandard is the largest domestic manufacturer by sales, ranking 18th in 2015. Distributors A drug store in Russia Drug manufacturers prefer not to work with retail pharmacy chains or pharmacies directly, relying instead on distributors to promote their products to retail outlets. Distributors operate vast networks of contacts and work to direct retail distribution channels. According to DSM, one of the major Russian pharmaceutical Agencies, the major four distributors include Katren, Protek, Rosta and CIA. The number of pharmacy chains has been growing and currently it exceeds 50,000. Most of the sales are coming from the following chains: , A5, , , and Neopharm. Import substitution efforts The Russian government is focused on creating its own pharmaceutical industry. The main document that governs this focus is the ‚ÄúPharma 2020 Strategy‚Äù. Its main goal is to reduce the reliance of the Russian economy on imported pharmaceuticals.

The ministry also works with other justice ministries around the world to prosecute criminals.  History  In 1924, the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Republic of Tajikistan was established by the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. By the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, the Commissariat was given official instructions and tasks on 12 February 1925. On 7 July 1925, the decision of interdepartmental training for administrative staff of the judiciary began by order of the Communist Party of Tajikistan's Central Committee under the auspices of the People's Commissariat for Education (commonly known as the Ministry of Education).

It is the fourth entry in Green's Hatchet series, and a sequel to Hatchet III. Kane Hodder returns to the role of the titular killer Victor Crowley. Plot In 1964, Del House (Jonah Ray) proposes to his girlfriend Sue (Kelly Vrooman) in Honey Island Swamp. However the couple hears Victor Crowley's (Kane Hodder) ghostly moans. Fearing that someone has been hurt, they investigate and find a hunter, who is decapitated in front of them by Crowley. The couple flees, but Crowley easily catches up with them and dismembers them. In 2017, survivor of the Crowley massacre Andrew Yong (Parry Shen), who is believed by some people to have committed the murders himself, appears on his ex-wife, Sabrina's, show The Sabrina Show, to promote his new book about the events. Sabrina announces an exclusive book signing to take place later that day. Meanwhile, Chloe (Katie Booth), her boyfriend Alex (Chase Williamson), and her best friend Rose (Laura Ortiz) plan to get Andrew to help them film a mock trailer for a B-Movie they're making about the Crowley massacre. At the signing, Andrew is subjected to abuse and lewd acts much to the ignorance of his manager, Kathleen (Felissa Rose) who quickly ushers him out when she gets him a deal that will gain him almost a million dollars, much to the chagrin of Chloe, who never got to pitch her idea. Andrew and Kathleen head out on a private charter plane with Sabrina and her crew: Austin (Brian Quinn), Casey (Tiffany Shepis), Jay (Tezz Yancey), and Zach (Blake Woodruff). However the plane's engine explodes and crashes in Honey Island Swamp, killing the pilots, Jay, and Zach. Elsewhere in the Swamp, Chloe, Rose and Alex are about to begin filming their trailer alongside eccentric, swamp tour guide/local actor Dillon (Dave Sheridan). Suddenly Zach's body lands in front of them. Rose and Dillon head off to investigate while Alex tries to calm Chloe down. All the while, Rose's phone plays a video of Reverend Zombie (Tony Todd) reciting the voodoo curse that originally brought Crowley back. At the plane wreckage, the survivors find Casey trapped underneath the seats with the water slowly rising. Rose and Dillon arrive and attempt to help the survivors when Crowley's screams are heard. Chloe and Alex also hear the screams and stumble across the old Crowley House, now a museum and memorial. Crowley attacks the pair, bashing Alex's head in with a claw hammer. When Chloe flees, Crowley grabs his hatchet and follows close behind her. Chloe makes it to the plane wreckage, but is unable to hear Rose's warnings of Crowley behind her and gets her face smashed into the plane window. Crowley drags Chloe away, leaving her badly injured but alive as bait. Following a series of arguments and altercations, Kathleen begins to have a panic attack and flees from the plane. Austin tries to stop her but Crowley slices the top of his head off, killing him. Kathleen manages to call the police but Crowley catches her and severs her arm with phone in hand, ramming it between her legs and out her mouth. Crowley then finishes off Chloe by stomping her head. He attacks the plane causing it to sink faster, drowning the pregnant Casey. As the group begin to argue, after it is divulged that Kathleen lied to Andrew about the amount of money he would receive, Crowley attacks the plane with his belt sander, as the group panics he begins to cut through the circuitry which restores power to the plane. Dillon locks himself in the pilot's cabin, hoping to radio for help and start the engine so they can use it to suck Crowley in with the hopes of killing him. Andrew, Sabrina and Rose all flee in separate directions with Sabrina stealing Kathleen's phone from Rose before heading to Dillon's boat, while Rose hides. At the boat Crowley catches Sabrina and decapitates her after breaking her jaw. He then chases after Rose and throws her at Andrew and Dillon, who got the engine working, the turbine now running. A stand-off between the three and Crowley ensues where Andrew misses his shot with a flare gun and Rose attempting to use Crowley's hatchet as a tomahawk also fails to hit him, instead giving him the weapon back. In a last ditch attempt to be the hero, Dillon tackles Crowley into the turbine, splattering Rose and Andrew in his and Crowley's blood. In a mid-credits scene, Marybeth Dunston (Danielle Harris) watches a news report on the crash. Realizing Crowley has once again returned she grabs a shotgun saying, \\"I've been waiting for you.\\" Cast * Parry Shen as Andrew Yong * Laura Ortiz as Rose * Dave Sheridan as Dillon * Krystal Joy Brown as Sabrina * Felissa Rose as Kathleen * Brian Quinn as Austin * Tiffany Shepis as Casey * Chase Williamson as Alex * Katie Booth as Chloe * Kelly Vrooman as Sue * Jonah Ray as Del * Kane Hodder as Victor Crowley * Tyler Mane as Bernard * Blake Woodruff as Zach * Tony Todd as Rev.

Development and release In July 2017, it was announced that an official '10th Anniversary Event' screening of the original Hatchet film would be playing at the FrightFest Film Festival of 2017, featuring newly released footage. The same event, which took place on August 22, 2017 in Los Angeles, brought forth the announcement that it was actually the premiere of a secretly filmed Hatchet sequel titled Victor Crowley. Writer/director Adam Green said on the matter, \\"I couldn't be happier to partner with Dark Sky Films and bring Victor Crowley back to horror fans around the world. Resurrecting the series for its tenth anniversary was our way of saying thank you to everyone in The Hatchet Army and beyond who have supported this series since its inception.

The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 6, 2018. Reception Steve Barton of Dread Central awarded the film a quality rating of 4/5, stating that \\"Victor Crowley is a smartly written, outrageously funny, and incredibly gory affair that's nothing short of a gift for slasher fans who appreciate their films wrapped in viscera with gallons of blood to spare.\\" JoBlo.com said of the film \\"VICTOR CROWLEY may be the best of the sequels to HATCHET, perhaps the best in the series.\\" Kalyn Corrigan of Bloody Disgusting called it \\"the Gory Slasher Film You're Craving!\\", while critiquing \\"Sure, they spend a little too much time on the plane, and it would've been nice to see some of the more human characters last a bit longer during the runtime, but... in all honesty, it's just nice to have a series in the same iconic style that we can count on to carry us through the years of big studio films and over produced predictable cash grabs.\\" Alternately, Brad Miska also reviewing for Bloody Disgusting said \\"While Hatchet has since become an iconic franchise, none of the sequels have been able to recreate the magic of the first film. The latest, Victor Crowley, is easily the worst of the bunch.\\" References External links 2017 films 2010s comedy horror films 2017 horror films 2017 independent films 2010s serial killer films 2010s slasher films American films American independent films American sequel films American slasher films American splatter films Slasher comedy films English-language films Films set in Louisiana Films shot in New Orleans Hatchet (film series) Parodies of horror 2017 comedy films ","title":"Victor Crowley (film)"},{"id":"55334874","text":"Susanta is a given name.

It covers both the ways in which economists can study the distinctive institutions of sports, and the ways in which sports can allow economists to research many topics, including discrimination and antitrust law. The theoretical foundations of the discipline are heavily based on microeconomics. As of 2006, about 100 to 120 college professors taught sports economics courses.  The Beginning of Sports Economics  Simon Rottenberg is credited with likely being the first to pen a scholarly article in the field of sports economics when he wrote his 1956 article on the Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis. In this article Rottenberg highlights the relationship of attendance at baseball games with things such as price, alternate activities, how good the team is, how large of a market the team is in, and so on. Importantly, Rottenberg made mention of ‚Äúdispersion of games won by team in the league.‚Äù  Key Components of Sports Economics  Competitive Balance is one of the most important ideas within sports economics. This idea, in general, refers to the comparison of wins between all teams in a league. Rottenberg, effectively built this seminal idea with his interest in \\"dispersion of games won.\\" Related to competitive balance is the understanding of different leagues and different team within those leagues objectives. Understanding the ownership structure and motives of front office personnel through their financial, read economic, decisions will reveal whether a team is looking to only generate profit, attempt to win a championship, or something entirely different. Making sense of human behavior through data is the central idea of economics and certainly applies to Sports Economics as well. Sports leagues look to promote competitive balance to make more games appealing to fans to watch, both in person and on TV. Many European leagues achieve competitive balance through promotion and relegation systems where multiple leagues are intertwined with teams moving between leagues based upon performance. Most sports leagues in the United States are standalone league and work towards competitive balance through other measures. These can include salary caps and roster size limits.  The Importance of Sports Economics  Sometimes Sports Economics can be dismissed as a side hobby for number crunchers. However, with the proliferation of globalized sports markets as well as the extreme rise in sports media, the economics of sport cannot be dismissed. In the United States, the Super Bowl regularly commands the attention of millions. In the EU, over 15 million people are employed in the sports world. On a larger scale, sports and sporting outlets provide immense health benefits as well as general satisfaction for a citizenry which are both prominent state concerns the world over. Another great feature of Sports Economics is the data rich environment that sports provide. In sports there are ample data sets provided from which economists can easily apply and investigate common economic models or problems, thus contributing to the field of economics at large.

The territories of the Republic of Venice are shown in green, both on the Italian mainland (Terraferma), as well as its overseas possessions (Venetian Dalmatia and the Venetian Ionian Islands) The Fall of the Republic of Venice was a series of events that culminated on 12 May 1797 that led to the dissolution and dismemberment of the Republic of Venice at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte and Habsburg Austria. In 1796, the young general Napoleon had been sent by the newly formed French Republic to confront Austria, as part of the French Revolutionary Wars. He chose to go through Venice, which was officially neutral. Reluctantly, the Venetians allowed the formidable French army entry to the country so that it might confront Austria. However the French covertly began supporting Jacobin revolutionaries within Venice, and the Venetian senate began quietly preparing for war. The Venetian armed forces were severely depleted, and hardly a match for the battle hardened French, or even a local uprising. After the capture of Mantua on 2 February 1797, the French dropped any pretext and overtly called for revolution among the territories of Venice. By 13 March there was open revolt, with Brescia and Bergamo breaking away. However, pro-Venetian sentiment remained high, and France was forced to reveal its true goals after it provided military support to the underperforming revolutionaries. On 25 April, Napoleon flat out threatened to declare war on Venice should it not democratize. The Venetian senate acceded to numerous demands, but facing increasing rebellion and the threat of foreign invasion, it abdicated in favor of a transitional government of Jacobites (and thus the French). On 12 May, Ludovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice, formally abolished the Most Serene Republic of Venice after 1,100 years of existence. Napoleon's aggression was not without cause: the French and the Austrians had secretly agreed on 17 April in the Treaty of Leoben that in exchange for providing Venice to Austria, France would receive Austria's holdings in the Netherlands. France provided an opportunity for the population to vote on accepting the now public terms of the treaty that yielded them to Austria. On 28 October, Venice voted to accept the terms, preferring Austria to France. Such preferences were well founded, as the French proceeded to thoroughly loot Venice, and either steal or sink the entire Venetian Navy and destroy much of the Venetian Arsenal a humiliating end for what had once been one of the most powerful navies in Europe. On 18 January 1798 the Austrians finally took control of Venice, ending the plunder. Austria's control was short lived however, as Venice would be back under French control by 1805. Thereafter it returned to Austrian hands in 1815 as the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, and would remain there until its incorporation into Italy in 1866. Background The young French general, and future ruler of France, Napoleon Bonaparte The Fall of the ancient Republic of Venice was the result of a sequence of events that followed the French Revolution (Fall of the Bastille, 14 July 1789), and the subsequent French Revolutionary Wars that pitted the First French Republic against the monarchic powers of Europe, allied in the First Coalition (1792), particularly following the execution of Louis XVI of France on 21 January 1793, which spurred the monarchies of Europe to common cause against Revolutionary France. The pretender to the French throne, Louis Stanislas Xavier (the future Louis XVIII), spent a period of time in 1794 in Verona, as a guest of the Venetian Republic. This led to fierce protests from the French representatives, so that Louis' right of asylum was revoked, and he was forced to depart Verona on 21 April. As a sign of protest, the French prince demanded that his name be removed from the libro d'oro of the Venetian nobility, and that he be returned the armour of Henry IV of France, that was kept at Venice. The behaviour of the Venetian government also provoked the displeasure and censure of the other European courts. In 1795, with the Constitution of Year III, France put an end to the turmoils of the Reign of Terror, and installed the more conservative regime of the Directory. For 1796, the Directory ordered the launching of a grand double-pronged offensive against the First Coalition: a principal attack west over the Rhine (under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Jean Victor Marie Moreau) into the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, and a diversionary attack against the Austrians and their allies in the south, in northern Italy. The conduct of the Italian campaign was given to the young (27 years old the time) general Napoleon Bonaparte, who in April 1796 crossed the Alps with 45,000 men to confront the Austrians and the Piemontese. In a lightning campaign, Napoleon managed to knock Sardinia out of the war, and then moved on the Duchy of Milan, controlled by the Habsburg forces. On 9 May Archduke Ferdinand, the Austrian governor of Milan, retired with his family to Bergamo, in Venetian territory. Six days later, after winning the Battle of Lodi, Napoleon entered Milan, and forced King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia to sign the humiliating Treaty of Paris, while the Habsburg forces withdrew to defend the Bishopric of Trent. On 17 May the Duchy of Modena likewise sought an armistice with the French. During the course of this conflict, the Republic of Venice had followed its traditional policy of neutrality, but its possessions in northern Italy (the Domini di Terraferma) were now in the direct path of the French army's advance towards Vienna. Consequently on 20 May the French denounced the armistice agreement, and recommenced hostilities. Occupation of the Terraferma Arrival of the French in Venetian Lombardy Map of northern Italy in 1796 At the approach of the French army, already on 12 May 1796, the Venetian Senate had created a provveditore generale for the Terraferma, with the task of overseeing all magistrates in its mainland territories (the reggimenti). However, the state of Venetian defences was parlous: arms were lacking, and the fortifications were in disrepair. Venetian Lombardy was soon invaded by masses of refugees fleeing the war, and shattered or fleeing detachments of Austrian troops, who were soon followed by the first infiltrations by French contingents. Only with great difficulty did the Venetian authorities manage to prevent first the Austrians of general Kerpen, and then the pursuing French of Berthier, from passing through Crema. Napoleon himself finally arrived before the city, bringing a proposal of alliance with Venice, which gave no reply to it. In view of the bad state of the defences, both the Venetian government as well as the authorities in the Terraferma put up only a weak resistance to the crossing of Venetian territory by the retreating Austrians, but firmly refused the requests of the Habsburg ambassador to provide, even secretly, food and supplies to the Austrian forces. In short, however, the situation was critical for the Most Serene Republic: not only Lombardy, but even Veneto were threatened with invasion. First the Austrian commander-in-chief, Jean-Pierre de Beaulieu, took Peschiera del Garda by ruse, and then, on 29 May, the French division of Augereau entered Desenzano del Garda. On the night of 29/30 May, Napoleon crossed the Mincio River in force, forcing the Austrians to withdraw to Tyrol. To the complaints of the Venetians, who through the provveditore generale Foscarini protested the damage inflicted by the French troops during their advance, Napoleon replied by threatening to pass Verona through iron and fire, and of marching on Venice itself, claiming that the Republic had shown itself as favouring the enemies of France by not declaring war after the events at Peschiera, and by harbouring the French pretender Louis. Opening of the Venetian territories to Napoleon's troops Porta Nuova of Verona, which opened its gates to Napoleon's troops on 1 June 1796. On 1 June, Foscarini, in an effort not to provoke Napoleon further, agreed to the entry of French troops into Verona. The Venetian territories thus officially became a field of battle between the opposing camps, while in many cities the French occupation created a difficult cohabitation between French troops, the Venetian military, and the local inhabitants. In the face of imminent threat, the Senate ordered the recall of the Venetian fleet, the conscription of the cernide militia in Istria, and the creation of a provveditore generale for the Venetian Lagoon and Lido, to ensure the defence of the Dogado, the core of the Venetian state. New taxes were raised and voluntary contributions were requested to provide for the rearmament of the state. Finally, the Republic's ambassador at Paris was ordered to protest to the Directory of the violation of its neutrality. At the same time, Venetian diplomats in Vienna remonstrated at the Habsburg forces' bringing war to the Terraferma. On 5 June, the representatives of the Kingdom of Naples signed an armistice with Napoleon. On 10 June, the heir to the Duchy of Parma, Louis of Bourbon, and two days later, Napoleon invaded the Romagna, which belonged to the Papal States; on 23 June the Pope had to accept the French occupation of the northern Legations, allowing the French to occupy the port city of Ancona on the Adriatic Sea. The appearance of French warships in the Adriatic led Venice to renew the ancient decree that prohibited the entry of foreign fleets in the Venetian Lagoon, and informed Paris of that. Flotillas and fortifications were established along the lagoon's shores with the mainland, as well as in the canals, to block access from the land as well as from the sea. In this regard, on 5 July the provedditore on the Lagoon, Giacomo Nani, recalling the victorious War of the Morea against the Ottoman Turks, wrote: Venice seemed to have lost forever the Terraferma, as in former times during the War of the League of Cambrai. The government resolved to mobilize its forces to avoid such an outcome; under the exhortations of Nani, the Venetian government prepared to order a mobilization and give command of its land forces to William of Nassau, but stopped at the last moment before the joint opposition of the Austrians and the French. Towards the middle of July the French troops quartered themselves in the cities of Crema, Brescia, and Bergamo, to allow the separation of French and Austrian forces, who in the meantime had concluded a truce. At the same time, diplomatic efforts were under way to induce Venice to abandon its neutrality and enter a joint alliance with France and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. However, the news of the preparations of the general Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser for an Austrian counteroffensive from Tyrol prompted the Republic to officially reject the French proposals with a letter from the Doge on 22 July. In the meantime, a provedditore extraordinary, Francesco Battagia, had been appointed to join, and in practice replace, the provveditore generale Foscarini. In Venice, night patrols composed of shopkeepers and journeymen, and commanded by two patricians and two burghers (cittadini), to maintain order and safety. In Bergamo also, troops were silently recruited in the neighbouring valleys, taking care to avoid conflict with the French occupiers, but only \\"to restrain the populace's fervour, without debasing it\\", as the Inquisitori di Stato magistrates put it. On July 31, on his part, Napoleon occupied . Failure of the Austrian offensive The Austrian commander Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser Charles, painted at the time of the Napoleonic Wars On 29 July, the Austrians under Wurmser began their counteroffensive, descending from Tyrol in a two-pronged advance along the shores of Lake Garda and the course of the Brenta River, passing through Venetian and Mantuan territory. The two Austrian columns were stopped at Lonato del Garda on 3 August and Castiglione delle Stiviere on 5 August respectively. Defeated, Wurmser was forced to return to Trent. After reorganizing his troops, Wurmser returned to the attack, advancing along the course of the Adige, but on 8 September, at the Battle of Bassano, the Austrians were heavily defeated: forced to a precipitous flight to Mantua, abandoning their artillery and train. As a result, during the autumn and winter, the French consolidated their presence in Italy, so that on 15/16 October, they founded the Cispadane Republic and the Transpadane Republic as French client states. At the same time, in the Terraferma, the French soldiers progressively took over the Venetian defensive system by assuming control over cities and fortresses. While the Venetian government continued to instruct its magistrates, placed at the head of the various reggimenti, to supply the maximum collaboration and to avoid giving rise to any excuse for a conflict, the French ever more openly began to support local revolutionary and Jacobin activities. On 29 October the Austrians, amassed in Venetian Friuli, attempted a new offensive, under J√≥zsef Alvinczi, by crossing the Tagliamento, then the Piave on 2 November, and arriving at Brenta on 4 November. The Austrians pushed the French back in the Second Battle of Bassano on 6 November, and entered Vicenza. However, the battles of Caldiero (12 November) and above all Arcole (15‚Äì17 November) blocked the Austrian advance. Finally, in the Battle of Rivoli on 14‚Äì15 January 1797, Napoleon decisively defeated Alvinczi and restored French supremacy. Revolt of Bergamo and Brescia Junot, commander of the French forces in the Veneto With the capture of Mantua on 2 February 1797, the French removed the last bastion of Habsburg resistance in Italy. The French now began to promote openly the \\"democratization\\" of Bergamo, which, under the pressure of general Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, rose in revolt against Venice on 13 March, establishing the Republic of Bergamo. Three days later, the provveditore extraordinary Francesco Battagia, in an effort to restore order, issued a general amnesty for any acts disturbing the public order. However, Battagia was already fearing the loss of Brescia, the city where he resided, and to which the Bergamasque revolutionaries were marching, as well. On 16 March, at the Battle of Valvasone, Napoleon defeated Archduke Charles, thus opening the way to Austria proper. On the next day, the Venetian Senate issued affirmations of gratitude to the towns and forts remaining loyal to the Republic, and for the first time ordered them to take defensive measures. The barricading of the Lagoon of Venice, the establishment of armed patrols in the Dogado, and the recall of naval units stationed in Istria, were ordered. The Arsenal of Venice, the military heart of the state, was ordered to increase its production, and troops were to be sent from the overseas possessions of the Stato da Mar to the Terraferma. On 19 March, the Inquisitori di Stato reported to the Senate on the condition of the reggimenti. For Bergamo, which was in rebellion, no information was available, and the inquisitors awaited for news from the neighbouring forts and valleys. The situation in Brescia was still calm and under Battagia's control, as well as Crema, where they recommended the reinforcement of its garrison. An anti-French mood prevailed in Verona, while Padua and Treviso were quiet, although the Venetian authorities kept the former under close watch in case of trouble from the students of the University of Padua. The report read:Samuele Romanin, Storia Documentata di Venezia, Vol X In reality, however, the inquisitors were not aware that at Brescia the previous day (18 March), a group of notables, desiring to liberate themselves from Venetian rule, had launched a revolt. Amidst the general indifference, they could count only on the support of the Bergamasque, and the French, who controlled the city's citadel; however, Battagia, so as not to endanger the population, which was still largely pro-Venetian, decided to abandon the city with his troops. News of this arrived in Venice only on 20 March, after Battagia arrived at Verona. The government seemed to rally at the news: a ducal letter was sent to all reggimenti ordering the preparation of \\"absolute defence\\" and demanding anew their oaths of allegiance to the Republic. On 21 March, while Bonaparte entered Gradisca, taking control of Tarvisio and the entry of the valleys leading to Austria, came the first reply: Treviso proclaimed itself fully loyal to Venice. The following day, however, came from Udine a letter by the Venetian ambassadors sent to deal with Napoleon, who informed the Venetian government of the French general's increasingly evasive and suspicious attitude. In return, the government considered it necessary to inform the main magistrates of the Terraferma, who had gathered a Verona, to operate with the greatest circumspection towards the French, thus essentially replacing the concept of \\"absolute defence\\" with the vague hope of not giving Napoleon a pretext for entering in an open conflict with Venice. On 24 March, nevertheless, arrived the new pledges of allegiance from the citizens of Vicenza and Padua, shortly after followed by Verona, Bassano, Rovigo and, one after the other, the other centres. Numerous delegations even came from the valleys of Bergamo, ready to rise up against the French. On 25 March, however, the Lombard revolutionaries occupied Sal√≤, followed on 27 March by Crema, where on the next day they proclaimed the Republic of Crema. The French intervention became increasingly audacious, with French cavalry employed in suppressing the resistance of Crema, and then, on 31 March, with French artillery bombarding Sal√≤, which had rebelled against the Jacobins. Venice's anti-Jacobin counteroffensive All these facts at last induced the Venetian magistrates of the Terraferma to authorize the partial mobilization of the cernide, and the preparation for defence of Verona, the principal military stronghold. The French occupiers were initially constrained by keeping up appearances, and consented not to interfere with the Venetian forces that intended to retake control of the cities of Venetian Lombardy. This is borne out by the agreement, signed on 1 April, with which Venice agreed to pay one million lire per month to Napoleon, to finance his campaign against Austria. In this way, the Republic hoped to expedite a speedy conclusion of that conflict, with its concomitant departure of the French occupying troops, and secure a certain freedom of action against the Lombard revolutionaries. Confronted with the spread of popular uprisings in favour of Venice and the rapid advance of Venetian forces, the French were finally forced to aid the Lombard Jacobins, revealing their true intentions. On 6 April a Venetian cavalry ensign was arrested for treason by the French and led to Brescia. On 8 April the Senate was informed of raids carried out by Brescian revolutionaries clad in French uniforms up to the gates of Legnano. On the next day, a proclamation called the population of the Terraferma to abandon Venice, which had up till then been preoccupied only by the security of its own capital. At the same time, the French general Jean-Andoche Junot received from Napoleon a letter in which the latter complained about the anti- French general uprising of the Terraferma. On 10 April, after the French captured a Venetian ship loaded with arms in Lake Garda, they accused Venice of having broken its neutrality by instigating anti-Jacobin revolts among the inhabitants of the valleys of Brescia and Bergamo. The general Sextius Alexandre Fran√ßois de Miollis denounced the attacks suffered by a battalion of Polish volunteers, that had intervened in one of the clashes. On 12 April, on account of the ever more frequent presence of French warships, the Venetians ordered all their ports to maintain the greatest vigilance. On 15 April, finally, Napoleon's ambassador to Venice informed the Signoria of Venice of the French intention to support and promote the revolts against the \\"tyrannical government\\" of the Republic. The Signoria responded by issuing a proclamation urging all its subjects to remain calm and respect the state's neutrality. The \\"Preliminaries of Leoben\\" and the \\"Veronese Easter\\" Fort of Sant'Andrea, whose artillery sunk the ' Ducal audience, painted by Francesco Guardi between 1770‚Äì1775 On 17 April 1797, Napoleon signed a preliminary armistice at Leoben in Styria, with the representatives of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II. In the secret annexes of the treaty, the territories of the Terraferma were already conceded to the Habsburg empire, in return for French possession of the Austrian Netherlands. On the same day, however, events precipitated themselves at Verona. The population, and a part of the Venetian troops quartered there, tired of French arrogance and oppression, rose in revolt. The episode, known as the \\"Veronese Easter\\", quickly reduced the occupation troops to the defensive, reducing them to the city's forts. On 20 April, although the ban on foreign warships entering the Lagoon of Venice had recently been reiterated, the French frigate ' () tried to enter the Porto di Lido, the northern entry to the Lagoon. In response, the artillery on the Fort of Sant'Andrea opened fire, sinking the ship and killing its captain. The Venetian government, however, still hesitated to seize the moment, and still hoped to avoid an open conflict, even at the loss of its mainland possessions: it refused to mobilize the army, or send reinforcements to Verona, which was forced to capitulate on 24 April. On 25 April, on the feast day of Venice's patron, Mark the Evangelist, at Graz, the bewildered Venetian emissaries were openly threatened with war by Napoleon, who boasted that he had 80,000 men and twenty gunships ready to overthrow the Republic. The French general announced that: On the same occasion Napoleon accused Venice of having refused an alliance with France, that would have consented to the restoration of the rebellious cities, with the sole purpose of maintaining its army under arms and thus cut the path of retreat for the French army in case of a defeat. During the next days, the French army proceeded to definitively occupy the Terraferma, up to the shores of the Lagoon of Venice. On 30 April a letter from Napoleon, who was now at Palmanova, informed the Signoria that he intended to alter the Republic's system of government, but offered to maintain its substance. This ultimatum was to expire in four days. The Venetian government made attempts to affect a reconciliation, informing Napoleon on 1 May that it intended to reform its constitution on a more democratic basis, but on 2 May the French declared war on the Republic. On the other hand, on 3 May Venice revoked the general recruitment order for the cernide of Dalmatia. Then, in yet another attempt to appease Napoleon, on 4 May the Great Council of Venice, with 704 votes in favour, 12 against, and 26 abstentions, decided to accept the French demands, including the arrest of the commandant of the Fort of Sant'Andrea, and the three Inquisitori di Stato, an institution that was particularly offensive to Jacobin sensibilities due to its role as the guarantor of the oligarchic nature of the Venetian Republic. On 8 May the Doge, Ludovico Manin, declared that he was ready to depose his insignia at the hands of the Jacobin leaders, and invited all magistrates to do the same, even though the ducal councillor Francesco Pesaro urged him to flee to Zara in Dalmatia, which was still securely in Venetian hands. Venice still possessed a fleet, and the still loyal possessions in Istria and Dalmatia, as well as the intact defences of the city itself and its lagoon. However, the patriciate was seized by terror at the prospect of a popular uprising. As a result, the order went out to demobilize even the loyal Balkan troops (Schiavoni) present in the city. Pesaro himself was forced to escape the city, after the government ordered his arrest in an effort to please Napoleon. On the morning of 11 May, in the penultimate convocation of the Great Council, and under the menace of an invasion, the Doge exclaimed: 12 May 1797: the Fall of the Venetian Republic On the morning of 12 May, between rumours of conspiracies and the imminent French attack, the Great Council met for the last time. Despite the presence of only 537 of the 1,200 patricians that formed its full membership, and hence the lack of a quorum, Doge Ludovico Manin opened the session with the following words: The council then proceeded to examine the French demands, brought before it by some Venetian Jacobins, that entailed the abdication of the government in favour of a (Municipalit√† Provvisoria di Venezia), the planting in the Square of St Mark's of a tree of liberty, the disembarkation of a 4,000-strong contingent of French soldiers, and the handover of certain magistrates who had championed resistance. During the session, the assembly was thrown into panic at the sound of gunshots from the Square of St Mark's: the Schiavoni fired their muskets in salutation of the Banner of Saint Mark before embarking on a ship, but the terrified patricians feared that it signalled a popular revolt. The vote was immediately taken, and with 512 votes in favour, 5 abstentions, and 20 against, the Republic was declared abolished. As the assembly dispersed in haste, the Doge and the magistrates deposed their insignia and presented themselves at the balcony of the Ducal Palace to announce the decision to the crowd gathered below. At the end of the proclamation, the crowd erupted; not, as feared by the patricians, in cries for revolution, but in the cries of Viva San Marco! and Viva la Repubblica!. The crowd raised the Flag of St. Mark on the three masts in the square, attempted to reinstate the Doge, and attacked the houses and properties of Venetian Jacobins. The magistrates, fearful of having to answer to the French, attempted to pacify the crowd, and patrols of men from the Arsenal and shots of artillery fired at Rialto restored order in the city. French occupation of Venice Last acts of the Doge The abdication of the last Doge, Ludovico Manin On the morning of 13 May, still in the name of the Most Serene Prince, and with the usual coat of arms of Saint Mark, three proclamations were issued, which threatened by death anyone who dared to rise up, ordered the restitution to the Procuratie of the valuables looted, and finally recognized the Jacobin leaders as deserving of the fatherland. Because on the next day the last deadline for the armistice granted by Napoleon was to expire, after which the French would have forced their entry into the city, it was eventually agreed to send them the necessary transports to carry 4,000 men, of whom 1,200 were destined for Venice and the rest for the islands and forts surrounding it. On 15 May the Doge departed for ever the Ducal Palace, and retired to his family's residence. In the last decree of the old government, he announced the birth of the . Establishment of the Provisional Municipality The Provisional Municipality established itself in the Ducal Palace, in the hall where the Great Council used to convene. On 16 May it issued a proclamation to announced the new order of things: On the same day at Milan a humiliating peace treaty was signed. On the request of the Municipality, conforming to the terms of the treaty, the French troops entered the city; the first foreign troops to set foot in Venice since its establishment a millennium earlier. At the same time, the provinces began to rebel against the authority of the Municipality of Venice, seeking to institute their own administrations, while the rise in the public debt, no longer supported by revenue from its possessions, the suspension of bank returns, and the other fiscal measures, pushed part of the population to ever more manifest forms of insufferance. On 4 June, in St Mark's Square, was raised the Tree of Liberty (Albero della Libert√†): during the ceremony the gonfalone of the Republic was cut to pieces, and the nobility's libro d'oro was burned, while the new symbol of a winged lion bearing the inscription DIRITTI DELL'UOMO E DEL CITTADINO (\\"Rights of Man and of the Citizen\\") was presented. A month later, on 11 July, the Ghetto of Venice was abolished, and the city's Jews were given the freedom to move about freely. Loss of the Stato da Mar The cathedral of Zara, a city occupied on 1 July 1797 by Austria On 13 June the French, fearing that the Municipality would not succeed in maintaining control of Corfu, sailed with a fleet from Venice, with the intention of deposing the Venetian provveditore generale da Mar in Corfu, who still controlled the Republic's overseas territories, and establishing a democratic regime. Thus on 27 June, the Provisional Municipality of the Ionian Islands was established. Meanwhile, in Istria and Dalmatia, the Venetian magistrates and the local nobles refused to recognize the new government. The fleet, that had repatriated the Schiavoni to their homelands, remained at anchor there, without showing any intention of returning to the Lagoon, nor of imposing the control of the Municipality. At Tra√π the goods of the pro- revolutionaries were looted, while at Sebenico the French consular agent himself was assassinated. The spread of the news concerning the terms agreed at Leoben then led the population to push for a rapid occupation by the Austrians. On 1 July, the Austrians entered Zara, and were greeted by pealing bells and artillery shots in salute. The flags of the Republic, which had been flying up to that point, were led in procession to the cathedral, where the population paid them homage. At Perasto, which enjoyed the title of fedelissima gonfaloniera (\\"most loyal standard-bearer\\"), the banner was symbolically buried beneath the main altar, followed by a speech of the garrison captain. The entire Istro-Dalmatian coast thus passed to Austrian hands, provoking the futile protests of the Provisional Municipality of Venice. The \\"Terror\\" in Venice On 22 July, a Committee of Public Salvation (Comitato di Salute Pubblica), established by the Provisional Municipality of Venice, instituted a Criminal Council (Giunta Criminale) to begin the repression of political dissent, and decreed the penalty of death for whoever pronounced the cry Viva San Marco!. Moving about without a pass was prohibited. On 12 October, the Municipality announced the discovery of a conspiracy against it. This led the French general Antoine Balland, military governor of the city, to decree a state of siege, and to proceed to the arrest and incarceration of hostages. The Treaty of Campoformio and the end of Venetian independence The Horses of Saint Mark, carried off by the French to Paris, and returned only after Napoleon's downfall in 1815 Conclusion of the Austro-French treaty After the Coup of 18 Fructidor on 4 September 1797, the Republican hardliners took control in France, pushing for a resumption of hostilities with Austria. On 29 September, Napoleon was given orders from the Directory to annul the accord of Leoben and issue an ultimatum to the Austrians, so as to leave them without any possibility of retaking control of Italy. The general, however, disregarded his instructions, and continued peace talks with the Habsburgs. Meanwhile, confronted with the precipitating deterioration of the political situation, and the risks raised by the provisions of Leoben, the cities of the Terraferma agreed to participated in a conference at Venice to decide the common fate of the Most Serene Republic's former territories. The union with the newly formed Cisalpine Republic was decided, but the French did not follow the population's choice. The last meeting between French and Austrians took place on 16 October in the villa of the ex-Doge Ludovico Manin, in Codroipo. On 17 October, the Treaty of Campoformio was signed. Thus, in accordance to the secret clauses of Leoben, the territories of the Republic of Venice, formally still extant as the \\"Provisional Municipality\\", were consigned to the Austrian empire, while the Provisional Municipality and all the other Jacobin administrations established by the French ceased to exist. On 28 October, in Venice, the people were summoned by parish to express its acceptance of the French decisions, or to resist them: of 23,568 votes, 10,843 were for submitting. While the heads of the Provisional Municipality were trying to resist, sending envoys to Paris, the activities of the Austrian agents and the deposed patriciate already opened the way for Austrian occupation. The Provisional Municipality's envoys were arrested in Milan and sent home. Plundering of Venice and the handover to Austria Map of northern Italy in 1803 On 21 November, during the traditional Festa della Salute, the representatives of the Municipality were publicly upbraided by the people, and abandoned power, while the French occupiers gave themselves over to unbridled plunder. Of the 184 ships in the Arsenal, those already equipped were sent to Toulon, and the rest were scuttled, thus putting an end to the Venetian navy. In order to deprive Austria of any benefits, the fleet's magazines were plundered, the two thousand Arsenal workers were dismissed, and the entire complex was burned down. Churches, convents, and numerous palazzi were emptied of valuables and artworks. The state mint (zecca) and the treasury of Saint Mark's Church were confiscated, while the Doge's ceremonial galley, the Bucintoro, was denuded of all its sculptures, which were burned in the island of San Giorgio Maggiore to recover their gold leaf. Even the bronze Horses of Saint Mark were carried off to Paris, while private citizens were imprisoned and forced to hand over their wealth in exchange for their freedom. On 28 December, the French military and a committee of police took power, until the entry of Austrian troops into the city on 18 January 1798. Aftermath Kingdom of Italy in 1807, during the brief period when Dalmatia formed part of it, before becoming the Illyrian Provinces of the First French Empire The Austrian administration did not last for long. On 18 March 1805, the Treaty of Pressburg ceded the Habsburgs' Venetian Province to France: on 26 May Napoleon, having been proclaimed Emperor of the French the previous year, was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at Milan. Venice thus returned to French control. Napoleon suppressed the religious orders and began large-scale public works in a city that was to become one of the capitals of his empire. In the Square of St Mark's, a new wing was constructed in what was to be a royal residence for Napoleon: the Ala Napoleonica, or Procuratie Nuovissime; a new avenue was opened in the city, the Via Eugenia (renamed Via Garibaldi in 1866), named after Napoleon's stepson and viceroy Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. In 1807, the post of Primicerius of St Mark's was suppressed, and the basilica became the cathedral of the Patriarchate of Venice. In 1808, Dalmatia too was annexed to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, and a Provveditore generale di Dalmazia was established until 1809, when, following the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, Dalmatia passed under direct French administration as the Illyrian Provinces. The second period of French rule ended with the fall of Napoleon in the War of the Sixth Coalition. On 20 April 1814, Venice returned to Austria, and with the collapse of the Kingdom of Italy, the entire Veneto followed. The region was incorporated in the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia in 1815.

Queen Elizabeth I had ascended the throne at the age of 25 upon the death of her half-sister, Queen Mary I, on 17 November 1558. Mary had reversed the Protestant Reformation which had been started by her two predecessors, so this was the last British coronation to be conducted under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Historians view Elizabeth's coronation as a statement of her intention restore England to Protestantism, but to allow the continuation of some Catholic customs, a compromise known as the Elizabethan Settlement. Background Henry VIII was the second Tudor king of England and his reign from 1509 to 1547 was one of great political and social change. Religious upheaval in Continental Europe and Henry's dispute with the Pope over his intended divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, led Henry to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England.Fraser, pp.179‚Äì189 Henry VIII was succeeded by his nine-year-old son from his marriage to Jane Seymour, Edward VI, who reigned under the governance of a Council of Regency appointed by Henry, which continued the Protestant reforms. However, Edward's early death in 1553 at the age of 15 precipitated a succession crisis. Edward's will excluded both his half-sisters, Mary (the daughter of Catherine of Aragon) and Elizabeth (the daughter of Anne Boleyn), from the succession, and instead declared his cousin, Lady Jane Grey, as his heir. Jane's reign lasted only nine days; with popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful monarch. In 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, who was appointed coregent by parliament under conditions that excluded him from the line of succession. Mary also returned England to Roman Catholicism, burning at the stake some 300 Protestants as heretics and forcing others into exile. The Protestant-minded Elizabeth outwardly conformed with Mary, but became the focus of opposition to the increasingly unpopular government. In 1554, Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower of London under suspicion of having some connection with the failed Wyatt's rebellion; she was released after two months but detained under house arrest thereafter. However, in May 1555, Mary and her physicians believed that she was pregnant and Elizabeth was recalled to court. It soon became apparent that it was a phantom pregnancy and as the prospect of Mary producing an heir receded, Elizabeth's place in the line of succession became more secure. Mary became ill in May 1558 and formally recognised Elizabeth as her heir on 6 November. Elizabeth was at Hatfield House to the north of London when she was informed of Mary's death on 17 November.Fraser, pp.190‚Äì211 Preparations Elizabeth I's first surviving state paper is dated 17 November 1558, the day of her accession, and is a memorandum for the appointment of \\"Commissioners for the Coronation\\"; a month later five had been selected, with Sir Richard Sackville taking charge.Hilton, Chapter 9 The date of Sunday 15 January 1559 was set, not as in previous coronations, on an appropriate Christian holy day but, following the advice of her court astrologer, Dr John Dee, one on which the stars and planets would be in favourable positions.Strong, p. 212 The brief time between accession and coronation was also a product of Elizabeth's concern over her legal status; the First Succession Act of 1533 and the Second Succession Act of 1536 had declared both Mary and Elizabeth to be bastards and excluded them from the line of succession. Although the Third Succession Act of 1543/44 had restored their place in the succession, it had not restored their legitimacy. Elizabeth consulted Sir Nicholas Bacon, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, who warned against attempting to repeal the Succession Acts and the tangle of legislation relating to them. Instead, he advised that following her coronation, Elizabeth's right to rule would be beyond question since \\"the English laws have long since pronounced, That the Crowne once worn quite taketh away all Defects whatsoever\\".Duncan & Schutte, p. 80 Coronation festivities at that time consisted of four parts; the vigil procession to the Tower of London where the monarch would spend one or more nights in vigil; on the day before the coronation, the royal entry procession through the streets of the City of London to the Palace of Westminster; the coronation service itself in Westminster Abbey, and finally the coronation banquet in Westminster Hall.Rowse (1953) Although the religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey was theoretically the main event, Elizabeth was aware that it was the elaborate processions through London which would secure the new queen's popularity with her subjects, not a foregone conclusion given that she was an unmarried woman, that her claim to the throne rested on her executed mother and that there was likely to be a further period of religious upheaval. The queen spent some ¬£16,000 of her own money on the coronation, while the aldermen, livery companies and merchants of the City contributed a very substantial amount, exactly how much is unknown.Collinson, Chapter 3 Unusually, the foreign merchants of the City were forbidden to contribute, making it a purely English display of loyalty; this contrasted with Queen Mary's procession, in which the most elaborate displays had been provided by merchants from Genoa and Florence.Strong, p. 221 The stridently Protestant overtone of the royal entry pageantry reflected not only the desire of the City establishment for religious reform, but the involvement of the Revels OfficeStevens, p. 263 and the Royal Wardrobe in the preparations suggest at least a foreknowledge, if not active direction by Elizabeth and her government.Strong, pp. 214-215 The question of which bishop would conduct the actual coronation service was problematic. That role traditionally fell to the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the incumbent Reginald Pole had died of influenza on 17 November, only 12 hours after Queen Mary, and in the uncertainty of the new regime, a successor had yet to be appointed. The Archbishop of York, Nicholas Heath, a committed but moderate Catholic who had not participated in the burnings of Mary's reign; although willing to attend the coronation, declined to officiate because of the new queen's reforms at the Chapel Royal.Marshall, p. 424 The next in seniority, the Bishop of London, Edmund Bonner, was unacceptable to Elizabeth because of his role in prosecuting heretics, earning him the epithet of \\"Bloody Bonner\\". The Bishop of Winchester, John White, was under house arrest for the anti-Protestant sermon he had preached at Queen Mary's funeral,Starkey, pp. 267-268 while the Bishop of Chichester, John Christopherson, died in prison on 28 December after preaching a similar sermon at St Paul's Cross.Colthorpe \\"1558\\", p. 11 Several other leading bishops also declined, others were suffering the effects of the same epidemic which had claimed the life of Archbishop Pole. Finally, the low-ranking Bishop of Carlisle, Owen Oglethorpe, was coerced into accepting the role. Oglethorpe had already displeased Elizabeth at the Christmas mass at the Chapel Royal, when he performed the Elevation of the Host, despite instructions to the contrary since Protestant reformers connected this ritual with transubstantiation; the Queen therefore walked out of the service before its conclusion.Strong, pp. 208-209 The state processions The instructions and etiquette for Elizabeth's state processions were laid down in a book known as the Little Device, which had originally been compiled in 1377 for Richard II and had been used at most coronations since.Strong, p. 214 Queen Elizabeth's litter at her royal entry, accompanied footmen and Gentlemen Pensioners. The vigil procession An account of the vigil procession was made by Il Schifanoya, a native of the Italian duchy of Mantua who lived in London and regularly wrote accounts of events there to the Mantuan ambassador in Brussels and to the Castellan of Mantua.Brown and Bentink, preface: pp. viii-ix The procession on Thursday 12 January was on the Thames from Whitehall Palace to the Tower of London; the fleet of \\"ships, galleys, brigantines &c.; were prepared as sumptuously as possible\\" which Il Schifanoya thought \\"reminded one of Ascension Day in Venice\\". The queen, attended by members of her court embarked on her royal barge, which was covered with tapestries, both inside and out, and was towed by a galley rowed by 40 men with \\"a band of music\\". The procession passed under the arches of London Bridge on the flood tide and approaching the Tower, an artillery salute was fired. The queen entered the Tower \\"by a little bridge\\".Brown and Bentink, pp. 11-12 The royal entry Another contemporary depiction of the queen's litter. Starting at about two o'clock on the afternoon of Saturday 14 January, Elizabeth made her royal entry, a state procession from the Tower of London through the City of London and the western suburbs to the Palace of Westminster. Besides Il Schifanoya's account of the event, there is also a pamphlet called The Quene's Majestie's passage through the citie of London to westminster the day before her coronacion written by Richard Mulcaster, which was published almost immediately afterwards and had run to a second edition two months later.Strong, p. 222 Il Schifanoya noted that it snowed a little; also that the route had been prepared with wooden barriers to hold back the crowds and that people had spread sand and gravel outside their houses to mitigate the muddy roads. The houses along the way were all decorated and the route lined with the City guildsmen in their hoods and black gowns, together with innumerable flags and banners. He reckoned that the whole procession consisted of a thousand horses.Brown and Bentink, p. 12 The queen was carried on a litter, covered in white cloth of gold and lined with pink satin. It was carried by two mules, attended on either side by a line of footmen in scarlet cloaks and escorted by a further line of Gentlemen Pensioners carrying halberds. A plan of the procession made for the College of Arms lists all of the officers of the royal court, government ministers, judges, knights and baronets, peers, royal chaplains, bishops and archbishops, heralds, and foreign ambassadors. Towards the rear of the line were the ladies of the participants, the highest ranking in coaches or \\"chariots\\", others on horseback or on foot, and finally the royal henchmen and the Yeoman of the Guard.Strong, pp. 217-218 Along the route, the City had devised a series of eleven triumphal arches and tableaux vivant or \\"pageants\\", each having a theme loaded with political and religious allegory. The first arch at Gracechurch Street was three storeys tall and was labelled \\"The vniting of the two houses of Lancastre and York\\"; upon it was a huge representation of a rose bush on which were large statues of Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, with Elizabeth seated in majesty at the very top, pointedly underlining the legitimacy of her succession.Strong, p. 223 A small boy was perched above the central arch who gave an oration to the queen, explaining the details of the symbolism, to which the queen listened \\"most attentively, evincing much satisfaction\\".Brown and Bentink, p. 13 Towards the western end of Cheapside, the Lord Mayor of London and the aldermen awaited the queen, to whom they presented a satin purse containing a thousand marks in gold, according to Mulcaster.Bartlett and McGlynn, p. 279 A little further along Cheapside, perhaps the most elaborate and important pageant was at the Little Conduit near St Paul's Cathedral, in normal times a small tower housing a water cistern, serving not only as the water supply for the area, but also as a customary public meeting place.Knight, Chapter 4 The space had been transformed with two artificial hills, one barren and wasted and the other green and fertile, representing bad and good governance. Between the hills, a cave had been constructed; upon the queen's arrival, an old man emerged representing \\"Time\\" followed by his daughter \\"Truth\\", perhaps a satirical reference to Queen Mary's personal motto; Veritas Temporis Filia (\\"Truth the Daughter of Time\\"). Truth was holding a book, a banned English translation of the New Testament, which was presented to the queen who kissed it, thanking the City for their gift. The final pageant was at Temple Bar, where the queen saw herself portrayed as the Biblical judge Deborah accompanied by the three estates of England, probably representing the forthcoming parliament which had already been summoned to decide the religious policy of the new government.Strong, pp. 224-225 The depiction of Elizabeth as Deborah was aimed at the supporters of Calvinist reformer John Knox, who in the previous year had published a polemic entitled The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women. This pamphlet, intended to undermine Queen Mary and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland, claimed that female leadership was contrary to the laws of nature and to Biblical teaching. Knox's qualified this assertion in the case of Deborah, who had freed the Israelites from the Canaanites and led them to an era of peace and prosperity, and whom Knox claimed had been a God-given and miraculous exception for the salvation of his people.Guy p. 184 The coronation service The coronation service was held on Sunday 15 January.Brown and Bentink, p. 16 The Little Device stipulates that the monarch was to enter Westminster Hall at seven o'clock in the morning.Strong, p. 174 After being censed by the Archbishop of York, the queen walked the short distance to the abbey in procession, flanked by the Earls of Pembroke and Shrewsbury and her train carried by the Duchess of Norfolk. She was followed by other nobles carrying the coronation swords, the orb and three crowns which were borne by the Kings of Arms, all accompanied by the Choir of the Chapel Royal singing the processional hymn Salve festa dies (\\"Hail, Thou Festal Day\\"). A plan survives of the layout of the abbey for the service, showing the large platform which had been erected at the crossing which was accessed by a flight of twenty steps, itself surmounted by a further dais in the form of an octagon of five steps, and on top of that was placed St Edward's Chair, high above the congregation.Strong, p. 211 The order of service followed the Liber Regalis, the abbey's transcript of the fourth recension of the coronation service, first used the coronation of Edward II in 1308 and spoken in Latin for the last time before its translation into English in 1601. Also for the last time, the coronation included a Catholic mass. There was no universal text for the mass in the Catholic Church at that time, and in southern England, the Sarum Rite was generally used, however most major churches had their own variations on it, the abbey using their own version called the Litlyngton or Westminster Missal,Hook, p. 151 dating from 1384.Strong, p. 84 The various accounts of the service describe the traditional phases of the coronation liturgy, starting with the Recognition. On the congregation being asked if they accepted Elizabeth as their queen, Il Schifanoya (who probably wasn't inside the abbey) reported that 'they all shouted \\"Yes\\"; and the organs, fifes, trumpets and drums playing, the bells also ringing, it seemed as if the world were come to an end'. After making an offering of gold to the altar, the queen sat to listen to the sermon, although which bishop preached it is unknown. The coronation oath returned to the form used at Edward's coronation 1547, but with an amendment to the wording, promising to rule according to the \\"\\"true profession of the Gospel established in this Kingdom\\". The fact that the text of the oath was handed to Bishop Oglethorpe by Sir William Cecil, the new Secretary of State, suggests that he was behind in its formulation. Then followed the Anointing, the Investing and the actual Crowning, accompanied by the sounding of trumpets. At the Homage, it was significant that the lords temporal were the first to offer their loyalty, rather than the lords spiritual as was traditional. The most controversial element of the ceremony was the Coronation Mass and Elizabeth's participation in it, since the three surviving eye-witness reports are either obscure or contradictory. There is no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to what actually occurred. It is evident that the Epistle and the Gospel were read in both Latin and English, a departure from the Catholic custom. At some point during the mass, Elizabeth withdrew to the \\"traverse\\", a curtained off area behind the high altar and next to St Edward's shrine, a private space in which the monarch could make the several changes of dress required for the ceremonial. David Starkey asserts that the mass was sung by Bishop Oglethorpe who elevated the host, prompting Elizabeth's early withdrawal.Starkey, p. 276 John GuyGuy p. 179 and Lisa Hilton both state that the royal chaplain, George Carew, sang the mass without elevation and administered Holy Communion to the queen inside the traverse.Hilton, Ch. 9 A. L. Rowse states that Oglethorpe sang the mass and that Elizabeth withdrew before the consecration. Roy Strong writes that Carew sang the mass without elevation, but that Elizabeth did not receive Communion, citing her reported conversation with the French ambassador in 1571 that 'she had been crowned and anointed according to the ceremonies of the Catholic church, and by Catholic bishops without, however, attending mass'.Strong, pp. 208-210 Finally, the queen left the abbey, smiling and exchanging greetings with the crowd, which Il Schifanoya thought 'exceeded the bounds of gravity and decorum'. The coronation feast Again, Il Schifanoya provides the most detailed description. Westminster Hall had been decorated by the hanging of two enormous tapestries which had been bought by Henry VIII, representing the Book of Genesis and the Acts of the Apostles; while on a raised platform a buffet on which were displayed an array of 140 gold and silver cups.Brown and Bentinck, p. 16 He describes how the 200 guests were seated at four large tables, each divided along the centre to allow the red-caped servants to serve the food. The organisers of the feast, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl Marshal and the Earl of Arundel, the Lord Steward, rode around the hall mounted on horseback. The feast began at 3 o'clock when the queen washed her hands. The highlight of the feast was the entry of the Queen's Champion, 'a country gentleman whose family has long been privileged to do this at all Coronations', actually Sir Edward Dymoke, mounted and in a full suit of armour, who issued the traditional challenges, each time throwing down his gauntlet.Colthorpe \\"1559\\", p. 14 The feast ended at 9 o'clock in the evening, when the queen left for Whitehall. A joust organised for the next day had to be postponed as the queen was 'feeling rather tired'.Brown and Bentinck, p. 18 Historical significance According to Roy Strong, Elizabeth's coronation and royal entry has attracted more scholarly attention than any other. In the following centuries, historians from Raphael Holinshed onwards, drew heavily on the tone of Mulcaster's The Quenes makesties pasage and presented the 1559 coronation and pageants as a turning point against imposed Catholicism and the triumph of popular Protestantism.Hunt, p. 161 Modern historians have taken a more critical view, asserting that the events of January 1559 were carefully stage-managed by Elizabeth and her advisers. Even the obscurity of the events surrounding the Coronation Mass have been interpreted as a signal that the future religious policy of the regime had yet to be fully determined.Hunt, p. 155 References Books    Articles 1559 in England Elizabeth I Elizabeth I Westminster Abbey ","title":"Coronation of Elizabeth I"},{"id":"55335393","text":"The Black Dove is a 2012 American independent drama film directed by Michael Caporale and starring John Savage and Sean Young.

Life He was the grandson of Henry Harman, clerk of the crown under Henry VII, who obtained about 1480 the estates of Ellam and Maystreet in Kent. Thomas's father, William Harman, added to these estates the manor of Mayton or Maxton in the same county. As his father's heir, Thomas inherited all this property, and lived at Crayford, Kent, continuously from 1547. That he was a member of the gentry is evidenced by the coat of arms stamped on his pewter plate and he appears to have been a local Commissioner of the Peace. As a magistrate he was responsible for implementing the new laws against beggary enacted by Henry VIII. He writes that he was 'a poore gentleman,' detained in the country by ill-health. He found some recreation in questioning the vagrants who begged at his door as to their modes of life, and paid frequent visits to London with the object of corroborating his information. He thus acquired a unique knowledge of the habits of thieves and beggars. Occasionally his indignation was so roused by the deception practised by those whom he interrogated at his own door that he took their licenses from them and confiscated their money, distributing it among the honest poor of his neighbourhood. In 1554 and 1555 Harman was appointed to the Commission of Sewers for Kent, which was responsible for the River Thames from Ravensbourne to Gravesend bridge. A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors Before 1566, Harman had composed an elaborate treatise on vagrants and come to London to superintend its publication. He lodged at the cloister in Whitefriars and continued his investigation even while his book was passing through the press. Of the first edition, issued in 1566 or very early in 1567, no copy is known. Its popularity was at once so great that Henry Bynneman and Gerrard Dewes were both fined by the Stationers' Company in 1567, for attempting to circulate pirated copies. Of the second edition two copies, differing in many particulars, are extant. One is in the Bodleian Library (dated 8 Jan. 1567-8), and in 1890 the other belonged to Alfred Henry Huth (dated 'Anno Domini 1567'). The former is doubtless the earlier of the two, neither of which seems to have been published till early in 1568. Both were issued by William Griffith. The title ran in the later copy, A Caueat or Warening for commen cvrsetors Yvlgarely called Vagabones. A dedication by Harman to his neighbour, Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, widow of the 4th Earl, who held the manor of Erith and 'the epistle to the reader' is followed by exhaustive small essays on 24 classes of the thieves' and tramps' fraternity, and by a list of names of the chief professors of the art 'lyuinge nowe at this present.' A vocabulary of 'their pelting speche' or cant terms concludes the volume, which is embellished by a few woodcuts, including one of 'an upright man, Nicolas Blunt,' and another of 'a counterfeit cranke, Nicolas Genynges.' Harman borrowed something from The Fraternitye of Vacabondes, by John Awdelay, which was probably first issued in 1561, although the earliest edition now known is dated 1575; but Harman's information is far fuller and fresher than Awdelay's, and was very impudently plagiarised by later writers. The Groundworke of conny-catching (1592), very doubtfully assigned to Robert Greene, reprints the greater part of Harman's book. Thomas Dekker, in his Belman of London (1608), made free use of it, and Samuel Rowlands exposed Dekker's theft in his Martin Mark-all, Beadle of Bridewell (Lond. 1610). Dekker, in the second part of his Belman, called Lanthorne and Candlelight (1609), conveyed to his pages Harman's vocabulary of thieves' words, which Richard Head incorporated in his 'English Rogue' (1671‚Äì80). Harman's vocabulary is the basis of the later slang dictionaries (cf. among others, that forming the appendix to 'Memoires of John Hall' (d. 1707) (see Jack Hall), 1708). Another edition of Harman's Caueat appeared in 1573, and this was reprinted by Machell Stace in 1814. A carefully collated edition of the second edition was edited by Dr. Frederick Furnival and Edward Viles for the Early English Text Society in 1869, and re-issued by the New Shakspeare Society in 1880. Personal life Harman married Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Rogers. Their eldest daughter, Anne (d.1574), married merchant taylor Robert Draper of Crayford.

There is also a 14th- century diarist known as the \\"Anonimo Fiorentino\\", as well as other figures. a manuscript with 128 pages of text, probably from the 1530s and 1540s, and now in the Central National Library of Florence (Magliab. XVII, 17). It includes brief biographies and notes on the works of Italian artists, mainly those active in Florence during the Middle Ages. Among several other suggestions, the anonymous author has been suggested to be Bernardo Vecchietti (1514‚Äì1590), a politician of the court of Cosimo I.Wierda, 157; DAH The author clearly had intimate access to the Medici court.Wierda, 161‚Äì162 The manuscript dates from about 1536 to the mid 1540s and is considered a useful source for the study of the history of Italian art since it is the most comprehensive biographical source for artists before the 1550 edition of Vasari's Lives, which was being compiled over the same period.Wierda, 157; DAH While the opening section is devoted to artists from ancient Greece, essentially reprising Pliny the Elder, the most significant part is dedicated to Florentine artists from Cimabue to Michelangelo.Wierda, 157 The entries for artists concentrate on lists of works, and lack the full biographical ambition of Vasari.Rubin, 174 Contents The manuscript, which now appears to be incomplete, is considered a particularly useful source for the study of the history of Italian art since it is the most comprehensive biographical source before the 1550 edition of Vasari's Lives, which was being compiled over the same period.Wierda, 157; DAH The account of the life of Leonardo da Vinci is especially detailed, and much used by later authors. One particular point, a later addition to the manuscript, has been much discussed. This states that Leonardo painted a portrait from life of \\"Piero Francesco del Giocondo\\" (or possibly just \\"Francesco del Giocondo\\"), respectively the son and the husband of Lisa del Giocondo, usually considered the sitter for the Mona Lisa.Early Printed Books as Material Objects, Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the IFLA Rare Books and Manuscripts Section, Munich, 19‚Äì21 August 2009, Editors: Bettina Wagner, Marcia Reed, 2010, Walter de Gruyter, , 783110253245, google books Frank Z√∂llner argues that the author of the note simply made a mistake, and was referring to the Mona Lisa.Z√∂llner, Frank, \\"Leonardo's Portrait of Lisa del Giocondo\\", p. 245, in Leonardo Da Vinci, Selected Scholarship: Leonardo's projects, c. 1500‚Äì1519, edited by Claire J. Farago, 1999, Taylor & Francis, , 9780815329350; also Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 121 (1993), S. 1., PDF In general, much of the information is the same as in Vasari's Lives, though there are also distinct differences. It is clear the two authors knew each other, but not clear that either had read the other's work. Annotations in the MS include notes to ask Vasari for further details, and it is possible that a satirical portrait at the end of the MS records the author's bitterness when he realized that Vasari's publication would eclipse his own efforts, or had already done so.Wierda, 165‚Äì166 Like Vasari, the author had access to a version of the material known from the somewhat earlier manuscript of Antonio Billi, from about 1515, which may have been circulated among Florentine art lovers in various redactions.Rubin, 174; Wierda, 163 Provenance Bernardo Vecchietti, one possible author, was the son of a rich cloth merchant and would only have been in his early twenties when he compiled the manuscript in the early 1540s. He was later a patron of the sculptor Giambologna, and helped Duke Cosimo organize his artistic projects, in 1572 provoking bitter complaints by Vasari, surviving in a letter to Vincenzo Borghini (another figure suggested as the Anonimo Gaddiano).Wierda, 163‚Äì164, 157 The manuscript later belonged to the Gaddi family (hence the \\"Gaddiano\\" name),Wierda, 157 descended from the 13th- century artist Gaddo Gaddi, and by the 16th century prominent in banking and the church. Contemporary members included Cardinals Niccol√≤ Gaddi and Taddeo Gaddi, and the priest Giovanni Gaddi, the last a courtier in Florence at the time, and friend of Vasari and Benvenuto Cellini.Wierda, 164 It entered the collection of Antonio Magliabechi, which became the core of the Florentine public library.DAH The manuscript was forgotten about until published in 1892 by Karl Frey; altogether the manuscript has been published three times in Italian.DAH; Wierda, 157; the earliest edition is: Il Codice Magliabechiano by Anonimo Fiorentino, [digitized from a collection at Harvard University]; Frey, Karl, 1857‚Äì1917.

Exiled from the country during the dictatorship in 1973, she relocated to Paris, where she worked as a professor and researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research. Much of her literary work centered on the cultural heritage of Jews in predominantly Catholic Latin America, the effects of military dictatorship on human rights and racial prejudices and exile. Her research evaluated the psycho-sociology of children and women's sexuality. She won a National Book prize in Chile for her fiction and a bronze medal from the French National Center for Scientific Research for her scholarship. Early life Ana Luisa Bronfman Weinstein was born on 18 December, 1931 in Santiago, Chile to Ida Weinstein Rudoy and Samuel Bronfman. Her mother's family were immigrants from Ukraine and her father's family were immigrants from the Russian Empire. Nicha, as she was called by acquaintances, was influenced and shaped by being the child of Jewish immigrants in the predominantly Catholic country. Studying psychology with a minor in French, Bronfman graduated from the University of Chile. She married Oscar V√°squez Pedemonte and the couple had seven children. Career From 1967 to 1973, V√°squez-Bronfman taught at the University of Chile, as a professor in the School of Sociology. When the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat occurred, she went into exile, fleeing to France in 1974. She wrote six novels, as well as several short stories, focusing her studies on exile. Working as a therapist with political prisoners and victims of torture, her works explored the effects of politics on human rights. She studied at the Sorbonne, earning her PhD in psychology and upon her graduation became a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research from 1984 through 1998. V√°squez-Bronfman' first novels, Les bisons, les bonzes et le d√©potoir (The Bison, the Leaders, and the Rubbish, 1977, translated into Spanish as Los b√∫falos, los jerarcas y la huesera, 1987), Abel Rodr√≠guez y sus hermanos (Abel Rodr√≠guez and his Brothers, 1981), and Sebasto's Angels (co- written with her son Cacho V√°squez, 1985) each explored a military dictatorship through fiction. Les bisons, les bonzes et le d√©potoir tells the tale of one hundred leftist refugees who had taken refuge in the French Embassy in Santiago. Ideologically linked, but differing in almost every other aspect, the book explored the limits on communication. It was selected as a book of the month by Le Monde diplomatique in 1978. Abel Rodr√≠guez y sus hermanos deals with the fracturing of the family, and thus the nation, dividing Chilean society as brothers take opposing sides in the political climate. The novel explores both psychological and physical torture, forced disappearance, and government cover-ups. Sebasto's Angels evaluates the impact of living in dual cultural realities for second-generation immigrants with the added dimension of being exiles. The book was V√°squez-Bronfman's first novel in which the setting moved from Chile to France and her son, √ìscar, known as \\"Cacho\\", who was a guitarist and singer of a Latin rock band, lends the story a more youthful focus. V√°squez deals with the pain and guilt of exile, while her son focuses on his anger, rejection politics, and his desire to live in the present moment. It explores the stages of exile, isolation, indifference, and ultimately a loss of identification with one's place of origin, recognizing that one cannot live based on the hypothetical idea that at a future point you may be able to return. In her book Mi amiga Chantal (My Friend Chantal, 1991), V√°squez-Bronfman explores being a double exile in a fictional-autobiographical exploration of community and personal development. V√°squez-Bronfman's 1999 short story The Sign of the Star, retold the story of a seven-year-old child bullied by his classmates for being Jewish. She tied themes of the Holocaust, such as ghettoization and cremation, to the isolation the child feels when his classmates forbade others to talk with him. Drawing on her own history of being a Jew in a Catholic country, she evaluated Antisemitism from both a cultural and racial perspective. That same year, her Los mundos de Circe (The World of Circe, 1999) was awarded the Chilean National Book and Reading Council prize for best narrative. The work explored shifting relationships of couples, which arise over the course of a partnership, dealing with trust given partially or fully, beauty and ugliness, and the risks that are inherent in love. V√°squez-Bronfman returned to the theme of her Jewishness in Las jaulas invisible (The Invisible Cages, 2002), evaluating women, their sexuality, and migration on the road to becoming mestizo. Set in the first half of the twentieth century, the novel tells the tale of modern daughters descended of immigrants to Chile and indigenous migrants who have moved from the countryside to the city and explores how all of them are marginalized and reshaped by their experiences. She took these themes further in a collaborative anthology, Cr√≠menes de mujeres (Crimes of Women, 2004), which she edited, along with Virginia Vidal. The title referred to both crimes committed and suffered by women and evaluated the complexity of victimization, perpetration, and institutionalized power. Her academic works focused on child psychology and she often evaluated the psychosocial development of children through organizations and public institutions, publishing several books on the topic. After her retirement from the National Center for Scientific Research in 1998, she received the center's bronze medal for research and was awarded an Honorary Degree for her research on women's sexuality. This last work Amor y sexualidad en las personas mayores: Trasgresiones y secretos (Love and Sexuality in the Elderly: Transgressions and Secrets, 2006) contrasted and compared the sexual experiences of twenty individuals as they aged. Subjects were from France and Spain and were an equal representation of male and female subjects. Divided into three sections, the first part of the study dealt with the socialization practices associated with sex‚Äîfears, initiation rituals, taboos‚Äîand the differences between men and women's sexuality. The second section evaluated sexuality as practiced in adulthood and the final portion analyzed the differences the group experienced in their sexuality as they aged. The research shows how childhood influences continue to be manifested in aging populations. Death and legacy V√°squez- Bronfman died on 18 November 2009 in Paris, France. In February 2010, colleagues and friends gathered to celebrate her memory. Her works have been translated into Dutch, French and German. In 2017, a literary prize for young women, known as the Ana Vasquez-Bronfman Prize, was launched to assist young writers in publishing their works.

The Main Street Branch Library is one of four branch libraries for the City of Huntington Beach Public Library system and, along with Triangle Park, is one of the 122 historic properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Orange County, California. Both the Main Street Branch Library and Triangle Park were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 13, 2013, by the United States Department of the Interior, Reference Number 13000157.  Main Street Branch Library  Construction began on the 9,034-square-foot Main Street Branch Library in 1949, in what was known as the International Style, and more recently called Mid Century Modern. The library opened in 1951, and the town's original Carnegie Library (1914-1951) at 8th and Walnut streets was closed and demolished. From the City of Huntington Beach City Clerk's \\"Historical Notes\\" (1975), ‚ÄúWhen the current Main Street facility (library), consisting of 9,000 square feet, was completed in 1951, it was celebrated for its size and its design.\\" The Library was dedicated in 1951 by Huntington Beach Mayor Vernon Langenbeck. The Main Street Branch Library held a collection of between 40,000 and 50,000 books and served as the main public library for the community from 1951 up until 1975. The architectural firm of McLellan, MacDonald and Marcwith designed the Main Street Branch as part of the mid-20th Century Civic Center.City of Huntington Beach, Huntington Beach Public Library, Main Street Branch, www.HuntingtonBeach.CA.gov James Edward McClellan, Denver Markwith, Jr., and Jack Hunt MacDonald, developed site-cast, concrete tilt-up construction, during the post-World War II building boom in Southern California. This innovative method was considered novel at the time, as was the library's three-hinged arch structural system. A handcrafted grandfather clock in the library's main room was donated by the senior class of Huntington Beach High School in 1914.  Triangle Park  Triangle Park is a 1.11 acre neighborhood park that was created in 1912, three years after the City of Huntington Beach's incorporation in 1909. The park was remodeled from 1924-1925 and Canary Island palm trees were planted, which still stand today. Triangle Park was used as a recreational area, prior to it officially being deeded to the city. The Park was associated with a baseball field (1912 to early 1930s); a tent city for oil workers (1921 to 1923); recreational activities like crochet and tennis (circa 1928 to 1930s); a putting green (1927 to circa 1950); and horseshoes (circa 1931). In 1917, the Huntington Beach Company officially deeded land blocks #405 and #505 to the City, specifying public park uses for the deeded land.City of Huntington Beach, California, archival public recordsBargain and Sale Deed. Book 316, page 383, August 7, 1917. A portion of Block 505, the future Triangle Park, was temporarily used for tents to house the constant flow of new residents to Huntington Beach upon the discovery of oil in 1920. The City of Huntington Beach City Clerk's office reports \\"on July 5, 1921, a lease contract was signed with R.E. Wright who constructed small beaverboard houses and rented them for $30 and $35 a month of which $8 a year went to the City. Bungalet Court, more commonly known as 'Cardboard Alley' was located on the triangular piece of land.\\" The incorporation of Triangle Park as part of a larger civic center complex was initiated in 1922, including the adjacent city hall (1922 to 1923); the Memorial Hall (1923); the Horseshoe Club (1931), which later provided space for a courthouse and city administrative offices: and the Huntington Beach Fire Department headquarters (1939). By the mid 1920s, the \\"triangular park\\" was seeded with grass, street lights were installed on Main Street, and the City began planting trees. In February 1925, the board of trustees (city council) discussed \\"with considerable interest\\" a resident suggestion \\"advocating the use of Block 505 for a recreation park, suggesting tennis, croquet, and handball courts as being a very desirable form of amusement.\\"\\"Main Street Library and Triangle Park\\", Historic Huntington Beach, August 27, 2012 In 1927, the recreational improvements at Triangle Park were well underway, with the addition of a lighted baseball diamond, grandstand, and cement work on the horseshoe grounds.\\"Finish Diamond in H.B.

Education Jean possesses a Bachelor of Social Sciences, International Relations and Economics, from the University of Ottawa and a Master of Business Administration from the State University of New York. Biography Jean began his career in Canadian government in 1983 and has held various positions since then, including Deputy Minister of Canadian Heritage and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. While he was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2015, Jean was seen to urge government to sign an extradition treaty with China. National Security Advisor Jean became the National Security Advisor (Canada) to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in May 2016, after Richard Fadden retired from the position. Several months after his appointment, Jean went to Beijing to talk about an extradition treaty and a \\"transfer of offenders\\" treaty. He assisted in the release of Hyeon Soo Lim from North Korea. =Resignation= Jean attracted controversy in 2018 when he gave a briefing to journalists on Justin Trudeau's trip to India, in which Jaspal Atwal was invited to an event at the Canadian embassy. Atwal is a Canadian of Indian descent to was convicted of the attempted murder of Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986. Jean claimed that the briefing was designed to \\"counter a false narrative\\" that CSIS, the RCMP, and the High Commission to India knew of Atwal's invitation in advance but did nothing. Following the briefing, several media outlets reported that a senior official had alleged that Atwal's presence was the result of a concerted effort to embarrass the Canadian government. The briefing drew criticism from some, including Conservative MP Glen Motz for raising \\"the conspiracy theory of rogue Indian elements\\" rather than accepting responsibility for Atwal's invitation. Within 24 hours, Surrey Centre Liberal MP Randeep Sarai said that he had secured Atwal‚Äôs invitation, thus giving the lie to Jean, who announced that he would retire as national security advisor in April 2018, stepping down officially on May 22.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history Colonial settlement of what is now the town of Gill began in the mid-18th century, and the town was incorporated in 1794. Riverside, located on the northern bank of the Connecticut River, now opposite the 19th-century industrial village of Turners Falls, was its first point of settlement. The oldest surviving building in Gill is the Howland Tavern, built about 1760 and now set on the south side of the French King Highway (Massachusetts Route 2). In the early 19th century sawmills were erected along the river, which produced lumber used in the development of Gill and neighboring communities. When Turners Falls was developed later in the 19th century, Riverside was economically eclipsed, and became a place for workers there to live. The Turners Falls Lumber Company, located in Riverside, burned down in 1903, and its site was never redeveloped. The historic district is roughly bounded on the north by the French King Highway and the south by the river. A network of mainly residential streets is clustered southwest of the highway and the Gill‚ÄìMontague Bridge, built in 1937-38 as a replacement for an older failing suspension bridge. Most of the buildings in the district are modest frame houses. They are built in a diversity of styles, representing the shifts in fortunes of the community and its industries. Notable non-residential buildings include a c. 1920 gas station, a 1926 schoolhouse, and a vegetable stand built in the 1940s to serve traffic passing on the highway.

History John Haimes, brewer, pastoralist and racehorse owner. Haimes was born in Australia, perhaps in Sydney, a son of Richard Haimes ( ‚Äì 31 March 1833), from 1832 licensee of the Waterloo Tavern, George Town, Tasmania. His father was killed at Sandy Bay when kicked by a horse, and his mother Margaret Haimes took over running the hotel. She married again, on 15 January 1835, to George Thomas Wilson; they ran the hotel until 1842. In 1847‚Äì1848 he had, with one Hardcastle, the licence for the hotel at Marrabool Creek (possibly present-day Moorabool), near Geelong. Haimes moved to South Australia, and in 1851 took the licence for the Sir John Franklin hotel at North Kapunda. Referring to the portrait photo caption: \\"Potapa, Patapa or as it is spelt today Puttapa, is in the northern Flinders Ranges and now forms part of the Beltana pastoral lease. It was taken up in 1854 by John Haimes at which time it was 195 square miles in extent. He sold it in 1862 to Thomas Elder. Haimes also held at various times the Baroota run and Old Telowie run (near Port Germein) in the mid north of South Australia.\\" He became involved in the mail contract business, in April 1855 taking over John Hayter's share of Simms & Hayter, operating out of Currie Street as Simms & Haimes (dissolved January 1856), then Haimes & Co running a weekly service to Moorundee. This was the time of the gold rush, and much traffic was carried on the River Murray from such river towns to the diggings of Victoria. He established a depot at Gawler 1857, then sold the business in September and January 1858. He had a separate carrying company Haimes & Jewell with Peter Jewell, which operated from January 1856 to May 1857. When Jewell faced insolvency Haimes purchased his farm Lots 101, 111 and part of 112, Netley, which in 1858 became his place of residence, left 1860, sold 1872. He also owned Lot 238 Unley (did this become Waverley Brewery?). He bred horses at Tullowie in the 1850s in a partnership with Peter Jewell which ended in acrimony and a lawsuit. He was judge at the Kapunda races; starter at Gawler races in 1859 and several meetings at the Thebarton course in 1860. He was appointed Captain in the South Australian Volunteer Military Force in March 1860, the source of his assumed title \\"Captain\\", which he affected in Victoria (but not South Australia). He left for England in 1861 and returned to Australia 1864, largely sold up his Adelaide assets and settled in Colac, Victoria. He served several years as a councillor in the Colac council, and an alderman of Geelong. He purchased Mamre estate of near Colac, which he sold in 1873 (then leased?) and continued to breed horses and sheep; Wychetella estate of . Amongst the sires he owned were Rapidity, Coeur de Lion, and Bay Middleton, and Archie, Dufferin, Tasman, and Larpent were bred and raced by him. Several of his horses were successful at Flemington. He was partner with Charles Mallen in founding the Waverley Brewery in 1878 and their company owned several public houses. The very rich but somewhat eccentric Haimes died peacefully at Colac after several years of deteriorating health. Among his many bequests was ¬£500 to each of the many children of his friend Edward Meade Bagot, comparable to a gift of $100,000 today. Family Haimes never married.

She was married to Alick McKay (died 1983 aged 73), then an executive at News Limited and deputy to Rupert Murdoch, and was targeted after being mistaken for Murdoch's then wife, Anna Murdoch. Two Indo-Trinidadian brothers, Arthur Hosein (34) and his youngest sibling Nizamodeen (22), were convicted of the crimes of murder and kidnapping in September 1970. The case was significant in that it was one of the earliest cases of a trial and conviction in a murder without a body case in the United Kingdom. Disappearance Muriel McKay and her husband, Alick McKay, were born and raised in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. By 1969, after moving to London for her husband's job as a newspaper executive for Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, they lived in St Mary's House on Arthur Road in Wimbledon. Their two adult children, Ian McKay and Diane Dyer, also lived in the United Kingdom. On 29 December 1969, assailants broke into the home and abducted McKay while her husband was at work. Returning home at 7:45 pm and finding the front door unlocked, the telephone ripped from the wall, the content of his wife's handbag scattered on the stairs, and the house empty Alick McKay reported her missing at 8 pm. The attack was especially troubling given that jewellery had been stolen in a burglary incident three months earlier, and McKay had become increasingly careful of her personal safety.  Investigation  When police arrived, the burglary case was quickly upgraded to a kidnapping after investigators found items that were foreign to the house: Elastoplast, twine, a newspaper, and a billhook. After the phone was repaired, at 1 am, a caller identifying himself as 'M3' (short for Mafia 3) contacted the house and demanded a ¬£1 million ransom. Over the next forty days, M3 made eighteen more calls, demanding to speak to either Alick, Ian, or Diane, and sent three letters (postmarked in Tottenham or Wood Green) demanding the money while repeatedly threatening to kill McKay. Five letters written by McKay and pleading for compliance were enclosed as 'proof' that she was alive, as were three pieces cut from her clothing. However, two successive attempts to deliver half of the money were unsuccessful. The first one, on the A10 on 1 February 1970, was abandoned due to a large police presence in the area. A second attempt was then made on 6 February. Following M3's detailed instructions, two disguised police officers placed ¬£500,000 (primarily composed of fake banknotes) in two suitcases and left them at a telephone box in Church Street, Edmonton. The police conducted surveillance in the area and noticed that a blue Volvo sedan with a broken tail-light, registration XGO994G, and with a single occupant, slowly passed the box four times between 8 pm and 10.30 pm. At 10.47 pm it passed again, this time carrying two men. However, a local couple noticed the suitcases and became concerned. The woman kept watching while her husband reported the cases to the police, who were unaware of the drop-off and took them to the local station. The investigation then shifted to the Volvo, registered in the name of a man from Rooks Farm near Stocking Pelham, Hertfordshire. Reviewing previous reports, they noted that some witnesses had also described seeing a dark coloured Volvo sedan driving near Arthur Road in the hours before McKay's disappearance was reported, and another one reporting it as parked in the McKay driveway around 6 pm. Police also noted it acting suspiciously at the first drop-off attempt but had assumed it was either undercover police or a local. Rooks Farm, which covered eleven acres and was considerably run down, was then raided by police on 7 February at 8 am. The owners of the farm were Trinidad-born Arthur Hosein (34) and his German wife, who also lived with Arthur's youngest sibling, Nizamodeen (22), who had worked there as a labourer since August. A notebook was found inside with torn pages that matched the tear patterns in McKay's letters. Further, twine and a matching roll of tape were found, and the billhook was revealed as belonging to a neighbour. The brothers' physical descriptions also matched those of the men seen in the Volvo, and Arthur's fingerprints also matched those found in the ransom letters and a newspaper found in the McKay house. Similarly, Nizamodeen's voice matched that of recordings of M3 when he was tested on a telephone. However, no trace of McKay was found at the farm, even after it was searched for several weeks.  Trial  Based on the evidence, the Hosein brothers were arrested and sent to trial on 14 September 1970, with the prosecution led by Peter Rawlinson. At the trial it was learned that Arthur, a tailor in Hackney, was experiencing financial difficulty after buying the farm in May 1968. The farm, originally established in the 17th century, was used to raise cattle, pigs and chickens. The Hoseins decided to kidnap Anna Murdoch after watching her husband being interviewed on television by David Frost about his recent purchase of the News of the World and The Sun newspapers on 30 October. The confusion arose when the Hoseins followed Rupert Murdoch's chauffeured Rolls- Royce to the house in Arthur Road, which they assumed to be his family's residence, but it was actually the McKays. Unbeknownst to the brothers, Murdoch had loaned the car to Alick McKay for a few weeks while he and his wife were in Australia. Throughout the case, each brother tried to put the blame on the other, although it was soon determined that the older brother was the more dominant of the two. The Hosein brothers were convicted on the charges of murder, kidnap and blackmail at the Old Bailey on 6 October 1970. Giving them life sentences, plus twenty-five years in Arthur's case, and fifteen in Nizamodeen's for kidnapping, the trial judge, Justice Shaw, said their \\"conduct was cold-blooded and abominable\\". Despite investigation, it was never established what happened to McKay's remains, though there was speculation that the Hoseins had fed them to their guard dogs or pigs. Aftermath The Hosein brothers were sent to Winson Green Prison where they appealed their sentence in March 1971. In November 1987 and September 1994, Arthur unsuccessfully applied for parole. Arthur died in 2009 in prison, whereas Nizamodeen served twenty years and was deported to Trinidad after his release. The nature of the case led to widespread media coverage alongside numerous hoaxes and prank letters and calls to the McKay home. Psychic Gerard Croiset, who was involved in a number of famous missing person cases, also became involved. Based on its notoriety, likenesses of the brothers were displayed in the Chamber of Horrors in Madame Tussauds alongside that of living murderers, Donald Neilson and Graham Young. In 2017, Kelvin MacKenzie's review of Ink, a play about the history of Murdoch's British tabloid The Sun, described the portion of the play about McKay's kidnapping as its \\"most dramatic moment\\". Jane Martinson, in her review for The Guardian, described that portion of the play as its \\"most uncomfortable moment\\". She quoted playwright James Graham on how to decide how to \\"ethically and morally report on these difficult stories\\", like McKay's kidnapping and murder.

Although signed and dated 1943, the signature and date were not added until 1947, and the work was probably completed around the fall of 1943. It was made with oil paint (and an off-white water-based paint) on linen, and is Pollock's largest canvas, measuring . The work was commissioned by Peggy Guggenheim for the long entrance hall of her townhouse at 155 East 61st Street in New York City. The work marks an important transitional moment in Pollock's artistic career, from his earlier works of surrealist abstraction towards action painting. It has been held by the University of Iowa Museum of Art since 1951. Background In 1943, Pollock had recently come to the end of a period working for the Federal Art Project, and was working at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (later the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum). The talent displayed by his small early paintings was recognized by Howard Putzel, who introduced him to Guggenheim. She was an art collector and dealer, and Pollock signed a contract with her gallery in July 1943 under which he would be paid $150 per month as a retainer, to be set against any proceeds from the sale of his artworks. Mural was Pollock's first commission. Guggenheim first considered asking for a mural to be painted on the wall, but Marcel Duchamp suggested that it should be painted on canvas so it could be moved. Guggenheim bought an oversize canvas of Belgian linen and gave it to Pollock, but otherwise gave him no direction or instructions, and Pollock was simply asked to paint whatever he wished. A wall had to be removed to allow the large canvas to be installed. The mural was intended to be completed before a planned exhibition of his works opening in November 1943, but according to Lee Krasner, he continued to stare at a blank canvas, saying he was \\"blocked\\". Eventually, it was conventionally said, around 1 January 1944, he began frenetic work, completing the entire work in one day. It appears that in reality the painting was finished earlier than that and was not done in one day. Francis O'Connor research found that Pollock sent a letter in January 1944 telling his brother, Frank, ‚ÄúI painted quite a large painting for Miss Guggenheim during the summer‚Äî8 feet x 20 feet. It was grand fun,‚Äù. Another letter from Peggy Guggenheim on 12 November 1943 to a friend, in which she describes: \\"We had a party for the new genius Jackson Pollock; who is having a show here now. He painted a 20 foot mural in my house in the entrance. Everyone likes it nearly except Kenneth [referring to another tenant]. Rather bad luck on him as he has to see it every time he goes in and out . . .\\" Investigations applied during Mural‚Äôs recent stints in the Museum of Modern Art and Getty conservation labs validate O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs documentary research, further disproving the legend through technical means. The Getty conservators conclude definitively that ‚Äúrapid work is not the case here, as there are many areas of dried oil paint evident under subsequent layers.‚Äù Scientific analyses of minute samples of paint, they explain, confirm this as well. Description Mural is a largely abstract work with the suggestion of several human figures walking, or possibly birds, or letters and numbers, in broad swirls of black and white. It combines influences from artists such as Thomas Hart Benton, Albert Pinkham Ryder and El Greco, and Mexican mural artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros. Painting technique The painting was investigated by the scientists of the Getty Museum and the University of Iowa around 2012.Getty Museum, Paint Analysis of Jackson Pollock's Mural Pollock employed cerulean blue, cadmium yellow, vermilion, and umber, with touches of phthalocyanine green and blue mixed in oil and a casein household paint.Jackson Pollock, Mural, ColourLex Most of the paint was applied with a brush, but some appears to have been splashed on. Reception The importance of Mural was recognized immediately. The art critic Clement Greenberg wrote: \\"I took one look at it and I thought, 'Now that's great art,' and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced.\\" After Guggenheim moved to Venice in 1947, she arranged with Lester Longman to donate the work to the University of Iowa. It was shipped to Iowa in 1951, where it is still held by the University of Iowa Museum of Art. Conservation The condition of the work had deteriorated by the 1970s, with the canvas sagging due to a weak stretcher and paint starting to flake off. The University of Iowa relined the painting in 1973, adding a second canvas with a wax adhesive, and also replacing the stretcher and varnishing the surface to stabilise the paint. The painting was sent to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles for 18 months from 2012 to 2014 to be fully conserved. The varnish was removed, and the stretcher was replaced again, this time with a curved stretcher that respects the sagged shape of the canvas. This conservation work revealed several layers of dried oil paints, without the distinct colours being swirled together, suggest that the work was not in fact completed in one day as had previously been thought, but rather was completed over a period of weeks, and was left to dry for several days between each session. However, the use of a quicker- drying white water-based casein house paint to add finishing touches to the upper layer suggests the painting may have been completed in hurry. Almost all of the drips of the thickly-applied paint flow in one direction, indicating that the work was mostly painted in an upright position with a brush. However, thin strands of pink indicate that some paint was applied using Pollock's famous \\"drip\\" action painting technique, in which the medium is laid horizontally on the floor. The restored painting was exhibited at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice in 2015. Its value was estimated in 2016 at around $140 million. It was exhibited at the Columbia Museum of Art in 2019, and then at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 2019-2020.

It is held by the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. The painting measures . It depicts a concert in the late 7th century BC, with the poet Alcaeus of Mytilene playing the kithara. In the audience is fellow Lesbian poet Sappho, accompanied by several of her female friends. Sappho is paying close attention to the performance, resting her arm on a cushion which bears a laurel wreath, presumably intended for the performer. The painting illustrates a passage by the poet Hermesianax, recorded by Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistae (\\"The Philosophers' Banquet\\"), book 13, page 598. The location, with tiers of white marble seating, is based on the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, but Alma-Tadema has replaced the original inscribed names of Athenians with the names of Sappho's friends. In the background, the Aegean Sea can be seen through some trees. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1881, and depicted in William Powell Frith's A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881, to the far right, being inspected by John Everett Millais.

It was one of the first Red Army mechanized divisions formed and also one of the first to be fully equipped with motor vehicles and tanks. Shortly before the German invasion, in late May, 1941, it began moving west by rail, arriving in western Ukraine on June 18. The division went into action on June 26, but by early July had lost most of its tanks and trucks. It was soon pulled back into the reserves of Southwestern Front and converted into the 304th Rifle Division.  Formation  The 109th Rifle Division had first formed on April 15, 1939, at Tatarsk in the Siberian Military District, part of the 12th Rifle Corps. Col. Nikolai Pavlovich Krasnoretskii was appointed to command on June 1, and he would hold that post through the division's existence. In January, 1940, the division began re-forming as a motorized division, in accordance with a People's Commissariat of Defense order of December 7, 1939. After conversion, its order of battle was revised to the following: * 381st Motor Rifle Regiment * 602nd Motor Rifle Regiment (from 82nd Motor Rifle Division) * 16th Tank Regiment (four tank battalions, each 52 BT tanks) * 404th Motorized Howitzer Regiment * Reconnaissance Battalion * Antitank Battalion * Antiaircraft Battalion * Sapper Battalion The 16th Tank Regiment was formed between January 29 and February 18, 1940 from the tank battalions of the 93rd, 94th, 109th, and the 152nd Rifle Division. The reorganization was completed on May 17, by which time the tank battalion of the 65th Motorized Division, whose conversion was cancelled, was added to complete the organization of the 16th Tank Regiment. By July, the division was at full strength with 275 light tanks when it was assigned to 5th Mechanized Corps. It was previously part of the 12th Rifle Corps. It was stationed at Chita until late May, 1941, when it began moving westward via the Trans-Siberian Railway.Charles C. Sharp, \\"The Deadly Beginning\\", Soviet Tank, Mechanized, Motorized Divisions and Tank Brigades of 1940 - 1942, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. I, 1995, pp. 58-59  Combat History  On June 18, advance elements of the division had reached Berdichev and Proskurov in western Ukraine and began de-training. Most of 5th Corps' other elements had been diverted to the Western Front once the invasion began, so the 109th was the only division under the Corps' command when it first went into combat at Ostrog on June 26. Due to this splitting the division fought as part of the improvised \\"Group Lukin\\" (named for the commander of 16th Army), and after July 2 under command of 5th Army, in 5th Mechanized Corps,David M.

On July 6, the 109th was equipped with 113 BT tanks, 11 BA armored cars, 285 trucks and cars, and 9 tractors. It had 2,705 officers and men on strength. On July 12 what remained was withdrawn into the reserves of Southwestern Front, and over the course of several days was converted into the 304th Rifle Division.Walter S.

He plays bluegrass and gospel music.'''  Biography  Joe Mullins was born and raised in southwestern Ohio. His father Paul \\"Moon\\" Mullins was a respected fiddler and broadcaster of a daytime bluegrass show on Classic Country Radio for more than four decades. Mullins toured and recorded as a member of the Traditional Grass, the band he founded with his father, from 1983 until 1995. The band signed to Rebel Records and recorded four albums for the label between 1992 and 1995 following four previous independent projects on cassette. In 1995, Mullins purchased WBZI Radio in Xenia, Ohio. He later purchased WKFI (Wilmington), WEDI (Eaton), FM 100.3 (Xenia / Dayton / Springfield), and FM 105.5 (Eaton / Dayton), of which he operates all as Real Roots Radio under Town and Country Broadcasting, Inc., having been renamed in March 2018 from My Classic Country. In 1995, Mullins released Just A Five String & Fiddle, an album of duets with the late fiddler Gerald Evans, with whom he'd played in Traditional Grass. In 1997, Mullins became a founding member of the band Longview, along with Dudley Connell, James King, Don Rigsby, Glen Duncan, and Marshall Wilborn. Longview earned the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Song of the Year and Recorded Event of the Year awards. In 2006, Mullins formed his band The Radio Ramblers to promote his radio stations. Members included Adam McIntosh (guitar), Evan McGregor (fiddle), Mike Terry (mandolin), and Tim Kidd (bass). The band released their first CD in 2007 called Tuned In (independent MULLINS-3272-CD) followed by their first Rebel Records release Rambler‚Äôs Call album in 2010. In 2011, Mullins released a gospel album Hymns from the Hills, with Larry Sparks, Doyle Lawson, and Rhonda Vincent guested. Playing My Song followed in 2012.

In 2015, Mullins began hosting a syndicated radio show called Front Porch Fellowship on Singing News Radio which is aired across much of the U.S. and Canada each week. Mullins released the album The Story We Tell in 2017. The Radio Ramblers included Mullins (banjo), Mike Terry (mandolin), Jason Barie (fiddle), Duane Sparks (guitar), and Randy Barnes (bass). Joe and the Radio Ramblers changed recording labels with a November 13, 2018 announcement and have released their debut album on Billy Blue Records on March 29, 2019 titled For the Record. Joe is widely considered one of the world's most accomplished five-string banjo players in the traditional bluegrass style. Although primarily a Scruggs style player, his playing is also influenced by the work of J.D. Crowe, Sonny Osborne, and Don Reno. Vocal influences are apparent from the Osborne Brothers and Paul Williams.

The team played a town team from State Center to a 6-6 tie and defeated a team representing the Des Moines YMCA by a 30-0 score.(identifying State Center as a \\"town team\\") Dr. Ira C. Brownlie was both the head coach, team captain, and played at the end position. Brownlie was credited with having \\"introduced football\\" while he was a student at the school in 1892. Brownlie later recalled: \\"There were so many strong boys around there doing nothing that I thought they could make a football team easily.\\" The only other player known to have played on the 1892 team was Charles Deering.2017 Iowa State Football Fact Book, p. 41. Between 1892 and 1913, the football team played on a field that later became the site of the university's Parks Library.

It was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and, at 2,501 yards (2,287 metres) in length, was the longest on the company's network at the time of its opening in 1878. The line through the tunnel closed in 1956. The tunnel is owned by the Department for Transport and maintained on its behalf by Highways England's Historical Railways Estate (HRE) team. Controversy has surrounded the future of the tunnel for several years. The Queensbury Tunnel Society (QTS), supported by cycling groups, environmental campaigners and two local councils, is seeking to reopen it as part of a greenway linking Bradford and Halifax. However Highways England is progressing plans to abandon the structure due to concerns over its condition; this would result in some sections being infilled. In September 2019, Queensbury Tunnel was named on The Victorian Society's list of the Top 10 Most Endangered Buildings in England and Wales for 2019.  Construction  Queensbury Tunnel was one of several major engineering feats on the Halifax, Thornton and Keighley Railway, one of the so-called Queensbury Lines. Plans for this route were placed before Parliament in 1873, with Royal Assent being granted on 5 August after several months of debate. Benton and Woodiwiss, a company with a longstanding association with the GNR, were the contractors. The southern end of the tunnel was north of . The route was of Railway No.3 to the northern portal just south of the triangular station of . Trains could diverge to either or . The Great Northern Railway appointed John Fraser as engineer whilst his son Henry acted as resident engineer. Work on the northernmost of the construction shafts got underway in May 1874. It was originally intended that eight shafts would be sunk, however their spacing was changed at an early stage, resulting in No.7 shaft not being progressed. The contract required the tunnel to be completed within two years, but this proved impossible due to significant water ingress forcing the abandonment of two other shafts, including No.5 which would have been the deepest at . In July 1877, Colonel Frederick Beaumont, chairman of the Diamond Rock Boring Company, brought a rock drilling machine to Queensbury which was used to speed up the driving of headings (pilot tunnels) from the bottom of No.4 shaft. This improved the productivity of the miners by four or five-fold and resulted in the breakthrough of a continuous heading from one end of the tunnel to the other on 2 October 1877, although there was still a need to excavate the tunnel to full size and construct the lining. Structural work on the tunnel was finished in July 1878. The last brick was inserted by the inspector, James Albrighton, who had supervised work on the tunnel from the outset. The event was marked by the flying of colours from the headgear of No.4 shaft, following which the Great Northern Railway entertained 300 of the workmen to a dinner. At least ten men died during construction of the tunnel. Miners Henry Jones, 39, and John Gough, 40, were killed when a charge exploded as they attempted to withdraw it. Of the others, Richard Sutcliffe was struck by a cage which fell down a shaft, John Swire was run over by wagons, Henry Ingham drowned at the bottom of a shaft, Sutcliffe Hodgson fell down a shaft, Richard Jones was crushed by falling rock, Llewellyn Jones was injured in an explosion and succumbed to tetanus, Frederick Goulding was crushed by a wagon, and Captain Pickles was struck on the head by a large timber.  Operational period  Railway No.3 was inspected by Major General C S Hutchinson on behalf of the Board of Trade on 11 October 1878, stating that \\"I must report that by reason of the incompleteness of the work (viz. the want of a terminal station) the Halifax, Thornton and Keighley Railway and its westerly fork cannot be opened for passenger traffic without danger to the public\\". Goods trains started to use the line almost immediately, but passenger services were not introduced until 1 December 1879. In 1882, defects were found in the arch and sidewalls at several locations through the tunnel, caused by poor workmanship and the effects of adjacent mine workings. This resulted in the imposition of single- line working for the first nine months of 1883 whilst repairs were carried out. Subsidence and water ingress continued to have an impact during the tunnel's operational period, prompting an extensive programme of patch repairs to the arch in the 1920s and the relining of No.3 shaft in 1934.Construction drawings held in the archive of Network Rail. In April 1906, foreman ganger Sam Hirst was knocked down by a train in the tunnel and lost one of his feet. On the night of 24 March 1944, fireman Henry Kilner looked out of the cab as his train approached the tunnel, resulting in him striking his head on the brickwork. He sustained lacerations and concussion. Although passenger revenue declined due to tram and bus competition, freight traffic remained relatively buoyant until the 1940s. However, the high cost of maintenance, in part due to Queensbury Tunnel, made the line a prime candidate for closure as part of post-war economy measures. With passenger services already withdrawn, the section of line from Holmfield to Queensbury West closed on 28 May 1956. Track lifting through the tunnel took place in 1963. The short remaining section of the tunnel's southern approach cutting during a period of flood.  After closure  In July 1969, an early prototype of an invar wire strainmeter was installed in Queensbury Tunnel as part of research by a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge into Earth strain. Following the project's conclusion, the facility was retained and expanded. Recording equipment was housed in a hut close to No.4 shaft. The facility was closed in November 1979. In 1991, scientists from British Rail's Research Centre carried out experiments into the effectiveness of new waterproof grout which was injected through the lining at locations close to the northernmost shaft. Queensbury Tunnel is built on a gradient of 1 in 100 (1%), falling to the south. Due to the amount of water entering the tunnel and the infilling of its southern approach cutting, severe flooding has affected it since the 1980s. During periods of heavy rain, the floodwater has reached a depth of approximately at the south portal, extending into the tunnel by half its length.One of two partial collapses to the south of No.4 shaft. Withdrawal of its maintenance regime after closure prompted a considerable deterioration in the tunnel's condition. In 2013‚Äì2014, two partial collapses occurred to the south of its midpoint. A number of severe bulges have also been recorded, as well as deep, longitudinal spalling to the south of No.4 shaft. Without intervention, engineers assert that this section is likely to suffer further collapses in years to come. The Institution of Civil Engineers listed Queensbury Tunnel as a Historical Engineering Work in June 2016 and it was listed on The Victorian Society's Top 10 Most Endangered Buildings in September 2019.  Abandonment  Plans for the formal abandonment of Queensbury Tunnel were included in a report developed by Jacobs, an engineering consultancy, for BRB (Residuary) Ltd in October 2009. It recommended that the tunnel should be infilled from both entrances for a distance of , substructure plugs placed beneath the five completed ventilation shafts, and all seven shafts backfilled and capped. Jacobs estimated the cost of this work would be ¬£5.125 million. A programme of remedial works to permit safe entry was costed at ¬£1.975 million. Jacobs submitted a second study ‚Äì the Queensbury Tunnel Options Report ‚Äì to Highways England's Historical Railways Estate team in February 2016. This was not progressed beyond the draft stage; however, HRE decided to move forward with two of the abandonment options outlined in it. The first required the tunnel to be infilled from both entrances for a distance of ; the second involved backfilling the seven shafts. In July 2018, the Queensbury Tunnel Society ‚Äì which is campaigning for the tunnel to be reopened as part of a cycle path ‚Äì published a report claiming the structure was \\"generally stable\\". In an accompanying media statement, it said \\"the condition of Queensbury Tunnel presents no short-term threat to the people of Queensbury ‚Äì contrary to the claims last week from Highways England ‚Äì so those trying hard to secure a positive outcome should be allowed the time they need to undertake a full and thorough assessment of the cycle network proposal.\\" A contract for the tunnel's abandonment was awarded to AMCO-Giffen in August 2018 at a cost of ¬£3.57 million , comprising ¬£550,000 for preparatory works ‚Äì which involved strengthening the lining below the shafts ‚Äì and ¬£3.02 million for the main phase. In October 2018, Bradford Council informed Highways England that its planning application for the abandonment works would have to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment as a result of concerns that the scheme was likely to have significant effects on the environment. The preparatory works got underway at the same time but their scope had to be broadened in November 2018 due to the tunnel's southern entrance being inaccessible because of flooding. The ¬£50 annual rent had not been paid on a pumping station, resulting in it being shut down. Highways England denied that it was responsible for paying the ¬£50, but campaigners pointed out that Clause 5.4 of its Protocol Agreement with the Department for Transport included \\"meeting from existing funding all costs associated with the property\\" and that Schedule 6 Clause 6 of an associated lease required the rent to the paid \\"whether formally demanded or not\\". The additional works included the establishment of a temporary pumping system and strengthening to a long section of tunnel which had previously been designated as an exclusion zone. By the end of September, around 80% of the floodwater ‚Äì estimated at 8.2 million gallons ‚Äì had been removed; however, over the following week, the southern half of the tunnel was again inundated due to a prolonged period of heavy rain. In response, AMCO-Giffen demobilised most of their equipment from the tunnel and the preparatory works were suspended. The infilling of No.2 Shaft. In October 2019, No.2 shaft, from the south end of the tunnel, was infilled under emergency powers after concerns were raised about a failing refuge close to the base of the shaft. A spokesman for Highways England said they had \\"no option other than to complete this work immediately to ensure both the safety of those communities living close by and the workforce who need to maintain it.\\" However, the action was condemned by campaigners who claimed that \\"Both the shaft and the supporting tunnel lining are in generally fair condition. Even if the defective area did fail, there‚Äôs no plausible mechanism whereby any effect could be felt at ground level. Load paths from the shaft would redistribute through unaffected parts of the tunnel lining and, more importantly, the shaft lining itself was built in two separate sections, with the upper portion independently supported on a rock ledge 39 metres below ground level\\". The leader of Bradford Council wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport to request an immediate halt to the infilling but the work was completed on 28 October at a cost of ¬£119,000. On 3 December, Bradford Council, as the Local Planning Authority, wrote to Jacobs, Highways England's agent, to assert that \\"the LPA do not accept that the recent works to Shaft 2 do not require planning permission\\" and that \\"the Council's Legal Team will be writing to you separately on this matter.\\" The overall cost of the preparatory works had risen to ¬£3.44 million by the end of November 2019. Highways England submitted a full planning application for the abandonment of Queensbury Tunnel in May 2019. The Queensbury Tunnel Society sought public objections against the plans on both technical and planning policy grounds. By 3 March 2020, more than 6,335 objections had been received. On the same day, Grant Shapps MP, the Secretary of State for Transport, told the Telegraph & Argus newspaper that \\"Queensbury Tunnel, I‚Äôve taken a specific personal interest in it. The plan and official advice was to fill it in but I have specifically prevented that from happening to work with local leaders and the Combined Authority to come up with a better solution.\\" He raised the possibility of the tunnel being used either for a cycle route or as part of a local tram/light rail network.  Cycle path proposal  A computer-generated image showing the tunnel after the repair scheme proposed by the Queensbury Tunnel Society. In 2014, a local heritage group proposed that Queensbury Tunnel should be repaired and reopened as part of the Great Northern Railway Trail, as one element of a vision to revitalise the fortunes of Queensbury village. Robert Goodwill MP, who at the time was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, visited the tunnel on 23 June 2014 to hear from the group . He subsequently asked HRE to develop a costing for the tunnel's repair and this was undertaken by Jacobs as part of its Options Report. The work took the form of a high-level desk study and resulted in an estimated cost of ¬£35.4 million being put before the Minister in March 2016. He ruled this out as too expensive, resulting in HRE making progress with its abandonment plans . The heritage group sought the help of a tunnel engineer and civil engineering contractor to develop its own repair scheme in summer 2016. Costed at ¬£2.8 million, this was published in October 2016 under the banner of the Queensbury Tunnel Society. A study by Sustrans, published in August 2017 , indicated that a network of paths linking Bradford and Keighley to Halifax via the tunnel would drive a 50% increase in the Annual Usage Estimate for commuting and leisure trips on foot or bike through these corridors, from 425,256 to 638,429. It found that ¬£26.8 million of environmental, health and transport benefits could be generated over 30 years, together with ¬£10.8 million in tourism benefits, much of which would be directly attributable to the tunnel's inclusion. Uncertainty over the likely construction cost resulted in the associated Benefit to Cost Ratio having a wide range from 1.4:1 (Low value-for-money) to 3.2:1 (High value for money). In September 2017, it was announced that HRE had agreed to fund independent investigations by Bradford Council into the condition of the tunnel, repair options and associated costs. This work was completed in October 2018 and the consultants, AECOM, proposed a programme of remediation costing ¬£6.9 million. However this was not without risk as sections of the tunnel could not be surveyed due to HRE exclusion zones and other on-site factors. At a meeting on 5 February 2019, Bradford Council's Executive Committee voted to endorse the reopening of Queensbury Tunnel as part of a new cycle route connecting Bradford with Halifax. However its backing was subject to funds being secured for construction of the whole scheme, estimated at ¬£16.3 million (plus an additional ¬£7 million for 30 years of maintenance) . In a media statement, the Council said ‚ÄúThe authority will continue to lobby HRE and the Department of Transport to delay closing the tunnel while it searches for the required funding. However, the AECOM study shows that the tunnel is in an active state of collapse so time is limited.\\" The Council published an 'Advocacy Document' to support funding applications on 28 June 2019 , naming the proposed cycle path as the Bradford-Halifax Greenway or CityConnect 3, the latter reflecting its perceived strategic value in extending the existing CityConnect 1 (Seacroft/Leeds-Bradford) and CityConnect 2 (Shipley-Bradford) routes into Calderdale. By including Queensbury Tunnel, the document states that the route would deliver \\"a high value Benefit to Cost Ratio of 2.31:1 when taking into account the significant tourism benefits of a greenway connecting two major urban centres to the heart of some of Yorkshire‚Äôs finest countryside.\\" In November 2019, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority submitted a bid to the Government's Transforming Cities Fund which included a request for ¬£23 million to turn Queensbury Tunnel into a \\"high quality cycling route\\" linking Calderdale and Bradford, describing the project as a \\"significant opportunity\\" . In June 2020, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps offered Bradford Council ¬£4 million towards the tunnel's repair in return for taking on its ownership. They were told this was a \\"best and final\\" offer and they had four days to accept it. Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe described the sum as \\"derisory\\" and \\"nowhere near enough to save the tunnel\\". The Council subsequently published a new Benefit:Cost Ratio for the proposed Bradford-Halifax Greenway via Queensbury Tunnel, concluding that it would return ¬£5.60 in social and economic benefits for every ¬£1 invested, representing very high value for money. QTS wrote to Mr Shapps and urged him to \\"stand by your previous statements and allocate a sufficient sum from your ¬£2 billion active travel fund to give Bradford Council the confidence to take on the tunnel‚Äôs ownership and construct a cycle route through it.\\"  References   External links  * History of the tunnel from Forgotten Relics * Queensbury Tunnel Society Buildings and structures in Halifax, West Yorkshire Railway tunnels in England Rail transport in West Yorkshire Tunnels completed in 1878 Tunnels in West Yorkshire ","title":"Queensbury Tunnel"},{"id":"55337239","text":"The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) is a United States federal advisory panel within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It coordinates all efforts within HHS concerning autism spectrum disorder. The IACC was established in 2000, and was reauthorized and chartered as a federal advisory committee since 2006. It is subject to periodic reauthorization. Mission The IACC's primary objective is to monitor autism research and associated services and support activities throughout all federal departments and agencies, ensuring that efforts are not duplicative and that they benefit from cross-collaborative opportunities. The IACC advises the Secretary of HHS of advances in autism spectrum disorder research related to causes, prevention, treatment, early screening, diagnosis or ruling out a diagnosis; interventions, and access to services and supports for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Additional functions of the IACC are to increase public understanding of member agencies' activities and research, and to act as a public forum to discuss autism spectrum disorder-related matters. An annual update summarizing advances is submitted to Congress and the President. The annual update has been published online every year since 2007. The IACC report of 2016 activities was released in April 2017. GAO recommendations The IACC Strategic Plan is released periodically, with the newest update since 2013 expected in the fall of 2017. A November 2013 study of federal autism activities by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that better data and more coordination was needed, with specific recommendations for IACC, including annual updates of the IACC strategic plan. Samantha Crane, an IACC board member, confirmed that none of the eight objectives that the IACC identified for research on autistic adult issues were fulfilled in 2013. In 2017, the GAO noted that the IACC has not collaborated with agencies outside the Department of Health and Human Services to support research for transition-age youth with ASD. They stated \\"As a result, IACC may continue to miss opportunities to leverage the knowledge of other agencies.\\" Membership and administration The Committee includes both federal and public members. Federal officials are selected from government agencies that work on autism related issues. Public members include advocates, community providers, and researchers. There are 31 IACC members, three of whom are autistic. IACC activities and associated cross-agency programs, policies and research are coordinated and managed by the Office of Autism Research Coordination (OARC). Jonathan Mitchell, an autistic advocate, has criticized the IACC's nomination process by claiming that it is too biased towards neurodiversity. He points out that seven pro-neurodiversity, anti-cure autistics were appointed. Two anti-neurodiversity pro-cure autistics were nominated but turned down. Jonathan Rose, a history professor at Drew University, agreed with his commentary that neurodiversity viewpoints are over-represented at the IACC.

The Triyampawai Ceremony ( ), the Hindu ritual celebrated currently in Bangkok Devasathan temple, was one of the 12 months' royal ceremonies of Thailand which is identified with Tamil Thiruvempavai of Tamils.  History  It is believed that Thiruvembavai was introduced to Thailand by Tamil brahmins who immigrated to then Siam in 14th century CE..Rajanupab Prince Damrong (1982) \\"Praraja Kranya Nusorn and Nung Nobpamass\\" p.316 Muang Boran journal, Vol 05, (1977) p.95 Available historical evidences confirm that the ritual of Thiruvembavai has been observed at Ayutthaya, Sukhothai and Sawankhalok, the ancient capitals of Thailand. Tanistha Dansilp, Michael Freeman (2002) \\"Things Thai\\" p.17 Initially it was observed as a penance and fasting at Sawankhalok and Phitsanulok and later it got royal patronage and became one of the 12 royal ceremonies combined with the swing ceremony.  Rituals  The Giant Swing of Thailand associated with the then royal ceremony of Triyamphway. Triyamphway was celebrated to praise the Hindu god Lord Siwa who was believed to come visit Thailand at the end of every Thai year.Pranee Liamputtong (2014) \\"Contemporary Socio-Cultural and Political Perspectives in Thailand\\" P.43 He was offered with rice, fruits and vegetables. Great Swing ceremony was celebrated to make him happy at the well known Sao Chingcha. So many Thai folklores interpret the connection between Siwa and Swing with interesting explanations. After ten days, it was believed that the companion of Lord Siwa, Lord Narai visits and blesses Thailand for five days.Suwit, Thongsrigeat (1981) \\"Kansuksa Vikraw Itiphon Khong Sasanaphram Time to Pruttikam Tang Sasanaput Naichangvat Nakornrajasrima\\" pp.58-64 Triyamphway mantra, actually Tamil Thiruvempavai stanzas of Saint Manikkavasagar was recited in these days. The first 11 stanzas recited in front of Siwa are known as \\"\\"Pothmurai yay\\" while the other 9 stanzas recited in front of Narai are known as \\"Pothmurai clang\\". The two main deities of Saivism and Vaishnavism are praised by single Thiruvembavai of Manikkavasagar, which is a saivite literature.Pannipa Kaveetanathum, (1995) \\"A comparative study of Tiruvempavai: Tradition in Thailand and Tamil Nadu in Historical and musical contexts\\" pp. 66  Swing ceremony  Swing ceremony was grandly celebrated in Thailand until the reign of King Rama VII. After that it was cancelled due to reasons such as the break down in the Swing, injuries at Swing ceremony and the unbearable great cost to Thai government following World War II. Abandoned Great swing still can be seen in front of Wat Suthat of Phra Nakhon, Bangkok. Present day, Triyamphway is celebrated indoors in Dewasathan temple of Bangkok.

History Parabon NanoLabs, a subsidiary of Parabon Computation, a computing software provider, was founded in 2008 by Steven Armentrout, Michael Norton and Christopher Dwyer. In 2018 Armentrout was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Parabon Computation. Parabon NanoLabs has developed oncology therapeutics and synthetic vaccines using nanotechnology and DNA phenotyping. Products  inSƒìquio Design Studio  Together with the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, the United States Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation as part of a project in the Federal Small Business Innovation Research program, Parabon developed a computer aided design software called inSƒìquio Design Studio for nanoengineering DNA constructs. This software was used to design and develop synthetic vaccines. Snapshot Snapshot DNA Phenotyping Service is the name of a DNA phenotyping tool developed by Parabon NanoLabs which creates composite face imaging sketches based on DNA samples. The algorithms used to make the composites are not open source, however, which has attracted criticism from members of the scientific community. Moses Schanfield, professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University, criticized the lack of any peer review, noting that there is no publicly available performance record for the product. In a 2016 article the American Civil Liberties Union recommended only using genetic phenotyping \\"...where the link between genes and external characteristics is based on well-proven, peer- reviewed, widely accepted science, such as is apparently now the case with hair and eye color.\\" Skin color predictions have been reported to be somewhat reliable but not predictions of the shape of the face. North Carolina detectives felt Parabon's Snapshot DNA Phenotyping Service had been helpful in identifying Jose Alvarez, Jr. in 2015 as the killer of Troy and LaDonna French in 2012. Privacy restrictions in 2019 on the use of GEDmatch for genetic genealogy may make DNA phenotyping more common. Illumina, Inc. and Identitas AG are reported to offer similar DNA phenotyping services. The United States Department of Defense provided approximately $2,000,000 in development financing for Snapshot. Keystone Parabon NanoLabs was awarded a two-year contract by the United States Department of Defense to develop a software platform dubbed 'Keystone' for the forensic analysis of DNA evidence. Genetic genealogy =Parabon's Genetic Genealogy Unit= In May 2018 Parabon NanoLabs appointed genealogist CeCe Moore as head of their genetic genealogy unit with three genealogists working for her. In cooperation with American law enforcement, Parabon uploaded DNA evidence from crime scenes to GEDmatch in an attempt to identify perpetrators. In November 2018 Parabon said they were working on 200 cases, 55% had produced leads and in May 2019 they said were solving cold cases at the rate of one a week. In May 2019, GEDmatch required people who had uploaded their DNA to its site to specifically opt in to allow law enforcement agencies to access their information. This change in privacy policy was forecast to make it much more difficult in the future for Law enforcement agencies and Parabon to identify suspects and solve cold cases using genetic genealogy. According to an article published by Los Angeles Times in November 2019, \\"[CeCe] Moore said Parabon has opened about 300 DNA searches and that the lab has solved almost 100 cases ‚Äî though arrests have not yet been made in several dozen of those cases.\\" In May 2020 it was reported that Parabon had participated in nearly 500 cases with 109 suspect positive identifications. In December 2019, it was announced that GEDmatch was sold to forensic, for-profit, DNA analysis company Verogen, whose CEO Brett Williams vowed to make the database safer for its customers, including fighting search warrants. In a May 2020 interview with Scott Fisher of the podcast Extreme Genes, CeCe Moore revealed that in her capacity as the genetic genealogy lead, she no longer uses GEDmatch exclusively because of the decline of profiles available to law enforcement. Moore stated, \\"So, it would be better obviously, if we still had access to the full [GEDmatch] database, that million plus profiles, but it hasn‚Äôt stopped us. Also, we are using Family Tree DNA more and more all the time. Parabon is not able to upload directly but the agencies we work with can get the raw data from us and upload it to Family Tree DNA and then come back with that login information for us. So, we‚Äôre also helping to solve some cases with Family Tree DNA matches now. And as you know, theirs is the opt-out situation where you‚Äôre automatically opted in if you‚Äôre a US customer, unless you choose to opt out.\\" This restricted direct-access limitation may be due to the fact that FamilyTreeDNA has their own genetic genealogy consultant, Barbara Rae-Venter, who solved the Golden State Killer cold case in May 2018. On 26 May 2020, the ABC television network premiered The Genetic Detective, featuring Parabon's CeCe Moore, Steven Armentrout, Ph.D., and Ellen McRae Greytak, Ph.D. The hour-long episodes feature cases that Moore's genetic genealogy team has worked on since she started with Parabon. =Case Results: To Trial= The following cases include suspects who were identified and then arrested for the indicated offenses.

William Earl Talbott II  Murder of Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook  Snohomish County, Washington, USA  1987-11-18  2018-05-17  Was found guilty of two counts of aggregated first-degree murder on June 28, 2019. On July 24, 2019, Talbott was sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. This case was the first in which CeCe Moore provided a suspect's name based on extensive genetic genealogical research. It is also the first conviction in which genetic genealogy played an integral part. CeCe Moore was interviewed (audio recording) about this case and the future of genetic genealogy considering the new restrictions that have come as a result of privacy concerns. - !  Gary Charles Hartman  Rape and murder of 12-year-old Michella Welch  Tacoma, Washington, USA  1986-03-26  2018-06-20  Hartman and a brother were first identified as persons of interest, but Hartman was ultimately identified using DNA from a discarded napkin. In 2019 Washington state passed \\"Jennifer and Michella's law\\" named after Michella Welch and Jennifer Bastian (a 13-year-old girl also murdered in 1986). This law allowed police more latitude in taking DNA samples from convicted sex offenders. - !  Matthew Norman Dusseault and Tyler Grenon  Stabbing death of 81-year-old Constance Gauthier  Woonsocket, Rhode Island, USA  2016-03-23  2018-07-18  Dusseault's DNA matched the crime scene DNA and when interviewed by police, he implicated Grenon. Both men have been charged with murder and conspiracy and are being held without bail. - !  Darold Wayne Bowden  Serial rapes as the \\"Ramsey Street Rapist\\"  Fayetteville, North Carolina, USA  2006-08-23  2018-08-18  August 23, 2006, is the date of the first offense of record. Multiple rapes attributed to the \\"Ramsey Street Rapist\\" occurred into 2018. - !  Michael F. A. Henslick  Fatal stabbing and sexual assault of 22-year-old Holly Cassano  Champaign, Illinois, USA  2009-11-02  2018-08-28  Although a convicted felon, Henslick had managed to avoid DNA testing. A discarded cigarette butt was used to connect him with the Cassano murder after genetic genealogy identified him as a person of interest. At the time of the murder Henslick lived a few blocks away from Cassano in a mobile home park. Police said he admitted to Cassano's murder when arrested but Henslick pleaded not guilty at his trial. Henslick was convicted in February 2020 and sentenced the following June to life in prison without parole. Because he had continued to evade court-ordered collection of his DNA to be placed in CODIS with past convictions, a serious look at collection enforcement in felony cases has been proposed by Cassano's mother, who wants federal law to be changed so that DNA is taken immediately in the courtroom at the time of conviction. - !  Marlon Michael Alexander  Serial rapes  Montgomery County, Maryland, USA  2007-08-11  2018-09-13  August 11, 2007, is the date of the first offense of this serial rapist, who was active into 2011.. - !

Zachary Bunney  Murder of 47-year-old Scott Martinez  La Mesa, California, USA  2006-06-17  2019-01-10  Martinez was stabbed several times with a sword in his home. The suspect left two blood stains, most likely the result of cutting himself while killing Martinez. Police traveled to Oregon to obtain an oral swab of Bunney's DNA, which proved to be a match to the crime-scene DNA. - !  Russell Guerrero  Murder of 30-year-old Jack Upton  Fremont, California, USA  1990-12-17  2019-01-22  The warrant for Guerrero's arrest was made January 17, 2019, but he was living in Arizona at the time.

Terrence Miller  Rape and murder of 20-year-old Jody Loomis  Snohomish County, Washington, USA  1972-08-23  2019-04-10  This is the second arrest that Snohomish County has made as a result of their working with Parabon (the first was of William Earl Talbott II). Police were given a list of six brothers as a result of investigative genetic genealogy, but focused on Miller because he had been accused of several sex crimes as early as the 1960s and because he lived near Loomis at the time of her murder. Miller's DNA was obtained from a discarded coffee cup and matched with the DNA from semen found on Loomis hiking boot. Described as a \\"real predator,\\" Miller, 77 at the time of his arrest, has plead \\"not guilty.\\" - !  Johnnie B. Green, Jr.  Multiple rapes, kidnappings, robberies  Fayetteville, North Carolina, USA  2009 - 2010  2019-05-07  Green is linked to multiple cold-case rapes and is currently charged with seven counts of first-degree burglary, two counts of felonious breaking and entering, 14 counts of second-degree rape, 21 counts of second-degree sex offense, five counts of first-degree kidnapping, and seven counts of common law robbery. - !

This was the first genetic genealogy case that resulted in an exoneration. In May 2019, Dripps was identified as the prime suspect. When faced with the DNA evidence, Dripps admitted to her rape and murder, stating that he had intended to rape her, but her killing was \\"an accident.\\" In 1996, Dripps lived across the street from Dodge and was even interviewed by the police shortly after her death. On August 23, 2019, Dripps was formally charged with rape and first- degree murder and on September 9, 2019, he pleaded not guilty to both charges. - !  Richard E. Knapp  Rape and murder of 26-year-old mother Audrey Hoellein Frasier  Vancouver, Washington, USA  1994-07-17  2019-05-28  Knapp, who had a criminal record, was living in Oregon at the time of his arrest. A discarded cigarette butt was used to identify him as the primary suspect. - !  Ivan Keith  Multiple rapes  Massachusetts, USA  1990s  2019-08-02  Keith, who had a history of sexual offences, was living in Seal Cove, Maine at the time of his arrest. A discarded vaping pipe was used to identify him as the primary suspect. He was charged with five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, two counts of kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon, two counts of threats to commit bodily harm, breaking and entering into a building in the night with intent to commit a felony, perjury, making false statements, and failure to register as a sex offender. - !  Donald McQuade  Murder of 16-year-old Shelley Connolly  Anchorage, Alaska, USA  1978  2019-09-04  McQuade was arrested in Gresham, Oregon and charged with first and second- degree murder of Shelley Connolly. Connolly had been beaten, raped, dragged by a moving car and thrown over an embankment where she froze to death in the cold of the Alaskan winter. Parabon narrowed down suspects to three brothers using genetic genealogy and DNA taken from under Connolly's nails and on her body. Police found that one, Donald McQuade, had been living in Alaska at the time and obtained an exact DNA match with discarded cigarette butts. - !  Robert Hayes  First-Degree Murder of Rachel Bey, Laquetta Gunther, Julie Green, and Iwana Patton  Palm Beach, Florida, USA and Daytona Beach, Florida, USA  2005-12 - 2006-02  2019-09-15  DNA from Bey's murder scene (Palm Beach) matched DNA form a cigarette that Hayes had discarded. Initially charged for the first-degree murder of Bey, police have since tied Hayes to three additional murders (Daytona Beach) through DNA and forensic evidence. Hayes faces the death penalty for the four first-degree murder charges. There is also the possibility of additional charges as an alleged survivor has come forward. - !  Jeffrey King  Rape of a 22-year-old female  Newark, Delaware, USA  1993-08-04  2019-10-03  Parabon produced both trait predictions and leads derived from genetic genealogy for the Newark Police Department to use to focus their investigation. King, a 54-year-old man from Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was 28 at the time of the crime. This case is the result of an initiative to test previously untested sexual assault kits in Delaware. - !  Giles Daniel Warrick  Rape and murder of 28-year-old Christine Mirzayan; several other rapes as the \\"Potomac River Rapist\\"  Washington, D.C.  1998-08-01  2019-11-13  Attacks of the \\"Potomac River Rapist\\" began May 6, 1991, and possibly ended when Mirzayan was murdered in 1998. The area covered included Washington, D.C. and Montgomery County, Maryland, USA, with these crimes being connected by common DNA at all the scenes. Warrick was arrested in South Carolina and brought to Washington, D.C., where he has been formally charged with first-degree murder of Mirzayan in D.C. and with six rapes in Montgomery County. He was not granted bail. - !  James Curtis Clanton, formerly known as Curtis Allen White  Murder of 21-year-old Helene Pruszynski  Douglas County, Colorado, USA  1980-01-16  2019-12  At the time of Pruszynski's murder, Clanton was on parole for rape in Arkansas after serving about four years. His DNA was not in CODIS, however. Charges include felony murder predicated on an underlying crime of robbery and felony murder predicated on an underlying crime of sexual assault. Clanton was positively identified after genetic genealogy led police to him. They put him under surveillance and were successful in obtaining a beer mug that Clanton had used at a bar. Police are investigating if Clanton was responsible for other sexual assaults in the area at the time of Pruszynski's murder. In February 2020, Clanton pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. - !  Joseph Mills  Murder and sexual assault of 31-year-old mother Linda Patterson Slaten  Lakeland, Florida, USA  1981-09-03  2019-12-12  Slaten's young sons were asleep when their mother was assaulted and murdered. Genetic genealogy led to Mills as the most likely suspect. Police matched Mills's DNA from his trash to the DNA from the sexual assault. - !  William Blankenship  Rape of at least three victims (two were children)  Cincinnati, Ohio, USA  1999 and 2001  2020-02-11  Blankenship was indicted on three counts of rape, two of which were against young girls aged 10 and 15. Police in Hamilton County are actively investigating the possibility that Blankenship has committed similar crimes in the area, including in Kansas. - !  Jonathan Hurst  Murder of Patricia Wilson, 85, and her son Robert Wilson, 64  Sycamore, Illinois, USA  2016-08  2020-02-24  Since there is no known link between Hurst and the Wilson family, police have theorized that Hurst acted in a \\"random act of violence.\\" Hurst is awaiting extradition from Cincinnati, Ohio to Illinois to face two counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, Hurst faces the mandatory sentence of life in prison. - !  Joseph Jones  Murder of 52-year- old Robert Romero  Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA  2018-07-30  2020-05-14  Jones had been released four days before Romero's murder after serving 18 months of supervised probation for a fourth-degree felony (receiving stolen goods). Police can make no personal link between Jones and Romero, making this a crime of opportunity. This is the first case that Parabon solved in New Mexico. DNA at the crime scene came from a pair of glasses and a flashlight and was compared to three persons of interest identified by Parabon. It was Jones's DNA that matched the DNA found at the crime scene. The execution of a search warrant for Jones's apartment revealed a handgun that may have been used to commit the crime. - !  Leroy Jamal Smith  Serial rape (at least five cases)  Muskogee County, Oklahoma, USA  1993-1995  2020-06-09  Five cases have been positively linked to Smith, and Muskogee Police were asking for any other assault victims to come forward to determine if Smith was their assailant. However, according to a news article on the Tulsa World website, \\"U.S. District Judge Ronald White on Thursday [27 August 2020] ordered Smith released from incarceration because the alleged crimes fall outside the established federal statute of limitations.\\" Also according to the article, U.S. prosecutors have filed an emergency order to get Smith back in custody to await trial because the judgment \\"wrongly denied the parties a hearing to argue over the defense motion to dismiss.\\" - !  Alan Edward Dean  Sexual assault and murder of 15-year-old Melissa Lee  Snohomish County, Washington, USA  1993-04-14  2020-07-29  Dean's arrest is the third made by Snohomish County law enforcement as a result of working with Parabon (the first arrest made was that of William Earl Talbott II; the second, of Terrence Miller). The arrest of Dean was \\"uneventful,\\" his DNA from a discarded cigarette matching the crime scene's DNA recovered from Lee's clothing. Dean reportedly knew Lee through a telephone \\"date line\\" and had been interviewed by police soon after her death. When Moore included Dean on her list of persons of interest, police quickly began surveillance because his name was in the case files. Dean has a previous arrest record that includes \\"marijuana possession, domestic violence assault, resisting arrest, failing to obey an officer and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\\" His bail has been set at $2 million. - !  Michael Allan Carbo, Jr.  Sexual assault and murder of 52-year-old mother Nancy Daugherty  Chisholm, Minnesota, USA  1986-07-16  2020-07-29  In what Chisholm investigators believe is the first case in Minnesota in which a suspect has been identified through investigative genetic genealogy, Carbo was arrested the same day as a direct DNA sample tested positive as a match to the DNA left from the sexual assault kit and from Daughterty's fingernail clippings. Carbo went to school with Daugherty's children and was never on the suspect list during the 1986 investigation. Carbo, who still lived in Chisholm, has been charged with second-degree murder and his bail has been set at $1 million. - !  Stephen Ray Hessler  Serial Home Invasion and Sexual Assault  Greensburg, Indiana, USA  1982-1985  2020-08-17  Hessler is a convicted felon, having served time in the 1990s for a similar crime. He faces 24 felony charges for home invasion and sexual assault of 10 victims. After Parabon provided Hessler as a person of interest as a result of investigative genetic genealogy, authorities positively identified him through a DNA sample obtained from an envelope that contained his payment for his Greensburg utility bill. He is being held in the Shelby County jail on a $20 million bond. } =Case Results: Confessions= In the following cases, the suspect arrested for the offense subsequently confessed and was sentenced without going to trial. { class=\\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"margin: 1ex auto 1ex auto\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 15%;\\"  Confessor ! class=\\"unsortable\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 15%;\\"  Offense(s) and Victim(s) ! class=\\"unsortable\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 15%;\\"  Location of Offense(s) ! class=\\"sortable\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 9%;\\"  Offense Date(s) ! class=\\"sortable\\"  Arrested ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Sentencing - !

Unidentified 17-year-old Juvenile Offender  Aggravated assault of 71-year-old organist Margaret Orlando  Salt Lake City, Utah, USA  2018-11-17  2019-04-24 (announced)  This was the first use of GEDMatch for a crime other than rape or murder and was CeCe Moore's first active case. This case also brought on the change in GEDMatch's Terms of Service, expanding the crimes for which the database could be used by law enforcement. GEDMatch removed all profiles from law enforcement's access and introduced the requirement for members to \\"opt- in\\" to allow law enforcement's access. The juvenile offender confessed and was sent to youth lockup. Ms. Orlando forgave him at his sentencing for aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. - !  Marquise D. Dozier  Multiple rapes  Allen County, Indiana, USA  2015 - 2017  2019-03  Dozier pleaded guilty to three counts of rape as part of a plea agreement.

Jeffrey Lynn Hand  Murder of Pamela Milam  Terre Haute, Indiana, USA  1972-09-16  1978-01-24  The announcement of Hand's identification, confirmed through the DNA testing of his two sons, was made in May 2019. He had a long criminal history, including homicide, stalking, and kidnapping. He was killed by police during a botched kidnapping. - !  Frank Edward Wypych  Murder and sexual assault of Susan Galvin  Seattle, Washington, USA  1967-07-10  1987-04-07  Wypych's body was exhumed and his DNA extracted to verify the identification, which was announced on May 7, 2019. This was the oldest cold case (51.6 years) to be solved using genetic genealogy to-date. - !  Jake Edward Brown  Rape and murder of 11-year-old Terri Lynn Hollis  Ventura County, California, USA  1972-11-23  2003-05-27  On Wednesday, September 11, 2019, Jake Edward Brown was identified as the primary suspect in the rape and murder of Terri Lynn Hollis on Thanksgiving Day in 1972. Brown's body was exhumed and DNA was extracted from his bones. It was \\"a 1 in 20 septillion match.\\" Police are using the DNA profile to determine if Brown was involved in other unsolved crimes. - !  Curtis Edward Blair  Brutal stabbing murder of 15-year-old Reesa Trexler  Salisbury, North Carolina, USA  1985-06-15  2004-08-06  Salisbury Police held a press conference on Tuesday, December 3, 2019, to announce that they have reached a conclusion on the brutal stabbing murder of teen Reesa Trexler. DNA collected from semen left in Trexler's body was analyzed by Parabon to produce both an ethnicity profile as well as a family tree through genetic genealogy. After the suspect was identified, Curtis's body was exhumed to obtain his DNA in order to confirm the identification. Curtis, who was in his 40s at the time of the crime has a criminal record. They declared the case \\"solved and now closed\\" and fully exonerated her sister, Jodi Trexler Laird, who had long been suspected of her sister's murder. - !  James Francis McNichols  Rape and murder of 11-year-old Julie Fuller  Fort Worth, Texas, USA  1983-06-27  2004-01-28  In early December 2019, Fort Worth police announced that they had positively identified McNichols as the man who raped and murdered Julie Fuller as she was taking out the trash at the Kensington Motor Lodge and Apartments. This was the first case in which Fort Worth police used genetic genealogy and they are reviewing other cases in which DNA evidence could be analyzed in the same manner to identify the offenders. - !  Clifton Hudspeth  Murder of 16-year-old cousins Jeffrey Flores Atup and Mary Jane Malatag  Milpitas, California, USA  1982-12-20  1999-10-07  Hudspeth had a history of criminal activity, including bank robberies, sexual assaults and at least one attempted homicide. He was identified by CeCe Moore and his body was exhumed to confirm the identification. Police are asking for help from the public to determine if Hudspeth is responsible for other offenses in Arkansas and San Diego, California, places where he had been known to live. - !  Bruce Lindahl  Sexual assault and murder of 16-year-old Pamela Maurer  DuPage County, Illinois, USA  1976-01-12  1981-04-04  It was announced during a press conference on January 13, 2020, that the late Bruce Lindahl was identified as the murderer of high school student Pamela Maurer. Lindahl died from \\"apparent accidental, self-inflicted injuries he sustained in the 1981 stabbing murder of Charles Huber, 18, of Naperville.\\" His body was exhumed to make the positive identification. Investigators have \\"evidence possibly connecting Lindahl to crimes against other women between approximately 1974 and the time of his death in April of 1981.\\" - !  Lorinzo Novoa Williams  Three counts of rape  Cobb County, Georgia, USA  1999‚Äì06 to 1999-10  2019-12-11  Williams was identified using genetic genealogy. He was first approached and interviewed by police who traveled to Arkansas where he lived. The suspect denied committing the sexual assaults, but just days after the interview, the suspect went missing and was then found dead (unspecified cause of death). Subsequent DNA testing on the suspect's remains confirmed matches to the DNA evidence from the three rapes. Williams had a criminal record, including peeping tom, indecent exposure and burglary. - !  Robert Dale Edwards  Murder of Naomi Sanders  Vallejo, California, USA  1973-02-27  1993-12-31  Edwards' father was a co-worker of Sanders. At the time of the crime, Edwards was 22 years old. Parabon identified two possible suspects: one living and one deceased. The living lead was eliminated. Because the second lead, Edwards, had been deceased and cremated, investigators made a positive identification through his son's DNA. - !  Clayton Carl Giese  Rape and stabbing death of 12-year-old Marsi Belecz  Spokane, Washington, USA  1985-08-04  1989-01-19  Giese's family assisted the investigation by authorizing the exhumation of his body to positively identify him. He was 22 years old at the time of the murder of Belecz and died in a car accident about four years after. Belecz's sister \\"found comfort in knowing Giese can no longer hurt [anyone], but sent her regards to Giese‚Äôs family, because she said she knows what it is like to lose someone so young.\\" - !  Daniel Leonard Wells  Sexual battery and murder of 23-year-old Tonya Ethridge McKinley  Pensacola, Florida, USA  1985-01-01  2020-04-01  Daniel Leonard Wells, 57, was facing charges of first-degree murder and first-degree sexual battery. Several items of evidence led investigators to determine that they were looking for only one suspect, whom Parabon and investigators ultimately identified as Wells. Police obtained one of Wells's discarded cigarettes to test his DNA for a match. \\"According to the arrest report, there is a less than 1 in 700 billion chance that the DNA from the crime scene is a match to anyone other than Wells.\\" He was arrested on March 18, 2020, and was awaiting his first hearing that was scheduled for April 8, 2020. While in his jail cell, Wells hung himself, not giving McKinley's family the answers they had hoped for. McKinley's son stated, \\"It‚Äôs frustrating for our family on a lot of levels because we waited so long to get justice. Now, it seems like we just have a lot more unanswered questions.\\" - !  Daniel Alan Anderson  Murder and dismemberment of 15-year-old John A. Muncy  Columbus, Ohio, USA  1983-10-15  2013-08-29  Although Muncy's remains were found on the western edge of Delaware County, police believed the teenager had been slain in Columbus and then dumped. Anderson and two of his brothers were first identified as persons of interest. Working with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, detectives ultimately positively identified the deceased Anderson as the murderer. Anderson had a violent criminal past involving boys, according to Sheriff Russell Martin. - !  Steve Branch  Rape and murder of 17-year-old Jessica Baggen  Sitka, Alaska, USA  1996-05-04  2020-08-03  Branch was living in Arkansas at the time he was identified as a primary suspect through investigative genetic genealogy. Arkansas police attempted to get a voluntary DNA sample from him, but he refused, denying any involvement with the crime. About 30 minutes after the interview, Branch committed suicide. After obtaining a warrant, police tested a DNA sample from Branch's autopsy and it proved to be a match with the DNA from the crime scene. } =Case Results: Identification of John and Jane Does= Unidentified remains of deceased individuals are given the names Jane Doe for females and John Doe for males.

Roger Hearne Kelso  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, USA  1963 (?)  1985  2019-06  It was determined that Kelso was a homicide victim after he was found inside a trash can during building excavation in 1985. The young man was last seen in 1962 and coins found near his remains date no later than 1963. The perpetrator or perpetrators have not yet been identified. Police have set up a tip line and a $10,000 reward is still being offered for more information about Kelso's murder. Long before Kelso's identification through genetic genealogy, Parabon featured Kelso on their website to demonstrate the combination of DNA phenotyping and facial reconstruction techniques to put a face on unidentified remains. - !  Hassan A. Alkebu-Lan  Chesterfield County, Virginia, USA  2016 (?)  2016-03-13  2019-03  The body of AlKebu-Lan, 39, of Richmond, Virginia, was found by a fisherman near the James River. Police do not suspect this was a crime scene as there were no signs of foul play. He was identified in March 2019. - !  Sandra Renee Morden  Vancouver, Washington, USA  Between spring 1977 and fall 1978  1980-02  2019-10-29  Sandra's bones were discovered by a father and son who were panning for gold in the Fly Creek Area near Amboy, Washington. She was given the name \\"Fly Creek Jane Doe.\\" Parabon created both a Snapshot Phenotype image and conducted genetic genealogy research to find her family. Sandra's identity was confirmed using a reference DNA sample for the family given by a cousin, who knew the family story about a cousin who had gone missing in the 1970s. Sandra was born in 1962 and would have been about 15 or 16 years old when she died. Because Sandra's skeletal remains show trauma indicative of \\"homicidal violence,\\" her case file remains open to find her killer: contact Detective Schultz at (360) 397-2036 if you have more information about Sandra's family. - !  William Arthur Fiegener  Parker County, Texas, USA  Fall of 1984  1985-10  2019-12-23  William's remains were buried in a shallow grave discovered by a father and son who were searching for a building site for a new home. CeCe Moore stated that this case was one of the longest she had worked on to-date. Officials have not made public the cause of death, but it was determined to be a homicide. In February 2020, police identified Forrest Ethington, Feigener's partner in crime, as the most likely murderer. Ethington had confessed to killing \\"Billy\\" to another associate after Fiegener was arrested for committing a smash and grab robbery using Ethington's daughter's car. The suspected motive was that Ethington feared that Fiegener would implicate him. Ethington committed additional crimes after Feigener's death, one for which he was sentenced to prison in 2010. He died in prison in October 2019 at the age of 81. Police announced that they would clear the case \\"by exception and the reason for the exceptionally cleared status will be death of the offender.\\" } References  External links  * Parabon Snapshots and advanced DNA analysis web page Companies based in Reston, Virginia 2008 establishments in Virginia Forensics organizations American companies established in 2008 Pharmaceutical companies established in 2008 DNA profiling techniques ","title":"Parabon NanoLabs"},{"id":"55337812","text":"Gordhanbhai Javia (born 9 March 1940) is an Indian politician.

USA Cricket operates all of the United States national representative cricket sides, including the men's and women's national teams and youth teams. The body was unveiled on September 24, 2017 as a proposed successor to the United States of America Cricket Association, which had been expelled from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June 2017 due to governance issues. In January 2019, it was approved as an associate member of the ICC.  History  In June 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA from the ICC, due to issues with governance of the sport in the United States. Control of the United States national team was handed over to ICC Americas until a new board was formed. On September 24, 2017 (the anniversary of the 1844 Canada-United States cricket match, and on the heels of a U.S. victory in the Canada-U.S. K.A. Auty Cup), USA Cricket was announced as a new proposed sanctioning body, including a logo unveiled by Denver-based group Adrenalin (using a cricket bat as the main symbol, deeming it to have stronger symbolism with the sport among the U.S. audience than other common symbols, such as the stumps or ball). The new body stated that its goal was to help build popularity for the game among a \\"mainstream\\" audience (as opposed to predominantly expats from other regions), with project manager Eric Parthen describing it as a \\"fresh start\\" that would \\"celebrate the past and look to the future\\". USA Cricket elected its first independent board in mid-2018. In November 2018, USA Cricket put out a request for proposals surrounding the establishment of a domestic Twenty20 league by 2021, with goals to \\"engage existing fans and grow new ones to support the bullish vision this Board has for cricket in the US\\", and \\"support the sustainable development of cricketing infrastructure across the United States\\" (noting that Central Broward Regional Park was the only ICC-certified cricket grounds in the country). In January 2019, USA Cricket was officially approved by the ICC as its 105th associate member. In May 2019, USA Cricket announced that it had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a $1 billion investment in its proposed T20 league; ACE's partners include Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, and Willow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan. ACE will provide investments for the league (including developmental and professional circuits), facilities, and support of the U.S. national teams. During its inaugural annual general meeting in February 2020, USA Cricket announced plans to launch its franchise-based T20 league Major League Cricket in 2021, stage the inaugural season of its development league Minor League Cricket in 2020, back proposals for cricket to be staged at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and pursue bids to host a future ICC tournament in the country between 2023 and 2031. It was also stated that USA Cricket may attempt to pursue full member status with the ICC. In October 2020, USA Cricket unveiled a \\"foundational plan\\" for 2020‚Äì23, including plans to promote youth and women's cricket, primarily focus on T20 (including the launch of Major League Cricket in 2022, delayed from 2021 due to COVID-19), and partner with Cricket West Indies on bids to host ICC events in the United States. The organization plans to initially target its activities towards markets where there is \\"already significant interest in and passion for the sport\\". USA Cricket also set long-term goals to reach ICC full member status by 2030.

An autobiographical collaboration between Andersen and childhood friend/lead actor/co-producer Josiah Polhemus, the screenplay was written by Andersen and Dominic Mah. Production took place in early 2014 throughout the San Francisco Bay Area including Andersen and Polhemus's hometown of Palo Alto. The film premiered in July 2016 at the Fantasia International Film Festival and was released in the Fall of 2017 by First Pond Entertainment. Plot Bob (Josiah Polhemus) is a typical, frustrated forty- something guy. He spends his days wandering and drinking. The more help he is offered the more frustrated he becomes. One might think that his situation is typical of millions of others who have suffered a sense of loss and a frustrating lack of purpose once they reach forty. But Bob is a bit different... Bob used to be Captain Truth, a masked superhero fighting crime throughout the Bay Area. Now, however, he's just Bob, and it's hard to get used to. Mimi (Amy Prosser), Bob's girlfriend, is facing her own challenges. Years ago she dreamed of moving to Rome and becoming a museum curator, but now she finds herself as an assistant in a law firm, with the chance for a lucrative promotion. As her future takes shape, she wonders if it's the future she really wants. Mimi encourages Bob to write a book, in an effort to soothe his mind and put things into perspective. He hires Danniell (Natalie Lander), a college English major, to help him get his thoughts down cohesively. She thinks Bob's book is worth publishing, and has her eyes set on Bob himself. As Bob and Danniell's relationship blossoms, Bob is tempted to risk losing Mimi, the one thing in his life that makes any sense. Meanwhile, Mimi discovers that she's pregnant. Bob has always been insistent that he didn't want kids, and with a potential new promotion, and her relationship with Bob deteriorating, she wonders if giving up the child might be the smartest thing. They both struggle as they learn that the best way to make the future worthwhile is to live the current moment as if it's the most important of all.

This was followed in November 2015 by the change of the registered name to Healthdirect Australia Limited. After a review of after-hours primary health care in July 2015, Healthdirect Australia began to operate locally tailored after-hours services and new GP advice and support lines. Services Healthdirect Australia's services include a helpline available 24 hours a day, an after-hours general practitioner (GP) helpline, the healthdirect website (which provides free health information), an app for mobile devices, and a symptom checker (a guided, online self-triage tool allowing visitors to initiate their health enquiry online).

Living in Maori dominant regions she and her husband served as an important link between Maori and European settler communities.  Early life  Born Agnes Carmont in Castle Douglas, Scotland her parents were Elizabeth Caven and John Carmont. While her parents were farmers she spent most of her upbringing in Glasgow, in the household of Dr. McCarthney, her uncle. She assisted him in his dispensary through which she gained a knowledge of medicine. This would prove valuable to her after she settled in rural New Zealand. The opportunity to immigrate to New Zealand arose through a job working as a companion to the wife of Sir Charles Clifford.  Life in New Zealand  Agnes arrived in Wellington, New Zealand in 1850. She worked for three years as a companion to Mary Ann Clifford. In 1854 she married trader Hector McDonald, also of Scotland. At this time Hector had gained a lease of 12,000 acres of land from Mua≈´poko and hapu from NgƒÅti Raukawa. The couple moved to this land in Otaki where Hector ran 12,000 sheep. With only two European neighbours Agnes learned te reo and raised her children to be bilingual. Her first child was born in 1856 and two more followed in 1857 and 1858. In 1858 the family moved to the mouth of the Hokia stream. Hector established an accommodation house in lieu of the Cobb & Company's mail coach service. This new residence was well suited to accommodate for the coach as well as running Hectors original run. Here Agnes had 6 more children and worked long hours operating the accommodation house and raising and educating her family. In the 1860s Agnes was witness to epidemics of influenza and scrofula that affected the region. Her medical knowledge and services were crucial to the treatment of children and families during this time. In the 1870s she travelled to Wellington where she was able to acquire a medical chest paid for by the government so that she could use her medical knowledge to treat children and families in her region. Through treating scrofula she was able to find a cure for the fatal variants of the disease in the form of iodine. Although she became well known for her remedies not all her patients were willing. She actively sought out sufferers of scrofula in the surroundings pa to undergo treatment. The land the McDonalds lived on was purchased by the government as part of the Levin Block. The land was divided and sold to other European settlers. Agnes died in 1906 and was buried beside her husband in their family cemetery near Lake Horowhenua.

Formed in 2001 by Daryl Talbot and Steve Oemcke, the company is known for producing branded content, but it has more recently expanded into creating lifestyle, documentary and drama content.  History  WTFN was founded by Daryl Talbot and Steve Oemcke in 2001. Talbot, a former journalist for the Bendigo Advertiser, had worked in television for a number of years and produced Postcards for Nine, and Oemcke had found his beginnings working at a Channel 8 newsroom in central Victoria. The company's first production was a Network Ten show, Bread, an observational series following people beginning a business sponsored by Sensis. Over the next decade, the company quickly gained prominence producing titles that included Coxy's Big Break, Bondi Vet, and The Living Room. Bondi Vet has gone on to be sold in over 100 countries. In 2012, the company launched international distribution company Fred Media, which represents both WTFN's programs and programs from a number of other Australian production houses. The company has signed a number of international content output deals, including a 2011 deal with US based Discovery Communications, a 2012 deal with South African Okhule Media, and a 2014 deal with Chinese broadcaster Tianjin TV. It opened a Los Angeles based office in 2012. The company received attention in 2012 after the broadcast of its branded content program McDonalds's Gets Grilled on Seven. The documentary was the recipient of allegations of bias due to it being funded by McDonald's but WTFN and Seven defended the program, saying that the producers maintained full editorial control over the content. In 2013, WTFN made a move into producing drama content after acquiring production company The Film Company and appointing its head, Richard Keddie, as WTFN's Director of Drama and Features. WTFN had its first foray into Feature films in 2016 with the release of Oddball starring Shane Jacobson. The name WTFN derives from a conversation Talbot and Oemcke had when starting the business. When discussing how to raise funding for their first pilot, one of the pair suggested putting in the money themselves and the other responded with \\"why the fuck not?\\", a phrase which was condensed into WTFN.

Louloudies is an important place of the early Christian history of Pieria. Location The complex is located 11.3 km northeast of the town of Katerini, 3.3 km northeast of the village of Korinos and 5.8 km south of the ancient Pydna in the region Pieria, Macedonia in Greece. In the middle of the 19th century the French archaeologist Heuzey localized the hills north-west of Louloudies as the place where 168 BC, the decisive battle between the Roman troops and the soldiers of the last Macedonian king Perseus took place.Heuzey, Mont Olympe et L'acarnanie History In 479 the Goths laid siege to the city of Thessaloniki. In order to avert damage to Thessaloniki, the besiegers agreed with the City Magistrate to put some Macedonian cities under Gothic supervision. Among them were the cities of Pella, Pydna, Dion and Veria. Pydna was appointed a bishops seat, but the bishop himself resided at Louloudies. The fortress-like complex was built in the last quarter of the 5th century at the road between Thessaloniki and Larissa. Probably it is the same place that was called in Roman records Anamon. During the reign of Justinian I (527-567), the complex was expanded. In the middle of the 6th century the buildings were destroyed by an earthquake. The bishop left the place and it was later used as a cemetery. In the 7th century the place was finally abandoned after barbarian attacks. The Facility Grave in Louloudies The entire complex has a floor area of 80 by 90 meters. It was surrounded by a wall, and had four rectangular towers, which were at the corners of the walls. At the western side of the wall was a double gate. In the first phase, a three-aisled basilica and a residence for the bishop were erected. The reception area and the colonnades of the building were striking. The floors are decorated with mosaic that, unlike the mosaics of Dion, represents only ornaments. Under the bishop's palace were found remnants of a villa from the early 4th century BC. At the time of Justinian facilities for the production of wine and olive oil were established. Eight larger graves were found, which have a vaulted ceiling. The painting was partially preserved. Furthermore, a larger number of simply equipped graves were found in the area of the complex. The Excavations The excavation work was conducted by the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities, Thessaloniki. They started in 1993, ended in 1997 and were financed by the Greek railway company OSE. The railway line divides the excavation site diagonally. The western defense tower and part of the wall are outside the accessible terrain. The numerous finds bring some light into the period between the 4th and 7th centuries, an epoch about which little information is available on this part of Macedonia. They bear witness to the importance of the bishop's seat and give evidence of the daily life and the existing technique of this time. After the plant was finally abandoned by their inhabitants, handicraft companies settled. Residues of a kiln for pottery, melting furnaces for glass products, smelting furnaces for metal and a sculpture workshop were found.

It premiered on Adult Swim on September 10, 2017. It was written by Dan Guterman and Ryan Ridley, and directed by Dominic Polcino. In the episode, as the main Rick and Morty adventure offscreen to Atlantis, the focus is shifted towards the Citadel, a secret interdimensional society populated by numerous versions of Ricks and Mortys from different realities. The episode was well received, with approximately 2.4 million viewers when airing. With the exception of the narration for a Simple Rick's commercial (voiced by Jeff B. Davis) and a single line from a young Beth Smith (voiced by Sarah Chalke), this episode was entirely voiced by Justin Roiland as the various Ricks and Mortys.  Plot  As Rick and Morty prepare for an adventure to Atlantis, they are interrupted by another Rick and Morty looking for donations to the Citadel Redevelopment Fund. Morty wonders what is occurring in the Citadel. The episode does then shift to the Citadel to follow several intertwined plots.  The Campaign  In the Citadel, a presidential election is ongoing following the deaths of the Council of Ricks. The controversial Candidate Morty of the Morty Party wins the crowd over at the debates, but abruptly fires his Campaign Manager. Later, Campaign Manager Morty is approached by Investigator Rick, who delivers some secret files to him. At Candidate Morty's next rally, Campaign Manager Morty confronts and shoots him. Mortytown A newly recruited Cop Rick is partnered with a violent and obese Cop Morty who harbors anti-Morty sentiments himself. They meet with \\"Big Morty\\", who offers Cop Rick a bribe to keep quiet on his illegal dealings, Cop Morty himself having already accepted. When Cop Rick refuses, Cop Morty shoots Big Morty's henchmen, and a shootout ensues. After an emotional Cop Morty kills Big Morty, Cop Rick is forced to kill him, then surrenders himself expecting punishment. Instead, he is cleared of all charges due to recent changes in departmental codes.  Stand by Morty  The students of Morty Academy are told they will soon graduate and be assigned a new Rick. Upon hearing this, a group of Mortys led by the rebellious Slick Morty decide to search for the mythical Wishing Portal. At the Wishing Portal the next day, they decide to sacrifice something important in order to make their wishes come true, which each of them, bar Slick, immediately do. Slick, expressing a wish for life to change for Mortys, throws himself into the portal ‚Äî which is then revealed to be a trash disposal. Saddened, the remaining Mortys return to the Academy, only to learn it has been closed. They believe this to be Slick Morty's wish coming true.  Simple Rick's  At a factory producing Simple Rick's Wafers, made with the titular Simple Rick's happy memories, employee Rick Sanchez J-22 is passed over for a promotion. J-22 goes on a rampage, destroying his assembly machine, killing his former Supervisor, taking Simple Rick hostage and then killing him in an escape attempt. Just as SWAT Team Ricks are about to apprehend J-22, they are stopped by the factory's owner, Rick D. Sanchez III, who commends J-22 for his courage and frees him. As J-22 is overwhelmed with emotion on being given a limousine, Sanchez III tasers him and uses his happiness as a replacement for the wafers' flavor.  Epilogue  Campaign Manager Morty is thrown into space by Secret Service Ricks, who reveal that Candidate Morty survived and will become President of the Citadel. In the next room, Rick D. Sanchez III takes his place with the Shadow Council of Ricks and President Morty. One councilman states that no matter who sits in the president's chair, the Council will always have control over the Citadel. President Morty asks the other Council members if they agree with this statement, then has his guards assassinate those who did. Outside the Citadel, Candidate Morty's documents reveal the new President to be the Evil Morty from \\"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\\". In a post-credits scene, the main Rick and Morty return home from Atlantis, satisfied with their trip. As Morty wonders what has been happening at the Citadel, Rick assures him that it will likely have no effect on their lives.  Reception  NME's reviewer Larry Bartleet praised the episode, saying that the episode's \\"upshot ‚Äì a brutal mirroring of America‚Äôs woes ‚Äì has earned the show its highest-ever rated episode, with an average score of 9.9/10.\\"  Awards  The episode won writers Guterman and Ridley the 2018 Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement, Writing ‚Äì TV/Broadcast Production.

A pioneer of San Francisco's machine art scene, he hand builds complex machines and robots. Current work, in 2018, includes building functional artificial robotic organs as a residence of the Stochastic Labs in Berkeley California. Through a collaboration with audience members who volunteer to control or operate his sculptures, Spelletich's work explores the interface of robots and humans. Early work frequently incorporated fire and \\"extremely dangerous\\" situations, to examine the boundaries of fear, control and exhilaration. By the late 1990s Spelletich started incorporating sensors in his sculptures to engage with questions about technology, spirituality, and play. Early life and education Spelletich grew up in Davenport, Iowa, where his parents owned a construction company. The seventh of nine children, he was given a chemistry set at nine, and began to experiment with fire and alchemy. At 18, he joined the International Harvester tractor assembly line and as a member of the United Auto Workers Union, he was exposed to mass production and large scale building processes. Spelletich attended the University of Iowa. He studied photography and graduated with a BFA in interdisciplinary art. He earned an MFA from the University of Texas, Austin. He helped to start the Austin Media Arts Center after he received his master's degree. Career Spelletich is considered a pioneer of San Francisco's machine-art scene. Spelletich builds interactive robots and brain machine interfaces using technology currently at the forefront of scientific research for medical, militaristic or consumer applications. Spelletich explores emotional boundaries related to risk and play. His work is interactive, requiring participants to enter or operate the piece, often against their instincts of self-preservation. The collaboration with the audience completes the work. His work often includes elements of fear, play, humor and absurdity such as a hugging machine, robots that grab and lift the participants in the air, harvest and respond to bio data and praying robots. Brain machine interface work began in 2016 and includes Split Brain Robotics (collaboration with Mitch Altman ) which incorporates a hacked EEG as a neural interface and a computer to analyze the data and signal the robots responses. In September, 2016, Amazon Video greenlit a pilot Budding Prospects that is based on the life of Kal Spelletich in the 1980s. Early work In 1989 Spelletich founded the interactive machine art performance collective Seemen (stylized SEEMEN) ‚Äî in the 1991 Richard Linklater film Slacker, Spelletich played a character who wore a backpack of television sets, similar to the TV backpacks the Seemen wore in their \\"often-jarring\\" performances. He was involved in Austin's music scene, and collaborated with bands including the Butthole Surfers and Scratch Acid. In August 1999, Spin wrote that Spelletich's work was influenced by American punk rock and informed by his \\"homegrown mechanical expertise\\" and his \\"art school exposure to Dadaists and Duchamp.\\" With Seemen, he constructed \\"notorious\\" installations at the Burning Man festival such as the three headed hound Cerebus, an animated fire spewing sculpture made of metal. In 2001, Spelletich began to build pieces that incorporated biofeedback sensors. The Levitator lifted a volunteer based on a device that measured respiration; another piece used breath analysis to connect a turbine jet engine with an afterburner. The installation The EKG Ring monitored volunteers sitting in the center of a ring of fire, with the fire pulsing in time with their heartbeats. In 2006, he constructed \\"Monkey on Your Back\\", a backpack robot with multiple arms and EKG sensors that responded to changes in a participant's heart rate. Further reading *Boas, Natasha.

The program is offered in partnership with Udacity and AT&T; and delivered through the massive open online course format. Georgia Tech has received attention for offering a full master's degree program for under $7,000 that gives students from all over the world the opportunity to enroll in a top 10-ranked computer science program. The program has been recognized by the University Professional and Continuing Education Association, Fast Company, and the Reimagine Education Awards for excellence and innovation. Background The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology launched its online Master of Science in Computer Science degree in January 2014. The program was conceived by former Dean of Computing Zvi Galil and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun. Offered in partnership with Udacity and AT&T;, OMSCS is delivered through the massive open online course format and was designed to provide a low-cost, high-quality alternative to traditional master's degree programs by delivering instructional content and academic support via the massive open online course format. The current Dean of Computing, Charles Isbell, helped lead the effort to launch the program as then-senior associate dean. As of Spring 2020, the program has over 9,500 enrolled students located in 120 countries. It admits all applicants deemed to possess a reasonable chance of success--about two-thirds of the approximately 30,000 applicants to date--which is significantly higher than the university‚Äôs on-campus graduate admissions rate. From its creation in 2014 until the spring semester of 2020, the program has graduated almost 3,500 students and now graduates more than 1,300 students each year, with a retention rate of 70%. Research by David Joyner & Charles Isbell found that applications to the on-campus program tripled after the launch of the online program. They also found the program is predominantly populated by domestic students, although the ratio of international students has been growing, and the program enrolls a higher rate of underrepresented minorities than the on-campus program. The program has received significant media attention since its announcement in May 2013, including a front-page story in The New York Times and a segment on the PBS NewsHour series \\"Rethinking Education\\". Curriculum and culture The online master's program currently offers 40 courses and four specializations-- Computational Perception and Robotics, Computing Systems, Interactive Intelligence, and Machine Learning. A study entitled ‚ÄúCan Online Delivery Increase Access to Education,‚Äù by John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University Associate Professor Joshua Goodman, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at the Georgia Institute of Technology Associate Professor Julia Melkers, and Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Associate Professor Amanda Pallais, explored the structure and industry impact of the online master's program and concluded that it supplies the need of ‚Äúa vast untapped market for highly affordable degrees from prestigious colleges.‚Äù Research published at the 2019 ACM Global Computing Education Conference noted that part of the reason for the program‚Äôs success is the alignment between platform and content. The professors, instructors, teaching assistants, and students in the program are uniquely qualified as CS students to contribute to the platforms used to produce and deliver the program. Due to the online format of the program, social media has played a significant role in the development of robust student communities. The utilizes an artificial intelligence teaching assistant called Jill Watson, built using IBM‚Äôs Watson platform. Jill is able to answer questions posed in natural language and assists students enrolled in the program's Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence course, led by Professor Ashok Goel. Jill has since been adapted for use in non-computer science courses, as well. To further reduce the load on human instructors and teaching assistance, as well as prevent duplicated effort on the part of students, the program uses the Piazza Automated Related Question Recommender, or PARQR, which suggests relevant existing posts as a student composes a new post. Created by a team led by Thad Starner, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing, and implemented in his Introduction to Artificial Intelligence OMSCS course, the tool has reduced duplicate posts by 40% and recommends relevant posts 73.5% of the time. The program has also introduced an artificial intelligence agent known as Jack Watson that monitors homework- for-hire sites for postings from OMSCS courses. When ‚Äúhired‚Äù by a student, Jack provides a watermarked solution that can be automatically recognized once submitted by the student. Created by a team led by Thad Starner, Jack Watson has had success in identifying course submissions that are not original work. Recognition and impact Former President Barack Obama publicly praised Georgia Tech's online master's program on two occasions, as providing a model to both address the STEM worker shortage and control the costs of higher education. The program was the recipient of University Professional and Continuing Education Association‚Äôs Outstanding Program Award in the credit category. OMSCS was also cited as the reason Georgia Tech was named to Fast Company‚Äôs 2017 list of Most Innovative Companies in the World--the third university so named and the first for work in the education sector. In 2019, the program received the gold award for the best distributed/online program for nurturing 21st-century skills at the Reimagine Education Conference & Awards. The program has proved to be a model for other online degrees. Georgia Tech itself has launched two additional online master's degrees: one in Analytics and one in Cybersecurity. The online master‚Äôs initiative has spurred Georgia Tech to also offer undergraduate courses online, and they now offer three courses: Introduction to Computing; Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming; and Data Structures and Algorithms. Other universities have followed suit, creating more than 40 online degrees by the spring of 2019. For example, in March 2018, Coursera announced six new, MOOC-based degree programs in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Arizona State University, the University of London, and Imperial College London.

Ronnie had been touring with bassist Ricky Phillips (Styx, The Babys) and Eric Singer (Kiss) in the early 2000s. Over three days in 2003 at Doug Messenger's studio in North Hollywood, the sessions produced 10 strong tracks of rhythm guitar, bass and drums with the intention to get a singer to for the vocals. Eventually Ronnie decided on the 10x10 concept, 10 tracks and 10 different singers.Ronnie Montrose; \\"10x10\\" liner notes; Rhino Records 2017 Early on, he was able to secure contributions from close friends and collaborators like Sammy Hagar, Edgar Winter and Davey Pattison. In the intervening years Ronnie battled prostate cancer and, at one point, hadn't touched a guitar for 2 years. Conflicts in scheduling led to the record remaining unfinished for years up until Montrose's passing in 2012. Along with completion of the vocals, the songs also needed lead guitar as well. Rickey Phillips, with the blessing of Ronnie's wife Leighsa and assistance of Eric Singer, picked up the reigns and completed the album. \\"After he passed, I had to carry on with what Ronnie wanted, because he was such a purist. The songs were cut to 2-inch tape and then transferred to digital, but I really needed it to be a cohesive record. I've done enough records to know how easily the levels of 10 different singers can sound disjointed if you don't stay on top of the production.\\" As per Singer, \\"I have to give a lot of credit to Ricky Phillips. Ricky really wanted to see this thing through. It was more for Ronnie than just for himself, or for ourselves.

He was the founder of the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital, the first hospital in Phoenix which served the African American community. Early years Hackett was born in Tyler, Texas, where he received his primary and secondary education. He became a student of the Tuskegee University. The Tuskegee University is a private, historically black university (HBCU) located in Tuskegee, Alabama. It was established by Booker T. Washington. He continued his medical studies at the Meharry Medical College, which is located in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. The college is a graduate and professional institution affiliated with the United Methodist Church whose mission is to educate health care professionals and scientists. Hackett graduated and earned his medical degree in obstetrics. Medical practice in Phoenix Hackett moved to Phoenix in 1916 and established his medical practice in his home which was located at 729 W. Sherman Street. He thus became the first African-American physician in Arizona. He was married to Ayra Elberta Hammonds Hackett (1896‚Äì1932), also a native of Texas, with whom he had two children Winstona Hackett Aldridge (1917‚Äì2017) and John Prentice Hackett (1918‚Äì1925). In 1925, the family moved to 1334 E. Jefferson Street. Ayra assisted with the deliverance of newborns in their home for five years. This was a time in the history of Phoenix when many African-Americans were often denied medical care because the city was segregated. Hackett also saw to the needs of those of the white race with socially stigmatized ailments who were denied medical care. His wife, Ayra, was also very active in the community. She founded a weekly newspaper, the Arizona Gleam, in 1929, which she published from their home. She was the only African American female newspaper owner in Arizona. She was also the president of the First Colored Baptist Church‚Äôs Baptist Young People‚Äôs Union (B.PY.U.). Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital Three of the six cottages which Dr. Hackett had built for his TB patients Hackett lobbied for the creation of an African-American community hospital but was unsuccessful. In 1921, Hackett purchased the residence of former Territorial Governor Joseph Kibbey which was located next door to his house at 1342 E. Jefferson St. In 1922, he established the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital a private medical in that residence. The hospital didn't have many beds at first and each bed was situated in the screened porch of the house. Hackett purchased three adjoining lots and was, therefore, able to expand the hospital. He also had six cottages built for tuberculosis patients. He charged his patients $12.50 to $35.00 per week for a hospital stay. Hackett opened a pharmacy nearby and recruited Southern African-American nurses with college nursing degrees to join his staff. One of the benefits which the African-American doctors and nurses gained from joining him was the opportunity to gain valuable experience in their chosen field. Hackett‚Äôs hospital grew and soon had 25 beds. However, the hospital did not only dedicate its services to the African-American community, it served other races, too. There were many people seeking more affordable health care and there were those who needed clandestine treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. In 1927, the Arizona Republican (now the Arizona Republic) called it: Grave-site of Ayra E. Hackett In 1932, Ayra was stricken with pneumonia. On November 13 of that same year she died in her home and was later buried in Phoenix's Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery. Her newspaper, the Arizona Gleam, continued to be published until 1939. Hackett's Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital began to suffer economically when a nearby maternity hospital expanded to become a full-service facility. Other factors that had an influence on the hospital's economy were the unpaid bills of some of his patients and his failing eyesight. He had no other choice but to close the hospital in 1943. Winston Inn Hackett converted the building where the hospital was once located into an inn which he named the \\"Winston Inn\\". The inn served and accommodated African-American servicemen during the World War II era and was frequented by many non-white educators, entertainers and athletes. This lasted until full racial integration was achieved in Phoenix during the Civil Rights era. Both, the Hackett house and hospital building were eventually demolished. Later years Grave-site of Winston C. Hackett Hackett's daughter Winstona married Aubrey C. Aldridge in 1943. Aubrey C. Aldridge worked as a school principal at Dunbar and Bethune schools. Winstona, like her father, was very active in the community. She was a founding member of the Phoenix Chapter of The Links Inc., and a Diamond Soror with 75 years of service in the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Kaleel then attended the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a medical degree, which he followed with post-graduate qualifications in medicine. In 1942 following the dismal of A. E. Goonesinghe from the State Council of Ceylon the All Ceylon Muslim League nominated Kaleel to run for the Colombo Central seat. He comfortably defeated his main opponent, Jinendrasinghe, and was sworn in as a member of the State Council. In 1945 Kaleel suffered his first heart attack and was unable to join the Muslim League Delegation, which gave evidence before the Soulbury Commission nor was he able to attend the inaugural meeting of the United National Party. At the 1st parliamentary election, held between 23 August 1947 and 20 September 1947, he acceded to Tuan Burhanudeen Jayah representing the United National Party in the Colombo Central electorate. Jayah was subsequently elected as the second member for Colombo Central, and was appointed as Minister of Labour and Social Services in the D. S. Senanayake cabinet. In 1950, Jayah resigned from parliament and cabinet minister to assume duties as the county's first High Commissioner to Pakistan. In the following by election for the vacant seat, on 6 May 1950, Kaleel, running as the United National Party candidate, defeated his nearest rival, Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe representing the Communist Party of Ceylon, by 2,295 votes. At the 2nd parliamentary election held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952, he was elected as the second member for Colombo Central. Kaleel was appointed as Minister for Labour in the First Dudley Senanayake cabinet, a post he continued to hold in the subsequent Kotelawala cabinet. In 1956, at the 3rd parliamentary election he failed to secure one of the three seats in the Colombo Central electorate losing to the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna candidate, M. S. Themis, by a mere thirty five votes. At the parliamentary elections in March 1960 Kaleel was elected as the first member for Colombo Central and was appointed as Minister of Home Affairs in second Dudley Senanayake cabinet. In the subsequent parliamentary election in July 1960 the United National Party was defeated however Kaleel retained his seat as third member for Colombo Central. He declined to contest the following parliamentary elections in 1965 standing aside for Falil Caffoor. Kaleel served as the United National Party president from 1990 until his death in October 1994, having earlier served as the party's treasurer and vice-president. In 1986 the Government of Sri Lanka awarded Kaleel the civilian honour of Deshamanya. References Further reading * 1900 births 1994 deaths Alumni of S.

By reading the markings on its metal rotunda, the current time in 148 major cities from around the world can be determined.Helmut Caspar: √Ñrger mit der Weltzeituhr am Alex. St√§dtenamen sind nicht korrekt. In: M√§rkische Allgemeine Zeitung, 24/25. Dezember 1997. Since its erection in 1969, it has become a tourist attraction and meeting place. In July 2015, the German government declared the clock as a historically and culturally significant monument.Uwe Aulich: Denkmalschutz f√ºr DDR-H√§user am Alex. In: Berliner Zeitung, 14. Juli 2015, S. 15.  History  Commemorative coin featuring the World Clock The World Clock shortly after it was opened to the public, photo taken on 3 October 1969 The sixteen ton world clock was opened to the public on 30 September 1969, shortly before the twentieth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, along with the Berlin TV Tower ('). The erection of the clock was part of a larger plan to expand and reorganize Alexanderplatz as a whole. At the end of the renovations, the public square was four times larger than it was at the end of the World War II. The clock was designed by the designer Erich John, who at the time was an employee of the planning group for the transformation of Alexanderplatz under the direction of Walter Womacka. Before designing the clock and managing its construction, John was a lecturer at Kunsthochschule Berlin-Wei√üensee (then called the Hochschule f√ºr bildende und angewandte Kunst, \\"College of Fine and Applied Arts\\"), where he taught product design. The idea to erect a clock in Alexanderplatz was had when the wreckage of the Uranias√§ule (a.k.a. Wetters√§ule), a pre-World War II public clock, was found during the restoration of the square in 1966.Auskunft des Gestalters der Weltzeituhr, Erich John. The construction of the clock required more than 120 engineers and other experts, including the sculptor Hans-Joachim Kunsch; the Getriebefabrik Coswig company was also instrumental in its construction.[https://www.kunsch- metallbau.de/referenzen/weltzeituhr-berlin-alexanderplatz/ Homepage von Weltzeituhr Berlin Alexanderplatz Kunsch Metallbau; Referenzobjekte,] abgerufen am 23. Juli 2018. In Germany at the time, there was no widely recognized design award, so John did not receive one for his work. However, he received a design award for a different design of his in 1982. In 1987, a commemorative coin was released with the image of the World Clock. In 1997, the cities of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were added to the clock during a necessary repair to the mechanism ‚Äì when it was erected, the cities were omitted due to the political sensibilities surrounding the nation of Israel of the time.Frisch poliert: Die Weltzeituhr dreht sich bald. In: Berliner Zeitung, 12. Dezember 1997, abgerufen am 3. Juli 2013.Weltzeituhr tickt jetzt wieder richtig. In: taz, 20. Dezember 1997 Two cities which had changed their names since the clock was erected were also changed: Leningrad (to Saint Petersburg) and Alma Ata (to Almaty).  Function  The main feature of the World Clock is a large twenty-four sided column (the cross-section of which is a regular icositetragon). Each side of the column represents one of the twenty-four main time zones of the Earth, and has the names of major cities which use that time zone engraved into it. A windrose is painted onto the pavement below the column which holds up the clock. Four smaller analog clocks are located on the sides of the narrow column which holds up the rotunda, and the entire clock is more than large enough for people to stand under it and read the smaller clocks. The clock is mechanical, and in normal operation is constantly in motion, although the motion is too slow to be seen by a human observer ‚Äì it is only readily apparent in timelapse recordings. Numbers ‚Äì in a line from one through twenty-four ‚Äì revolve around the outside of the clock throughout the day. To read the clock, a user finds the side of the icositetragon which corresponds to the city or time zone they are interested in and notes the number under it. The number corresponds to the current hour in that city. If the number is not directly under the side, but is instead off-set by some fraction, that can be used as a way to estimate the number of minutes past the hour it is in that city. This is made easier because each number is in a different-colored rectangle, the length of which corresponds to one side of the icositetragon. Cities in time zones which are not exact hours offset from UTC, such as New Delhi which is situated in the Indian Standard Time (IST) zone (UTC+05:30), have their offset in minutes engraved next to them. For New Delhi, the engraving is \\"NEW DELHI +30\`\\". Once per minute, an artistic sculptural rendering of the solar system made of steel rings and spheres rotates. Including the sculpture, the World Clock is high. The clock is driven by an electric motor which resides in a space of x x . This motor drives the gearbox, which was rebuilt from one made by Trabant.Weltzeituhr ‚Äì Treffpunkt mit Innenleben. In: Berliner Zeitung, 30. Januar 2007, Abgerufen am 3. Juli 2013. During the 1997 renovation of the clock, Aurotec GmbH replaced parts of the original equipment which were failing.  Social relevance  The clock has become since the 1970s the scene of protests, as well as a landmark which Berliners living near the area use to meet others. On 12 May 1983 the Bundestag deputies of The Greens, including Petra Kelly, Gert Bastian and three other deputies, unrolled a banner with the inscription \\"The Greens ‚Äì swords to plowshares\\" before the world clock and were arrested.Udo Baron: Kalter Krieg und hei√üer Frieden. Lit Verlag, M√ºnster 2003, , S. 188 On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic on 7 October 1989, opposition political groups formed a demonstration which began at the clock and ended at the Palace of the Republic. The state responded by arresting over 1,200 of the protesters. Thirty-three days later, the Berlin Wall fell.

Similar to screenwriting, it is typically a freelance profession. It includes many differences from writing for film, due to the non-linear and interactive nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with video game designers and voice actors. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including written text, foreign or made-up languages, and often situation-based information. Especially when developing Triple A games, more than one writer will be required to create the game, split into different roles.  Writers  People who write video games are part of the design team, during pre-production,How To Become A Video Game Writer, interview with Darby McDevitt, posted on Game industry career guide and create the main plot of a video game but can also focus on the dialogue, the character creation and development or the worldbuilding.The Gamasutra 20: Top Game Writers, by Bonnie Ruberg on Gamasutra During the game development process, the design may change and a video game writer can also be asked to fix the eventual narrative issues.Building a Narrative That‚Äôs Explosive, by Chris Suellentrop, published on The New York Times March 19, 2013 The importance of the plot can be minimized by some video game designers, for instance Harvey Smith of Arkane Studios claimed that \\"The world is very important. The characters are very important. The plot? It can be thrown away. Because each gamer will build his own story.\\".Dans un jeu vid√©o, ¬´ le joueur s‚Äôinventera toujours sa propre histoire ¬ª by Corentin Lamy , published 27 december 2016 on Le Monde website Moreover, according to academic and video game designer Ian Bogost video games can be much more than narrative media, by putting together, in a non-linear structure, elements of everyday life, as in What Remains of Edith Finch.Video Games Are Better Without Stories by Ian Bogost, published in April 2017, in The Atlantic. One issue specific to the medium is that priority is given to interactive play mechanics over narrativeWhat In The World Do Video Game Writers Do?

Graphics Improve But Video Game Endings Still Come Up Short, by Stephen Totilo which could lead to Ludonarrative dissonance: a situation when ludic and narrative elements are opposed to each other, as Far Cry 2 director Clint Hocking defined the concept in his blog. Also as video games are more recent than other media, video game writing is still a field to be conquered.Bad lines by Clint Hocking, published 9 february 2012 on the Edge website There is no specific training to video game writing and some video game writers ‚Äì such as Tim Schafer and Sam Barlow ‚Äì are also in charge of other game development tasks.  Types  Video game writing differs from writing for arts, due to the non-linear and interactive nature of most video games, and the necessity to work closely with video game designers and voice actors. There are many differing types of text in video games in comparison to stage shows or movies, including written text, foreign or made-up languages, and often situation- based information. Subsequently, more than one writer will often be used to create the game, split into different roles, with more specific job titles that can range from being a traditional writer, developing an overview of the story and how it reacts to the player, or creating a translation or localization.  Pitch writing  A pitch writer specializes in writing pitches for video games to publishers. They create collaborative pitch documents within a game studio that often contain design mockups or art concepts. The main parts of a pitch document, in order from first to last, are the executive summary, audience analysis, story, competition analysis, market analysis, gameplay, and budget and schedule. With an increasing emphasis placed on game profitability, especially in the free to play model, the F.T.U.E. (First Time User Experience) and retention metrics have also become important parts of the pitch document.  Narrative design  Narrative designer is a hybrid role of video game design and writing that creates not only the story, but also how it is communicated to players and how the game mechanics work to reinforce that story. Bioware writer David Gaider described the role as \\"the person who shapes the game‚Äôs narrative, as well as the one who writes all the words.\\"  Script work  = Script writing = The script writer focuses on the dialogue said by characters and the voice over. The script's dialogue can be written in flowcharts to illustrate the various dialogue resulting from both decision and indecision. Generally, a script writer is less involved with the video game's mechanics, and is tasked with writing and working with voice actors. = Script doctoring = Similarly to screenplay script doctors, video game writers can be brought in to assist with writing-related tasks. However, the term is more vague than in screenplays due to the wide variety of potential tasks needed.  Industry practice  Similar to screenwriting, it is typically a freelance profession. Writing roles may also be filled by other members of the development team. Tools Traditionally, game writers used simple tools like Word, Excel or just plain pen and paper. Some game writers also used tools initially designed for the film industry such as Final Draft. As the field has evolved and player agency started to play a bigger role, the need for professional game writing tools has emerged.

The band labeled the event as \\"An Evening of Music and Unity.\\" Tickets for the concert were free but prioritized for the greater Charlottesville area and students, faculty, and staff of the University of Virginia. Attendees were encouraged to donate to the \\"Concert for Charlottesville Fund,\\" benefiting \\"victims of the events in Charlottesville on August 11 and 12, their families, first responders, and organizations devoted to the promotion of healing, unity and justice locally and nationwide.\\" The concert was also live-streamed to audiences around the world through platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and by Oath Inc. sites, including Tumblr and HuffPost. Background On the evening of August 11, a day before the Unite the Right rally was to be held, a group of white nationalists marched onto the University of Virginia campus. The marchers carried lit tiki torches and chanted antisemitic, homophobic, and misogynistic slurs at bystanders. Just before noon on August 12, the rally was canceled after the Virginia State Police declared that the gathering was an unlawful assembly. After the rally was aborted, James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car through a crowd of counterprotestors on the Downtown Mall. One person, Heather Heyer, was killed and 19 others were injured in the attack. Two Virginia state troopers, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M. M. Bates, were also killed while on their way to assist with public safety in Charlottesville, after their helicopter crashed 7 miles southwest of the city. Concert Dave Matthews opened the concert by performing an acoustic rendition of \\"Mercy\\". He then invited Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, onto the stage where she thanked the crowd and asked them to be part of her daughter's legacy. Bro's speech was followed by a performance by Cage the Elephant. Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland of Coldplay were then announced as special guests by Pharrell Williams. The duo performed some of the band's biggest songs as well as a cover of \\"You Never Can Tell\\" by Chuck Berry. The concert then proceeded with performances by The Roots with Bilal and Brittany Howard, Williams, Chris Stapleton, Justin Timberlake and Ariana Grande. The Dave Matthews Band and special guest Stevie Wonder closed out the concert by performing a cover of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", and Wonder's famous single, \\"Superstition\\". Williams, Matthews, and Wonder at one point during their respective performances each knelt on stage, performing the gesture to show solidarity with NFL players protesting the National Anthem and in response to President Donald Trump's criticism of the players. The concert faced some criticism from local racial justice organizations, including Solidarity Charlottesville. These community members raised issue with the event being planned in part by Charlottesville city officials and University of Virginia leaders, whose inaction they viewed as being partly responsible for the violence on August 11th and 12th, as would be confirmed in the Heaphy Report, commissioned by the city in response to the events of Unite The Right. A protest was held across the street at the beginning of the concert, with student and community activists holding banners reading, \\"No Unity Without Justice.\\" Set list #Dave Matthews ‚Äì \\"Mercy\\" #Cage the Elephant ‚Äì \\"Punching Bag\\" #Cage the Elephant ‚Äì \\"Cold Cold Cold\\" #Cage the Elephant ‚Äì \\"Trouble\\" #Cage the Elephant ‚Äì \\"Come a Little Closer\\" #Coldplay ‚Äì \\"The Scientist\\" #Coldplay ‚Äì \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" #Coldplay ‚Äì \\"You Never Can Tell\\" #Coldplay ‚Äì \\"Viva la Vida\\" #Coldplay ‚Äì \\"Amazing Day\\" #The Roots ‚Äì \\"How I Got Over\\" #The Roots and Bilal ‚Äì \\"It Ain't Fair\\" #The Roots and Brittany Howard ‚Äì \\"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\\" #The Roots and Brittany Howard ‚Äì \\"Move On Up\\" #Pharrell Williams and The Roots ‚Äì \\"Feels\\" #Pharrell Williams and The Roots ‚Äì \\"Get Lucky\\" #Pharrell Williams and The Roots ‚Äì \\"Freedom\\" #Pharrell Williams and The Roots ‚Äì \\"Happy\\" #Pharrell Williams and The Roots ‚Äì \\"Blurred Lines\\" #The Roots and Pharrell Williams ‚Äì \\"The Seed (2.0)\\" #Chris Stapleton ‚Äì \\"Sometimes I Cry\\" #Chris Stapleton ‚Äì \\"Second One to Know\\" #Chris Stapleton ‚Äì \\"Broken Halos\\" #Chris Stapleton ‚Äì \\"Fire Away\\" #Chris Stapleton ‚Äì \\"Tennessee Whiskey\\" #Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"Side to Side\\" #Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"Be Alright\\" #Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"One Last Time\\" #Ariana Grande ‚Äì \\"Dangerous Woman\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Drink You Away\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Suit & Tie\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"My Love\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"TKO\\" / \\"Holy Grail\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Cry Me a River\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Rock Your Body\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"SexyBack\\" #Justin Timberlake ‚Äì \\"Mirrors\\" #Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" #Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Warehouse\\" #Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Satellite\\" #Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Seven\\" #Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"You Might Die Trying\\" #Dave Matthews Band and John D'earth ‚Äì \\"Grey Street\\" #Stevie Wonder and Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Imagine\\" #Stevie Wonder and Dave Matthews Band ‚Äì \\"Love's in Need of Love Today\\" #Stevie Wonder, Dave Matthews Band and John D'earth ‚Äì \\"Superstition\\" See also * 2017 in American music * One Love Manchester References External links *Official concert website 2017 in American music 2017 in Virginia Benefit concerts in the United States Charlottesville, Virginia Music of Virginia September 2017 events in the United States Unite the Right rally ","title":"A Concert for Charlottesville"},{"id":"55339953","text":"Herschel Sizemore is an American mandolinist in the bluegrass tradition.

Her father, Walter Bolandi, was a leading photographer and cinematographer and her mother, Marina Jim√©nez, was a pianist. She had drawing lessons from Fausto Pacheco. Her mother became her companion after she returned from fifteen years studying in Colorado and in New York with Ivan Olinsky and Robert Brackman. She worked as a photographer in the 1960s before she became a professor at the University of Costa Rica and later at the National University of Colombia. Bolandi was not interested in exhibiting her work and only showed four pieces of work and only to please others. She was given the Mag√≥n National Prize for Culture although she did not consider herself worthy of it. She retired in 1983. She was in the first wave of Costa Rican women artists that included Margarita Bertheau, Lola Fernandez and Sonia Romero. These four who all taught fine art at the University of Costa Rica are said to have created the second generation of Costa Rican women artists. Dinora eventually became a near recluse in Escaz√∫, selling little, and using her mother, her dog, and the occasional stranger as models.

The Ambedkar family is the family of B. R. Ambedkar (14 April 1891 ‚Äì 6 December 1956) who was an Indian polymath, human rights activist, the chief architect of the constitution of India and the founding father of the Republic of India. Ambedkar's followers and the Indian people started respectfully addressing him as \\"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar\\", since September 1927, because millions of Indians consider him the \\"greatest liberator\\". \\"Babasaheb\\" is a Marathi phrase which means \\"Respected Father\\" (Baba = father and Saheb = sir/lord). Currently, Ambedkar's descendants are working in political, social, religious and other fields.  Family background  The Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial and a Ashoka pillar in Ambadawe, the origin place of the Sakpal-Ambedkar family. Rajgruha - the house of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in Mumbai, Maharashtra Ambedkar family was of Marathi background from the village of Ambadawe (in Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra, India. Ambadawe village is the origin of the Ambedkar family. B. R. Ambedkar's ancestors lived in this village, and at that time their family name or surname was \\"Sakpal\\". Maloji Sakpal was a soldier in the army of British India, and later his son Ramji Sakpal served as a Major-Subhedar in the army of British India. Ramji had 14 children, the last of them was Bhimrao. Bhimrao was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now Dr. Ambedkar Nagar) in the Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh). Bhimrao was also known by his other name as Bhim, Bhima, Bhiva and later Babasaheb. Bhimrao's surname was Sakpal but his father Ramji Sakpal registered his surname as \\"Ambadawekar\\" in the school, meaning it comes from their native village of Ambadawe. Bhimrao's Devrukhe Brahmin teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from \\"Ambadawekar\\" to his own surname \\"Ambedkar\\" in the Pratap Singh High School's records. In 1909, Ambedkar married Ramabai Ambedkar. They had five children ‚Äì Yashwant, Gangadhar, Ramesh, Indu (daughter) and Rajratna. Apart from Yashwant (1912‚Äì1977), the other four died in under their two years age. Yashwant alone survived as his descendant. His second wife Savita Ambedkar had no children.

In: Heinrich Krone Tageb√ºcher Erster Band: 1945-1961.1995 p.1.  Politics  Ursula Krone- Appuhn joined the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (party) in 1958 and switched to the similarly oriented Bavarian Christian Social Union (party) in 1962. In 1973 she took over from Centa Haas as regional chair of the party's \\"Women's Union\\", an office she held till 1981. She was elected to the national parliament (Bundestag) in the 1976 General Election, remaining a member till 1987. As her party's representative on the parliamentary defence committee she took her position seriously, and herself undertook a week's military training at an army base in Munsterlager so as to gain firsthand experience of army life. The issue of women's role in the military was topical at the time, and she followed the conservative party line in being was opposed to the idea of drafting women into the West German armed forces: she nevertheless cited historical precedent to insist that there was no question of women being inherently incapable of operating heavy weapons.

Unveiled on August 31, 2017 at IFA, it is a revival of the previously discontinued Moto X line. It was released in Europe at the end of September 2017. In the United States, an Android One version of the device was also released, marking the first device to be released in the US as part of the Android One program.  Specifications   Hardware  The Moto X4 is equipped with a IPS display. It comes in two colors: Super Black and Sterling Blue. The camera assembly protrudes from the body, as on almost all Motorola smartphones in production. The fingerprint sensor is an oval on the front. The front has a front-facing camera with flash, LED notification light, and the proximity sensor in the top bezel. The back has the dual camera at the top and one of the secondary noise-cancellation microphones at the bottom. The sides are an aluminium frame, which holds the front and back glass. The phone's USB type C charging port has a USB-OTG function, supported by a USB type C OTG connector. Its Moto Turbopower fast-charging technology can add about 5 hours of battery life with 15‚Äì20 minutes of charging. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom along with the manufacturing details. The SIM-card tray can support either two nano SIM cards or a nano SIM card and a microSD card of up to 2TB of capacity. The phone is IP68 rated.  Memory and Storage  The Moto X4 comes in three memory variants: 3GB / 32GB, 4GB / 64GB, and 6GB / 64GB.  Processor  The Moto X4 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 SoC at 2.2GHz, and the Adreno 508 GPU at 650MHz. Together, these provide a decent performance in terms of general browsing. However, most games supported by the hardware run without lag.  Battery  The Moto X4 comes with a 3000mAh Li- ion non-removable battery that Motorola claims can provide a full day of usage. Users typically report the same, with a few exceptions. Along with the Moto Turbopower technology, the battery performance of the phone is good.  Camera  The device features a dual rear camera, in a raised circular camera bump. It contains a 12MP 2.0 1.4Œºm dual autofocus pixel sensor combined with an 8MP 2.2 1.12Œºm wide-angle sensor which has a 120¬∞ field-of-view. The dual camera system allows the camera to use depth effects, selective focus and black and white and background replacement. The rear camera has a color- corrected‚Äìtemperature dual LED flash. The front-facing camera is a 16MP 2.0 1Œºm sensor with a front-facing LED flash. It also has a 4MP adaptive night mode for low light levels, with the new system update enabling the portrait mode for it as well.  Software  The X4 launched with Android Nougat version 7.1 and can be updated (in most regions) to Android 9.0 Pie. The Prime Exclusive model currently is sold running Android Oreo. It also contains Amazon's Alexa voice assistant in addition to the standard Google Assistant offered in all android phones and Motorola's own assistant Moto Voice. It also has several other Moto experiences; one-button-nav, Moto Display, Moto Actions, Moto Key and wireless sound system. Android 9.0 Pie upgrade rollout began December 17, 2018 in the US and most other regions, including some European regions. The UK got Pie on June 24, 2019. Some may still be \\"pending\\".  Android One version  The Moto X4 Android One edition is the first device to be released as part of the Android One program in the United States. It is only available in the US and works on Google's Project Fi network, which had previously been exclusive to Google's own Nexus or Pixel phones. The Android One version does not include the Amazon Alexa assistant and some Motorola software additions, and will receive Android updates from Motorola faster than the regular version of the device. Release supply issues The X4 was originally made available to buy on September 21, 2017 in France, Germany and the United Kingdom via Motorola's website, and proved popular with many customers ordering it within a few days of release. However, Motorola was unable to meet the demand due to manufacturing and shipping issues, with many customers having their orders cancelled and refunded after the expected delivery dates. It has since been removed from sale in some countries or is showing as out of stock in others.

The Privy Council granted a Commission of Justiciary for a local trial to be held and four of the women ‚Äì believed by historians to be Margaret McLevin, Margaret McWilliam, Janet Morrison and Isobell McNicoll ‚Äì were executed in 1662; a fifth may have died while incarcerated. One woman, Jonet NcNicoll, escaped from prison before she could be executed but when she returned to the island in 1673 the sentence was implemented. Background The early modern period saw the Scottish courts trying many cases of witchcraft with witch hunts beginning in about 1550. Prior to the fervent activity in 1662, generally the numerically small, tightly-knit, population of islanders on Bute did not encounter the scale of witch hunting experienced throughout the rest of Scotland. Records indicate the only instances of formal witch persecution on the island took place between the 1630s and 1670s although the documents may be incomplete. In 1630 after a group of women ‚Äì their names and the exact number are not known ‚Äì confessed to witchcraft, they were confined in the dungeon of Rothesay Castle without food or water and starved to death. A strong belief in fairy traditions and folklore persisted in Scotland during the seventeenth century despite being subjected to nearly a hundred years of vigorous oppression. The Kirk session in Rothesay heard a complaint against Jeane Campbell in 1660 as it was claimed she went with the fairies who had instructed her how to make spells; she was also accused of applying \\"a salve to rub on her breast, which was good for comforting the heart against scunners [afflictions].\\" It was discovered she suffered from indigestion so the local minister allayed the fears of his congregation regarding her involvement in witchcraft. The following year she was brought before the session again after she used the cure on others; she was discharged but informed she would be deemed a witch if she repeated the offence. Ten years earlier, in 1650, another woman, Finwell Hyndman from Kingarth, was interviewed as she went missing for a day every three months; when she returned she had such a repugnant smell no one could approach her and it seemed she had been on a long journey. As she offered no adequate reason for her absence, she was \\"bruted for a witch or (as the commone people calls it) being with the fayryes\\". In common with other European witch trials, major Scottish witch hunts occurred in batches; historians offer differing opinions as to why this should happen but generally agree that military hostilities and political or economic uncertainty played a part coupled with local ministers and landowners determined to seek convictions. The execution of King Charles I took place in 1649 and an extensive witch hunt started that year. Charles II was declared the monarch of Scotland in 1660; most historians connect the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661‚Äì62, the last but most severe wave of prosecutions, with the Restoration. The hunt started in small towns and villages near Edinburgh during April 1661 spreading to Bute with a succession of accusations and trials beginning in early 1662. Some of the charges, including those against Margaret McWilliam, concerned events that had happened over twenty years before. Events leading up to the trials The series of events on the island in 1662 were initiated following disagreements between neighbours, a common scenario for the instigation of witchcraft cases. John McFie accused his neighbour Margaret McWilliam of witchcraft. He alleged she caused him to suffer pains resembling those of giving birth; the ailment started shortly after he had an altercation with her and continued for three months. McFie also claimed she was responsible for the sudden death of one of his children a few hours after the child became ill. McWilliam had been regarded as a witch by the community for more than thirty years; the women who confessed to witchcraft that starved to death in Rothesay Castle in 1630 claimed she was a witch and she had been imprisoned in 1631. Investigation The first recorded statement given by any of the accused women was from Janet Morrison at her home on 15 January 1662. Aftermath Jonet NcNicoll escaped from the tolbooth in Rothesay during 1662 and fled to Kilmarnock where she lived for the next twelve years. She returned to the island in 1673 and was executed for the 1662 conviction alongside another woman, Mary NcThomas, who had been found gulty of incest and charming. These two executions were the last recorded cases of witch persecution on the island.

Designed in 1956, none of these locomotives were ever actually built. Background The planning of the JNR Class C63 began around 1955. Electrification for the locomotive developed slowly due to financial difficulties at JNR. The company was not experienced with diesel locomotives, and it lacked test facilities for non-steam engines. Development of the new diesel locomotive was proposed because existing models were aging and travel demand was increasing. Cancellation Number plate of C63 1 exhibited at the Kyoto Railway Museum In 1956, the design drawing was completed. A prototype was to be manufactured, and a manufacturing order was to be issued. In 1958, JNR, in its \\"Power Modernization Plan\\", planned to completely eliminate the steam locomotive in 15 years from fiscal year 1960. JNR authorized the implementation of the plan and completed it in 1975. Since JNR had converted to the policy of abolishing the steam locomotive, the company decided to cancel the C63. At the Koriyama Plant (currently the Koriyama General Vehicle Center), a 1/5-scale live steam replica was produced based on the design documents, mainly to demonstrate the steam locomotive technology to the young staff; the miniature is currently used during special events.

A remake of the 2014 Hindi film Queen by Vikas Bahl, the film features Kajal Aggarwal alongside Elli Avram, Vinaya Prasad, Bhargavi Narayan. The film began production in September 2017, and was shot simultaneously in Kannada as Butterfly. In July 2020, filmmakers entered talks to release the film through Amazon Prime Video.  Cast   Production   Development  In June 2014, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, the producers of the Hindi film Queen (2014), made an official announcement that they hold sold the remake rights for the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada versions of their film to Thiagarajan, who would make the films through his production studio, Staar Movies. Viacom put a caveat in the agreement that the principal photography of any of the films must start by 8 June 2017, else the rights would revert to Viacom. Soon after the announcement in June 2014, several Indian directors and actresses expressed their desire to do the film, but Thiagarajan maintained that no one had been finalised and that he was still considering his options. Thiagarajan announced his potential plans of casting Lisa Haydon to reprise her supporting role and for his son Prashanth to act in the film, but remarked that he was unsure if Prashanth would accept to play a character with \\"grey shades\\". Samantha held discussions about portraying the film's lead role during July 2014, but turned the film down after being unconvinced about the way the original script was set to be adapted into the South Indian regional languages. Asin also rejected the offer due to her pending marriage.https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainmenttags/asin- thottumkal/why-did-asin-refuse-queen-remake After a period of inactivity and further media reports about the casting of the lead actress, Thiagarajan revealed in February 2016 that he had signed on Revathi to direct the Tamil version of the film, while Suhasini would work as the dialogue writer. Soon after, Nayanthara turned down the opportunity to work on the film citing scheduling issues during early 2016. In mid-2016, Trisha was also approached to play the lead role but conflicting schedules meant that she could not sign on to appear in the film. The media also linked actresses Parvathy Thiruvothu and Nithya Menen to the lead role, but neither were signed on. During an interaction with the media in November 2016, Thiagarajan revealed that he had finalised Revathi to direct the Tamil and Malayalam versions of the film, while Anish Kuruvilla and Prakash Raj would make the Telugu and Kannada versions respectively. He added that Tamannaah would feature in the lead role of the Tamil version, while Amala Paul and Parul Yadav would reprise the role in the Malayalam and Kannada versions respectively. He also stated that Amy Jackson was signed on to feature in all four versions of the film in the role originally portrayed by Lisa Haydon. In April 2017, Tamannaah stated that the film was shelved, though Thiagarajan refuted her claim and stated that production would begin in May 2017. He revealed that talks with the actress to play the lead role had fallen through after a dispute over her remuneration for the lead role. In June 2017, further confusion about the remake arose after two separate production houses apart from Thiagarajan's Staar Movies had claimed rights to the film. As per a contract signed on 30 July 2016, Staar Movies agreed to enter into a co-production agreement with Mediente International Films Ltd and Liger Commercial Brokers for the making of the films. However a mutual cancellation form was then signed between the parties on 5 April 2017 after Mediente allegedly failed to pay the consideration provided under the agreement. Then, as per a contract signed on 21 April 2017, Staar Movies agreed to assign the rights of all four South Indian versions of Queen to Golden Crab Film Production Ltd. To avoid the reversion of rights back to Viacom due to three years of inactivity, Staar Movies and Golden Crab swiftly began shooting the film on 17 May 2017 with a series of supporting actors including Nassar under the title of Vaanil Thedi Nindren. However, on 3 June 2017, Staar Movies again assigned and transferred the remake rights of the film to Mediente and Liger, with the Kannada version of the film titled Butterfly (2018) featuring Parul Yadav, starting immediately with Ramesh Aravind taking over as director. Staar Movies then produced a declaration affidavit on 14 June 2017 that any agreement with Golden Crab Films was false. The final credits of the film indicate that the producer is Manu Kumaran of Mediente, with actress Parul Yadav, Staar Movies and Liger as co-producers. Kajal Aggarwal revealed in August 2017 that she had agreed terms to play the lead role in the Tamil version of the film, which would also be directed by Ramesh Aravind and produced by Mediente, and that the film's shoot would begin in September 2017. In September 2017, it was revealed that Tamannaah would instead work on the Telugu version of the film which would be directed by Neelakanta. Amala Paul also opted out of the Malayalam version citing date issues and was later replaced by Manjima Mohan. In late September 2017, Mediente announced that the Tamil film would be titled Paris Paris and the shoot would commence from October 2017. Writer Tamizhachi Thangapandian was signed to help adapt the script and opted to set the film in Virudhanagar, while music composer Amit Trivedi was signed to work on the Tamil and Kannada versions. In late October, Jackson left the film due to scheduling conflicts with the TV series Supergirl.  Filming  The film was launched in Chennai on 24 September 2017 with director Ramesh Aravind and actress Kajal Aggarwal in attendance. The team announced that they would film scenes in Virudhanagar, followed by schedules in Paris, Barcelona and London. Speaking about the Tamil remake at the film launch, Kajal Aggarwal had said, \\"I loved the story ever since I saw the original! But we have to remember that the film, since it was made a couple of years ago, will have to be changed to keep it in sync with the current times. The makers of the film and I are very clear that we want to adapt Queen to Southern sensibilities, and do it our own way. While the script will essentially remain the same, the treatment will be personalised. I will also add my own touch to the role.\\" Filming began in early November 2017.  Post-production  Elli Avram lent her own voice in Tamil for first time despite not knowing the Tamil language simultaneously with Kannada.  Soundtrack  The music of the film is composed by Amit Trivedi and lyrics are by Thamizhachi Thangapandian and Parvathy.

They are used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The Janus kinases are a family of four nonreceptor tyrosine-protein kinases, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. They signal via the JAK/STAT pathway, which is important in regulating the immune system. Expression of JAK3 is largely restricted to lymphocytes (predominant expression is in the hematopoietic system), while the others are ubiquitously expressed, so selective targeting of JAK3 over the other JAK isozymes is attractive as a possible treatment of autoimmune diseases.Activation of JAK3 by cytokine receptors that contain the common gamma chain (Œ≥c)  Mechanism of action  Janus kinase 3 inhibitors work by inhibiting the action of the enzyme Janus kinase 3, so they interfere with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. JAK3 is required for signaling by cytokines through the common Œ≥ chain of the interleukin receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. However JAK1 is also required as the two kinases cooperate for signaling. Signaling leads to phosphorylation and dimerization of the adaptor proteins STAT. When activated, they translocate into the nucleus, where they modulate gene transcription. By selectively inhibiting JAK3, downward signaling can be blocked. JAK3 is crucial in transmitting signals from cytokines that are responsible for either T-cell proliferation, differentiation, or development. It is also of high importance in the development of B-cells and NK-cells. Inhibition of JAK3, then, could prove to be a powerful immunosuppressant. Since JAK3 is restricted to the immune system, while the other JAKs such as JAK1 are much more broadly expressed, selective targeting of JAK3 could decrease possible adverse effects and improve tolerability. As an immunosuppressant, JAK3 inhibitors could aid in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or other diseases where the immune system fails to distinguish self from nonself and starts attacking self cells.  Discovery and development   Discovery  One of the first JAKs to be targeted in drug development for medical use was JAK3. Immune system depression is observed in patients with JAK3 defects. The role of JAK3 is greatly restricted to the immune system, so this enzyme was thought to be a good target for selective immunosuppressant. Whether JAK3 is sufficient to suppress the cytokine signaling is uncertain, as it can also be caused by stimulation of JAK1. Whether inhibiting JAK3 is as efficient as pan-JAK inhibition is under study. Many compounds with high affinity and possible selectivity for JAK3 have been discovered with high-throughput screening.  Development  Currently, much attention is focused on developing Janus kinase inhibitors as drugs for immune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, and psoriases. The first JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was tofacitinib. It has also shown promising results in other autoimmune disorders. Initially, tofacitinib was thought to be a selective JAK3 inhibitor, but later was found to be a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2. The value of developing a selective JAK3 targeting over the other JAKs is that JAK3 expression is restricted to the immune system, while the other JAKs are much more broadly expressed. Since JAK3 is not as ubiquitously expressed, selective targeting could improve tolerability, and decrease possible adverse effects and safety concerns. For example, dual inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 might increase bacterial and viral infection because of a broader immunosuppressive effect. Inhibition of JAK2 has been linked to adverse effects such as anaemia and generalised leukopenia.Common structure groups of ATP and inhibitors that target the ATP binding site on JAK3. Developing sufficiently selective JAK3 inhibitors has been difficult. One of the reason is the small variation in the ATP binding site of different JAKs. Another problem is that JAK3 has a higher affinity for ATP than the other JAKs, which can be a reason for a poor translation from in vitro enzymatic assay studies to cellular system studies. An example of this is decernotinib, which showed 41-fold selectivity for JAK3 vs JAK1 in in vitro enzyme assays, while the selectivity for JAK3 was not maintained in cellular assays, where it showed a slight preference for JAK1.  Structure activity relationship  JAK3 inhibitors target the catalytic ATP-binding site of JAK3 and various moieties have been used to get a stronger affinity and selectivity to the ATP-binding pockets. The base that is often seen in compounds with selectivity for JAK3 is pyrrolopyrimidine, as it binds to the same region of the JAKs as purine of the ATP binds. Another ring system that has been used in JAK3 inhibitor derivatives is 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine, as it mimics the pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold. Sequence alignment has shown that the ATP binding pockets of the JAKs are almost identical and only a few features distinguish JAK3 from the rest. One of these differences is the presence of cysteine residue (Cys909) in the front region of the ATP binding pocket, where the other JAKs have serine at that same position. Only 10 other kinases possess a cysteine at that location, making cysteine even more intriguing as a target for a better selectivity. The focus has been on structures that can react with cysteine and have the electrophilic warhead acrylamide have been of interest, as they should ideally react only with proximal cysteine. Covalent cysteine targeting can be tricky, as off-target reaction can lead to adverse reactions, but as the JAKs resynthesize rapidly, covalent inhibition could be necessary to extend the pharmacodynamics. To compare inhibitors, the parameter of choice is IC50; by measuring IC50 for different JAKs, determining selectivity is possible. In the kinase family, JAK3 has the highest affinity for ATP, so measuring IC50 in high concentrations of ATP show whether the inhibitor can compete with ATP for the binding site.  Medical use  Several therapeutic options exist for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, but the search is still going on for safer, more effective, and more convenient treatments. Inhibition of JAK3 has in research shown to be a good target for immunosuppression. The only indication for a JAK3 inhibitor at the moment, rheumatoid arthritis, is for the nonselective JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib. Other indications, such as psoriasis, alopecia areata, and ulcerative colitis are in clinical trials. Cytokines have an important role in autoimmune diseases and as the common Œ≥ chain cytokines interleukin IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 signal via JAK3, the inhibition of JAK3 and blocking of the signaling of these cytokines could affect many immune diseases and lead to development of new effective immunosuppressive drugs.

It is operated by BBC Cymru Wales, and also serves as a base for S4C. The ¬£120 million building replaced the BBC Cymru Wales Broadcasting House in Llandaff, when 1,000 production and support staff began moving into the new facility in October 2019. The building is officially located at 3 Central Square, but has also been referred to as BBC New Broadcasting House. Design and construction Construction started in December 2015 on the site of the former Cardiff Central bus station. The building will be half the size of the current Broadcasting House in Llandaff. The BBC received the keys to the building in April 2018, after which the headquarters was fitted out with new technology before staff moved in, around October 2019. The building has been designed by Foster + Partners, with the interior design by Overbury and Sheppard Robson. There will be four floors providing office, studio and production space. There will be desk space for 750 staff, on the basis that not all the 1,200 staff will be on site at the same time. The internal size of Central Square over several floors is , making it nearly 1.5 times the area of the Millennium Stadium pitch. It is envisaged that an estimated 50,000 people will visit the new building every year. The BBC agreed a 20-year lease on the building at an annual rent of around ¬£25 per square foot per annum with Rightacres Property Company, the developer of the Central Square.  Operation  The building's first audio broadcast was made on 15 July by channel announcer Leanne Thomas. This was followed by the first radio broadcasts, by BBC Radio Cymru 2 host Daniel Glyn on the 25 July and by BBC Radio Wales host Owen Money on the 31 July. The building's first video broadcast was made by reporter Alex Jennings as part of a piece to air on the afternoon broadcast of Wales Today.

A digital product designer identifies an existing problem, offers the best possible solution, and launches it to a market that demonstrates demand for the particular solution. The field is considered a subset of product design. Some digital products have both digital and physical components (such as Nike+ and Fitbit), but the term is mainly used for products produced through software engineering. Since digital product design have become mainstream in the creative industry, a digital product designer oftentimes is simply referred to as a \\"product designer\\" in job posts. Career Path Digital product design is a transdisciplinary field because a digital product designer sees the project from end-to-end; from recognizing an opportunity and understanding the customer's need through to final delivery. A digital product designer is an integral part of the creative team at every stage of the process who leads the UI and UX design throughout, and is also involved in the product strategy with an entrepreneurial mindset to help get it to the market. Although computer programming is not a required skill for a digital product designer, digital product designers need to have a high-level understanding of how all of the technical pieces work together in order to ensure that the creative vision is fully realized. Digital product designers who are able to code are far more likely to succeed in this career field. Although part of a digital product designer's job is to oversee the look and feel of the product as well as the development of the software system, digital product design is a different creative process and career path from graphic design and web design. Academic Degree Digital product design is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary course of study combining fields of Computer Technology, Industrial Design, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, and Humanities. Established as a modern degree addressing needs for cross-disciplinary education, one of its fundamental objectives is to develop lateral thinking skills across more rigidly defined academic areas recognized as a valuable component in expanding technological horizons.

In 1879, while working on A Doll's House, he protested against women not being allowed as members of the association, and in 1882, Circolo was opened to women as well Circolo Scandinavo was more like a meeting point for Scandinavians than it was a working space until the end of the Second World War. In 1962, the association started a residency programme, and in 1975 was transformed exclusively into an artists residency. This was done with financial help from the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is still today the main sponsor of Circolo Scandinavo. The Casino Farnese where Circolo Scandinavo is located.

The artists granted residency are determined through an application process. Each year over 300 artists from all the Nordic countries apply for residency and about 60 artists each year get a residency. The residencies are usually one or two months. The artists come from every discipline of art.Homepage of Circolo Scandinavo The association is also an active player in Roman cultural life. It arranges events with Nordic artists, and participate in mainly Nordic themed events in Rome. Alongside the Nordic embassies of Rome, Circolo arranges the Nordic Film Fest, a film festival held every spring.

Bacon was the son of Waller Bacon of Earlham, Norfolk. He entered Gray's Inn in 1731. His father died in 1734 and he inherited Earlham Hall. In 1738 he was called to the bar. He married Elizabeth Knight of Southampton on 4 September 1742 Bacon's father had represented Norwich from 1705 to 1734 and in 1739 Bacon was invited to stand with Tory support against the sitting Whig Members for the town. He waited until he had consulted Horace Walpole, the senior sitting Member, who arranged for him to be brought in as Member of Parliament for Kings Lynn in 1742, sitting until the 1747 general election. He was then returned as MP for Callington in a by-election on 21 April 1748 on the Walpole interest. He became Steward of Norwich in 1750 and recorder in 1752, holding the post until 1783. In 1754 Bacon was again invited to stand for Norwich, but declined in order to oblige Pelham, who provided him with another seat at Newport in the 1754 general election. He became bencher of his Inn in 1755. When Walpole was raised to the peerage, Bacon was finally elected MP for Norwich in a by- election on 25 June 1756. He was chairman of committee of privileges and elections from 1758 to 1770. He became Lord of Trade in December 1759 and zealously applied himself to its work, remaining in office until 1765 with an attendance at Board meetings during that time of nearly 80 per cent. At the 1761 general election Bacon and Harbord were opposed by two Norwich aldermen whom they easily defeated. Bacon never held any public office after 1765. He was returned for Norwich again in a contest in 1768 and returned uncontested in 1774. The 1780 election was however closely contested, and Bacon kept his seat only by a narrow margin. The English Chronicle acknowledged in a note on him in 1781: \\"Edward Bacon ... is an intelligent sensible man, perfectly conversant in the intricacies of committee business, and skilled in all the branches of commercial information. He is vulgarly denominated a stickler, but as this appellation appears in him to be only an ill-natured mode of conveying an idea of indefatigable attention to every subject that comes within his cognizance, it will rather operate as a compliment than otherwise. He is firmly attached to Lord North, and is of course his friend in Parliament\\". After 1780 no vote by him is recorded as he was too ill to attend. It was said of him in December 1783: \\"Mr. Bacon is so ill he can‚Äôt attend and can‚Äôt live long; perhaps may not wish to come in again\\". He did not stand in 1784. Bacon was highly respectable, independent and diligent but apparently very dull. During his 41 years in Parliament he represented local interests indefatigably and his activities in Parliament centred on committee work. He is not known to have spoken in any major debate, and intervened very rarely. Bacon died on 12 March 1786 and was buried at Earlham Church. He and his wife had no children.

Early life The son of a well known Genoese boat builder, Andrea Corrado completed his Shipmaster examination at age 17, and by 1882 had advanced to the rank of first officer. He became a Captain shortly thereafter and became known for his exemplary ship maneuvering skills. This led to him becoming the head of the Genoa Maritime Pilots. Shipowning career The first historical record of Andrea Corrado as a ship owner (and by extension investor) was in 1908, when he acquired the \\"Castagna\\". By 1917, he had organically grown his fleet to five vessels; three steamships and two Brigs. Inter war years The fleet experienced heavy losses during World War I, with italy joining the Triple Entente, but through both strong cashflows and strategic diplomacy, he successfully rebuilt and expanded his fleet, taking advantage of vessels made available by the British Shipping Controller, an institution created by the Lloyd George coalition government in 1916. These ships were called Standard Vessels. By 1919, his fleet had expanded through both direct and indirect investments in merchant vessels. When he invested indirectly, he did so through both joint ventures and equity stakes in other Genoese ship owners. In the latter case, he always held a controlling stake. In 1931, Corrado was awarded the honour of the Knights of Labor, and by 1932, his fleet, operating under the corporate structures ‚ÄúCorrado di Navigazione‚Äù and ‚ÄúPolena‚Äù had grown to become one of the largest diversified private fleets in Europe. His ships were active in many Mediterranean ports and on both shores of the Atlantic. In 1936, Andrea Corrado acquired ten additional vessels from the state owned ‚ÄúLa Meridonale di Navigazione‚Äù and between this time and 1939, at the dawn of World War II, his fleet had grown to between 35 and 40 vessels according to historical records. The fleet was largely destroying during World War II; many units were sunk by British intelligence, others sank from damage caused by naval mines. Others were confiscated by the Italian Royal Navy and used in the war effort. Post war years Corrado was one of the first to capitalise on Marshall Plan financing to rebuild his fleet. His son, Giovanni Battista, who was a decorated pilot of military aviation, led a delegation of Italian entrepreneurs to the United States. They were received by US President Harry Truman, who agreed that warships would be made available as compensation for war damage. These ships were called \\"Liberties\\" but many in the Italian shipping community questioned the feasibility of successfully converting them for commercial purposes. Corrado was convinced that appropriate technical interventions could make them more suitable for merchant transport. For this reason, he decided to expose himself personally by defending this project in Confitarma (Association of Italian Shipowners); often in the face of strong opposition from other Italian shipowners. His efforts paid off, and Italy became a significant beneficiary of the Liberties program. The Liberties were instrumental to European post-war reconstruction, and subsequent economic growth. Corrado built out his fleet but also diversified into maritime insurance and real estate initiatives. In 1961, Andrea Corrado and his son Giovanni Battista, oversaw the construction of one of the first modern dry bulk Merchant ships, characterised by scaled cargo intake and technology assisted navigation. Many of these technological advances paved the way for the super-bulker, and super-tanker era that followed. Death and legacy Andrea Corrado died in Genoa in 1963 and is buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa. As a testimony to his significant contribution to the Italian Maritime industry, a city square was named after him in central Genoa. His history is recounted today in the hall of fame of the largest Maritime Museum in the Mediterranean, Galata MuMa. In 1976, Andrea's grandson Francesco restructured the company and expanded geographically under the name of Gestion Maritime. Danilo Carlo Fumarola joined the company in 2002, and took over as CEO of Gestion Maritime Group in 2010. As the first non-family member to run the organization, he shifted the company towards an internal commercial and technical management model, whilst cautiously expanding the fleet size based on quantitative vessel valuation metrics. Fumarola implemented a Liability- driven investment strategy and an anticipatory approach to vessel design, whilst developing a customer-centric approach. He successfully transitioned the company from pure shipowner to full service shipping company. Fumarola holds a master's degree in both Economics and Financial Engineering from Bocconi University and Berkeley University Haas School of Business. Gestion Maritime investment Advisors was created to manage external capital from the Institutional investor community, and is co-managed by Fumarola and Richard George Stephenson, a seasoned investment management, alternative investment, Illiquid securities and financial risk management specialist who joined the Gestion Maritime Group as executive board member.

Overview  Blood Donation collects at a combination of community-based temporary donation centres and 23 permanent blood donation venues across England, and it has been estimated that three units of blood are issued to hospitals within England every minute. It was reported by The Independent in 2016 that Blood Donation and NHS Blood and Transplant collect 1.8 million units of blood each year from 23,000 blood donation sessions across England and North Wales. On May 2nd, 2016 responsibility for blood collection in North Wales was passed from Blood Donation to the Welsh Blood Service, making it a national service operating across the whole of Wales. In 2016, it was announced by NHS Blood and Transplant that blood donors within England would receive a text message when their donation was sent to a hospital for use. In recent years, Blood Donation has launched campaigns aimed at increasing the numbers of Black and Minority Ethnic donors. In 2016 a number of famous landmarks across the world took part in the Missing Type Campaign, in which the letters A, B, and O were removed from signage for BAFTA, Abbey Road, and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll railway station to highlight the need for the corresponding blood types.

He led the Native Brigade during the battle of Adwa and was taken prisoner by the Ethiopians. Early life Born in Alessandria when the town was still in Sardinia-Piedmont, he graduated from the Military Academy in Turin shortly after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Appointed sub-lieutenant in the Bersaglieri, he fought in the 1866 Austro-Italian War and in the capture of Rome in 1870. In the following years he was appointed captain in the Army Staff and started teaching logistics at the School of War. In 1888 he was assigned to the Special Operation Corps of Alessandro Asinari di San Marzano in Eritrea and took command of the 1st Cacciatori d'Africa Regiment. When the Corps was disbanded, he was reassigned to garrison duties in Massawa until 1890. First Italo-Ethiopian War Albertone returned in Eritrea in 1895, when the tensions upon diverging interpretations of the Treaty of Wuchale between Italy and Ethiopia escalated into the First Italo-Ethiopian War. When the fighting started the Italian forces were divided into two operational Corps, one in Adigrat and the other in Mek'ele: the latter, almost entirely composed by ascari under general Arimondi, won the victory at Coatit, the opening engagement of the war. The Italian then invaded Tigray, while Menelik II was slowly gathering his forces in Addis Abeba. By November, when the negus finally started marching towards Italian positions, the occupation was complete, and a line of outposts and pickets was established on the borders. Realizing Menelik forces greatly outnumbered those units, Baratieri ordered a preemptive retreat. His conflictual relationship with Arimondi, however, led to the massacre of Toselli's column at the Amba Alagi and the loss of the isolated Fort of Mek'ele (Macall√® in Italian sources) after a two-weeks siege. As the situation deteriorated, Baratieri reorganized his command: Albertone received command of the highly respected Native Brigade, formed with troops that served in the 2nd operational Corps, while Arimondi was moved to the I Infantry Brigade, a mixed formation that mostly comprised Italian units recently shipped from Italy. By mid February 1896, the Italian expeditionary force concentrated on the Sauria hills, near Adwa, a small settlement where the Ethiopian army was encamped. Battle of Adwa By 27 February, both the Italian and the Ethiopian armies had only a few days of supply left. Unable or unwilling to decide between a temporary withdrawal or a small advance, Baratieri asked for the advice of his brigade commanders: Giuseppe Arimondi, Albertone, Vittorio Dabormida and the newly appointed Giuseppe Ellena. Albertone informed his commander that, according to native informants, the Ethiopians were scattered across the hills of Adwa, foraging. This was later proved to be wrong, but, with Arimondi's mistaken estimate of Menelik‚Äôs forces, it suggested to the commanders that Baratieri was moving away from an easy victory. Following Arimondi, Albertone urged an aggressive attack and was soon joined by his colleagues. With the officers urging an attack and pressed by telegrams from Crispi, Baratieri decided to advance towards Adwa. The 29 February he ordered the field force to redeploy with a night march. Albertone and the Native Brigade, on the left, was to occupy the Kidane Meret peak, Dabormida, on the right, the mountain of the Rebbi Arienni and Arimondi, with the center, again the Rebbi Arienni, in a less prominent position. The reserve brigade of General Ellena was stationed behind Arimondi.  Night march  At 21:30 of 29 February, the brigades of Albertone, Arimondi and Dabormida were on their way, each following different roads. Baratieri and his staff, with Ellena's brigade, was to follow Arimondi, three hours later. The faulty map given to Italian brigadiers at Adwa, that shows \\"Mount Kidane Meret\\" (Monte Chidane Meret) At midnight it was found that the paths followed by Albertone and Arimondi were converging. Albertone took the lead, forcing Arimondi to stop for an entire hour. Since the Native Brigade marched faster than the two others, by 3:30 a.m. Albertone reached his intended position, on what he thought was the Kidane Meret. His guides, though, informed him that the brigade was on Erar√† Hill. After an hour, not seeing Arimondi coming into line on his right as he expected, Albertone deemed that he was on the wrong position and decided to resume the march toward the real Kidane Meret, away.  Menelik's first attack  Albertone's move opened a wide gap in the Italian lines, and isolated his brigade from Arimondi and Dabormida. By 5:30 a.m., at sunrise, while the two Italian brigades deployed on the Rebbi Arienni, from his position overlooking the Mariam Shavitu valley Albertone sighted the Ethiopian camp. Convincing himself that Baratieri wanted him to threaten those positions, he sent forward the 1st Native Battalion of major Turitto to scout the ground. Around 6 p.m. the advanced battalion came under heavy attacks from nearby Ethiopian troops, and Menelik was rapidly binging fresh forces to this side. The assault was so fierce that it reached the Italian second line, and the entire Native Brigade was forced to retreat, protected by the fire of Albertone's two mountain artillery batteries. At 6:45 Baratieri, who heard the sound of the fighting, ordered Dabormida to advance in support of Albertone, whom he assumed to be at the false Kidane Meret, a little ahead. Once Dabormida discovered the Native Brigade was further away, he continued to slowly march westwards, reaching the Mariam Shavitu valley 3 miles north of Albertone's positions.  Mount Semaiata  By 7:00 a.m. Albertone was arraying his remaining battalions on the nearby Mount Semaiata, leaving Turitto and the two batteries on the Kidane Meret to cover his movements. He wrote a message to Baratieri, informing him that he was under heavy attack and in dire need of reinforcements: it would reach the commander only at 8:15. From 7:30, the 1st Native Battalion held off increasing numbers of enemy troops until 8:30, when it was forced to retreat. At this time, about 18,000 Ethiopians were converging on Albertone's brigade in a half moon formation, trying to encircle it, and the strong Ethiopian northern wing occupied Mount Gusoso, cutting any existing link between Albertone and Dabormida's relief attempt. For about two hours, the ascari under Albertone held their position, the artillery inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers, but then the Ethiopians set up quick-firing batteries on the Kidane Meret. While Menelik was committing more troops from his own command, the badly mauled flanks of the Native Brigade collapsed, and by 10:30 the whole brigade, low on ammunition, started a fighting retreat that soon turned into a rout. The batteries that tried to cover the withdrawal were captured, retaken by ascari with a bayonet charge, then definitely lost, their crews annihilated. Albertone was captured leading his troops, and his brigade was shattered shortly afterwards. Last years After being held prisoner by the Ethiopians for fourteen months, he was freed under the terms of the treaty of Addis Abeba and returned to Italy in July 1897 . After commanding for two months the \\"Re\\" (lit. King's Own) Brigade, he retired from the Army at his request.He was substituted by Major General Carlo Caneva on 1 October 1897. See For his valiant deeds during the battle of Adwa, Albertone received the Silver Medal of Military Valour in 1898. He died peacefully and almost forgotten in Rome, in 1919.

His name is included in the \\"Foyer‚ÄìHalliwell‚ÄìAsada\\" pathway, a cellular process of hydrogen peroxide metabolism in plants and animals, named for the three principal discoverers, with Christine Foyer and Kozi Asada. He moved to Singapore in 2000, and served as Deputy President (Research and Technology) of the National University of Singapore (2006‚Äì15), where (as of 2018) he continues to hold a Tan Chin Tuan Centennial professorship. Early life and education Born in Preston, Lancashire in 1949, Halliwell was educated at Preston Grammar School. He attended St Catherine's College, University of Oxford (1968‚Äì71), achieving a BA with First Class (honours) in biochemistry. He was also awarded the Rose Prize for the best final papers of any candidate in biological sciences. His D.Phil in plant biochemistry was also at Oxford, supervised by Frederick R. Whatley and Vernon Butt; his thesis was entitled \\"The biochemistry of plant peroxisomes\\" (1973). He was later awarded a D.Sc from the University of London for his work on the biochemistry of free radical reactions in plant and animal systems. Career and writing After leaving Oxford, Halliwell briefly lectured at the Portsmouth Polytechnic (1973‚Äì74). He took up a position as lecturer at King's College London in 1974, remaining there until 2000, rising to the position of professor of medical biochemistry in the Division of Pharmacology. He also simultaneously held a visiting professorship at the University of California, Davis, United States (1995‚Äì99). After a 1998 sabbatical at the National University of Singapore (NUS), he moved there in 2000 as chair of the biochemistry department. As of 2018 he is a professor in the department of biochemistry at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, where he holds a Tan Chin Tuan Centennial professorship. Halliwell served as the NUS's first Deputy President (Research and Technology) in 2006‚Äì15, founding the Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, and overseeing a doubling in the university's research grants. He was subsequently appointed Senior Advisor to the NUS President. He chairs Singapore's Biomedical Research Council. His textbook, Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, co-written with John M. C. Gutteridge, is considered \\"an authoritative text in the field\\". His work is highly cited; in 2011, eight of his research articles had each received over a thousand citations. Research Halliwell is known for his work on the control of free radicals in biological systems. His earliest research was in plants, where with Christine Foyer and others in 1976, he discovered the glutathione‚Äìascorbate cycle (also known as the Foyer‚ÄìHalliwell‚ÄìAsada pathway) by which chloroplasts remove damaging hydrogen peroxide. He subsequently focused on the role of free radicals in human diseases, demonstrating the toxicity of the hydroxyl radical, a metabolite of superoxide, and investigated the involvement of metal ions, including iron and zinc, in this process, as well as the protective effect of their sequestration. He has also worked on reactive nitrogen species. He developed methods to measure free radical levels in vivo and to quantify the damage they cause to DNA. He has also researched dietary antioxidants. As of 2018, his research focuses on the role of free radicals and antioxidants in human disease, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders. His interests include the characterisation of redox biomarkers for the identification of human diseases, molecular nutrition, the role of transition metal ions as promoters of radical reactions in vitro and in vivo, the development of drugs to prevent oxidative cell damage, the chemical nature of antioxidants in vivo, methods for the specific detection of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in vivo and their application to human disease, particularly stroke and neuro-degenerative diseases and ageing in humans and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Awards and honours Halliwell was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012. He was dubbed a \\"Research Pioneer\\" by the journal Antioxidants & Redox Signaling in 2011. Other awards include a lifetime achievement award from the American Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine (2008) and the Ken Bowman Research Award from the Canadian Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences (2011).
