Early life and education Carolyn Schnurer was born in New York City on January 5, 1908 as Carolyn Goldsand.Fashion Encyclopedia As a young woman, Schnurer studied at the New York Training School for Teachers. She taught art and music at a public school, where she would occasionally design styles as part of her work. She married Harold Teller \\"Burt\\" Schnurer, a bathing suit designer, in 1930, who encouraged her to pursue fashion design instead of teaching. Schnurer received her B.S. degree from New York University (NYU) in 1941. Schnurer studied fashion at the Traphagen School of Fashion class of 1939 in Costume Design. Fashion career Red dress and stole by Carolyn Schnurer, Ladies' Home Journal, 1948 Carolyn Schnurer is best known for her beach and play clothes, particularly her cotton bathing suits as opposed to the more common knit bathing suits. Schnurer was also noted for her culturally-inspired resort collections. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Schnurer's globally inspired designs were not costumes, they \\"typically featured one or two understated thematic details in the cut or fabric, while maintaining a classic American silhouette.\\" In 1944, Schnurer traveled to the Andes for inspiration. According to the Milwaukee Journal, she covered \\"15,000 air miles of mountainous roads\\" during the trip. Schnurer's Andes-inspired collected was presented in 1945 as \\"Serrano Fashions.\\" The fashions used fabric familiar to American consumers in a range of light and dark colors. The cholo coat and pollera skirt were considered particular highlights of the collection. Over the years, Schnurer traveled to France, Ireland, Turkey, Japan, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Ghana, South Africa, and India for inspiration. According to Richard Martin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Schunrer was a \\"devoted researcher\\" who consulted museum experts before creating her collection. In 1956, Schnurer's fashion line was reportedly making seven million dollars a year in sales.

Biography Libous began his political as a Binghamton City Council, representing the city's North Side. He was first elected Mayor of Binghamton in November 1968. He ultimately served three consecutive, four-year terms as Mayor from 1969 until 1981. Libous greatest challenge as mayor was the decline of the both city's downtown business district, as well as the continued loss of population to the suburbs. In particular, the opening of the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City lured retail stores and consumers away from Downtown Binghamton during the 1970s and 1980s. In response, Libous tried to persuade a Canadian developer to construct downtown, but the deal fell through after negotiations and several false starts. The failure of the development led to a further decline of downtown businesses. (The present-day MetroCenter now stands on the same site as the proposed development). Mayor Libous and the city government were also unable to stop Binghamton's demographic decline during the 1970s and 1980s, despite their efforts to revitalize the downtown and lure new business developments. The population of Binghamton had already declined 20% from 81,000 in 1949 to 64,000 residents by the time Libous took office as mayor in 1969. The flight to the suburbs, such as Chenango and Vestal, continued throughout the 1970s, posing huge logistical challenges to the city and the Libous administration. Binghamton's population dropped to 56,000 by the time Libous left office in the early 1980s. Libous is believed to have been one of the first politicians from the Southern Tier to host his own radio show. For years, he co-hosted a talk show with his friend and political rival, Walt Fedorich, a Democratic city councilman who represented Binghamton's First Ward. In 1974, Libous ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from New York's 27th congressional district, which included Binghamton at the time. However, Libous was defeated in the general election by Matt McHugh, a Democrat, in the 1974 general election McHugh placed first with 83,562 votes, defeating Libous, who garnered 68,273 votes. Libous also made an unsuccessful bid for County Executive of Broome County, New York, but lost the Republican primary election to Carl Young. Libous did not seek re-election in 1981 and retired as Mayor after three terms in office. He was succeeded by Democrat Juanita Crabb, who won the mayoral election on November 3, 1981, to become the city's first female mayor. Throughout the rest of his life, Libous was referred to as \\"Uncle Al\\" in local political circles, in reference to his nephew, State Sen. Thomas W. Libous, who represented the area in the New York State Senate from 1989 until 2015. Al Libous died on June 30, 2016, at the age of 88. His nephew, former state Senator Thomas W.

The name Qhubeka means \\"to move forward\\" in Nguni. Qhubeka provides bicycles for children to attend schools, and for adults to attend work, with estimates suggesting a 75% reduction in commuting time and 23% higher attendance at schools for people given a bicycle by the Qhubeka. In order to be given a bicycle, the recipients are first required to take bicycle safety and maintenance training courses. The organisation also donates one bicycle for every 100 trees grown, or for every ton of rubbish collected. Qhubeka has donated over 100,000 bicycles. In 2013, the organisation became part of the World Bicycle Relief, and in November 2013, RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro d'Italia, donated 58 bicycles to Qhubeka.

Biography William was born in London, the son of architect William Whitfield Hemsley and Caroline Amelia Hemsley. He was sent away to preparatory school in Brighton at a young age, and began to develop an interest in art through painting portraits as a teenager. Upon his return to London, he began to train in his father's profession and found employment as a drawing clerk in the office of John Crake. However, he continued to be drawn to art, and left early in his career in order to paint professionally. He began to exhibit at artistic societies, and his works were regularly reported upon in The Art Journal. Hemsley's technique was compared to the Dutch style, but attention was also drawn to his \\"love for fun\\". Many of his works depicted rustic domestic scenes, leading to him being described as \\"pre-eminently the painter of cottage life\\". In 1859, Hemsley was elected to the Society of British Artists, and served as the Vice President of the organisation, which later became the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA), for many years. He was also a steward of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution. For most of his adult life, Hemsley resided in London, including at 5 Marlborough Street, and at addresses in Chelsea and South Kensington. He also undertook numerous study trips abroad, including to France and Holland. Exhibitions Between the years of 1848 and 1880, Hemsley exhibited 120 works in major London exhibitions, at the Royal Academy, the British Institute and the Society of British Artists' Suffolk Street gallery. A number of his paintings were featured at the 1862 International Exhibition and the Exposition universelle de 1867, world's fairs held in London and Paris respectively, as well as at other British galleries including Manchester Art Gallery and Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery. Reproductions of his paintings appeared in the Illustrated London News, Illustrated News of the World and The Art Journal. Today, Hemsley's paintings can be found at the Wellcome Library in London, and as part of public collections in Bath, Birkenhead, Hull, Leeds, Southport, and Wolverhampton.

A genus of Antarctic cyanobacteria, called Wilmottia was named after her in recognition of her work in this field. Early life and education Wilmotte completed her MSc (Botanical Sciences) at the University of Li√®ge in 1982. Her thesis investigated the use of epiphytic marine cyanobacteria as indicators of pollution of Calvi Bay, Corsica, France. She subsequently completed her PhD in Botanical Sciences from the University of Li√®ge. The title of her thesis was \\"Contribution to the taxonomic and ecological characterisation of marine epiphytic Oscillatoriaceae (Cyanophyceae) of the experimental cultivation and nucleic acid studies\\". Career and impact Wilmotte, currently Research Associate of the FRS-FNRS, working at the University of Li√®ge, has recognized research experience in the isolation, cultivation, and characterisation of cyanobacteria by phenotypic and genotypic methods, has contributed to the molecular taxonomy of cyanobacteria and has highlighted the importance of Antarctic microbial diversity. Her polar work concerns the microscopic and genotypic diversity of cyanobacteria in Antarctic microbial mats (MICROMAT, LAQUAN, AMBIO) and the use of fossil DNA for cyanobacterial paleodiversity reconstruction (HOLANT). Willmotte is coordinating the BELSPO project CCAMBIO using high-throughput methodologies to investigate the microbial biodiversity and biogeography in lacustrine benthic mats at the scale of the Antarctic continent. She also was involved in the study of the diversity of picoplanktonic cyanobacteria in the Southern Ocean and Arctic Sea. Since 2011, she has been the promoter and curator of the BCCM/ULC public collection of cyanobacteria, a dedicated public collection, currently containing one of the largest collections of documented subpolar cyanobacteria worldwide. The collection accepts deposits of polar cyanobacteria and allows their distribution to scientists and industries, for further research. Wilmotte has been the Belgian delegate to the Committee for Environmental Protection at the Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty since 2008.

Its boundaries were created in April 2013, with the name selected in respect to the ‚Äòlong established local name‚Äô. Its southern boundary was altered in November 2013 with the addition of land from Hawker and the transfer of land to Shaggy Ridge. The sites of the government towns of Edeowie and Mernmerna are also within its boundaries. These were both surveyed in 1863; Edeowie Post Office was open from c. 1870 to 1876 and from 1879 to 1881, while Mernmerna Post Office was open from 1874 to 1881 and again for a period in 1905. Flinders Ranges consists of the part of the mountain range between the ‚Äòtown centre‚Äô of Hawker in the south and the 'town centre' of Parachilna in the north, as well as some land to the west of the range. In the north east it contains all of the protected areas of the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park and Bunkers Conservation Reserve, whose eastern boundaries align with that of the locality. The Marree railway line and The Outback Highway both pass through the west side of the locality while the Flinders Ranges Way passes through the south-east side. As of 2012, its land use was either pastoral farming or conservation. The Marree railway line is the boundary between these uses, with pastoral farming to the west and land to the east zoned for conservation, including the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park and the Bunker Conservation Reserve. Flinders Ranges is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral districts of Giles and Stuart, the Flinders Ranges Council and the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia.

It is a classic and pioneering work on agrarian history in colonial Mexico, a point of departure for later studies of Mexican haciendas sparking a discussion on whether they were fundamentally feudal or capitalist. Education and career Chevalier was a student of geography at the University of Grenoble (1933‚Äì36). He became a doctoral student of French historian Marc Bloch and developed interests in accord with the Annales School. During World War II, Chevalier was resident in Madrid at the Casa de Vel√°zquez, with the aid of anthropologist Paul Rivet. In Spain, Chevalier began pursuing his interest in the agrarian history of Mexico using the Archivo General de Indias in Seville. Between 1946 and 1949 he was a fellow of the in Mexico City. During this period he developed his theory concerning the formation of the great landed estates (haciendas) in Mexico. This subject was developed in his doctoral dissertation, directed by Marc Bloch, which he completed in 1949. It was revised for publication in French by the in Paris (1952).

Chevalier spent considerable time in Mexico. He had contacts with Mexican historians including Jos√© Miranda, , , and Moreno as well as intellectuals visiting Mexico, including Woodrow Borah, Marcel Bataillon, , and Claude Dumas. While in Mexico, Chevalier worked in the Archivo General de la Naci√≥n and in regional archives in Guadalajara, Zacatecas, Monterrey, and Puebla.

He visited the isthmus of Tehuantepec, coast of Michoacan, and the highlands of Jalisco, as well as Veracruz, Puebla, Nayarit, and Aguascalientes. During his travels and researches, he accumulated a huge personal archive of photos and notes, which became the basis for his book Viajes y Pasiones.Fran√ßois Chevalier, Viajes y pasiones, voyages et passions‚Ä¶ Images et souvenirs du Mexique rural (with Javier P√©rez Siller.

With the help of Hispanist , the Spanish literature department at the University of Bordeaux hired Chevalier. He taught courses on Mexico from the prehispanic period to the Mexican Revolution, especially emphasizing issues of land tenure.

He died in Paris on 6 June 2012. Impact of Chevalier‚Äôs work Chevalier's publication on the development of the great landed estate in colonial Mexico grew out of his doctoral dissertation under the direction of Marc Bloch. When it was published, it was recognized as a major contribution to Mexican history. Relatively few works in French at the time were translated to Spanish or English, but Chevalier's merited having a wide scholarly readership and was translated into both. Chevalier's publication built on earlier work by Mexican historians, such as Silvio Zavala, Jes√∫s Silva Herzog, and others, but his book applied the model of the medieval landed estates in France, ‚Äúemphasizing the politico-institutional dimension highlighted by his own teacher, Marc Bloch.\\"Eric Van Young, ‚ÄúRural History,‚Äù p. 330 fn. 9. Chevalier viewed the landed estate's development by elites was as much as anything a ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù impetus, to show one's status whether or not the estate was profitable.Chevalier, La formation des grands domains au Mexique, p. 231. In 1983, Van Young wrote a major historiographical article taking Chevalier's work as the point of departure, saying that ‚ÄúThirty years ago, Fran√ßois Chevalier told us everything we had always wanted to hear about \\"men rich and powerful\\" and the classical Mexican hacienda... Chevalier, with his painstaking approach to masses of previously unexploited documentation, who brought the great hacienda down from the level of abstraction to that of historical reality.‚ÄùEric Van Young, \\"Mexican Rural History Since Chevalier: The Historiography of the Colonial Hacienda,\\" Latin American Research Review, 18 (3) 1983; 5-62.

A fifth person was injured outside. The attacker was a 17-year-old asylum seeker, armed with a knife and hatchet. The state office of criminal investigations called it a terrorist attack with an Islamist religious motive. The attack happened at around 21:00 CEST on a train traveling on the line between Treuchtlingen and W√ºrzburg. The victims (a husband, wife, their daughter and her boyfriend) were from Hong Kong. A fifth victim, attacked outside the train, was a local woman. Fourteen witnesses were treated for shock. The attacker tried to flee and was shot dead by the SEK police tactical unit after they confronted him and he tried to attack them with the hatchet. German authorities later discovered evidence showing that the perpetrator, identified as Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, was in contact with a suspected Islamic State member and had originally been asked to drive a car into a crowd of people. Ahmadzai declined this suggestion as he was not able to drive the car. Instead, he told his contact that he would plan and carry out a train attack.\\"Germany Attackers Had Contact with Suspected IS Members\\", by Andreas Ulrich, Spiegel Online Details Late on 18 July 2016, a youth with a hatchet and a knife injured four Hong Kongers on a train in W√ºrzburg, Germany. A fifth person, a woman who was walking her dog, was \\"hit with the axe twice in the face\\" and seriously injured. The perpetrator was located by the police about from the train. As they approached him, he tried to attack and was shot dead. He reportedly shouted \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" during the attack, according to Oliver Platzer, a spokesman for the Bavarian Interior Ministry. Public prosecutor Erik Ohlenschlagern said police heard the attacker call out \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" in a recorded emergency call from a witness' mobile phone. On 20 July, it was announced the Attorney General Peter Frank had taken over the investigation, because it is believed \\"the assassin committed the offence as a member of the so-called Islamic State.\\" Perpetrator Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, born on 6 April 1999 (), also known as Muhammad Riyad, was reported to be a 17-year-old Afghan male who arrived in Germany as an unaccompanied child refugee in 2015. He first lived in a refugee camp in Ochsenfurt, then for two weeks with a foster family in Gauk√∂nigshofen southwest of Ochsenfurt, both in the district W√ºrzburg. German prosecutors learnt the perpetrator wanted to avenge the death of a friend who had been killed in Afghanistan. Die Welt reported that \\"he was a devout Muslim,\\" but was not perceived as fanatical. Amaq News Agency published a two-and-a-half minute video, allegedly of him speaking in Pashto, proclaiming himself a soldier of the Caliphate, threatening further ISIL attacks in \\"every village, city and airport\\" and holding a knife. German officials were checking if the man in the video was in fact the attacker. The Chief of the German Chancellery, Peter Altmaier, told ZDF television, \\"The security authorities expect that this video is in all likelihood authentic\\". Police found a hand-painted ISIL flag at his foster family's home, along with a letter he appeared to have written to his father, which they said read: \\"And now pray for me that I can get revenge on these non-believers, pray for me that I go to heaven.\\" Reactions Authorities temporarily closed the train line between Ochsenfurt and W√ºrzburg- Heidingsfeld. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said, \\"There are witnesses that suggest there may be an Islamic background to this but that is far from clear at this point.\\" Both he and Landeskriminalamt spokesman Fabian Hench declined to confirm the attacker said \\"Allahu Akbar\\". Herrmann said it did not appear the victims were targeted for being Chinese. On 21 July, Joachim Herrmann demanded stricter control of the German borders. People without valid papers had to be adhered and checked at the border. \\"We can't let it slide this way anymore\\", Herrmann said. Hermann also criticised slow asylum proceedings. No fingerprints were taken of the perpetrator and no hearing of him took place.Herrmann pocht auf strengere Kontrollen an Grenzen, Rheinische Post, 21 July 2016, in German German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack as an \\"incredibly cruel act\\" and promised that everything would be done by the authorities to prevent further attacks. Rolf Tophoven, director of the Crisis Prevention Institute in Essen told Le Monde that the perpetrator was \\"integrated\\" and wasn't known to police or intelligence agencies. He said he appeared to have been radicalised overnight, perhaps through frustration, hopelessness and online ISIL propaganda, and that the case appeared similar to that of Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who committed the 2016 Nice truck attack, or Omar Mateen of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, because of their lack of direct connection to ISIL. Amaq News Agency, an online presence associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, citing an \\"inside source\\", said the attacker was \\"a soldier of the Islamic State who executed the operation in response to calls to target nations in the coalition fighting the Islamic State\\". Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun- ying has condemned the attack as he dispatched a team of immigration officers to accompany the victims‚Äô relatives to Germany. The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Berlin dispatched staff to visit the injured. Leung said he was saddened by the incident and expressed his sympathy. The attack was linked to the European migrant crisis, and was reported to have raised more questions about Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy. The attack was compared to a knife attack at Hanover main station earlier that year on 26 February. Former federal minister Renate K√ºnast of the Green Party was ridiculed by police union chief Rainer Wendt as a \\"parliamentary smart aleck\\" for asking why the perpetrator was shot dead instead of arrested alive.

This centre is part of the Spanish Ministry of Culture, Historic Heritage and Museums of the town council of Grand Canary. Inside are found some of the most representative archaeological vestiges of pre-Hispanic Canaries, with characteristics unique within Spain. The Painted cave is considered as the \\"Sistine chapel\\" of the former inhabitants of the island, the Canarii.

The \\"official discovery\\" had to wait until 1873, when Jos√© Ramos Orihuela visited the cave. In 1876, Gregorio Chil y NaranjoGregorio Chil y Naranjo (Telde, Gran Canaria, 1831 - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1901) was a doctor, anthropologist and historian and one of the leading intellectuals on the Canary Islands at the end of the 19th century. He founded the Canary museum, to which he bequeathed most of his personal possessions. He was excommunicated in 1878 for his work on evolution in the Canary Islands entitled \\"Estudios historicos, climatologicos y patol√≥gicos de las Islas Canarias\\"; the Bishop of Barcelona, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Urquinaona y Vidot, declared the work \\"falsa, impia, scandalosa y heretica\\" and excommunicated the doctor. That same Studies became one of the key works on the Canary Islands and is still used as a reference to this day. briefly mentions the cave in his \\"Studies\\". In 1882 Diego RipocheDiego Ripoche Torrens (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1859 - 1927) studied the cave and his work made it known to the scientific community. He lived in Paris for many years. visited the cave and made drawings, some of which he may have sent to Ren√© Verneau. He also noted the presence of corpses, pots and other utensils. In 1884, Olivia StoneOlivia Stone was a British female writer. She visited the Canary islands between November 1883 and February 1884. visited the cave, made some drawings, wrote about it and suggested that the local government should acquire the site and take proper care of it. In 1887, French anthropologist Ren√© Verneau visited the cave. He wrote a detailed description in which he mentions the careful execution of each painted panel. The end of the 19th century is noted for a revival in the awareness of the importance of conservation issues for historical works. In the El Museo Canario review, chronicler Batllori y Lorenzo writes \\"Mi √∫ltima tentativa\\", a solemn appeal for the protection of the cave. Critics of the institutions' lack of action in that direction continue into the 20th century. But only in 1967 starts a public campaign in favour of the cave's protection - counting among its supporters Celso Mart√≠n de Guzm√°n and El√≠as Serra R√°fols. Meanwhile, the paintings were deteriorating. In 1970 the General commission of archaeological excavations (\\"Comisar√≠a General de Excavaciones Arqueol√≥gicas\\") started working on the protection of the cave, notably on the humidity that was causing much damage. This was completed with the construction of an enclosure to protect the cave - and the public. In 1972 the site was declared Monument historique artistique. El descubrimiento de la Cueva Pintada (\\"The discovery of the Painted cave\\"). Antonio Beltr√°n and Jos√© Miguel Alzola realized the first systematic study, published in 1974 with the first colour photographies and the most exact drawings to that date. This was another big step into spreading the knowledge of the existence of the cave among the specialists. It also helped determine the deterioration of the paintings. The plantations being watered nearby, the inadequate protection of the enclosure, the absence of planning for the visits, the chemical soil treatments for agricultural purposes and the inadequate ventilation of the premises were the main factors in increasing temperature and humidity in the cave and the subsequent damage on the paintings. Expropriation procedures were then started regarding the cultivated nearby land, and the site was closed to the public in October 1982.

Description  Facade of the museum and archaeological park of the Painted cave = The Painted cave = The cave is a superb example of artistic representations of the ancient natives of Gran Canaria. It and the village next to it are located in the town that used to be the capital of the island in pre-Hispanic times.Cueva Pintada de Galdar on gobiernodecanarias.org. Excavated by humans in volcanic material, its walls are decorated with geometrical patterns.Painted cave museum on grancanaria.com. The archaeologists think that, due to their regular distribution (usually in series of twelve), they could be a sort of calendar. It is also the only location on Gran Canaria that brought the proof of the existence of common wheat on the island (triticum aestivum or triticum durum, as it is difficult to tell the difference from the seed grain).The cueva de Don Gaspar (\\"Don Gaspar's cave\\" in Icod, Tenerife) has revealed grains of triticum compactum (\\"compact wheat\\"), barley (Hordeum vulgare L. polystichum) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Bethencourt (a French adventurer from Normandy who conquered 4 of the Canaries islands at the beginning of the 15th century) wrote that in Gran Canaria there were two harvests of wheat per year, without fertilizers. See Mederos Martin & al. (2002), p. 83. Note that Grand Canary is the only Canarian island to have painted caves. = Utensils = The site also bears remains of houses, in which have been found various utensils. The collection counts among other items some notable locally-made decorated ceramic pots and paintings. It also include some ceramics made on pottery wheel on the continent as well as coins, swords, horseshoes, nails, every day use items (thimbles, knives, etc.). Painted cave, the collections on cuevapintada.com. Most coins are from the 15th and 16th centuries. It seems that all metal items were imported. Painted cave, imports on cuevapintada.com. Guanche ceramics at the Galdar Painted Cave Some pots are large and were used for storage; others were used for cooking. The local pottery was hand- made, with many of them presenting a finely polished surface and decorated with paint, generally ochre red applied before firing them in a hole in the ground. Some pots are entirely covered with geometrical patterns, in some cases including the bottom of the pots. Painted cave, the recipients on cuevapintada.com. Note that Gran Canaria is the only Canary island where painted pottery has been found. Am√©lie A. Walker. Beyond the Beaches of Gran Canaria - Galdar. October 29, 1999. Beside these, are some fired clay statues of idols with human and animal figures. Most of the human idols are feminine and many are associated with maternity. In some cases the statues' bodies have been decorated with red paint and some incisions mark the hair. These could be simple offerings, amulets or toys. Painted cave, idols on cuevapintada.com. There are needles, stamps and spatulas made of sheep or goat bones; the needles are related to the making of leather clothes; the stamps and spatulas were pottery tools. Painted cave, other finds on cuevapintada.com. Objects made of stone have also been found. The stones most used are basalts, phonolites and obsidians. The stones were worked to create sharp edges with which to work other raw materials (wood, bone, skin/leather) or to carry out other works such as meat cutting or food preparation. Basalt was also used to make mortars, some round and some of elongated shapes. Some round mortars were used to grind grain for flour, some others for the red ochre that was used for the paintings and to decorate the pots. Painted cave, stone items on cuevapintada.com. = The settlement = The site, outside view (looking N-W) Over twenty years of excavations have unveiled a whole settlement beyond the Painted cave. A whole hamlet used to spread from the bottom of the valley up to the present city centre. This was one of the neighbourhoods that constituted pre-Hispanic Agaldar. The hamlet was occupied from the 6th century until the 11th century, and again from the 13th century until the 16th century and the Spanish conquest of the island. Painted cave, the village on cuevapintada.com. The houses were quadrangular and were surrounded outside by circular walls. They had one or two lateral bedrooms, opening towards the south through a small corridor. The bedrock was used to lean walls against it, and was worked to form a flat floor in the houses. The floor was further covered with packed earth or, in some cases, of stones sometimes coloured with red ochre. Painted cave, the houses on cuevapintada.com. The walls were made either of basalt or of well-dressed blocks of tuff. Nearly all the houses have kept remains of mortar and of paints of various colours that decorated the rooms. The enclave has an important role in the understanding of the final stage of pre-Hispanic Canaries - before the conquest - and the incorporation of the island to the crown of Castille. It is of note that some of the main artificial cave sites of the island are located in the relative vicinity of the Painted cave (cuevas del Hospital, Huertas del Rey or the Audience cave in the Four Doors cave site).Although a few caves were dug in isolated locations, most of them are near the sea coast and are concentrated, often in large groups. (source: Mederos Martin & al. 2002, p. 61).  Dating the site  The first carbon-14 analysis made on the cave was on the wall paintings. This gave no results because the paint used carried no trace of carbon, being entirely non-organic (ochre). Then some vegetal remains of a plant from the family Lauraceae were found in the mortar in the walls. These remains were analysed by the CSIC laboratory and that of the French CNRS, and dated between 1049 and 1257 A.C. Some fragments of pine tree were dated between 601 and 994.La cueva pintada de G√°ldar tiene mil a√±os (\\"The Painted cave is 1,000 years old\\"). El Mundo, 03/07/2013.

He grew up in London, the son of Tom Ellis, the Brutalist architect and was a student at Cambridge University 1965-70 under Sir Leslie Martin, Colin St John Wilson and David Roberts. While a student he ran the Architectural Society and invited numerous distinguished architects to speak including Louis Kahn, the Russian Constructivist Berthold Lubetkin and the American Jack MacAllister. In 1968 he and four other students drove 12,000 miles from London to Moscow and Leningrad and out through Scandinavia to research the work of the Russian Constructivist architects. At Cambridge he was also taught by Richard Saul Wurman (TED talks, etc.) who offered him a position in his office in Philadelphia in the summer of 1969 where he met his late wife Becky, an art historian. Early career On graduating, he worked in London for Lyons Israel Ellis (Tom Ellis' firm) on the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) Department of Photography and Communication building on Little Titchfield Street, London. He then returned to Cambridge and worked with David Roberts on a number of projects including an extension to the Fitzwilliam Museum and a Music Room for Trinity Hall. He then joined Richard MacCormac in London who had just started his practice MacCormac Jamieson Prichard (MJP) and worked on some of the early public housing projects the practice was well known for in Milton Keynes and Warrington New Towns. Move to California In 1977, Ellis and his family moved to the Bay Area where he has lived, worked and taught. He worked with a number of architectural practices including ten years 1982-92 Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz (KMD) where he was project designer for projects such as Stevenson Place, San Francisco, one of the earliest post-modern high-rise office towers, the iconic twin-towered Oakland Federal Building and the art- Deco inspired U.S. Bank Plaza (Sacramento). He worked from 1992 to 1994 with Anshen & Allen and was project designer for the Far East International Building Shanghai and the Kaiser Medical office building in San Francisco. Since 1994, Ellis has worked as a partner and Director of Urban Design with Daniel Solomon a San Francisco architect and teacher, who was one of the founding members of the Congress of the New Urbanism (CNU). In 2001 with Daniel Solomon and Anne Torney the practice was renamed Solomon Ellis Torney (Solomon ETC)Solomon ETC and from 2003-10 was an autonomous part of the Philadelphia-based firm Wallace Roberts Todd (WRT). In 2010 the practice joined the Seattle-based firm Mithun and became Mithun/ Solomon. Work with Daniel Solomon Ellis, Anne Torney and Daniel Solomon have specialized in the design of affordable housing and urban repair and have participated in the work of the Congress of the New Urbanism. They designed public and affordable housing master plans for several HOPE VI projects at Othello Station in Seattle, Hunters View in San Francisco and Jordan Downs in Los Angeles. The designs aimed to create mixed-income neighborhoods and to integrate previously marginalized communities back into the mainstream of American urbanism. They have also designed student housing for various universities including Weyburn Terrace and Glenrock for UCLA, and Escondido Village at Stanford University. In 2001 the firm undertook an ambitious plan to transform the Market/Octavia neighborhood in San Francisco after the demolition of the Central Freeway following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake into a demonstration project for urban repair. They also produced a master plan in 2004 for Coyote Valley in San Jose for the Greenbelt Alliance entitled 'Getting it Right' to demonstrate how to accommodate the projected growth in the area in a compact, transit- oriented, mixed-use design without resorting to sprawl. Other large scale urban design projects include that for Bin Hai in Tianjin in China which demonstrated how to build an urban fabric with small blocks and perimeter block urbanism in contrast to the conventional Chinese pattern of rows of south-facing slabs in vast superblocks. Teaching Ellis has taught part- time at UC BerkeleyJohn-Ellis  UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design since 1980 and used to be an Adjunct Professor at California College of the Arts, CCA (formerly CCAC) in San Francisco. In 2012 he was the inaugural Sir Arthur Marshall Professor of Sustainable Urban Design at Cambridge University Professor John Ellis ‚Äî Department of Architecture where he gave a series of public lectures and ran an urban design studio on master planning for Northwest Cambridge.

The organization was created in December 1928 under the name \\"Y Missionary Women\\" (\\"Y\\" referring to Brigham Young University (BYU)). In 1932, the name of the society was changed to \\"Yesharah\\", a Hebrew word meaning \\"upright, just, good, or pleasing\\". The Yesharah Society reached its peak in popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, but began to decline at the end of the 20th century. Although the organization still exists today, most of the chapters are beginning to fade away. Beginnings Single Latter-day Saint women have been missionaries for the LDS Church since 1898, when Amanda Inez Knight Allen and Lucy Jane Brimhall Knight received their calling to serve in the British Isles. However, the number of women serving missions for the church were few until the early 1920s. In 1915, the First Presidency, consisting of Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, and Charles W. Penrose, stated that they were \\"greatly in need of lady missionaries in the United States Missions\\". With a growing number of returning female missionaries, there became a both a need and a desire to form an organization of returned women missionaries. The Yesharah Society did not begin as an independent group, however. From 1915 to 1929, female returned missionaries were included with male returned missionaries in the Young Doctors of Divinity Club, or Y.D.D. On November 11, 1928, the YDD was invited to reorganize as part of the Friars' Club, an all-male Christian organization. An initial vote was taken by the Y.D.D. on the issue and the motion to join the Friars' Club failed. However, several of the male members of the Y.D.D. and the University of Utah Friars' Club attempted to push ahead with the reorganization anyway. Finally, BYU President Franklin S. Harris assessed the situation and stated that the Y.D.D. would only be able to reorganize into the Friars' Club if the \\"lady missionaries\\" were reorganized into their own club as well. The \\"Y\\" Missionary Women Consititution After Harris's announcement, the \\"lady missionaries\\" acted on their own before the Y.D.D was dissolved. In December 1928, returned sister missionaries of the Y.D.D invited other female missionaries to meet with them at the home of Amanda Inez Knight Allen, who held the prominent position of being the first single sister missionary for the LDS Church. There, under the direction of Barbara Maughn Roskelly, this group of women formed the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" group, electing Allen as the first president. Some of the initial members of the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" included, along with Allen and Knight, Elizabeth Souter, Georgia Maesar, Anna Boss Hart, Alice Louise Reynolds, and others. In the earliest years of the group there were approximately 40 members. Out of these 40 initial members, 34 were single and only six were married. Although the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" reorganized itself before the Y.D.D. could vote to exclude them, it was not something that the Y.D.D. women originally wanted to do. Re-organization was something that they fought against, and it would remain a bitter memory for the Yesharah Society even into the late 1950s. At its founding in December 1928, the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" took part of the Friars' Club Constitution and placed it word-for-word in their own. The plagiarized statement outlined the intentions of the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" as to \\"keep ever paramount in the lives of its members the high and worthy ideals [of manhood] which they have promulgated while active in the missionary field\\" and to \\"promote educational, cultural, and social development in the members of the organization\\". To these first two purposes copied from the Friars' Club, the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" added three others: \\"1) To be a sister in very deed to each and every member, 4) Uphold the ideals and promote the interests of the educational institutions with which this organization shall be affiliated, and 3) Give special encouragement to our sisters laboring in the mission field.\\" The qualifications to be a member of the organization were threefold: to have been \\"regularly called to and honorably released\\" from an LDS Mission, Be in good standing with the church, and be affiliated with BYU. From the beginning, the emphasis of the organization was placed on missionary work. The \\"Y Missionary Women\\" rejected the word \\"club\\" so that it would be clear that the women were to be a missionary organization with local chapters. Organization of the Yesharah Society In 1932, at the suggestion of BYU professor Sidney Sperry, the \\"Y Missionary Women\\" changed its name to \\"Yesharah\\". \\"Yesharah\\" is a Hebrew adjective meaning \\"straight, upright, just, righteous, good, and pleasing\\". At this time, the new society further organized itself. The Yesharah Society's revised 1932 Constitution stated that the organization's executive officers would consist of a President, First and Second Vice Presidents, Recording Secretary-Treasurer, and a Corresponding Secretary. In addition there were to be three committees within the society: The membership committee, program committee, and project committee. The annual dues at the time were $2.00 per member, and members were to be organized in to more local chapters, the first of which was the Provo Chapter. The emphasis within the newly named society continued to be missionary work. The Yesharah Society maintained a standard of high ideals, as characterized by a 1932 Yesharah Poem: Should mission memories be forgot and never brought to mind? Should we forget the days we spent in service to mankind? Oh know we'll strive our very best to ever keep in mind. The lessons we to others taught, the way of life to find. And here's a vow, my sisters true we'll make anew this day That we shall teach in faith and love the truths that point the way. The Yesharah Society's Constitution ensured that the organization would remain professional and purpose-centered, specifying that the Constitution and by- laws were to be read biannually, and that all meetings would be conducted according to Roberts Rules of Order. As the Yesharah Society evolved and its purposes changed in the following years, its Constitution reflected those changes.

In 1760, she became acquainted with Giacomo Casanova, who made her a horoscope claiming that she would be the lover of the king. Her sister Marie-Madeleine Couppier-Varnier was a courtesan in Paris and connected to Dominique Guillaume Lebel, who provided the king with lovers for his Parc- aux-Cerfs. =Royal mistress= She became the petite ma√Ætresse (unofficial mistress) of the King in 1760, but she refused to become one of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, were at the time Marguerite-Catherine Haynault and Lucie Madeleine d'Estaing were housed. Instead, she successfully demanded to be given her own house in Passy, close to the Ch√¢teau de la Muette, where the King visited her. Her house was called Hotel de la Folie. The King gave her the title baronesse de Meilly-Coulonge. She had a son with the King: Louis Aim√© de Bourbon (1761-1787), who became a priest. The King registered himself as the father of the child, which was unusual, as while he did take responsibility for many of his illegitimate children, he normally did not acknowledge them. Anne Couppier de Romans called her son 'Monseigneur', a title for a Prince, and displayed him in public in the Bois de Boulogne. The special treatment given by the king to Anne Couppier de Romans, so unlike anything to any of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, reportedly worried Madame de Pompadour, and on one occasion, she visited the Bois de Boulogne to observe Anne Couppier de Romans and her son. =Later life= In 1765, Anne Couppier de Romans was implicated in the affair of Louis-Ren√© de Caradeuc de La Chalotais. The same year, the king discontinued their affair. She was separated from her son. She was given an allowance of 500.000 livres, more than any of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs. In 1772, she married Gabriel Guillaume de Siran, marquis de Cavanac (d. 1784). In contrast to most of the marriages of the lovers of the Parc-aux-Cerfs, hers was not arranged by the king. She had two children in her marriage prior to her separation. She left France during the French Revolution and lived in Spain during the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, she returned to France and reclaimed her property.

It presents the theme of the lone inventor who saves Earth from cosmic danger and introduces Humanity to an unknown civilization. The novel was adapted for film as The Terrornauts in 1967. Plot When satellite-tracking stations around the world begin receiving radio signals from deep space, Joe Burke, owner of a small engineering company, is about to propose marriage to Sandy Lund, a woman he has known since high school. The signals consist of a repeated series of flute-like notes, which Joe recognizes. Joe plays for Sandy a tape recording he made a year earlier and it sounds just like the signal from space. Joe explains that he got the notes from a lucid dream that has come to him off and on since he was eleven. In the dream he is on a world with two moons and trees with ribbon-like leaves and he is holding a strange weapon, a kind of recoilless pistol. In his shop he makes a modified version of the weapon and when he tests it, it breaks loose from the workbench and slams into a wall hard enough to shatter the bricks. Meanwhile astronomers trace the signal to an asteroid, M-387, and send a radio signal to it. In response the asteroid changes its signal. With the help of Holmes, a yacht builder, Keller, an electronics expert, and several workmen, Joe builds a small spaceship propelled by a reactionless drive based on his modification of the recoilless pistol. Just in time the ship is finished and, with Holmes, Keller, Sandy, and Sandy‚Äôs sister Pam aboard, Joe lifts off just as the police arrive to end the project. Pursued by Nike missiles, Joe takes the ship into space and heads for Asteroid M-387. After eleven days of travel they arrive at the asteroid and see only a radio mast and the entrance to a tunnel. When they fly their ship into the tunnel a door closes behind them, lights come on, and the tunnel fills with air and artificial gravity. Finding the air breathable, the five impromptu astronauts explore the asteroid. They discover that it is a vast, empty fortress with unknown weapons still in their racks and a control room where the fluting signal originates. In one room Joe finds thousands of small black cubes. When he dozes off next to one he has a lucid dream of taking part in a weapons drill. He understands that the dream that has obsessed him since childhood must have come from a fragment of a similar cube that had been found in a Cro-Magnon cave with artifacts dated to 20,000 B.C. Sandy suggests looking for cube readers, reasoning that learning from a cube by sleeping near it is inefficient. They find a pair of reading helmets and quickly begin learning all about the fortress, its weapons, and an implacable Enemy with which the garrison‚Äôs civilization may have been at war for 100,000 years or more. They also learn that the Enemy has sent a new attack, one that will rip apart the solar system in a matter of days. Using a procedure that Keller develops, Joe, Holmes, and Keller modify three hundred of the torpedoes they find in the fortress and launch them. The ten-foot spheres accelerate toward the enemy squadron at 160-gees, approaching the speed of light in little over two days. The torpedoes obliterate the Enemy‚Äôs squadron and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Then Joe notes that in a few centuries Humanity will have to go out into interstellar space to look for the Enemy. Allusions In The Wailing Asteroid Leinster makes tacit reference to three themes that are worth mentioning: The story of a lone inventor devising a reactionless space drive and then, with a small team, building a spaceship around it and taking to another celestial body provides the foundation of the adventure that H. G. Wells laid out in First Men in the Moon (1901). In what seems a remarkable coincidence, both The Wailing Asteroid and Edmond Hamilton‚Äôs The Haunted Stars (1960) present the human race as the descendants of an alien garrison, whose abandoned base astronauts discover on another body of our solar system. In a small side adventure, Joe Burke and his team are accidentally teleported to an alien planet many light years from Earth. They infer that the people who built the base on Asteroid M-387 had used spaceships cruising slower than light to carry ‚Äúmatter transposers‚Äù through space as a means of spreading themselves throughout the galaxy. Poul Anderson used that idea as the foundation for his story, The Enemy Stars (1959).

She was famously imprisoned in the Tour de Constance (Aigues-Mortes) from 25 August 1730 for attending a Huguenot assembly with her mother, or perhaps because her brother, Pierre Durand, was a well-known preacher, or perhaps because of her marriage. Early life Marie was born to Etienne and Claudine Durand from the hamlet of Le Bouchet near Privas in France. Her older brother Pierre became well known as a Huguenot preacher and pastor. Her father Etienne who was consular registrar of the parish was arrested in February, 1729. He was jailed in Brescou at the fort where he was interned for fourteen years. Marie married a much older man who was at least in his forties, Mathieu Serres, later that same year. Her father Etienne was finally released as ninety-two year old although he only had a further two years to conclude his ruined life. Her brother was caught on the road to Vermoux in 1732 and was hung at Montpellier in that same year. Imprisonment The formal reason for her arrest is unclear. E Audra writes: :\\"It seems this marriage was not approved of by her brother, perhaps because of the great difference of age. It seems also that it was neither solemnized by a catholic priest nor blessed by a pasteur, and that the couple, after having signed a marriage contract, which was duly registered, lived as husband and wife. Perhaps for that reason alone, perhaps because she was suspected of having been married by Pierre Durand, lastly perhaps because she was the sister of a pasteur wanted as a rebel to the King‚Äôs Will, she was imprisoned in the Tower of Constance, at Aigues- Mortes, in 1730, while Mathieu Serres joined his father-in-law in the fort of Brescou. Anyhow, she continued to be called and to call herself not Marie Serres, but Marie Durand.\\" Marie was not released until 1768, 36 years later after serving 38 years in the tower. Like Margaret Wilson simple abjuration was all she needed for release but this offer she refused. The word \\"RESISTER\\" scratched by her, or by one or others of her cell mates with a knitting needle into the stonework serves as an expression of her Protestant faith. She did not convert to Roman Catholicism. It has been argued that the authorities didn't attempt to convert her once she was imprisoned as she was allowed to correspond with her pastor. It is also recorded that she was asked every day whether she would abjure but daily refused. Letters About fifty letters by Marie Durand have been published. These include letters to her niece, Anne in Geneva who, \\"who, in the end, recanted in order to marry a rich catholic many years her senior.\\" She also wrote, in 1740, on behalf of other prisoners like the nine women from Vivarais complaining that ‚Äò During the ten years we have been here, nothing has ever been sent to us from Vivarais.‚Äô She added: ‚ÄòCharity is the true principle of our religion, and they ‚Äô ‚Äî meaning the people in Vivarais ‚Äî ‚Äò do not profess it.‚Äô She also wrote to Paul Rabaut, a Huguenot pastor in N√Æmes who looked after the prisoners. Jean Louis Bridel quotes some sections of her letters to her pastor for example: :\\"Sir, very dear and much honoured Pastor, it is to you we have re-course; it is to your pastoral kindness I apply for a remedy to prevent an infection which is likely to spread among us... In the name of the divine mercy, use every possible effort to rescue us from our frightful sepulchre. We are in urgent need of all the help you can give... May God bless you, worthy Sir, and your amiable family; may He protect you all and accomplish by your beloved hands the great work of His most desired peace, and grant me the blessing of the sweetest satisfaction I desire in this world, next to the peace of the church, the great pleasure of seeing you. My most respectful salutations to all who are dear to you; may you and the talent you have received from Heaven live again in them for ever. Burn my letter if you please. Have the goodness to pray for us, particularly for our sick; the health of nearly all of us is much affected.\\" Release, death and legacy Prisonni√®res huguenotes √† la Tour de Constance Marie Durand was released on 14 April 1768; she returned to her childhood home. Charles Tyler relates: :\\"The Walloon Church of Amsterdam allowed Marie a pension of 200 livres, which she generously shared with a neighbour, Alexandre Chambon, who had returned from the galleys of Toulon at the age of seventy-three. Marie died in September, 1776.\\" Prisonni√®res huguenotes √† la Tour de Constance, par Jeanne Lombard  References  * Mus√©e du Vivarais Protestant, Maison Pierre et Marie Durand, Le Bouchet, Pranles, 1711 births 1776 deaths 18th-century French people Huguenots ","title":"Marie Durand"},{"id":"51107908","title":"Lucie Koudelov√°"},{"id":"51107921","text":"Juliane (Juliana) de Fontevrault (1090 ‚Äì after 1136), was a French noble, the illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. She is notorious for attempting to murder her father. An account of these events can be found in the Historia Ecclesiastica by Orderic Vitalis.  Life  Juliane de Fontevrault was an illegitimate daughter of Henry I of England; her father, at her birth, was not yet king. Her mother is unknown, though some scholars have suggested the king's mistress Ansfrida (Ansfride).; She the mother of Richard of Lincoln and possibly Fulk FityRoy, two other illegitimate children of Henry. Orderic's description of Juliane's mother as \\"a concubine\\" questions her identification as Ansfrida. Juliane's half-siblings included Empress Maude, William Adelin, Sybilla, Queen of Scots and Robert of Gloucester. Juliane was married to Eustace of Bretuil, the illegitimate son of William of Bretuil, in 1103. They had at least two daughters. In February 1119, Eustace and Juliane threatened to join a rebellion against Henry I of England unless they were given the castle of Ivry. To ensure Eustace's loyalty, Henry set up an hostage exchange between Eustace and Juliane's daughters (Henry's own granddaughters), and the son of Ralph Harnec, Constable of Ivry. Perhaps instigated by Amaury de Montfort, Eustace cut out the eyes of Ralph's son and sent him back to his father. Ralph furiously appealed to Henry for justice. Henry allowed Ralph to blind Eustace and Juliane's daughters, as well as cut of the tip of their noses. The incident further estranged the king and his daughter. Enraged, Juliane journeyed to Bretuil to defend the citadel, where she found an unmotivated garrison. Informed of Juliane's actions, the king moved to Bretuil and laid siege to the citadel. Seeing no other solution, Juliane agreed to a parley with her father, but when she met her father, she unsuccessfully shot at him with a crossbow. He destroyed the drawbridge and forced her to surrender the castle, placing her in confinement. Determined to escape, she leapt from her castle tower into the freezing moat water and fled to her husband, who was at Pacy. The couple lost all their property except for Pacy. Bretuil was temporarily given to William, the son of Ralph Harnec, later to Richard of Lincoln and after his death to Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, who was married to a cousin of Eustace. Eventually, Henry pardoned Eustace and Juliane after they appealed to him on their knees. They were supported in their supplication by friends and Juliane's brother Richard. Eustace was granted three hundred silver marks each year as a compensation for Bretuil. He died in 1136, and Henry died on 1 December 1135. After the death of her husband Juliane retired to the abbey of Fontevrault. She lived to see early conflicts between her half-sister Maude and her cousin Stephen.  References  Sources * Judith A.

It is known to host four planets, all similar in size to Earth, with one of them residing within the habitable zone. Nomenclature and history K2-72 also has the 2MASS catalogue number J22182923-0936444. Its EPIC (Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog) number is 206209135. The star's planetary companions were discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. The name K2-72 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 72nd star discovered by the K2 mission to have confirmed planets. The designation b, c, d, and e derives from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, and e to the last. In the case of K2-72, there were four planets, so only letters b to e are used. At first the planets were all thought to be smaller than Earth. However, in 2017, new analysis by Martinez et al. and Courtney Dressing found that K2-72 was significantly larger than previous estimates, and found that the planets were all larger than Earth, although all are still expected to be rocky. Stellar characteristics K2-72 is a M-type star that is approximately 27% the mass of and 33% the radius of the Sun, according to the analysis done by Dressing et al. The results found by Martinez et al. suggest a larger star, with about 36% the radius and mass of the Sun. Both give a luminosity estimate between 0.013 and 0.015 solar luminosities. It has a surface temperature of between 3360 and 3370 K and its age is unknown. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 15.309. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye and can only be observed with a telescope.  Planetary system  The star is known to host four planets, all likely to be rocky. Only one (K2-72e) is currently known to reside inside the habitable zone, although K2-72c may straddle the inner edge.

Colbert was a well-educated girl living in France during and after the tumultuous French Revolution which caused her faith to deepen since she had the desire to aid the poor and neglected. Her marriage to a nobleman in Paris led to the two setting off to live in Turin where the couple threw themselves into charitable works. The couple bore no children but rather \\"adopted\\" the town's poor. Colbert was widowed some decades later and became professed into the Secular Franciscan Order while establishing hospitals and schools as well as other charitable institutions. Her cause for canonization opened in late 1990 (she became titled as a Servant of God) and culminated in mid-2015 when Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. Her husband's cause was opened in 1995 and he remains a Servant of God. Life Juliette Victorienne Fran√ßoise Colbert was born in Maul√©vrier on 26 June 1786 as the second of four children to the nobles Edouard Victurnien Charles Ren√© Colbert (15 December 1754-August 1839) and Annemarie Louise de Cr√©nolle (the couple married on 12 March 1782). Her father served as an ambassador for Maximilian Franz von √ñsterreich. Her ancestor was the former Finance Minister Jean Baptiste Colbert who served for King Louis XIV (either the great-granddaughter or descended from his brother). In October 1793 her mother died in Brussels leaving her father to care for the children. Her siblings (in order) were: * Elisabeth-Marie (11 February 1783 ‚Äì 19 April 1835) * Edouard-Auguste (d. November 1817) * Charles-Antoine (11 February 1793 ‚Äì 26 July 1859) Her father remarried on 19 April 1812 to Pauline Le Clerc and she had a half-brother in Ren√©-Oliver (b. 19 March 1813). Colbert studied art and music in her private studies and learnt Greek and Latin as well as English and Italian and German when the Colbert's lived there. The French Revolution forced her father to relocate with his children in 1793 to the German Kingdom before settling in Holland and Belgium (her mother died in Brussels); their return to France came after Napoleon Bonaparte assumed power. Upon their return their castle had been burnt down and their land had been laid waste. Colbert had been traumatized with the death of her aunt and paternal grandfather at the guillotine in 1794 (during the Terror) added with the death of her mother months before. In 1804 she served Empress Josephine in the imperial court where she first met her future husband. The two had in common a deep faith and desire to aid others though their temperaments were different: she was impetuous with a brilliant mind while he was gentle and reserved in nature. Colbert married the nobleman Carlo Tancredi Falletti di Barolo in Paris on 18 August 1806 and the couple later relocated to Turin (it was supposed to be brief but became a permanent arrangement) in 1814 after Napoleon's fall where the couple lived childless for the remainder of their lives together. Prince Camillo Borghese helped in mediating the union between the couple. The couple bore no children (both were infertile) but viewed the poor as their adopted children. It became the norm for her to help prisoners as well as poor girls and their mothers. Colbert created free schools with her husband for children and the first opened in Borgo Dora in 1821; she founded the Istituto del Rifugio for mothers in 1823 and an institute for victims of child prostitution later in 1833. In 1814 - during the Easter Octave - she encountered a Eucharistic procession to an ill person and knelt before the Blessed Sacrament. But a piercing scream broke the procession: \\"It is soup I need, not Viaticum!\\" This provocation from an inmate in a prison near the procession led Colbert to visit the prison where she was shocked from the degradation of the prisoners and their conditions. This moved her to help them. In 1834 she founded the Sisters of Saint Anne with the Archbishop of Turin Luigi Fransoni encouraging her work; she later founded the Daughters of Jesus the Good Shepherd. In 1835 she distinguished herself in aiding the ill during a cholera epidemic which saw officials award her with the Order of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro. Her husband contracted this which caused great concern granted his frail health at the time. The doctors advised that he seek treatment in Austria though his condition deteriorated after contracting a violent fever forcing the pair to stop in Verona. The pair moved for respite at an inn in Chiari in Brescia where he died in her arms on 4 September 1838. Colbert later provided the former prisoner Silvio Pellico with an annual pension from 1834 until his death in 1854 and she provided for the French translation of his published works. Pellico first served as the couple's librarian in 1834 and the two became good friends with Pellico who became Colbert's private aide in 1838 after her husband died. In 1845 she opened the Hospital of Saint Filomena for handicapped children and in 1847 established a vocational school for aspiring workers. Colbert often wore a hair shirt of coarse horsehair as a penitential practice. Colbert became a professed member in the Secular Franciscan Order at some stage after her husband died. It was around this stage that her spiritual director was Giuseppe Cafasso. In 1862 the election for a new superior-general was held and the Sisters of Saint Anne saw fit to elect Caterina Dominici. In 1845 she travelled to Rome for six months in the hopes of expediting her claim for papal recognition of her orders. Colbert succeeded in this venture and Pope Gregory XVI provided canonical recognition in a decree on 8 March 1846 not long before the pontiff's death. Colbert was close friends with Madeleine Sophie Barat and supported the efforts of Giuseppe Benedetto Cottolengo in social activities. But she also came into contact with Giovanni Bosco and asked him to serve as a chaplain for the Istituto del Rifugio. But his ill health sometime after proved a challenge since he refused to abandon the girls prompting Colbert to ask him to leave so as to take care of his own health. Her death came in 1864 after having fallen ill in October 1863 and her remains have been housed in the Santa Giulia church since 1899 after their transferral. Colbert had founded not long before her death the Opera Pia Barolo in order for that institute to be able to continue her work; she had left her entire fortune to that institute. =Barolo wine= The couple were both identified with the famous Barolo wine. It had long been rumored that the wine had been produced in Turin at their estate but at that point had never been sold on the market. Once the King Carlo Alberto joked with her and asked if it were true that the wine was produced there. It was within the week that she sent out several ox- drawn carts to the palace with 325 barrels for the king. Colbert offered it to her guests and to reigning monarchs. Beatification process The cause for canonization opened on 17 November 1990 under Pope John Paul II and she became titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued an official edict declaring \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against the cause). The diocesan phase of investigation was inaugurated under Giovanni Saldarini on 21 January 1991 who later closed it on 4 July 1994; the C.C.S. later validated this process on 13 January 1995. In 2009 the postulation submitted the Positio dossier for further assessment with historical advisors issuing their assent on 27 October 2009 to the cause. Theologians affirmed their support for the cause on 1 April 2014 following their assessment of the Positio with the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also approving it on 21 April 2015. Colbert became titled as Venerable on 5 May 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin friar Paolino Rossi. References Further reading * Melun, Armand Marie Joachim. La marquise de Barol: sa vie et ses ≈ìuvres.

It is a much-branched shrub with short, narrow leaves and feathery red or red and yellow flowers with long styles in spring and early summer. Description Verticordia pulchella is a shrub with many spreading branches, which grows to a height of and wide. Its leaves are rough, linear in shape, long and more or less circular in cross- section. The flowers are arranged in rounded groups on the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, hairy and rough near the base. The sepals are long, spreading, bright red or rarely, white, with many long hairs around the edges. The petals are a deep pink, sometimes yellow or creamy-coloured, long, erect, egg-shaped to almost round with short hairs around their edge. The style is long, curved and slightly hairy near the tip. Flowering time is from October to December. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia pulchella was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (pulchella) is a Latin word meaning \\"pretty\\" or \\"rather pretty\\" referring to the appearance of this species. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Intricata along with V. monadelpha and V. mitchelliana.

History The clocktower of the municipal palace/hall The first political authority within the region was founded on 4 August 1507, with the first official minutes conserved in the municipal archives dating to 5 January 1555. Between 1563 and 1564, there was a combined seismic and volcanological event resulting in complete destruction to the community and the original municipal hall. Work on a municipal building began in the 17th century and included a subterranean jail with successive floors. By 17 February 1796, there was a decision to construct two arches over the Rua das Espigas and, above them, build rooms for prison officers. The representatives also left space aside, in the most convenient place, to build a chapel for masses for the prisoners. At the same time, it was decided to construct a tower and install a clock. In this sequence, a wing was constructed forming a passageway over the public accessway and a clock tower, to shelter the prison officers and his inmates, along with bells and municipal clock. Between 1860 and 1864, the public gardens were installed in front of the municipal hall. By the 1930s, the interior of the building was remodeled, resulting in the construction of interior staircase, the placement of stained-glass window to illuminate the same, and the installation of the ceiling in the main hall. The ashlar azulejo tiles were installed in the main hall in 1936, by Jorge Rei Cola√ßo. In 2006, a detailed plan to safeguard the historic center of the city was instituted, that included the medieval municipal palace/hall. Architecture The three- story ex-libris of Ribeira Grande, with covered archway and clocktower The municipal hall is situated in the city of Ribeira Grande, fronted by the gardens of the Pra√ßa Hintze Ribeiro (also known as the people's garden) and alongside the walls and grade of the Ribeira Grande river. Immediately nearby are the Church of the Miseric√≥rdia, Church of the Holy Spirit and Church of Nossa Senhora da Estrela (the parochial church of Ribeira Grande) in the east and the Ribeiragrandense Theatre in the southwest. The building is the ex- libris of the city, consisting of a three-story structure linked by archway to a right, lateral clocktower. The principal corp of the building is a rectangular plan with access by a symmetrical staircase that includes large balusters to the entrance, flanked by windows. The body is surmounted by three windows with verandas. Over the staircase is a tunnel-like passage that allows access to the subterranean floor, with an entranceway door surmounted by a lintel with the municipal coat-of-arms flanked by two diamond forms, linked to the top floor balcony console. On the facade are more contemporary windows, including rounded window (with flag and geometric motives), situated on upper left corner and window illuminating the staircase. The second, less profound, corp of the structure is situated on the right-hand side, dominated by the tower, and forming an arched \\"bridge\\". The ground floor is primarily substituted by a framed arch of grand dimensions that allows the passage of a road. On the principal facade of the upper floors are two windows with varanda and two with guillotine-style windows, while the rear have simple unframed windows. Within the main hall of the building are azulejo tiles representing the watermills, the traditional Cavalhadas de S√£o Pedro, feasts of the Holy Spirit, tea plantations, the former municipal coat-of-arms (dating to the constitutional monarchy) and Gaspar Frutuoso. In addition is the historic pillory, as well as a collection of photographs of Portuguese chiefs-of-staff, beginning with Queen Maria II.

It played an important part in the history of the developing women's education in contemporary Sweden. History In 1859, the L√§rokurs f√∂r fruntimmer (\\"Learning Course for Women\\") was founded in Stockholm after the Herthadiskussionen (\\"Hertha Discussion\\"), about women's legal status and right to education which was caused by Fredrika Bremer's novel Hertha. The courses proved so popular that a permanent Female seminary, the Royal Seminary, was founded in 1861, employing many of the teachers of the Learning Course. In 1865, the Rossanderska kursen or Rossander Course was founded, inspired by its predecessor. The Rossander Course was founded by the sisters Jenny Rossander (1837-1887) and Alida Rossander (1843-1909), and named after them. Jenny Rossander was a personal friend of Fredrika Bremer and a contributor of the Tidskrift f√∂r hemmet, were she agitated in favor of the view that education for women would benefit society when they became mothers and raised their children: Alida Rossander was a pioneer as the first female bank official when she became employed at the Stockholms Enskilda Bank the year prior. The Rossander Course was organized in the same manner as its predecessor and role model, Learning Course for Women. The school was ruled by a board composed of Rossander, Fredrika Limnell, Anna Wallenberg and the noblewoman Ebba Lind af Hageby. Among its teachers were some of the teachers previously engaged at the Learning Course for Women and Royal Seminary, such as professor Alfred Fock, Louise Sund√©n, Ebba Gregerson, professor Lorentz Dietrichson, Frans Hultman, doctor Christian Lov√©n, Emil Key as well as the Rossander sisters themselves. The subjects were the same as in the Learning Course for Women: religion, natural science, mathematics, history, grammar, literature, French, personal hygiene, and drawing, but in contrast to its predecessor, it also offered language, which had been excluded by Learning Course for Women because it was the only serious subject normally provided by conventional girl schools. The students were divided in \\"students\\" (who studied with the purpose of graduating) and \\"listeners\\" (who wished to hear the lectures for recreational reasons), and the method of education were lectures, home assignments and interrogations. The course was almost free, with only an almost symbolic fee, used to finance the upkeep of the localities. The Rossander Course was popular and mentioned as a valuable opportunity for adult women to complete their education, particularly female teachers. Many students were to become well known figures in Swedish society, such as the feminist Ellen Key, the educators Eugenie Steinmetz, Hilda Myrberg and Hildur Djurberg, and the suffragist Anna Whitlock. In 1879, Jenny Rossander married the Swiss doctor baron Friedrich von Tschudi and left the school, but her sister Alida Rossander managed the school until it was closed in 1882.

It is located about 217.1 light-years (66.56 parsecs, or nearly km) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= K2-72e is an Earth-sized exoplanet, meaning it has a mass and radius close to that of Earth. It has an equilibrium temperature of . It has a radius of 1.29 ., and a mass of 2.2 , depending on its composition. Orbit graphic with a table of simplified figures =Host star= The planet orbits a (M-type) red dwarf star named K2-72, orbited by a total of four planets, of which K2-72e has the longest orbital period. The star has a mass of 0.27 and a radius of 0.33 . It has a temperature of 3360 K and its age is unknown. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is unknown. =Orbit= K2-72e orbits its host star with an orbital period of 24 days and an orbital radius of about 0.1 times that of Earth's (compared to the distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU).  Habitability  The exoplanet, along with K2-72c, were announced to be orbiting in the habitable zone of its parent star, the region where, with the correct conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of the planet. K2-72e has a radius of 1.29 , so it is likely rocky. Its host star is a red dwarf, with about a fifth as much mass than the Sun does. As a result, stars like K2-72 have the ability to live up to 100‚Äì200 trillion years, hundreds times longer than the Sun will live. The planet is very likely tidally locked, with one side of its hemisphere permanently facing towards the star, while the opposite side shrouded in eternal darkness. It receives 11% more sunlight than Earth does, so any oceans present are potentially vulnerable to boiling away, therefore possibly reducing the chance of habitability.  Discovery  The planet, along with the other three planets in the K2-72 system, were announced in mid-July 2016 as part of the new results from the second mission of the Kepler spacecraft.

The group was led by Abu Wardah (also known as Santoso) until he was killed by Indonesian police on 18 July 2016. The group has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. MIT was proscribed by the United Nations Security Council under the Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee on 29 September 2015. The US Department of State has designated MIT as a terrorist organisation. MIT has largely carried out its operations within Sulawesi but has threatened to attack targets across Indonesia. The group's operations have typically avoided operations that would cause civilian casualties, but was reportedly involved in clashes between Muslims and Christians in Maluku province between 1999 and 2002. Uyghur links Turkish passports were used by Uyghurs who were seeking to contact Mujahidin Indonesia Timor. ISIS/ISIL aligned Uyghurs have been traveling to Indonesia to participate in terrorist attacks against Shia, Christians, and the Indonesian government, during a terrorist attack in Central Sulawesi, one Uighur, Farouk, was killed by Indonesian security personnel in November, and another Uighur terrorist, Alli, was arrested for plotting a terrorist attack. China has been contacted by the Indonesian government who sought assistance in confronting Uighur members of terrorist organizations in Indonesia. Indonesia arrested a possible suicide bomber named Ali, a Uyghur, on 24 December 2015. In Sulawesi on Tuesday 15 March 2016 two pro-ISIS Uyghurs in Indonesia were liquidated by Indonesian government forces. The Indonesians used bullets to kill them. The \\"Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ±\\" which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), denounced the Indonesian government and police for their killing of 2 Uyghurs who were members of \\"Doƒüu Endonezya M√ºcahitleri\\" (Mujahidin Indonesia Timor). 2 Uyghurs with suspected terror ties were killed in Sulawesi by Indonesian security forces on 8 April and the killings were condemned by \\"Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ±\\". The \\"Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ±\\" slammed the Indonesian government for hunting down four Uyghurs who illegally entered the country to join \\"Doƒüu Endonezya M√ºcahitleri\\" and accused the Indonesian government of attacking Muslims. A Uighur accused of terror ties was killed in Sulawesi by the Indonesian security forces on 24 April, for which the \\"Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ±\\" condemned the Indonesian government. In Poso Uyghurs were being instructed by Santoso, the head of Mujahideen Indonesia Timur. Faruq Magalasi, Mus'ab, Ibrohim, and Joko were the names obtained by the Indonesian media of Uyghurs being hunted by the Indonesian police. In Poso four Uyghurs were captured by Indonesian police after they illegally entered Indonesia via Malaysia and Thailand with forged passports. Death of members and Clashes On 18 July 2016, Indonesian forces claimed to have shot and killed MIT leader Santoso. Andika Eka Putra, one of the remaining members of MIT, was killed on 14 September 2016. Sobron was also killed by Tinombala Operation's Task Force on 19 September 2016.

Since both events were notable, both are covered in this article. January‚ÄìFebruary 2010 cold wave =January= January was in the southern part of the country the coldest for 23 years, the deep freeze of 1987. Some cold weather had finished 2009 and was followed with solid freezing temperatures during the first week of January. The December means were not by any means extreme, but the cold would gradually build up. The intense cold set in between January 7 and January 15, with Horn as far south as in northern G√∂taland recording an overnight low of and Hemavan in the north of the country recording . Relatively less extreme temperatures would follow during the second half of the month, until the final days of January saw another cold snap after some heavy snowfall on January 27‚Äì28. During the final three days of the month low temperatures fell below in most areas far south in the country. Link√∂ping recorded , which was the coldest temperature recorded on this location since the record-breaking 1942 cold wave. The end result of January was that capital Stockholm that is inside an urban heat island did not record a single temperature above all month. In √ñrebro the maximum temperature recorded was and in V√§ster√•s , which is very rare for an area so far south in Sweden. Remarkably, the far north of the country saw less severe January temperatures than during the 1961-1990 reference period. =February= February was colder than usual, although not matching the January extremes in the southerly parts of the country. The cold was shifted further north, with Nikkaluokta above the polar circle having a monthly mean of and an average low of . With means below Dal√§lven (the boundary between Svealand and Norrland) being between and in most cases the heavy snowfall was a larger issue. Westerlies mixed with the colder than usual air made snowfall abundant during the low-pressure systems' resurgence on the west coast. Although no February precipitation records were broken, an unusual amount of what fell came as snow in the southerly part of the country, where winter highs normally are above freezing. The frequent snowfall caused havoc for rail transport, with severe delays and cancellations of many lines. The night of February 22 was among the coldest of the entire cold wave, with Stockholm recording inside the urban heat island and being measured in √ñrebro. February 24 saw the coldest temperature of the winter being recorded in Naimakka in the far north with . March‚ÄìOctober From March onwards the temperatures slowly returned to normal. March is a winter month in the northern parts of the country, but apart from a reading in Pajala in the far north, no particular extremes were being seen. Sweden was affected less by the intense 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves than Russia, Finland or Germany were, although some hot temperatures were recorded and Lund had a July mean of and Stockholm had one of the hottest months in the country's history with . Unlike many other heat waves, the effects were rather local and did not affect the whole country. Such were the swings that Stockholm's 2010 values were in some ways comparable to inland areas in southern Ontario in Canada, known for its very continental climates. The summer peaked with a reading in M√•lilla on July 11. Afterwards, August and September cooled down fairly rapidly, but with October being unusually cold. November‚ÄìDecember cold wave =November= November 2010 was described as King Bore (very cold winter) moved south by SMHI, with tendencies of winter even in the deep south. The nature of November in the south is low diurnal temperature variation and lack of extreme cold, but significant snowfall occurred on several occasions quite far south in the country, and J√∂nk√∂ping, Link√∂ping, Uppsala and √ñrebro all recorded daily means below freezing. All of those cities are located inland, and in coastal locations means were above the freezing point, albeit not by much. Stockholm and Gothenburg both recorded 7 days with highs below freezing, something that is highly unusual for the country's big cities in November. Even more remarkable were the five ice days measured in Malm√∂, with southern Scania often averaging means above freezing even in January. In the north of the country the cold was rather intense even by winter standards. Out of SMHI's 100 selected monthly stations, the mean of Nikkaluokta was the lowest ever recorded for the month, and lower than its January normals. Nikkaluokta also saw a reading on November 24, which was the lowest in the country for the month. This, unlike the averages was not a national record. Pajala and Arjeplog were also notably new record lows for November. No such records were broken south or east of the mountain ranges and the surrounding highland forests, where Ulvsj√∂ in Br√§cke Municipality in J√§mtland saw a new record cold November with a mean. =December= The most extreme cold of the year relative to the normals came in December. Although January 2010 had been slightly colder than what was recorded in the south of the country, December is normally a month that is above freezing during daytime in southern Sweden due to its seasonal lag that a maritime climate brings. Although the month started out quite mild, temperatures plummeted to extreme cold as winter solstice and Christmas neared. Most of the month was solidly below freezing in the entire country, with a few bursts of mild air affecting the deep south. The cold just before Christmas was unprecedented this time of the year in many southern locations. Kalmar saw a record cold value, Kristianstad another record value, with √ñrebro nearly beating its December all-time record cold with , the coldest value for 124 years. During Christmas, the most extreme cold had swept north, with several coastal cities of Norrland recording temperatures around . This, albeit highly unusual, did not break any December records. Temperatures throughout the months in the northern parts of the country were quite far below normals, resulting in the cold wave being felt in the entire country. In the south, the New Year's Eve brought milder air, bringing temperatures just above freezing for that night. This marked the end of the cold wave in the south, with January 2011 being a normal winter month. The cold returned to normal levels further north as well, although winter temperatures there are more extreme than a cold wave in the south regardless. The coldest temperature of the month and year was recorded in Nikkaluokta on December 20, with . The fallout of December were a lot of new all-time low monthly mean temperatures in southern Sweden. The most extreme new record was set in Arvika, V√§rmland, with a monthly mean of and a low of . This was more than three degrees colder than the previous December record for the site and less than half a degree below the deep freeze of January 1987, in all possibly the coldest December month there since 1788. Among other new December record cold months were found in √ñrebro, Norrk√∂ping, Link√∂ping, Gothenburg, Malm√∂, Kalmar, V√§xj√∂, Kristianstad, Halmstad, Varberg, Bor√•s, V√§nersborg, Helsingborg, Ljungby, Visby and many maritime coastal stations such as Falsterbo, Landsort and the extreme points of √ñland. The reading of Helsingborg was also almost three degrees colder than the previous record. The full year The summer heat wave prevented all-time yearly cold records throughout the country in spite of the two cold waves. The nearest to a new all-time cold record was in Ljungby, which measured as opposed to the record of 1987. Although the year was colder than normal throughout the country, it takes a cool summer for those records to be broken, as were in 1942, 1985 and 1987. In spite of this, it is extremely rare for inland locations in G√∂taland in the south to record yearly means below , as was done at some stations such as J√∂nk√∂ping, V√§nersborg and Ulricehamn. The same was recorded in √ñrebro and V√§ster√•s further north, climates that most often are as mild as further south. The year 2010 was a blip in a warming tendency of Swedish winters, the following winters were often delayed by mild autumns, and brief in nature with mild Februarys. Regions Norrk√∂ping had a record cold December, with a new all-time low for the month being set on December 23 with . Also during the January cold wave, Norrk√∂ping did not go above freezing all month. In total, Norrk√∂ping had 158 frost days during the year. =Svealand= Stockholm did not set any cold records, but still had a colder year than usual, with the entire January month being below freezing. 136 air frosts were recorded throughout the year. In addition, Stockholm also had a very hot July, being most affected by the 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves than any other Swedish location. This moderated the yearly average, along with the urban heat island that always render milder overnight lows than in the rural M√§lar valley. √ñrebro had a record cold December, and the coldest temperature for decades set in January with . Considering the airport's rural setting farther from Lake Hj√§lmaren at a slightly higher elevation, temperature extremes in the city proper may have been slightly less severe, although these differences would be marginal. In total, √ñrebro recorded 171 air frosts in 2010. =Southern Norrland= Hudiksvall that normally has a very mild climate considering its northerly latitude saw one of its coldest years on record. Hudiksvall was the northernmost part of the country that saw a record cold December, although nearby Delsbo had seen a much colder value 17 years before Hudiksvall's weather station opened in 1932. Both cold waves also saw high snowfall. In total Hudiksvall had 179 frost days during 2010.

He was the son of Hiranyaksha and brother of Andhaka. In this birth as Hiranyaksha's son, he was slain by Lord Vishnu while his brother was killed by Lord Shiva. In one of his rebirths as per his karmic deeds, he was born as Kansa, son of Ugrasena the king of Mathura. His sister was Devaki and her son Krishna was an avatar of Vishnu. Krishna eventually killed Kansa in this birth.In the epic Ramayana Kalanemi was Maricha's son and minister of Ravana and was assigned to kill Hanuman. Etymology Kalanemi is a compound word made up of 'kala' which means \\"time\\", and 'nemi' which means \\"the felly of a wheel or a portion\\". It represents the time segment of the wheel of time that denotes \\"the afternoon leading to sunset\\". 'Kala' also means \\"black\\", perceived to be the asura Kalanemi who represents the period of darkness that \\"increases as day moves toward night and as the Dwapara yuga moves towards Kali yuga.\\" Previous birth of Kansa Marichi, mind born son of Brahma Krishna killing Kamsa According to Hinduism's Karma principle for the cumulative actions of bad and good deeds resulting in \\"blessings or punishments\\". His elder brother was Andhaka. Kalannemi had a daughter, Vrinda whom was married to Jalandhara. Kalanemi had six sons who in their previous birth had been the sons of Marichi, a manasputra (mind son) of Brahma, considered a demigod being associated with Indra and believed to be one of the maruts with \\"powers of storm and battle\\". Marichi was also considered to be a prajapati (\\"projenitor or grandfather\\") or even as one of the seven saptarishis who also represented seven cosmic principles. In another birth, the six brothers were sons of Kalanemi, and being pious they received a boon from Brahma that no one would kill them. But Hiranyakashipu cursed them to sleep in patala (the netherworld). After much pleading the curse was moderated and they were to be reborn as the first six sons of Devaki. In that birth, Kalanemi would be reborn as Kamsa, son of Ugrasena, and would be their uncle who would eventually kill them all. The six brothers made fun of Brahma as he had married Saraswati, his own daughter. This infuriated Brahma who cursed the brothers to be born as asuras, and thus they were reborn as the six sons of Kalanemi. The rebirth cycle continued over the aeons and Kalanemi was then born as Kamsa. Kalanemi's six sons had to have two more earlier rebirths before they were born as Kamsa's nephews. Narada had informed Kamsa that his birth was the result of a rape of his mother by a gandharva, called Dramila, and that was the reason that Kamasa's mother disliked her son and had cursed that he would be killed by a member of his own family. When his sister Devaki was married to Vasudeva, a divine voice told him that their eighth son would kill him. Kamsa wanted to kill his sister then only before she could bear any children. But her husband prevailed on Kamsa with the promise that he would surrender to him all sons born to them. Devaki and her husband lived in confinement and as soon as a child was born to them, Kamsa would kill the child. After killing the first six sons of Devakai, he thought that their seventh child died before he took birth but actually Devi Mahamaya put the seventh child in the garbha of first wife of Yasudeva, Rohini who was staying in Gokul. When Krishna was born as the eighth son then a divine voice told Yasudev to put his son in Gokul at the house of Nanda and Yashodha and take their daughter who was born at that night, with him. Everyone thought that eight child is a girl but Kamsa did not spare her. Trying to kill the girl child, she flew away, being an incarnation of Mayadevi, and before disappearing announced that Kamsa's death would happen soon. Kamsa's efforts to kill the child failed, and finally Krishna killed him during an ambush. As Kamsa was killed by Krishna, a divine person, he attained moksha due to his constant thoughts on Krishna.  In Skanda Purana  According to the Skanda Purana, after the churning of the ocean of milk when the divine nectar of immortality was denied to the daityas and danavas by Vishnu taking the form of Mohini, a battle ensued between the Devtas who had received the nectar and the asuras who hadn't. The Devtas were led by Indra, the king of Gods, and the asuras were led by sons of Virochana, initially by Bali, the chief of asuras, and later by Kalanemi. After Indra had slain Bali with a thunderbolt, his deputy Vrishparva who attacked Indra was also killed. Then Kalanemi, riding a lion as his mount, fiercely attacked Indra and his followers which unnerved the suras. They were then advised by Narada to seek the help of Vishnu as he only could kill Kalanemi who had immense powers acquired by meditation. On the request made by the Devtas, Vishnu riding his mount Garuda, attacked Kalnemi and felled him unconscious. Regaining consciousness Kalanemi realized that he was confronting Vishnu, accepted his defeat and requested Vishnu to grant him \\"beatitude\\" as he was defeated by a divine being. After Kalanemi was killed, Indra continued slaying Kalanemi's soldiers but Narada advised him to stop and let them go, because it is a sin to kill Brahmins.

A few weeks after receiving the position, Archer's house was raised and searched by the FBI as part of a secret John Doe investigation of current and former Walker aides. In April 2015, Anderson testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources. Secretary Anderson has also testified to the House Budget Committee. During the same month, Anderson was criticized for the extensive backlog of 2,800 child abuse and neglect cases within the Department of Children and families, as well as reports of high staff turnover of two resignations per month. In 2015, Anderson announced that the Department of Children and Families would not provide any benefits or services to any new refugees of the Syrian Civil War should they be placed in Wisconsin. In May 2016, Anderson delivered the commencement address at Cardinal Stritch University. Anderson penned a 2016 Op-Ed which stated, in part, \\"Studies show that the positive influences of family and marriage, and the structure of a stable home environment set the groundwork for children‚Äôs future success. Having a loving home with a mother and father who provide for their needs is a cornerstone to enhance family values. In 2017, Anderson was publicly criticized by law enforcement leaders in Cook County, Illinois for alleged agency negligence and mishandling in a case involving a runaway 17-year-old girl. During her time leading the Department of Children and Families, Anderson chaired the Secretaries' Innovation Group, a membership organization of conservative state human service and workforce secretaries advocating for \\"national solutions which favor healthy families, work, economic self- reliance, budget responsibility and limited government.\\" Personal life Secretary Anderson is married to Pat LeMahieu. She has adopted children and served as a foster parent.

The earliest known appearance of the song was in 1927. The song depicts various sexual escapades involving the title character, an unnamed Queen of Spain, a French king named Phillip, and the \\"Duke of Zippity-Zap\\" who gives the King a case of the clap. The song has a number of historical inaccuracies, since the last French king to bear the name Phillip died in the 14th century, but Spain would not become a united kingdom until the 15th, while the last King of England to be illegitimate was William I (reigned 1066-1087), although it was alleged during the reign of Edward IV (1461-1483) that Edward was illegitimate. Also, it would be quite impossible to drag anyone from France to England behind a horse before the Channel Tunnel was dug. According to Ed Cray, author of Bawdy Ballads, \\"As the story goes, Rudyard Kipling wrote 'The Bastard King of England' (pronounced En-ga-land') and that authorship cost him his poet laureate's knighthood. It is too bad that the attribution is apparently spurious; 'The Bastard King' would undoubtedly be Kipling's most popular work\\" if he had actually written it. In the first episode of Z: The Beginning of Everything, Zelda Fitzgerald sings a verse from the ballad before diving off a dock.Z: The Beginning of Everything. Internet Movie Database. 2015-2017.

Along the way, the two men raised awareness of the unrelenting pain of moral injury many vets face and encouraged them to seek treatment.

Life and career In 1963 Nomura burned down the home of a government minister, for which he served 12 years in prison. In 1977 he took four people hostage at the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations headquarters, for which he served another 6 years in prison. He continued to maintain that circumstances sometimes justified such violence. Nomura and his Kaze no Kai (, \\"Wind Party\\") ran in the 1992 Upper House election. The party was behind in the polls when the Asahi Shimbun published a cartoon in its weekly magazine in which the character for \\"lice\\" () replaced the character for \\"wind\\" () in \\"Kanze no T≈ç\\". In reaction, Nomura entered the offices of Asahi dressed in a kimono, proclaimed \\"\\" (, \\"Asahi and I will die upon each other's swords\\"), and bowed in the direction of the Imperial Palace. He then shot himself with two pistols and died shortly after in the hospital. Media criticized Nomura's act as an attack on freedom of the press.

The work was commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra and was composed between 1998 and early 1999. Its world premiere was performed in Cleveland by the Cleveland Orchestra under the direction of Christoph von Dohn√°nyi on April 1, 1999. Composition Cantigas is composed in a single movement and has a duration of roughly 19 minutes. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, three clarinets (3rd doubling E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet (doubling contrabass clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets (4th doubling piccolo trumpet), three trombones, tuba timpani, three percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings. Reception Cantigas has been praised by music critics. James R. Oestreich of The New York Times described the music as \\"glacially shifting blocks of harmony giving rise to explosions of strident color.\\" Keith Potter of The Independent wrote, \\"Cantigas was written in 1998-9 for the Cleveland Orchestra and lasts around 20 minutes. It is thus a recent example of Lindberg's considerable prowess as a purveyor of brightly coloured, brilliantly orchestrated scores, including a much higher percentage of genuinely fast music than composers tend to produce these days. It is also, however, a good example of its creator's move away from rhythm, gesture and sheer sonority as prime features to greater concern for harmonic thinking in the context of goal-directed structures.\\" Gramophone similarly observed: Recording A commercial recording of Cantigas, performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen, was released through Sony Classical Records in 2002.

However, as Kong Pi's mother was a concubine and Pi himself was said to have deformities in his feet, he could not become his father's successor.

Overview Kelly started his career in the 1980s and 1990s reporting for The Nenagh Guardian, the Tipperary Star, and the Cork Examiner, and in 1994 he received the AT Cross Business Journalist of The Year Award. He afterwards worked in management for Irish communications companies such as FleishmanHillard, and in 1999 he founded his own business, Gallagher and Kelly Public Relations. Selling that firm to Financial Dynamics (FD) in 2000, he subsequently moved to the United States and began consulting for companies such as General Electric, Coca-Cola and Dell. When FD was sold to FTI Consulting for US$340 million, Kelly became FTI's executive vice-president and chief integration officer. In 2007 and 2008 he was a leading adviser to Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, and in 2009 Clinton appointed him US Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland. During his two-year tenure he worked closely with Invest NI and on the US-Northern Ireland Investment Conference, and was praised for bringing jobs to Ireland by politicians such as Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, and Owen Paterson. In June 2011 Kelly co-founded Teneo Holdings in New York, and the following year Irish Central dubbed Kelly \\"this Irish generation's Tony O'Reilly\\" for his work in international business. Kelly has served as an adjunct business professor at the NUI Galway and is involved with a number of non-profit and civic organisations, including the Sesame Workshop, the American Ireland Fund, Cooperation Ireland, and GOAL (USA). Currently serving as chairman of the American Associates of the Royal Academy of Arts, he also founded the Northern Ireland Mentorship Program for business graduates, and has been recognised with accolades such as the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. The American Irish Historical Society selected Kelly as the youngest-ever recipient of their gold medal in 2008, which is given to a person \\"deemed to have made a unique contribution to Irish American society.\\" Early life and education Declan Kelly was born in 1968 in Portroe, Nenagh, a village on the banks of Lough Derg in the Irish county of Tipperary. He was born to Nan Kelly and Tom Kelly, and recollects that his father, a labourer from Portroe, had been a \\"small farmer\\" who left school at the age of twelve to work. Kelly's parents made financial sacrifices to ensure that he and his brother Alan, a future Minister of State, received full educations. At the age of 16 Kelly began working for free as a \\"cub reporter\\" for The Nenagh Guardian, while also attending Nenagh CBS at the same time. At Nenagh CBS he competed as a hurler in the All-Ireland 'B‚Äô Colleges final. While continuing to report during the day and study at night, Kelly attended the National University of Ireland in Galway, Ireland from 1986 until 1989, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English and law. Career =Journalism and early advising= Working for The Nenagh Guardian during his student years, after 1989 Kelly was hired to report for the Tipperary Star. He became a sports columnist and business reporter for the Cork Examiner in the mid-1990s, and in 1994 he received the AT Cross Business Journalist of The Year Award for his coverage of \\"an industrial relations crisis in the Irish government.\\" Kelly afterwards held a number of senior management positions with Irish communications companies. In 1995 he became a senior consultant for Murray Consultants in Dublin, which at the time was Ireland's largest public relations firm. He was appointed to the board in 1996, and according to The Independent proved to be the \\"young protege of the boss, Jim Milton.\\" In 1997 he left Murray Consultants to join the communications company FleishmanHillard, where he was appointed to the board of its Irish subsidiary. In 1999 he founded his own business, Gallagher and Kelly Public Relations. His partner in the venture, Jackie Gallagher, had previously advised politician Bertie Ahern and has also worked with Kelly at FleishmanHillard. Kelly sold the firm to the communications company Financial Dynamics (FD) for US$15 million in 2000. Joining FD as a member of their senior management, he moved to the United States in 2001 and was appointed chairman of Financial Dynamics in Ireland in late 2002. Kelly was also appointed global head of business development for FD International, and in September 2002 he became chairman and CEO of Financial Dynamics USA. Kelly was part of the senior management team that \\"negotiated management buyout of FD International\\" in July 2003, with management purchasing the company for US$43.5 million. =FTI Consulting= In 2004 he was still president and CEO of FD in the United States, also managing the company's business dealings in Europe. By that time he had helped corporations such as \\"General Electric, Coca-Cola and Dell to burnish a positive image through the media.\\" In September 2006, Kelly helped oversee the sale of Financial Dynamics to FTI Consulting for US$340 million, which at the time was the largest sum ever paid for a communications firm. At the same time he joined FTI Consulting Group Limited as their executive vice-president and chief integration officer in New York. At FTI he also served as the chairman of the FD US and Ireland divisions. While holding the roles until late 2009, Kelly was \\"responsible for the operational integration of the company's various businesses in more than 20 countries.\\" Working with the 3,500-person business, he also had \\"responsibility for corporate strategy, global business development, global client management and all of the company's marketing and communications functions.\\" In 2007 and 2008 he served as \\"one of the leading advisers\\" to Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, also organising fundraising events for Clinton in New York, San Francisco, and Limerick. Explained the Irish Central, \\"he was often at her side during her election battle against Obama and became known as a fundraising wizard, personally raising millions and became a person the Clintons increasingly relied on.\\" In July 2009 The Independent reported that Kelly was stepping down from his roles at FTI, despite that fact that Kelly had \\"been touted as a likely potential chief executive... But given his political experience, it was also expected that he could be tapped for some kind of political role. Kelly remained with FTI in a consulting capacity while observing a 2-year non-compete clause with the company. =Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland= In September 2009 Kelly was appointed economic envoy to Northern Ireland by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, promptly travelling to Belfast. In a meeting with the Northern Irish Enterprise Minister, Arlene Foster, Kelly asserted that his role would be \\"confined to economic matters only, and he would have no political function,\\" unlike his predecessors Richard Haass, Mitchell Reiss and George Mitchell. During his tenure he worked closely with Invest NI on projects and events such as the US-Northern Ireland Investment Conference held in October 2010, which he organised. According to the BBC, he was also credited with \\"having a big impact as a member of the winning Derry bid team for UK City of Culture,\\" with Derry later selected as City of Culture in 2013. He resigned as US Special Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland on 11 May 2011, with the BBC reporting that Kelly \\"said he had achieved the goals he had set for himself and the time was right for him to move on.\\" According to the BBC, in his two-year tenure he \\"helped to create hundreds of jobs,\\" specifically 1,500, with American companies such as Seagate, Dow Chemical, GE Energy, the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, Citi and Kana Software establishing new jobs in Northern Ireland. Hillary Clinton accompanied his resignation with a public statement praising his tenure, writing that \\"during his time as envoy, Declan has helped our friends in the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, Invest NI, and the business community make Northern Ireland one of the best per capita attractors of investment in the world.\\" His tenure was also praised by Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, and later UK Secretary of State Owen Paterson. =Founding Teneo= From October 2009 until June 2011 Kelly worked as an independent contractor for FTI Consulting. At the end of June Kelly co-founded Teneo Holdings in New York with his long-term colleagues Douglas Band and Paul Keary. Kelly was the largest shareholder, taking on the roles of chairman and co-CEO. Band, a legal advisor to Bill Clinton, became co-CEO and president, while Keary took on the role of COO. It was announced that Teneo would comprise \\"a merchant bank, a private equity vehicle and an international consulting business.\\" Explained Irish Central in 2012, \\"at its heart Teneo is essentially a global consulting firm and merchant bank that advises many of the world's largest companies on a wide-range of issues.\\" Teneo was headquartered in New York's 601 Lexington Avenue building, with announced plans to open offices in Washington D.C., London, Dublin, and Toronto. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both announced as members of Teneo's advisory board, with Clinton later becoming a client and unpaid advisor to Teneo and its founders. As of December 2011, Kelly was serving as an adjunct professor at the NUI Galway in their College of Business, Public Policy and Law. In the spring of 2012 Teneo added the division Teneo Intelligence, which through algorithms \\"aims to identify trouble spots around the world and analyse their potential effect on global markets.\\" Teneo had 100 employees by June 2012, a number which had risen to 130 employees by August. Teneo had already signed a number of high-profile clients at its founding, and by the summer of 2012 clients included Coca-Cola and Donald Keough, among others. On 22 June 2012, Irish Central dubbed Kelly \\"this Irish generation's Tony O'Reilly\\" for his work in international business. =Recent years= In December 2014, New York private equity firm, BC Partners made a minority investment in Teneo. Thereafter, Teneo grew from operating 6 divisions to 12 divisions, also increasing its headcount both in the United States and internationally. In 2015 Teneo received information requests from the office of Senator Charles Grassley as part of a review into potential ethics issues with a State Department waiver granted to Huma Abedin, a Clinton top aide, allowing her to earn income outside the government. Kelly responded that Teneo was \\"committed to the highest ethical and professional standards,\\" while Abedin \\"said her work arrangement was approved by State Department lawyers and that she did no work for Teneo involving the department, nor was she asked to.\\" Abedin had additionally signed a contract pledging she would avoid conflicts with her State Department role when she took the adviser position. Though the issue was seen as controversial by Republicans, The Journal noted that there \\"was no evidence of any fundraising, donations, or services provided by Teneo executives to the State Department or Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State.\\" By the summer of 2015 Teneo had advisors on staff such as former US senator George Mitchell, and in July 2015 FIFA hired Teneo. Teneo expanded throughout 2015, purchasing the agencies Blue Rubicon and StockWell in July and Pendomer Communications in October, doubling Teneo's employee count to about 500. As of January 2016, there was speculation in the press that Teneo would purchase Apco, a public relations firm with 600 staff headquartered in the United States. That month Teneo Holdings also expanded into Canada, resulting in Teneo employing 570 people. Kelly remains chairman and CEO of Teneo Holdings, and oversees all 12 operating divisions of the company. He has also been an advisor for companies such as New Mountain Capital, among others. Philanthropy Involved with a number of non-profit and civic organisations as either a philanthropist or a boardmember, Kelly has been particularly focused on Irish and Irish-American issues. In 2004 he joined the advisory board of New York University's Glucksman Ireland House, and as of 2009 he was chairman of the US Foundation Board at the National University of Ireland, Galway. As of 2012 he had raised \\"considerable sums\\" for the Clinton Foundation, as well as the American Ireland Funds and Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin. He has been on the board of the non- profit educational organisation Sesame Workshop since 2013, and he has also served on the board of directors for the American Ireland Fund, Cooperation Ireland, and GOAL (USA). In June 2015 he was appointed chairman of the American Associates of the Royal Academy of Arts. Kelly founded and continues to oversee the Northern Ireland Mentorship Program in partnership with the American Ireland Fund, which \\"enables young university graduates from Northern Ireland to spend a year working within several leading corporations in the United States.\\" The stated goal of the organisation is to increase skill and experience in the Northern Irish workforce. In April 2020, he was executive producer of Together at Home, an online fundraising concert to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic with performers including Elton John and Billie Eilish. Accolades Kelly has been recognised with a number of awards and accolades for his work in journalism, business, and philanthropy. In 1994 he was named the AT Cross Business Journalist of The Year, and in 2005 he was included for the first time in the Business 100 Awards sponsored by Irish America, which lists the \\"top one hundred Irish American businessmen in the US.\\" Also that year the National University of Ireland, Galway gave Kelly their annual Alumni Award for Business and Commerce. The American Irish Historical Society chose Kelly as their youngest-ever recipient for their gold medal in 2008, which is given annual to \\"one person deemed to have made a unique contribution to Irish American society.\\" The Queen's University Belfast awarded Kelly an honorary doctorate in 2011 for \\"his service to the community and economy of Northern Ireland,\\" and later that year Irish America again named him to their annual Business 100 list. The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations awarded Kelly the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in July 2012, and the following August Business and Finance named him to their annual Global 100 list.

The chief designer was N. P. Mazur. * Weight of launcher: 15 tons, based on PT-76 tank * rocket engine: 3R1 * missile diameter: 1.75 m * guidance: by launcher * maximum speed of launcher: 35 km/h History =Background= At 3 meters long, between 0.7 and 1.5 meters in diameter, and weighing 4-5 tons, the earliest nuclear weapons were so large and heavy that they could only be carried by strategic bombers such as the United States Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Convair B-36 Peacemaker and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-4. However, use of these aircraft in the 1950s for nuclear strikes on forward positions of enemy troops in a theatre of military operations was impractical. By the mid 1950s, nuclear weapons development led to increases in their power and technical characteristics while reducing their diameters and masses, and therefore creating the possibility of using them in a variety of delivery vehicles. In particular, tactical strike aircraft became suitable carriers, but their application depended on factors including time of day, weather conditions, and the intensity of enemy air defenses. Additionally, the response time of tactical strike aircraft was very large. Under these circumstances, it became desirable to provide army units with their own means of delivering nuclear warheads. In the 1950s, these means included traditional artillery pieces, recoil-less rifles, and unguided tactical missiles. Work was carried out on all three of these options in the United States, and, after some delay, in the Soviet Union too. The available nuclear weapons technology did not allow the creation of sufficiently compact ammunition, so artillery solutions, including the American 280-mm T131 gun and Soviet 406-mm SM-54 (2A3) rifled gun and 420-mm SM-58 (2B1) smoothbore mortar, became too heavy and clumsy ‚Äî the 2A3 weighed 55 tonnes, the T131 weighed 75.5 tonnes. These pieces could not be towed over bridges, could not navigate urban and rural streets, and required a lot of time to prepare for firing. In both the US and the USSR, the alternative to these too-heavy artillery shells was unguided tactical rockets as carriers of nuclear weapons. The main advantages were: * Inertial guidance systems of the 1950s and 60s at ranges of around 30 km could achieve accuracies of only around 500‚Äì1000 m (CEP), comparable with the accuracy of unguided rockets. * The use of radio guidance was undesirable because it made the rocket vulnerable to interference. Additionally, it required the establishment of a guidance post on the ground or in the air. * Active homing systems for marine and air targets had not yet been developed in the early 1950s, let alone systems designed for ground targets.

They are located at the southwest corner of Central Park South and Sixth Avenue. Trump Parc (the former Barbizon-Plaza Hotel) is a 38-story condominium building, and Trump Parc East is a 14-story apartment and condominium building. Trump Parc: Barbizon Plaza Hotel Trump Parc (highlighting roof detail) The 38-story art deco Barbizon-Plaza Hotel opened at 106 Central Park South on May 12, 1930http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/BarbizonPlazaHotel.html with 1,400 ensuite rooms. It was built for $10 million by William H. Silk, owner of the Barbizon Hotel. The architect was Laurence Emmons. The hotel was designed to appeal to artists and musicians, with facilities including soundproof practice rooms, art studios, and two performance halls. The property was foreclosed on in 1933. At some point, likely around World War II, the top of the building was altered to its present form with a stylish design. Carter B. Horsley of The City Review said, \\"Its only rivals in audacity are the Chrysler Building and the former RCA/GE tower\\". Aeolian Company installed a large pipe organ at the hotel in 1930; it was moved a year later to the nearby American Women's Association clubhouse. During World War II two floors of the hotel were reserved for the use of Royal Navy officers based in or passing through New York City. At this time there was a drug-store on the ground floor of the hotel. New York society ladies served tea to the British officers every afternoon. Lambert Brussels Real Estate Corp. and Loeb Rhoades purchased the hotel in 1973 for $11 million, and affiliated it with the Penta Hotels chain. Despite the completion of $2 million of renovations, the hotel earned minimal profits for its new owners. Donald Trump purchased the hotel and the neighboring apartment building in 1981. On December 14, 1985, he closed the hotel to prepare for conversion to condominiums. He renamed the property as \\"Trump Parc\\" and completed the conversion with 340 condominium units around 1988. Trump Parc East: 100 Central Park South Trump Parc East (small building in the foreground) with Trump Parc behind 100 Central Park South is a 14-story building that was built as an apartment complex around 1917 by John J. Hearn. Trump purchased the Barbizon Plaza Hotel and 100 Central Park South from Banque Lambert in 1981 for $65 million, financed by a $50 million loan from Chase Manhattan Bank. As to the apartment building, Trump stated that \\"they practically gave it to me, because it was losing so much money under rent control.\\" He also claimed to have paid only $13 million for the two buildings. By 1985, 60 of the building's 80 units were occupied, with about half being rent-controlled and the rest being rent-stabilized. Trump's intention was to replace the two buildings with a new one, which would be \\"one of the finest pieces of real estate in New York.\\" In a February 1985 New York article, Tony Schwartz detailed \\"how a bunch of rent-controlled and rent- stabilized tenants in an old building... have managed to do what city agencies, courts, colleagues, competitors, and the National Football League have never been able to do: successfully stand in the way of something Donald Trump wants.\\" Trump could have bought out the rent-controlled tenants; instead, he contracted with Citadel Management, who also handled tenant resettlement and had been accused of harassment in the past. The article goes on to describe how Trump and his organization, attempting to evict the tenants, harassed them through \\"lapses in building security\\" and ignored needed repairs. Trump (as Park South Associates) sued to evict the tenants in 1981, and in 1982 the management company ordered six tenants to comply with rules ignored for 30 years, giving them 10 days to comply. Trump, in newspaper advertisements, also offered to house homeless in the vacated units, which was seen as a threat to the remaining tenants. The tenants raised funds and hired legal counsel, receiving an injunction against the compliance orders in 1984. In 1985 the harassment case was brought to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, with the city mentioning daily harassment, \\"wrongful acts and omissions\\", bogus nonpayment notices, and utilities that were turned off, by Trump's agents. The city lost an injunction against Trump in September 1985, with the State Supreme Court justice stating The danger of irreparable harm to the tenants seems to be minimal now that the challenged activities of the defendants are under the scrutiny of the various departments of the City of New York. The hearings were still open in November 1985, even though Trump had claimed victory. Trump countersued, citing the RICO act, listing charges including extortion and bribery that were committed by the tenants. Judge Whitman Knapp rejected the countersuit, ordering it dismissed with prejudice. In a 1985 New York Times editorial, Sydney Schanberg called Trump a \\"slumlord\\". Trump's attorney on the case responded in an editorial, attacking Schanberg, the tenants' lawyer, the city, and calling it a \\"political maneuver in a mayoral election year\\". Ultimately, in 1986, Trump dropped the eviction suit, allowing the tenants to stay with their rent controls in place and paying their legal fees of over $500,000. Trump stated he wouldn't continue with demolition but would renovate the building to \\"take advantage of the strong real-estate market now.\\" After a final settlement in 1988, the building was converted to a condominium with 51 rent-regulated tenants remaining. In 2016 some rent-controlled tenants were paying less than $1000 for a one- bedroom apartment along Central Park. Notable tenants have included Suzanne Blackmer, who lived in the building from before Trump's purchase until her death in 2004, Arnold Scaasi, and Eric Trump.

So far the best episodes of Grimm have found a way to take a well-known folk tale ‚Äî or the occasional obscure story ‚Äî and give it a modern twist to fit in a crime procedural context. Not so with 'The Good Shepherd,' which is mostly a literal take on that story, depicting a Blutbad reverend presiding over a congregation of sheep Wesen (at one point Monroe says the name and the plural form, but I honestly have no clue how to spell it). It's all a bit too clever from the get-go, with the whole flock of sheep as the reverend's flock, the herd mentality, et al.\\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \\"Let it be known that Grimm has a thing or two to teach us about herd mentality, how con men talk when pretending to be religious men and just how many bake sales you need to replace stolen funds. I was relieved Rev. Calvin's megachurch vibe turned out to be an act because it just felt so fake. I know there are real fire-and- brimstone guys out there, but no men of the cloth I know talk like that.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"After a few weeks off from an early start, Grimm settled back into its Friday night slot with 'The Good Shepherd.' Sadly for Grimm, however, tonight tried telling a mostly procedural story rather than a serial one, and the show stumbled a bit because of it. However, aside from said stumble, there were a few moments that were more than worth the price of admission.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"Characters and themes aside, the show unfortunately missed a cool opportunity to flesh out the Wesen belief system, or at least examine religion from the monsters' point of view. What does Leviathan think of the Old Testament? Do snake-Wesen get upset at their portrayal in the Garden of Eden? Are animal-headed Pagan gods Wesen too?

It is a simple kind of a Bayesian-optimal mechanism, in which the price is determined in advance without collecting actual buyers' bids.  Single item and single buyer  In the simplest setting, the seller has a single item to sell (with zero cost), and there is a single potential buyer. The highest price that the buyer is willing to pay for the item is called the valuation of the buyer. The seller would like to set the price exactly at the buyer's valuation. Unfortunately, the seller does not know the buyer's valuation. In the Bayesian model, it is assumed that the buyer's valuation is a random variable drawn from a known probability distribution. Suppose the cumulative distribution function of the buyer is F(v), defined as the probability that the seller's valuation is less than v. Then, if the price is set to p, the expected value of the seller's revenue is: :Rev(p) = pcdot (1-F(p)) because the probability that the buyer will want to buy the item is 1-F(p), and if this happens, the seller's revenue will be p. The seller would like to find the price that maximizes Rev(p). The first-order condition, that the optimal price p^* should satisfy, is: :p^* = {1-F(p^*)over f(p^*)} where f(p)=F'(p)= the probability density function. For example, if the probability distribution of the buyer's valuation is uniform in [a,a+d], then F(v)=(v-a)/d and f(v)=1/d (in [a,a+d]). The first-order condition is p^* = (a+d-p^*) which implies p^* = (a+d)/2. This is the optimal price only if it is in the range [a,a+d] (i.e., when aleq d). Otherwise (when ageq d), the optimal price is p^* = a. This optimal price has an alternative interpretation: it is the solution to the equation: :w(p^*)=0 where w is the virtual valuation of the agent. So in this case, BO pricing is equivalent to the Bayesian-optimal mechanism, which is an auction with reserve-price p^*.  Single item and many buyers  In this setting, the seller has a single item to sell (with zero cost), and there are multiple potential buyers whose valuations are a random vector drawn from some known probability distribution. Here, different pricing methods come to mind: * Symmetric prices: the seller sets a single price for the item. If one or more buyers accept this price, then one of them is selected arbitrarily. * discriminatory prices: the seller sets a different price for each buyer. If one or more buyers accept this price, then the buyer who accepted the highest price is selected. Discriminatory pricing can be implemented sequentially by ordering the prices in decreasing order and giving the item to the first buyer who accepts the price offered to him. In the multiple-buyer setting, BO pricing is no longer equivalent to BO auction: in pricing, the seller has to determine the price/s in advance, while in auction, the seller can determine the price based on the agents' bids. The competition between the buyers may enable the auctioneer to raise the price. Hence, in theory, the seller can obtain a higher revenue in an auction. Example. There are two buyers whose valuations are distributed uniformly in the range [$100,$200]. * The BO auction is the Vickrey auction with reserve price $100 (= the inverse-virtual-valuation of 0). Its expected revenue is $133. * The BO discriminatory pricing scheme is to offer one agent a price of $150 and the other agent a price of $100. Its expected revenue is 0.5*150 + 0.5*100 = $125. In practice, however, an auction is more complicated for the buyers since it requires them to declare their valuation in advance. The complexity of the auction process might deter buyers and ultimately lead to loss of revenue. Therefore, it is interesting to compare the optimal pricing revenue to the optimal auction revenue, to see how much revenue the seller loses by using the simpler mechanism. = Buyers with independent and identical valuations = Blumrosen and Holenstein study the special case in which the buyers' valuations are random variables drawn independently from the same probability distribution. They show that, when the distribution of the buyers' valuations has bounded support, BO-pricing and BO-auction converge to the same revenue. The convergence rate is asymptotically the same when discriminatory prices are allowed, and slower by a logarithmic factor when symmetric prices must be used. For example, when the distribution is uniform in [0,1] and there are n potential buyers: * the revenue of the BO auction (a Vickrey auction with reserve price determined by the probability distribution) is 1-2/n; * the revenue of BO discriminatory pricing is 1-4/n; * the revenue of BO symmetric pricing is 1-log(n)/n. In contrast, when the distribution of the buyers' valuations has unbounded support, the BO-pricing and the BO- auction might not converge to the same revenue. E.g., when the cdf is F(x) = 1-1/x^2: * the revenue of the BO auction is .88sqrt{n}; * the revenue of BO discriminatory pricing is .7sqrt{n}; * the revenue of BO symmetric pricing is .64sqrt{n}. = Buyers with independent and different valuations = Chawla and Hartline and Malec and Sivan study the setting in which the buyers' valuations are random variables drawn independently from different probability distributions. Moreover, there are constraints on the set of agents that can be served together (for example: there is a limited number of units). They consider two kinds of discriminatory pricing schemes: * In an order-oblivious pricing mechanism (OPM), the mechanism-designer determines a price for each agent. The agents come in an arbitrary order. The mechanism guarantees are for worst-case (adversarial) order of the agents, determined after the agents' valuations are drawn. * In a sequential pricing mechanism (SPM), the mechanism-designer determines both a price for each agent, and an ordering on the agents. The mechanism loops over the agents in the pre-determined order. If the current agent can be served together with the previously-served agents (according to the constraints), then his personal price is offered to him, and he can either take it or leave it. Their general scheme for calculating the prices is: * For each agent j, calculate the probability q_j with which the BO mechanism (Myerson's mechanism) serves agent j. This can be calculated either analytically or by simulations. * The price for agent j is p_j := F_j^{-1}(1-Ccdot q_j), where C is a constant (either 1 or 1/2 or 1/3, depending on the setting). In other words, the price p_j satisfies the following condition: ::Prob[the valuation of agent j is at least p_j] = C times Prob[the BO mechanism serves agent j]. If C=1 then the marginal- probability that an agent is served by the SPM is equal to the marginal- probability that it is served by the BO auction. The approximation factors obtainable by an OPM depend on the structure of the constraints: * uniform matroid or partition matroid constraints - 2 (i.e, the revenue of the BO OPM is at least 1/2 the revenue of Myerson's BO auction). * graphic matroid - 3 * Intersection of two partition matroids - 6.75 * Intersection of a graphic matroid and a partition matroid - 10.66 * General matroid with matroid rank k  O(log(k)) Moreover, they show two lower bounds: * An OPM cannot guarantee more than 1/2 the revenue of the BO auction, even in the single-item setting. * An OPM cannot guarantee more than O({loglog{n} / log{n}}) the revenue of the BO auction when there are downwards-closed non-matroid constraint. The approximation factors obtainable by an SPM are naturally better: * Uniform matroid, partition matroid - e/(e-1) ‚âÖ 1.58 * General matroid - 2 * Intersection of two matroids - 3 The lower bound (proved by ) is approximately 1.25. Yan explains the success of the sequential-pricing approach based on the concept of correlation gap, in the following way. The revenue of a mechanism is related to a set function f. E.g, in a k-unit auction, the function is f(S)=min(S,k) * The revenue of the BO auction is at most f(Winners)cdot Price, where \\"Winners\\" is the set of k agents with highest valuations. * The revenue of the BO SPM is at least f(Demand)cdot Price, where \\"Demand\\" is the set of agents whose valuation is above the price. Both \\"Winners\\" and \\"Demand\\" are random-sets, determined by the agents' valuations. Moreover, by carefully setting the price, it is possible to ensure that each agent j has the same probability q_j to be in \\"Winners\\" and to be in \\"Demand\\". However, in \\"Winners\\", there is high correlation between different agents (if one agent wins, there is more probability that other agents lose), while in \\"Demand\\", the agents are independent. Therefore, the correlation gap is an upper bound on the loss of performance when using BO SPM instead of BO auction. This gives the following approximation factors: * General matroid - e/(e-1) * k-unit auctions (a sub-case of general matroids) - 1/(1-1/sqrt{2pi k}) * p-independent set systems (a generalization of the intersection of p matroids) - p+1.  Different items and one unit-demand buyer  In this setting, the seller has several different items for sale (e.g. cars of different models). There is one potential buyer, that is interested in a single item (e.g. a single car). The buyer has a different valuation for each item-type (i.e., he has a valuation-vector). Given the posted prices, the buyer buys the item that gives him the highest net utility (valuation minus price). The buyer's valuation- vector is a random-vector from a multi-dimensional probability distribution. The seller wants to compute the price-vector (a price per item) that gives him the highest expected revenue. Chawla and Hartline and Kleinberg study the case in which the buyer's valuations to the different items are independent random variables. They show that: * The revenue of the BO unit-demand pricing when there are n item-types is at most the revenue of the BO single-item auction when there are n potential buyers. * When the buyer's valuations to the different items are independent draws from the same distribution, the BO unit- demand pricing that uses the same price to all items attains at least 1/2.17 of the revenue of the BO single-item auction.Single-price pricing is not necessarily the optimal pricing. For example, suppose there are two items, each with a value independently equal to 1 with probability 2/3 and 2 with probability 1/3. Then, the price-vectors (1,2) and (2,1) are optimal, but the price-vectors (1,1) and (2,2) are sub-optimal. * When the buyer's valuations are independent draws from different distributions, the BO unit-demand pricing that uses the same virtual-price (based on virtual valuations) attains at least 1/3 of the revenue of the BO single-item auction. They also consider the computational task of calculating the optimal price. The main challenge is to calculate w^{-1}, the inverse of the virtual valuation function. * For discrete and regular valuation distribution, there is a polynomial-time 3-approximation. * For continuous and regular valuation distribution (available via an oracle) there is a polynomial-time (3+Œµ)-approximation with high probability, and a faster (6+Œµ)-approximation with probability 1.  Different items and many unit-demand buyers  In this setting, there are different types of items. Each buyer has different valuations for different items, and each buyer wants at most one item. Moreover, there are pre- specified constraints on the set of buyer-item pairs that can be allocated together (for example: each item can be allocated to at most one buyer; each buyer can get at most one item; etc). Chawla and Hartline and Malec and Sivan study two kinds of discriminatory pricing schemes: * In a sequential pricing mechanism (SPM), the mechanism-designer determines a price for each buyer-item pair, and an ordering on the buyer-item pairs. The mechanism loops over the buyer-item pairs in the pre-determined order. If the current buyer-item pair is feasible, then the buyer is offered the item in the pre-determined price, and he can either take it or leave it. * In an order-oblivious pricing mechanism (OPM), the mechanism-designer determines a price for each buyer-item pair. The buyers come in an arbitrary order, which may be adversarially determined after the agents' valuations are drawn. A sequential-pricing mechanism is, in general, not a truthful mechanism, since an agent may decide to decline a good offer in hopes of getting a better offer later. It is truthful only when, for every buyer, the buyer-item pairs for that buyer are ordered in decreasing order of net-utility. Then, it is always best for the buyer to accept the first offer (if its net utility is positive). A special case of that situation is the single-parameter setting: for every buyer, there is only a single buyer-item pair (e.g, there is a single item for sale). To every multi-parameter setting corresponds a single-parameter setting in which each buyer-item pair is considered an independent agent. In the single- parameter setting, there is more competition (since the agents that come from the same buyer compete with each other). Therefore, the BO revenue in the single-parameter setting is an upper bound on the BO revenue in the multi- parameter setting. Therefore, if an OPM is an r-approximation to the optimal mechanism for a single-parameter setting, then it is also an r-approximation to the corresponding multi-parameter setting. See above for approximation factors of OPMs in various settings. See Chapter 7 \\"Multi-dimensional Approximation\\" in for more details. = Many unit-demand buyers and sellers = Recently, the SPM scheme has been extended to a double auction setting, where there are both buyers and sellers. The extended mechanism is called 2SPM. It is parametrized by an order on the buyers, an order on the sellers, and a matrix of prices - a price for each buyer-seller pair. The prices are offered to in order to buyers and sellers who may either accept or reject the offer. The approximation ratio is between 3 and 16, depending on the setting.

Ruby Rai, student of Vishun Roy College, Kiratpur Raja Ram village in Vaishali district pronounced Political Science as ‚ÄòProdigal Science‚Äô and described it as a subject related to cooking. Science topper Saurabh Shrestha was unaware of electron and proton and wrongly said that aluminium is the most reactive element. Background The examinations in February‚ÄìMarch 2016 were largely fair as the Bihar government, stung by the photos of mass copying in the BSEB- conducted exams in 2015, tried its best to prevent the use of unfair means. On 28 May 2016, the BSEB publicly declared the intermediate results, however it released its official merit list for 10 May 2016 itself but due to some issues, it made the results public on a later date. Only 56.73% of students passed in arts against 86.47% in 2015. In science, 67.06% got passed against 89.32% in 2015. Some journalists visited Ruby Rai's house on May 30. When interviewed by the Aaj Tak TV channel, Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shresth were unable to answer basic questions. The arts topper Ruby Rai named \\"prodigal science\\" (actually political science) as one of the subjects she had studied. When asked what this subject dealt with, she answered that it was about cooking. She stated that the exam was of 600 marks, while it was actually of only 500 marks. The science topper Saurabh Shresth could not describe the link between water and H2O (the chemical formula for water). He also wrongly named aluminium was the most reactive element. SIT Formation After the video of their interviews went viral, a three-member SIT was formed by the Bihar state government to look into the fraud. Manu Maharaj, Patna special SP is heading the special investigation team. Ruby and other 13 rank holders were asked to appear for the test on June 3. Ruby Rai was later sent to judicial custody in remedial home for 14 days. Vishun Roy College was de-recognised thereafter. A day after retest, the results of toppers were cancelled. Ruby Rai flunked retest in the first time. BSEB Chairman Lalkeswar Prasad Singh was on the run after that. On 6 June, Bihar government dissolved the four-member committee constituted by Bihar School Examination Board on 5 June to probe into alleged irregularities in evaluation of marks in Bihar intermediate exams and ordered registration of FIR. The decision to dissolve the committee was taken in a meeting when BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh was also present in that. Vishun Roy College principal Bachha Rai was arrested on 11 June. Bachcha's daughter Shalini Rai is also an accused in the fraud case. Bachcha had unsuccessfully lobbied for an RJD ticket from the Paroo (Vidhan Sabha constituency) in Muzaffarpur district in November 2015. Bachcha's daughter Shalini had topped the state in the matriculation exams in 2010. Her name was with-held as topper in Science stream and Saurabh Shreshtha was declared the topper in science stream. Bachcha's family are said to be die-hard supporters of Rashtriya Janata Dal. Ruby Rai's father is said to have promised six acres of land to Bachcha Rai in lieu of his \\"help\\" for his daughter. On 8 June 2016, the BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh resigned after being served a show- cause notice by the Bihar state's education department. On 25 June, Ruby Rai appeared before BSEB team for re-evaluation, and failed to answer a single question correctly. She was subsequently arrested. Patna Commissioner Anand Kishore took charge as BSEB chairman. On 12 June, Bihar Deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav tweeted pictures of Bachcha Rai with Union minister Giriraj Singh. Tejashwi said Bachha Rai had cordial relation with a central minister. Giriraj Singh also tweeted pictures of Bachcha Rai with Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar. On 20 June, BSEB Chairman Lalkeshwar Singh and his wife Usha Sinha were arrested from Varanasi. Usha Sinha is a former MLA from Hilsa (Vidhan Sabha constituency) (2010-2015). BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh confessed to have taken from a cheating racket kingpin to help each unworthy student become a topper. In investigation, Ruby Rai said on June 27 that she just wanted second division but her father Avadesh Rai made her topper in collaboration with Bachcha Rai. Ruby Rai was denied bail by juvenile court on 13 July. The father of the science topper was arrested from the Kanti Factory Road area in east Patna on 15 July. In an investigation of The Indian Express in July 2016, it was revealed that many schools are only on paper. Officials of G.A.Inter School Hajipur have also been interrogated. Third topper Rahul Kumar was arrested in July. On 15 July, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that topper scam is a God-sent opportunity to rectify the system in Bihar. On 9 August 2016, Vikas Kumar, who was a clerk-cum-storekeeper of the Bihar Vidyalaya Pariksha Samiti and kingpin of the racket in connection with the Bihar intermediate exam scam was arrested by a joint team of the West Bengal CID and Bihar police. In September 2016, Bihar government decided to link exams to Aadhaar numbers to avoid duplication and facilitate easy access to documents. The seven-member governing board led by BSEB chairman Anand Kishor gave its nod for creation of 135 posts (official and clerical), construction of nine new examination halls and setting up of nine regional offices. These 135 posts include nine deputy secretaries, nine accountants, nine zonal officers. In October 2016, investigations revealed that Ruby Rai wrote names of movies in one answer sheet and the name of Tulsidas more than a hundred times in another and poetry in some others, which were then replaced. She wrote only 1 (home science) of 6 papers. Criticism Many argued that Ruby Rai was unfairly targeted as she is a minor (17), as she was born on 15 November 1998 and the real kingpins of the crime and pathetic education level of Bihar Board have not yet been caught. Central Education Minister Upendra Kushwaha said that Ruby Rai's father, Avadesh Rai, was complicit in the conspiracy forged by Bacha Rai. Referring to the specifically targeted media coverage of Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha, columnist Shivanshu K. Srivastava wrote, \\"At least the news presenters should have shown some sensitivity towards these misguided children. In context of another news wherein a girl misbehaved in a police station, the girl‚Äôs face was blurred even when she was adult, but these children are openly humiliated.\\" Ruby Rai was said to be under utter stress and finding herself utterly hopeless after deserted by family within few days of her arrest. On 13 July, Ruby broke down in tears in juvenile justice board office after seeing her grandfather Munshi Prasad Rai. Later on, Ruby Rai was able to adjust and adapt herself inside the Juvenile Home. Her bail petition was heard in Juvenile court on 1 August. Ruby studied in the juvenile home to reappear in the 2017 exams. Ruby was released from jail on 1 August after court agreed to her bail plea. Aftermath BSEB introduced multiple steps to curb cheating in subsequent exams. Candidate's applications have been linked with Aadhaar number to prevent duplications. To prevent impersonation, photographs have been added at multiple locations, including the admit card. CrPC section 144 (curfew) would be imposed at all examination centres to refrain others from roaming around the examination centres. CCTVs have been installed to prevent and identify those involved in such activities. End to end digitisation is being implemented: registration, form filling, evaluation and declaration of results. Affiliations of 147 schools/colleges have been canceled for not fulfilling the affiliation criteria. Some of the colleges were running in only one room.

Youths in a courtship dance in Karamoja- Kabong. Afrikaans folklore is the body of traditional literature, music, dance and customs present in Afrikaans-speaking cultures.  Afrikaans examples of folklore  Some of the Afrikaans folklore subjects being taught can be categorized as follows: = Humour: the comical use of language, events, and trickery = BoschBosch, B. 1997. Humor in die taalklaskamer. Journal for Language Teaching 31(2):190-201. points out that there are different aspects of humour which can add to the enjoyment of studying folktales and Afrikaans as an additional language. Experience has shown that the humour expressed and understood by Zulu learners in the additional language classroom consists mostly of imitating comical situations, tone of voice, facial expressions and body language. Additional language learners struggle to appreciate humour that involves the implicit subtlety of word games. MorainValdes, J.M. 1986. Culture bound - bridging the cultural gap in language teaching. New York: Cambridge University Press. believes kinesics should be part of any learning programme that includes perception and that it can contribute to the understanding of social and intercultural relationships, because those who have \\"learned\\" a language without the nonverbal component are seriously handicapped if they intend to interact with living members of the culture instead of with paper and print. Kinesics comprises understanding and interpreting body language to provide a creative means of communication across borders and add another dimension to the appreciation and expression of humour in the additional language classroom. One of the functions of folklore is to entertain the audience. Humorous events set in motion by tricksters can contribute to amusementBascom, W.R. 1965. Folkore and Anthropology. In: DUNDES, A. The study of folklore. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. and mental stimulation.Miruka, O. 1994. Encounter with oral literature. Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers. Examples are the actions of the \\"Jakkals en Wolf\\" characters of Afrikaans folktales which HoniballHoniball, T.O. 1942. Jakkals en Wolf-reeks. Die Jongspan. portrayed in comic strips and cartoons. LateganLategan, F.V. 1985. T.O. Honiball - 'n waardering. Lantern (January):46-59. refers to how Honiball used the Jakkals and Wolf stories that he had heard as a child. His stories followed an old tradition of Middle Dutch literature - that of the satirical Van den Vos Reynaerde - and Honiball became the Walt Disney of Afrikaans. He used satire to gently ridicule people and to unmask human frailty among the Afrikaans-speaking society of the day, mocking the eccentric habits and customs of a community.D√©gh, L. 1965. Folk narrative. In: Dundes, A. The study of folklore. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. Cartoons and comics like these are not regarded by all folklore specialists as belonging to folklore, because they do not explicitly include oral traditions.Utley, F.L. 1965. Folk literature: an operational definition. In: Dundes, A. The study of folklore. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. However, since they are based on the \\"Jakkals en Wolf\\" intertextual tradition of oral folktales that have been handed down for generations,Steenberg, E. 1987. Fantasie en die kinderboek - 'n kernhandleiding . Pretoria: HAUM-Liter√™r. it could be argued that Honiball's Adoons-hulle (1977) and Wolf en Jakkals van Uilekraal (1978) can indeed be regarded as part of mass-cultural folklore where city life is portrayed by the mass media. DorsonDorson, R.M. 1972. African folklore. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. cites Bausinger (1961) who maintains that \\"we no longer believe that industrialization necessarily implies the end of a specific folk culture, but rather we attempt to trace the modifications and mutations undergone by folk culture in the industrialized and urbanized world.\\" These comic strips by Honiball provide interesting teaching possibilities in the additional language classroom, especially because of the elements of humour in the animal tricksters,Finnegan, R. 1970. Oral Literature in Africa. Oxford: Clarendon Press. comical situations, body language and language usage (e.g. the nicknames of some of the characters). This argument is in line with Jansen,Jansen, W.H. 1965. The esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore. In: Dundes, A. The study of folklore. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. who is of the opinion that comics and television series should receive the interest of folklorists and should incite them to pursue further the application and significance of the esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore. = Magic = An Afrikaans story that could be classified as a magic tale in that it portrays the role of magic and the repetition of the number three, is \\"Die Wolfkoningin\\" by I.D. du Plessis.Du Plessis, I.D. 1970. Doederomandro en ander Kaapse Stories. Kaapstad: Human & Rousseau. Though this story is called a Cape story, since it reflects the culture of people of Malay origin, who are concentrated in the Western Cape (Du Plessis can be regarded as one of South Africa's leading experts on Cape Malay stories). Following Bettelheim, Steenberg would probably regard the story as a fairy tale. It is a story of magic that reflects some aspects of the inner world of human beings. According to Miruka's classification of folktale content, it can be called an imaginary tale. This imaginary tale has a typically Eastern setting, with a rural atmosphere. There are hunters, a wood, rich landowners (\\"wazirs\\") and beautiful ladies (\\"poeteri\\"). There is a definite movement from an earthly space (the house of a wood cutter) to a magical space (a dance party and a wolf's den), and ultimately a return to an earthly reality (the house of the wazir). The number three reoccurs in different spatial settings and with respect to different objects, and symbolises the character's search for freedom, identity and fellowship. The main character's incantation in order to release the magical power (where she changes from a wolf into a beautiful lady) also centres on this number. In this context, the symbolism of these objects can stretch \\"the capacity of both expression and comprehension, and becomes the medium through which some of the most universal, elemental - and intangible - concepts of man are conveyed\\".Leach, M. (ed). 1972. Standard dictionary of folklore, mythology and legend. Toronto: Funk & Wagnalls Publishing Company. = The transmission of social and cultural values and traditions = Some of the best examples of Afrikaans folklore are stories recorded and written by Minnie Postma,(a) Postma, M. 1964. Litsomo. Johannesburg: Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel. (b) Postma, M. 1986. As die maan oor die lug loop (Sotho-verhale). Kaapstad: Tafelberg. who grew up with and heard these tales told by Sotho people. Using these stories can give effect to a recommendation made by Robinson,Robinson, G.L.N. 1995. Crosscultural understanding: Processes and approaches for foreign language, English as a second language and bilingual educators. New York: Pergamon Institute of English. namely that the integration of culture in a language programme should be a synthesis between the learner's home culture, the target language's cultural input and the learner as an individual. According to Robinson, intercultural understanding develops from cultural adaptability, that is, 'modifying one's own cultural repertoire'. An interesting example of an Afrikaans folktale that is situated in an African context and entails the transmission of cultural values, traditions and views, is Postma's story \\"In die begin\\". This story explains how things were between woman and man in the beginning. MillerMiller, P. 1979. Myths and legends of Southern Africa. Cape Town: T.V. Bulpin Publications. gives a similar account of the same phenomenon in a discussion of a Sotho-Tswana myth called \\"The First Marriage and the First Bachelor\\". HattinghHattingh, M. 1994. Die baie stemme van Minnie Postma se Litsomo. Stilet 6:39-56. discusses the validity of Postma's oral transmission in detail and notes that Postma understands and applies the different characteristics of Southern Sotho narratives. Jacottet (1908. in Hatthingh 1994) postulates that this story has its origin in San culture, because the men in the story use bows and arrows, weapons which were never used by the Basotho. In both Postma's and Jacottet's representation of this myth, the woman's identity is established in terms of masculine criteria. However, Postma adds a new dimension. Her narration depicts a woman as an intelligent, creative and innovative being, even if she is the servant of the man. The dialogue in the story is typical of the oral narrative in that dramatic development, rather than description, is preferred. The relationship between male and female is exceptionally harmonious, unlike in most other Southern Sotho narratives. = Ecological stories = The folktales of Eug√®ne MaraisMarais, E.N. 1965. Dwaalstories. Kaapstad: Human & Rousseau. are typical examples of African ecological narratives concerning the relationship between things and people. Marais follows the tradition of San stories, more specifically those that are known as wandering stories,Kannemeyer, J.C. 1978. Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse literatuur I. Kaapstad: Academica. in that songs and poems are included. In \\"Die Vaal Koestertjie\\" we find well-known themes of threatened innocence and beauty, and the weaker character's victory over physical strength and mockery. According to Kannemeyer, this story - with its use of the apostrophe, paradox, inversion and cumulative and progressive parallelism - follows to a great extent the traditional line of fairy-tale literature. A young Koisan girl, Nampti, has a very special relationship with a little bird, which she calls 'her little grey sister' because they are both pipits. This character fits in very well with Miruka's general description of birds in ecological stories - she seems unfailingly to appear in times of crisis and she acts as a messenger bearing urgent and important messages, more specifically information about the magic formula that can transform and enrich the protagonist. She (the bird) is invincible, being up in the air and out of reach of the antagonists, in this case the other young women. She counsels the protagonist and is her life guardian. Like other folktales, this story can be used in the language classroom to discuss moral voices, choices, and values like patience and tolerance, even fatalistic benevolence. = Idiomatic expressions = Language plays an important role in any culture. HydeKamwangamalu, N. 1997. English and transformation to multicultural education in the new South Africa. Journal for Language Teaching 31(3):243-252. observes that people are not necessarily prisoners of their language, but that the way a culture sees the world is nevertheless reflected in its language. In the same vein, TrivediTrivedi, H.C. 1978. Culture in language learning. English Language Teaching Journal 32(2):92-97. emphasises the importance of the transmission of values as well as the recognition of emotional problems that the learner might experience (like culture shock and feelings of helplessness), language anxiety and fear of failure, in being unable to understand or interpret the cultural message. The (learned) behaviour and values of learners of an additional language will be challenged through exposure to the culture of the target language. Their critical appreciation will be intensified by listening to Afrikaans folklore. Miruka mentions an important function of folklore, namely that of mental stimulation. Developmental aspects such as memory training, sensory awareness, analysis and synthesis, as well as affective development can be specifically emphasised in this regard. The development of all mental and other capacities can be enhanced by the use of an Afrikaans folktale full of idiomatic expressions: \\"Klein Riet-alleen-in-die-roerkuil\\" by Eug√®ne Marais, which is included in the volume Dwaalstories (1927). This story by Marais follows the basic pattern of Western European fairy tales and myths in that the San hero (Klein Riet) is given an important task to carry out within a specific time frame. NolteNolte, E. 1999. Terug na die teks of om stroomop te swem. Stilet 11:9-22. indicates that the whole story might have developed around a range of Afrikaans idiomatic expressions. These expressions can be regarded as a reflection of the values of the source culture in the classroom for Afrikaans as an additional language. This study by Nolte can serve an important function in helping to overcome the previously mentioned problems that learners of Afrikaans as an additional language often experience. Idiomatic expressions and the like are very well received and appreciated by additional language learners from African cultures (as experience with Zulu-speaking learners has shown,Kruger, E. 2002. Folklore as a multi-cultural component in the literature curriculum for Afrikaans as additional language. Southern African Journal for Folklore Studies, 12(2):93-113. perhaps because they often have so many of these in their mother tongue. However, because of urbanisation, many idiomatic expressions have been lost in African languages. These learners have a rich instinct for idioms and have often even created new expressions themselves in the additional language context (e.g. 'Matriek is nie matras nie'). = Praise poems = A story like \\"Lied van die re√´n\\" by Eug√®ne Marais is an ideal example of an Afrikaans praise song that could contribute to the integration of cultural aspects of previously marginalised groups in the curriculum to achieve sensitivity. Coming from an African culture, Kamwangamalu is of the opinion that almost every element in a language programme is capable of conveying a cultural message of some sort: \\"Culture is the socially learned, shared assemblage of practices, perceptions, attitudes, world views, value systems and beliefs that determine the texture of our lives as members of a given community.\\" According to Mih√°likMih√°lik, A. 1988. Die lied van die re√´n - 'n Afrika-pryslied. Tydskrif vir Letterkunde 26:84-91. this folktale by Marais, although it was considered to be an indigenous fairy tale, is an example of an African praise song that can be compared with Sotho and Zulu praise songs dedicated to nature. Mih√°lik refers to Finnegan's view that there is a similarity between African and European folklore and that there is supposedly some primordial source for both. The impression is that Marais got these stories from a certain \\"old Hendrik\\" (probably Tswana or Sotho) during his visits to the Waterberge. = Ogre characters = A folktale that calls to mind the European fairy tale The Beauty and the Beast on the one hand, yet fits Miruka's description of a tale involving African ogre characters, is Brolloks en Bittergal by C.J. Langenhoven.Langenhoven, C.J. 1977. Brolloks en Bittergal. Kaapstad: Tafelberg. It was first published in 1925, and has kept Afrikaans-speaking listeners spellbound from one generation to the next ever since. The main character, Brolloks, is a grotesque and monsterlike individual, scheming and decidedly untrustworthy. He is like Miruka's description of Luo ogres: neither human nor animal but displaying characteristics of both; and the Maasai ogre: 'a man-eater as well as an eater of its own kind ... [possessing the] quality of grandiosity and hedonism'. Brolloks lives as a human being would. Miruka emphasises that ogres are but masks of humanity; they are no different from those in society 'who specialise in ugly deeds but who can appear very mild and sociable to gain access to the victims'. Brolloks ultimately corresponds to Miruka's interpretation of the ogre who stands \\"for evil and death. He symbolises the ominous flail of vice looming over humanity and threatening to reduce it to nothingness. He is a replica of those of us who are dehumanised, alienated, immoral and egotistically ready to achieve their goals ... regardless of the repercussions on the larger society\\".

Fasce served in various leadership positions in her convent in Genoa and was noted for the establishment of an orphanage and spreading the charism of Saint Augustine and Saint Rita of Cascia. Fasce was beatified at Saint Peter's Square on 12 October 1997. Life Monument to Maria Giovanna Fasce (Cascia) Maria Giovanna Fasce was born on 27 December 1881 in Genoa to the middle-class Eugenio Fasce and his second wife Teresa Valente. She had seven siblings and her oldest sibling was Luigia. Her relations dubbed her as \\"Marietta\\". Her mother died in 1889 which prompted her oldest sister Luigia to take care of Fasce. Fasce taught catechism to children and grew to love the charism of Saint Augustine. She also met her confessor Father Mariano Ferriello in Genoa who encouraged her to learn of the Augustinian figures and pursue her vocation. She also became aware of the life of Rita of Cascia and travelled to Rome in 1900 when Pope Leo XIII canonized her - this was the most important event of her life thus far and solidified her desire to become a nun. She expressed this intention to her relations who took the news bad and her brothers in particular were negative about it. Her oldest sister Luigia accepted this but did not understand Fasce's reasoning for living in a primitive place like Cascia. She applied for admission to a Ligurian convent but was rejected much to her surprise. The Abbess Giuseppina Gattarelli said that she believed Fasce was unable to handle the rigors of the monastic life. Fasce reapplied and was accepted in 1906. On 22 June 1906 she entered the convent of the Order of Saint Augustine (she received the habit on the night of 25 December 1906) and made the profession of her initial vows on 25 December 1907 in the religious name of \\"Maria Teresa\\". She became quite disillusioned due to the convent's decline and returned home in June 1910 for a period of deep reflection. Her time at home saw her affirm her desire to be in the monastic life and returned to the convent in May 1911 and later made her solemn vows on 22 March 1912. She was appointed as novice mistress on 17 July 1914 at the time of World War I and was then vicar of her convent from 1917 until 1920. The unanimous decision of the convent's leadership saw her made abbess on 12 August 1920 and she held that post until her death. In 1923 she began the circulation of the newsletter \\"Dalle Api alle Rose\\" (first edition published 22 May 1923) in order to promote the almost unknown chapel that contained the remains of Rita of Cascia and desired bringing people to God through the saint she admired. Fasce suffered from a malignant tumor on her right breast and had to undergo two operations on it. She referred to her tumor as her \\"treasure\\" that was the most beautiful gift that Jesus Christ had given her. She suffered from diabetes and asthma and also became overweight which caused walking difficulties - fellow nuns also had to move her in a chair later in her tenure. Her goal was the construction of a girl's orphanage which began construction in 1925 and finished in 1938 though she had to depend on donations and work was slow due to the bad economic climate and the onslaught of World War II. She referred to the orphan girls as her \\"bees\\" and the first girl to be admitted into the new orphanage was Edda Petrucci. Fasce died in 1947. Her remains were placed next to Rita of Cascia. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process commenced in the Diocese of Spoleto-Norcia in an informative process that commenced on 5 August 1968 and concluded its business on 5 June 1971. Fasce was titled as a Servant of God on 5 August 1968 under Pope Paul VI once the process commenced. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 6 May 1988 in Rome. The postulation sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for further assessment at which point theologians met and approved its contents on 17 January 1995 while the C.C.S. themselves followed suit on 6 June 1995. Pope John Paul II proclaimed Fasce to be Venerable on 11 July 1995 after confirming that the late religious had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated in the Italian diocese of its origin and received C.C.S. validation on 17 March 1995 while a medical board approved the miracle on 30 November 1995; theologians also voiced their approval on 24 January 1997 while the C.C.S. did so as well on 18 March 1997. John Paul II approved the miracle on 7 July 1997 and beatified her on 12 October 1997.

Nagaraj and Smt.Varada Devi, Vasundhara made her acquaintance with Bharatanatyam at the tender age of 4 under the guidance of Muralidhar Rao and won a gold medal at the age of 5 at the state level competition. which highlighted her potential and prompted her parents to seek out the supervision of Late ShriRajaratnamPillai the student of Pandanallur Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, who continued in the role of her Guru. Vasundhara, through her dedicated training claimed 1st rank in Vidwath Examination conducted by Karnataka Secondary Education Board and claimed three consecutive gold medals. She was married to Late Sri H.S. Doraswamy and has a son who lives in Australia with her daughter-in-law Meghala Hirasave continuing in her tradition. Meghala Hirasave has a well known school called art of vinyasa where she teaches students dance with great passion and dedication to the art form. Career In 1988 Vasundhara earned a Ph D for her study on the correlation between Yoga and Bharatanatyam. She holds a post-graduate degree in Folklore and is a consummate exponent of the martial arts of ‚ÄòTang-ta‚Äô and ‚ÄòKalarippayattu‚Äô that vouches for her quest for multidisciplinary approach to dance e. Dr Vasundhara has released a Treatise on the correlation of Yoga and Dance called \\"Natya Yoga Darshana\\". As for her choreographies, \`Panchali\` is noted for its singular adaptation of Yakshagana music (a form of folk music from the State of Karnataka) to Bharatanatyam. Solo productions like Ganga Lahari, Ambe, Dakshayani,Panchali, ShakuntaKunjana (literary masterpieces of Udyavara Madhava Acharya) and now Jyothi Shankar's Kshaatra Draupadi ‚Äìwith a strong female oriented theme have won acclaim.

Over the years, with her experience and creativity, she has been able to give it a unique footprint of her own, which has been recognized by the dance fraternity and the art connoisseurs in her performances and that of her students. As a venerated Guru, Dr Vasundhara has been successful in generating (three generations) disciples who have imbibed her every move, look (Drishti) & nuances needed etc. in the way they perform. What inspired Dr Vasundhara to experiment with the boundaries of the classical dance of Bharatanatyam was supposed to have been her strong footing in Yoga and experience of martial arts. Her use of singular hastas, alluring gaits, abhinaya which can communicate easily with the common man, modifications of the adavus, aharya, inimitable feather-touch footwork, all within the traditional framework, have led to a unique footprint that is today identified and recognized as \\"Vasundhara Style\\".

Etymology The name of the genus derives from the Greek œÑŒ±œáœçœÑŒ∑œÇ (tachytes), meaning swiftness or speed. Distribution These wasps have a worldwide distribution throughout temperate and tropical regions. Description Adults are typically black, with light or clear wings, and sometimes a red or brown gaster or legs. They are about 12 mm long, but can range from 4 mm to 24 mm. Many species have green eyes, which is distinctive of the genus. They often possess short golden hairs and a round build, which can give them a bee-like appearance. Biology Tachytes generally predates on Orthoptera (grasshoppers and katydids, especially those of the families Acrididae, Tettigoniidae, Tetrigidae, and Tridactylidae), though Tachytes bidens reportedly predates on geometer moths. Like other hunting wasps, the female captures a prey item, stings to paralyze it, and seals it in a burrow along with an egg that consumes the prey during development. The sting often paralyzes the prey completely, though in a few species, it only appears to prevent them from attempting to escape. Their burrows can be very long, up to one meter in Tachytes praedator. Jean-Henri Fabre devotes a chapter to their predacious behavior in his More Hunting Wasps, comparing it with the genus Sphex. Some Tachytes species exhibit hilltopping behavior, in which males will perch near and territorially defend points of high elevation, such as the tops of hills and mountains. In other cases, males apparently guard burrows with developing females, waiting for them to emerge.

Sources may also identify her by the pseudonym, Mathilde Leusch; Leusch is apparently a variant of her second husband's surname (Lesch). Life Mathilde Danegger was born and attended school in Vienna. Her father was an Austrian character actor and stage producer (real name, Joseph Deutsch: 1865‚Äì1933) who later took over as director of the City Theatre in Z√ºrich. Her mother, Bertha Danegger (real name Bertha Deutsch; known professionally by her maiden name Bertha M√ºller, she was an Austrian actress of stage and silent film. Like her elder brothers, (1889-1948) and Theodor Danegger (1891-1959), she decided on a stage career early in life. She started her performing with children's roles, making her debut in 1912 at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater in Berlin, with a further youthful appearance there in 1914. She would continue to return to the Berlin stage throughout her career, but by 1919 she was, with her parents, based in Z√ºrich. In 1919/1920 she had engagements at the City Theatre in Vienna. From 1921-24, she was working, primarily, at the Popular Theatre in Vienna, and, between 1924-28, at the Theater in der Josefstadt. Danegger's first marriage was to Herbert Waniek (1897‚Äì1949) whose theatre career during the 1920s was focused on the same Vienna theatres as those of his wife. Waniek had connections with the \\"German Theatre\\" at Brno (in the former Czechoslovakia), where, until 1933, Mathilde Danegger was making regular guest appearances. There were also frequent guest appearances at theatres in Berlin and Vienna. Around this time she married her second husband, Swiss drama producer Walter Lesch (1898‚Äì1958). With the German change in government at the start of 1933, Mathilde, a staunch antifascist, fled to Switzerland where she worked at the National Theatre in Z√ºrich with Wolfgang Langhoff, like her a political exile from Nazi Germany. She took part in political cabaret, between 1934-38 appearing in the \\"Cornichon\\" cabaret established by her husband. In 1939, she met with Herbert Cr√ºger, who subsequently became her third husband. She was a co-founder in Switzerland of the National Committee for a Free Germany. Two years after the war ended, in 1947, Mathilde Danegger returned to Germany. Sources differ as to whether she settled in the American occupation zone or in East Berlin, which was in the central part of what had been Germany, and was now administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. In reality, it was several years before the political division of occupied Germany would be matched by physical barriers. Between 1947-51, she was working at the Hessische National Theatre in Wiesbaden. In East Berlin, supported by the dramatist's wife and business manager, Helene Weigel, Danegger was recruited by Bertolt Brecht to work at the Berliner Ensemble where she was employed between 1951-53. During these years she was active in the peace movement. In December 1948 she joined the German Communist Party. Between 1948-51 she also wrote, as Cultural Editor, for Unsere Stimme, a regional communist news magazine based at Villingen-Schwenningen near the border with Switzerland. In 1953, four years after the foundation of two separate German states, and with the border between them becoming less permeable, she formally relocated with her husband to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). There followed a long period as a star of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. Among others, she took part in productions by Wolfgang Langhoff, Wolfgang Heinz, Benno Besson and . In parallel with her theatre work, from 1960 she built up an extensive repertoire of cinema and television roles in productions by the state-owned film studio, DEFA, and Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the state television broadcaster. She had already undertaken a significant amount of acting work in front of the camera during her time in Switzerland. Of particular note was her portrayal of Frau Holle in the 1963 film of the eponymous fairy tale by Gottfried Kolditz and her television role in \\"Mutter Jantschowa\\" (1968). She remained politically engaged throughout. In 1957 she wrote a letter to the party defending dissident Wolfgang Harich following his arrest. Marriages By her second husband she was the mother of the actress Karin Lesch. Her third husband, the university lecturer and author Herbert Cr√ºger, became caught up in the political persecution that was a feature of East Germany in the 1950s. In 1956, he was overheard criticising the arrest of Bernhard Steinberger in the aftermath of the remarkable party conference of the Soviet Communist Party. In March 1958 Cr√ºger was himself arrested by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). At a secret trial in December 1958 he was found guilty of \\"high treason\\" (\\"schweren Staatsverrats\\") and sentenced to an eight-year jail term. In the end he was released in 1961 and rehabilitated by the High Court in May 1990.

The capitals letters F, H and M are spelled out close together in a large, red font with a black shadow. , the Israeli actress alt=Upper body colour photograph of Gal Gadot in 2016. FHM 100 Sexiest Women is an annual listing compiled by the monthly British men's lifestyle magazine FHM, based on which women they believe to be the \\"sexiest\\". , each year's list is first announced through a section on FHM official website, FHM.com. The first listing was published in 1995 and was voted for by a panel of 250 judges. The inaugural winner was German supermodel Claudia Schiffer. From 1996 to 2015, the poll was instead voted for by the general public, with, at its height, several million votes being cast each year. Subsequent winners have included the British singer Cheryl, the American actress Halle Berry, and Jennifer Lopez. At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the listing, while Lopez was the first to top it more than once. By the time FHM ceased publication of its print edition in January 2016, the 100 Sexiest Women list had been compiled 21 times. The current holder of the Sexiest Woman title is the Israeli actress Gal Gadot. Alongside the 100 Sexiest Women list, FHM has also twice published a \\"Most Eligible Bachelorettes\\" list, in 2006 and 2007, to celebrate qualities such as \\"talent, star quality and cash\\". These lists were topped by the American actress Mischa Barton and the American socialite Kimberly Stewart, respectively. To commemorate the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the 100 Sexiest Women list, two one-off charts were compiled in April 2004 and May 2014, to recognise the sexiest women up to those points. The winner of the 2004 list was the English singer Louise Redknapp, who had placed on every 100 Sexiest list since 1996, while the 2014 chart topper was the singer Rachel Stevens, who had peaked at number two in 2001, 2002, and 2004. History The first 100 Sexiest Women list was published in 1995, and was compiled exclusively by a panel of 250 judges; German supermodel Claudia Schiffer topped the inaugural chart. The following year's poll was the first to be opened up to the general public ‚Äì a total of 10,000 votes were cast, with the American actress Gillian Anderson being announced as the winner that September. A spokesman for FHM described her as the \\"thinking man's crumpet\\" and a \\"surprise winner\\". Anderson had posed half-naked on the front cover of the magazine earlier that year. The 1999 \\"100 Sexiest Women\\" poll was launched by projecting a naked image of alt=Colour photograph of a naked image of Gail Porter projected onto the Palace of Westminster in 1999 Over subsequent years, the list's popularity continued to grow. The 1998 poll was voted on by half a million readers, with its companion issue being sold sealed inside a plastic cover. Martin Daubney, a former features editor of FHM, noted that this added a \\"sense of mystique and occasion\\" to the issue, which went on to sell 936,000 copies. The issue's cover girl was British TV presenter Cat Deeley, who had placed at number seven; the 100 Sexiest winner was Playboy model Jenny McCarthy. The following year, FHM publicists promoted the poll by projecting a 60 ft naked image of British TV presenter Gail Porter onto the front of the Palace of Westminster. An FHM spokesman remarked: \\"We want to up the voting frenzy for the poll ... It is a cheeky way of increasing interest.\\" Porter was placed at number eight in the chart that year, while American actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was number one. The first person to top the 100 Sexiest Women list more than once was American singer Jennifer Lopez, who was placed at number one in both 2000 and 2001. Speaking about being named the sexiest woman in the world for a second year running, Lopez said she was \\"overwhelmed\\", and added: \\"Any woman who says they don't like being called sexy, they're lying.\\" By 2002, the list was attracting over five million votes ‚Äì that year, Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova was number one. A further five million votes were cast the following year, when the American actress Halle Berry was named as the world's sexiest. At 36 years old, Berry was the oldest woman ever to top the list. She responded: \\"Wow, that's a pretty heady title. I'm not so sure I live up to it, but thank you anyway.\\" The first British woman to top the listing was the model Kelly Brook, who was named the world's sexiest in 2005, the most successful poll to that point. , Brook has been featured in the top ten of FHM 100 Sexiest Women ten times, more than any other entrant. The 2011 list was noted for being the first to include a transgender woman. The androgynous model Andrej Pejiƒá was voted at number 98 on the poll. FHM caused controversy when the entry's accompanying blurb warned its readers to \\"pass the sick bucket\\" and described Pejic as a \\"thing\\". Following a backlash, FHM removed the text from their website, spoke directly with Pejiƒá and issued a public apology, saying that the online entry \\"wasn't subbed prior to going live\\". The final 100 Sexiest Women poll to be voted for by the public was published in 2015, before FHM went out of print in January the following year. The list included its oldest entrant ever, 80-year-old food writer Mary Berry, who was placed at number 74, while the sexiest woman that year was British actress Michelle Keegan. Speaking in November 2015 as FHM suspended its print publication, a spokesman reflected that the poll was what the magazine was best known for, and that it had \\"helped propel the careers of many well-known actresses, musicians and models\\". Subsequent 100 Sexiest Women lists have been compiled by FHM writers themselves, and have been published on FHM.com. , the most recent winner is Gal Gadot. 100 Sexiest Women winners {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" +100 Sexiest Women !scope=colYear !scope=col width=170pxWinner !scope=col width=200px class=unsortableTop ten !scope=col class=unsortableRef. -

Unlike the 100 Sexiest Women list, this list also considered qualities such as \\"talent, star quality and cash\\" as well as sex appeal in its compilation. Similar lists published by the US version of FHM had been topped by women such as the model Lauren Bush and the socialite Paris Hilton. The 2006 list was voted for by more than 3,000 FHM readers, and was published in March of that year. It was topped by American actress Mischa Barton. Speaking about the result, FHM editor Ross Brown remarked: \\"Our most eligible list consists of much more than just sex appeal and our readers recognise a good catch when they see one.\\" The following year, the Most Eligible Bachelorettes list was topped by the American socialite Kimberly Stewart. The list received over 10,000 votes from FHM readership, and was featured in the April 2007 issue of the magazine. An FHM spokesperson stated: \\"Kimberly Stewart has all the attributes you want in a woman.

To commemorate the tenth edition of the poll in May 2004, FHM published a list ranking the 50 sexiest women of the previous ten years. The list was topped by the English singer Louise Redknapp, who had placed on every 100 Sexiest list since 1996. Ten years later, in May 2014, FHM published a list of the \\"Sexiest Women of All Time\\", compiled using a new analysis based on the previous 20 years' worth of polls. The winner was the English singer Rachel Stevens. Stevens had been featured on 11 lists at that point, but had never been placed first on any of the annual lists, instead peaking at number two in 2001, 2002 and 2004.

It is located in the midline of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. It is covered anteriorly by mucosa in the adenoid mass. It is bounded posteriorly by longus muscle. Signs and symptoms The symptoms usually appear when there is inflammation of pharyngeal bursa causing Tornwaldt's cyst. This is caused by spontaneous drainage in the nasopharyngeal cavity or can also be caused because of involvement of nervous plexus. The symptoms are occipital headache, cough, middle ear effusion, cervical myalgia, halitosis ie bad breath. When there is an enlargement of the cyst it causes symptoms like nasal obstruction, post nasal discharge with foul smelling odour, blockage of Eustachian tube causing otalgia and secretory otitis media, retro orbital pain. Cause Tornwaldt's disease is caused by many different causative agents of stimulus. This includes excessive alcohol and tobacco which causes decrease in local immune resistance and so the pathogenic microbes take advantage and lead to the disease. Frequent contact with high temperature, malnutrition, chronic heart disease, kidney disease, joint disease, poor living and working conditions and contact with dust and harmful gases leads to the thornwaldt's disease. Pathogenesis Tornwaldt's disease is a rare benign disorder caused by persistent notochord remnants. This disease almost remains asymptomatic. At about the 10th week of embryonic development, the pharyngeal pouch forms by adhesion of the pharyngeal ectoderm to the cranial end of the notochord. This become closed at the orifice or crusts adhere to the orifice without closing. The contact between these remnants and pharyngeal ectoderm leads to the growth of respiratory epithelium. This forms Tornwaldt's bursa which drains into the nasopharyngeal cavity. This only forms cyst when the orifice partially or completely obstructed by infection. A Tornwaldt's cyst progresses in to Tornwaldt's disease only after infection or inflammation occurs. Diagnosis CT scan shows solid mass of Tornwaldt's cyst and MRI shows glass shaped lesion with a fluid on upper part of posterior nasopharyngeal wall. Additionally, a cystic mass in upper part of nasopharyngeal wall and mucopurulent discharge from upper part of the mass can be seen on nasal endoscopy. Among them MRI is the best for diagnosing the Tornwaldt's cyst. Treatment Antibiotics are given to treat the infection. If there is a large symptomatic lesion, surgery by transnasal endoscopic marsupialisation is the treatment option because it is safe, fast and provides good visualization during surgery and for small lesion Endonasal approach is recommended. History Tornwaldt's disease was noted by Mayer in 1840. He noted it in an autopsy specimen but founded as a pathologic entity by German physician Gustavust L. Tornwaldt in 1855. Only a few cases have been reported in Japan between 1929 and 1992.

Biography  The son of a surgeon at the H√¥tel des Invalides, Legrand started very early his acting career, first in Lyon in 1692 in the company of Marshall de Villeroy and made a first attempt at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise 19 March 1694 but was not received. After a stay in Warsaw at the court of John III Sobieski, he returned to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise 21 March 1702 and was received 18 October. Disgraced by nature, he one day harangued the audience by throwing \\"Gentlemen, it is easier for you to accustom yourself to my face, that for me to change it.\\" If he never gave up the stage (he even played the role of Ma√Ætre Robert in his last play Les Amazones modernes in 1727, written in collaboration with Louis Fuzelier), he devoted part of his time to writing theater plays (forty in all), sometimes to the Com√©die fran√ßaise, sometimes to the Comedie Italienne, and once even for a Th√©√¢tre de la foire, the op√©ra comique, Les Animaux raisonnables, 1717. Le Roi de Cocagne (1718) is usually considered to be his masterpiece.

Following the Greek failure to hold the Pass of Kleisoura on 14 April a new attempt was made to stop the German advance east of the road Bilisht (in Albania) ‚Äì Kastoria ‚Äì Grevena, which was used as the main route for the withdrawal of the Greek Western Macedonia Army Section. Prelude The origin of the battle lies with the battle of Kleisoura Pass, crossing between mountains Vitsi and Siniatsiko immediately to the east of the plain of Kastoria, separating it from the plains of Ptolemaida. In the engagement fought on 13 and 14 April, the Greek detachment comprising elements from the Greek 20th Infantry Division failed to hold the German LSSAH brigade. In the midday 14 April, the commander of the Greek Western Macedonia Army Section (TSDM), after having been asked by Central Macedonia Army Section (TSKM) to send reinforcements for the 20th Division to counterattack, dispatched from its own 13th Infantry Division the I/23 battalion on motor vehicles, while additional forces were marching on foot. Because the units could not arrive in time, the counterattack never took place. Instead, the German LSSAH brigade advanced forward to meet the Greek detachments gathering around Lake Kastoria. Opposing forces =Greek forces= The Greek forces that participated in the battle belonged to the Cavalry Division north of the lake, and principally to the 13th Infantry Division south of the lake. The 20th Infantry Division was in poor shape after its long retreat between 10 and 13 April and the defeat at the battle of Kleisoura Pass, and concentrated around the village Smixi, immediately to the south of the 13th Division. At 02:00 hours on 15 April the 20th Division received from TSKM the order to move southwards and deploy in the area west of the Aliakmon River and between Tsotyli and Neapoli. The Greek Cavalry Division, part of the TSDM, was the first Greek unit to withdraw from Albania, already since 8 April, taking positions south of Lake Prespa, facing the plain of Florina which was expected to fall to German units coming southwards through Yugoslavia. The Division remained on the defensive, and successfully held back elements of the LSSAH attacking from Florina, in the battle of Pisoderi Pass. On 14 April however, following the collapse of the Greek defense on the Kleisoura Pass, the Division's sector was threatened from the south, and the Division sent forward the 21st Reconnaissance Group (Vosniadis' Squadron) plus one Cavalry Squadron from the 1st Cavalry Regiment, as well as a troop (2 guns) of 47mm anti-tank guns. The detachment received support from one battalion of heavy artillery.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 113 The 13th Infantry Division, consisting of the 18th, 22nd and 23rd Infantry Regiments had taken part in the short lived joint Greek‚ÄìYugoslav offensive in Albania agreed prior to the German attack. The division had attacked with two battalions on 7 April north of Pogradec, taking some Italian positions and many prisoners, but also suffering substantial casualties (763 killed and wounded).ŒîŒôŒ£, page 10 The information arriving from Yugoslavia regarding the situation there, convinced the Greek command to call off the attacks for 8 April, and the Division reverted to the defensive.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 9 On the same day elements of the Division entered Yugoslav territory and carried out demolitions on the road leading to Pogradec to protect its flank.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 15 In the night of 12‚Äì13 April the Division began its withdrawal, breaking contact with the Italians successfully at 22:00 on 12 April. Having covered 45 kilometers in 17 hours, on 13 April the Division's HQ was at Bilisht, where it remained for a day, in order to cover the withdrawal of the other units of TSDM.ŒîŒôŒ£, pages 101-102 The Division was briefly bombarded by the Italian air force on 13 April, and on 14 April Italian Bersaglieri elements made contact with the Division's rearguard, while 26 Italian prisoners were taken in an ambush.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 103 Late on 14 April the entire Division was set in motion towards Argos Orestiko.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 104 Due to the congestion created by the Division's using a single route, the movement during the night of 14‚Äì15 April was particularly slow.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 104 Also on 14 April, as mentioned above, the Division received the request to mount two battalions on motor vehicles to be sent for the counterattack on Kleisoura Pass.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 103 The number of vehicles available sufficed for only a battalion of infantry. Battalion I/23 had marched some in 15 hours and had reached Bilisht at 1530 where it took the order to move to Argos Orestiko and be put under command of 21st Infantry Brigade. Loading of the first elements began at 16:30 and was eventually completed by 18:15, as initially an insufficient number of trucks was provided.Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, page 98 Arriving at 2000 hours at Argos Orestiko the battalion found a chaotic situation and panic-stricken units of the 20th Division.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 103 Following a brief confusion regarding the battalion's exact mission, the 13th Division's commander ordered the battalion to dismount and take positions defensively on the hills east of the line Limenakia‚ÄìAmpelokipoi, covering the Division's withdrawal. For that purpose, the commander sent also the battalion-sized 13th Reconnaissance Group, a company of four heavy machineguns (of 13.2 mm caliber) and a field battery of 3 guns creating a detachment which was placed under the command of the Division's infantry commander, Colonel Efstathios Liosis.ŒîŒôŒ£, pages 104-105 By the morning of 15 April the detachment was further reinforced with an additional 3 field and 4 heavy artillery batteries, while the 2nd Positional Machinegun battalion was sent to replace the 13th Reconnaissance Group which was to cover the front further south. In fact he commander of the 2nd Positional Machinegun Battalion didn't obey the order, claiming much later that the order was not written and that the positions assigned to it were vulnerable to tanks.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 105-106 =German forces= Armored reconnaissance vehicles belonging to the LSSAH during the Balkan campaign (photo taken in Yugoslavia or Bulgaria) The German forces that participated in the battle belonged to the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH), an SS motorised unit of brigade size. More specifically the units that participated in the action were the reinforced Reconnaissance Battalion under Sturmbannf√ºhrer Kurt Meyer which acted as LSSAH's vanguard battlegroup, as well as the III/LSSAH and II/LSSAH motorised infantry battalions and the entire LSSAH Artillery Regiment (two battalions with a total of 24 guns).Golla, pages 230-232 Meyer's battlegroup included besides the Reconnaissance battalion's organic strength (one armoured car company, two motorcycle infantry companies, one heavy weapons company),Golla, page 502 also a troop of light and another of heavy infantry guns, a troop of Panzerj√§ger I tank hunters, a troop of flak guns, and a heavy howitzer battery.Golla, page 230 Opposing tactics The Greek plan was to hold the Germans away from the road Bilisht‚ÄìGrevena, however unknown to the commanders of 13th and Cavalry Division at the time, their mission had actually already been compromised by the collapse of the Greek 12th Infantry Division‚Äôs defense on Siatista Pass to the south, which had been abandoned to the German 5th Panzer Division late on 14 April (in reality the Germans attacked again on 15 April to find the Greek positions vacant as the 12th Division had withdrawn west of river Aliakmon).ŒîŒôŒ£, page 68 In order to achieve their task, the Cavalry Division would block the German attack north of Lake Kastoria at Foteini Pass, while the 13th Division would attempt to form a front south of the lake, from its shore to the western slopes of Mt. Siniatsiko. South of the 13th Division, the 20th Division was covering the banks of river Aliakmon from a possible attack from Siatista Pass, having demolished its bridges leaving only a wooden one to permit withdrawal of stragglers.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 73 The battle The first contact between the German and the Greek line was made at 0530 on 15 April. The Greek side identified the German forces as light motorized troops supported by 15 ‚Äútanks‚Äù.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 106 Another Greek source based on the account of I/23 battalion's commander mentions 17 ‚Äúlight tanks‚Äù and 10 ‚Äúcars‚Äù.Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, page 100 Based on Meyer's account it was his own LSSAH's armored reconnaissance battalion which first made contact with the Greek line.Meyer, page 68 Golla also includes the III/LSSAH in the first attacks.Golla, page 231 The first German attack took place at around 0600 and was beaten off,Golla, page 231ŒîŒôŒ£, page 106 with the Greeks claiming to have hit 25 vehicles and caused substantial casualties, although the weakness on the Greek right wing became apparent.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 106 At 1100 the Germans renewed their attack, reinforced with what the Greeks describe as a truck-borne unit of battalion strength and 10 batteries of heavy artillery.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 107 Paschalidis notes that at 1030 German heavy artillery intensely bombarded the right wing of I/23 causing 3 killed and 10 wounded. He also notes that the Greek position was very poor as the men were immobile in rocky terrain, which under bombardment caused flying rocks to disproportionally increase the amount of woundedŒ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, page 100-101 Meyer notes that ‚Äúabout midday‚Äù the III/LSSAH battalion entered the battle to his left in an effort to envelop the Greek line and reach its line of retreat.Meyer, page 69 This attack was beaten off through the effective fire of the Greek infantry and artillery. Throughout the battle the Greek artillery had good observation on the German artillery and brought down on them very effective counter-battery fire, silencing them and forcing them to change positions.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 107 At 1330 the Germans repeated their infantry attack with strong support by tanks and artillery and by 1400 succeeded in capturing the village Ampelokipoi on the Greek right wing. The Greek cavalry squadron defending the location suffered heavily, retreated and part of it was captured, after its commander captain Kleitos Hatziliadis was killed in action.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 108 Golla notes that the III/LSSAH reached its objective at 1400 and the Reconnaissance battalion/LSSAH at 1645.Golla, page 231 At about 1445 the Greek I/23 was reporting that it had suffered some 84 killed and wounded, and its companies were asking for additional stretcher- bearers.Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, page 102 The Greek command which had been worried from the beginning about its weak right flank, started to become desperate, and began using whoever was available, such as artillery gunners, muleteers and engineers, to plug the gap.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 108 The situation became more dire when at 1500 the remaining squadron of the 13 Reconnaissance Group defending hill 681 abandoned it, and the command of 13th division failed to rally it. Thus after that point there were almost no Greek forces south of the village Ampelokipoi and the appearance of German armored vehicles moving in the plains towards Argos Orestiko was considered a matter of time. The commander of the Greek 13th division personally rode a motorcycle and after locating the descending column of the III/22, which was severely weakened in numbers after very long continuous marching, ordered it to move immediately to the hill 681 before the Germans. At 1630 the battalion had successfully reached the height, thus temporarily relieving the Greek command's worries. For a time it was believed that the situation was salvageable as darkness was about to fall and columns of troops were arriving that could be used as reinforcements.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 109 However, at 17:00 the Germans renewed their attack, this time with the support of some 40 Luftwaffe airplanes. The airplanes focused their attacks on the Greek artillery and successfully destroyed 4 guns and many carriages. Personnel losses were limited as they mostly abandoned their guns and took cover. The two 20mm anti-aircraft guns used by the Greeks were also silenced. The German artillery also joined with full force the attack. The German armor, relieved from the threat of the Greek artillery, moved freely. Progressively the Greek companies and batteries started to report that they were getting encircled, and surrendered. At 1800 the Maniakoi bridge was ordered demolished and the units to retreat over the bridge north-west from Argos Orestiko. The Greek artillery was fighting with its last shells over open sights.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 110 Meyer notes that ‚Äúone of their batteries continued to fire and was shot to pieces‚ÄùMeyer, page 69 At 1900 the German armour encircled and captured Argos Orestiko. Those Greek units that were not able to retreat were captured.ŒîŒôŒ£, page 110 Battalion I/23 according to his commander's account had suffered some 160 killed and wounded by the time its remnants retreated towards Argos Orestiko where they were taken prisoner.Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, page 103 From the German perspective, Golla notes that the III/LSSAH reached the road north of Argos Orestiko at 1800, while the Reconnaissance battalion/LSSAH moved along the west bank of Lake Kastoria and eventually reached the town of Kastoria itself. As II/LSSAH, which in the meantime had crossed over Kleisoura pass and joined the action, reached the area south-west of Lake Kastoria, the III/LSSAH was ordered to occupy Argos Orestiko at 2300.Golla, pages 231-232 Throughout the night unsuspecting Greek columns that had previously been engaging the Italians to the north continued to come across the Germans at Kastoria. The Germans claimed that by the next morning they had captured 12,000 prisoners and 36 guns.Meyer, page 70 Footnotes References * Kurt Meyer, Michael Mend√© & Robert J.

He composed the first five of them in Berchtesgaden in June and July 1899, and the last one in Weiden in August that year. Dedicated to different people, they were published by Jos. Aibl Verlag in Munich the same year. The texts are poems by five authors: # \\"Dein Auge\\" (Felix Dahn) # \\"Der Himmel hat eine Thr√§ne geweint\\" (Friedrich R√ºckert) # \\"Traum durch die D√§mmerung\\" (Otto Bierbaum) # \\"Flieder\\" (Bierbaum) (also in arrangement for voice and orchestra) # \\"Du liebes Auge\\" (Otto Roquette) # \\"Wenn lichter Mondenschein\\" (D'Annunzio) In 2008, the musicologists Richard Mercier and Donald Nold dedicated a book to Reger's songs. They noted that he chose texts not by literary significance but for their theme and mood. The texts of Opus 35 have in common that they are love poems by contemporary writers. Some poems deal with the eye of a beloved woman, others with twilight and night. Reger composed individual songs, not song cycles, and selected for his performances songs from different collections. Most of his songs are through-composed, even when beginnings of stanzas at times begin with the same material. He favours syllabic rendition of the text, which helps its intelligibility. Usually his melodies require the accompaniment for expression. Complex harmonies support text of \\"unsettling\\" and passionate content. The first recorded performance was of #3 in Heidelberg on 5 November 1899 by Maria H√∂sl and the pianist Otto Seelig. Reger arranged #4 also for voice and orchestra, and wrote a version for voice and harmonium for 3‚Äì5. The work is the first by Reger with parts dedicated to various notable personalities, to aid publicity. However, one of them, , only mentioned the songs without detailed analysis in his biography of the composer. Mercier and Nold noted that the collection is \\"consistently on a high level with beautiful sonic textures and rich harmonies throughout\\", and that \\"the 'love' theme in these poems inspires some of Reger's most magical sonorities\\". In the Reger-Year 2016, students of the Musikhochschule M√ºnchen performed the songs in a concert in Berlin on 18 May. The Musikhochschule Saarbr√ºcken focused on chamber music by Mozart and Reger, presenting the six songs on 12 June.

Three people, including the perpetrator, were killed in the shooting. Police quickly ruled out potential links to terrorism, while stating that the incident appeared to be a lone wolf attack. The perpetrator was identified as 57-year-old Lance Hart, who targeted his wife, 50-year-old Claire Hart, and their daughter, 19-year- old Charlotte Hart, in the attack. Both women were killed by the perpetrator, who subsequently committed suicide at the site of the attack. The attack was the deadliest mass shooting in the United Kingdom since the Cumbria shootings in June 2010, in which thirteen people were killed. Shooting At around 09:00 BST on 19 July 2016, a single gunman, 57-year-old Lance Hart, opened fire close to the entrance to the swimming pool at the Castle Sports Complex in Spalding town centre using a shotgun. Two victims suffered fatal gunshot wounds before Hart fatally shot himself at the scene of the attack. Local residents said that they heard \\"three bangs\\" in the area at around the time of the attack. Aftermath The East Midlands Ambulance Service responded to the shooting and treated three people with gunshot wounds, but were unable to resuscitate them. The local air ambulance attended the incident. Due to initial fears of potential further attackers, paramedics were told to approach the scene with caution, while police stepped up patrols across Spalding. Following the shooting, Lincolnshire Police raided a house in Hatt Close in the village of Moulton, five miles from the site of the attack in Spalding town centre. Police also confirmed that the incident was not terrorism-related and no shots were fired at, or by, police officers. They also confirmed that they were not looking for any further suspects in connection with the shooting, before asking for any potential witnesses to come forward. At least six police cars attended the incident, with some eyewitnesses stating that they saw \\"dozens\\" of police vehicles following the shooting. The attack was later confirmed to be unrelated to an ongoing gang conflict amongst Eastern European immigrants in Lincolnshire, which has been the cause of previous firearms incidents in the area. The Castle Sports Complex was closed as a result of the shooting. Parts of Spalding town centre were also cordoned off, while Pinchbeck Road through the town was closed. Local businesses were warned by police to keep their doors locked. Local schools were initially put under lockdown due to fears of potential further attacks. The lockdown was lifted by 12:00 on the day of the shooting. Counselling support was offered to staff at the Castle Sports Complex following the shooting. On 20 July, police confirmed that the suspected gunman did not have a gun licence. A police investigation into the attack is currently ongoing, while an inquest into the shooting is to be launched on 27 July. =Reactions= Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, tweeted his condolences following the shooting, stating: \\"Shocking events in Spalding, Lincolnshire. My thoughts are with the victims and their families\\". The leader of Lincolnshire County Council, Martin Hill, stated that he was \\"shocked\\" by the shooting. Councillor Gary Taylor, South Holland District Council's representative for the Spalding Castle ward in which the attack took place, stated that \\"it's terrible news and local people are very shocked\\". Additionally, he stated that \\"gun crime does not exist in this area at all\\". On Twitter, the Diocese of Lincoln stated that their \\"thoughts and prayers are with the community of Spalding at this time\\". Tributes were left outside the Hart family home in Moulton, Lincolnshire by local residents following the shooting. Further tributes were left at the local church, where mourners lit candles. Victims and perpetrator The victims were named as 50-year-old Claire Hart and her daughter, 19-year-old University of Northampton student Charlotte Hart, who were the wife and daughter of the perpetrator, 57-year-old builder's merchant Lance Hart. The perpetrator committed suicide immediately following the attack. The perpetrator, Lance Hart, was described as both a \\"very difficult man\\" with a \\"short fuse\\" and as a \\"very nice guy\\" who was \\"always caring\\" by people who knew him. Hart had previously lived in Wisbech, but moved away after he \\"fell out with everyone\\". Hart had also previously threatened a neighbour in Spalding with a firearm following a minor dispute over a planning application. His sons described their father, Lance Hart, as a \\"tyrant\\" who inflicted constant psychological abuse on the family.

An activist of Popular education, he was until 2000, Managing director of programmes in Community Centers and research specialist with 'Institut national de la jeunesse et de l'√©ducation populaire'. By telling the story of Christiane Faure (the first ever Director of Popular Education in France in 1944), he criticizes vividly the role of Culture and Arts in our society in a conference called Inculture(s) 1 ‚Äì L'√©ducation populaire, monsieur, ils n'en ont pas voulu‚Ä¶, (Inculture(s) 1 ‚Äì Popular Education, Sir, they did not want any of it...), he played on stage in a ¬´ conf√©rences gesticul√©es ¬ª (a new concept of gesticulate conference), that became more and more popular from 2006 to 2014. Many people were to follow then on different subjects. In 2010, under the same format conference/one-man-show, Franck Lepage started Inculture(s) ‚Äì 2, in which he deals with Teaching. Then Inculture(s) 5 with Ga√´l Tanguy, on Social protection, based on the theorytical work of Bernard Friot. With the developing network of Workers' co-operatives of Popular Education, especially 'La Grenaille', Le Pav√© of Rennes, L'orage of Grenoble, Le vent debout of Toulouse and L'engrenage of Tours, he helps them in creating other gesticulate conferences. About a hundred conferences are then created by the end of 2014. The self-disbandment of Le Pav√© in December 2014, leads to co-found a new structure of Political popular education ¬´ L'Ardeur ¬ª (Blazing Heat) with a new group of radicalist gesticulating conference folks. Created in 2015 and focused on Trade Unionism, and see a whole lot of new conferences and also the creation of activist workshops. Biography Born in Paris on the 17th November 1954. He went to Sciences Po, failed to get in Year 2 but took up Oriental Languages and Law, and turned to Pedagogy. Teacher for youngs with difficulties at School in Haute-Savoie in 1974, he discovers the social and cultural activities in community centers in 1975 and starts working within the Department of social and cultural activities, and science of education at Centre universitaire exp√©rimental de Vincennes ‚Äî a free, revolutionary and open University in Vincennes (Paris 8) ‚Äî in 1977. The teaching is practical and freestyle in order to rethink the whole of Capitalism's Institutions. He then stop teaching to take up Theatre in 1980, at l'universit√© de Paris 8 (Vincennes in Saint-Denis). he found his own theatre company in 1985. Then he works for F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise des Maisons des jeunes et de la culture in 1987 and for the first time he hears about popular education, without anybody being able to explain to him the concept. It is in that moment, by trying to take up the cultural and social problems of the Youth and the Community of Community Centres to the Culture and Arts Ministry, that he realises the violence of the symbolic division of culture and social affairs in France. He then, with help from others, put a theory in place and a definition of what is Popular Education. He writes a report years later in 1994 to the Education Ministry about the importance of this subject. Not much is done, that is why he went on to create his own Popular Education Network. In 2007, foundation with five other members of la SCOP d'√©ducation populaire et transformation sociale Le Pav√©.

Care Manag J. 2011;12(2):60-71. Transnational caregiving has emerged in to prominence due to globalization and global aging. Workforce mobility has increased not only across countries, but also with internal migration within countries. Typically people move from rural to urban areas for better opportunities. There are other factors like civil unrest in certain populations that can cause similar migration (see section on displaced person). Thus, the definition by Baldassar is broader and more largely applicable. With increased lifespan, more children are involved in care of older parents. In addition in China, it's one-child policy has left families without siblings to share the responsibilities of caring for older parents. Some of the factors that affect transnational caregiving like gender, socio- economic class and culture are similar to factors for local care. In transnational settings, there are also factors such as travel, finances and governmental relations that have a great influence. Components of transnational care 5 models of caregiving: # Economic: providing financial support to one's family back home. # Accommodation: providing a place to live. # Personal: providing companionship. # Practical: providing direct nursing care in activities of daily living. # Childcare, emotional and moral support Role of communication in transnational care Information and communication technology (ICT) has affected provision of transnational care. Communication is an essential component in facilitating and enhancing the process of care. ICT has allowed transnational care to be reciprocal in nature and communication has enhanced intergenerational contact.‚ÄúTransnational Support of Asian Indian Elderly in India: Examining Patterns of Exchanges.‚Äù Kalavar JM, Zarit SH, Ferraccio BJ.

The movie stars Sanjeev Kumar, Tanuja, Madan Puri, Sailesh Kumar, Aruna Irani, Shamminder and Kishore Bhatt. Other star casts include Tarun Bose, Bela Bose, Asit Sen, Pravin Paul Sunder, Amrita Patel, Dinesh Hingoo and Masterji. Story-screenplay-dialogue was written by Probodh Joshi. Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Bula Gupta and Hemant Kumar rendered their voices. Title Song was by Anil Kumar and its lyrics by Gohar Kanpuri. Music of the film is given by Hemanta Mukherjee and lyrics by Gulzar. Plot Thakur Sunder Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) is the thakur, or lord, of a small estate. He lives in the estate's manor with his daughter Sharmila (Tanuja). His greedy brother Madan Singh (Madan Puri) also resides at the manor, and is constantly seeking money from Sunder Singh. In the past, Sunder Singh had an affair with a village girl, who gave birth to his illegitimate child. Sunder Singh refused to accept both of them as it would be against his family honor. His guilt over this situation causes him great anxiety, and he suffers from asthma and heart problems as a result. Doctor Shyam attends the manor to treat Sunder Singh, and Sharmila falls in love with him. When her uncle Madan Singh sees Sharmila and Doctor Shyam flirting, he goes to Sunder Singh and informs him about his daughter's behavior. In a fit of rage, Sunder Singh quarrels with Sharmila and slaps her. She continues her secret relationship with the doctor behind her father's back. The stress causes Sunder Singh to have a heart attack. Sharmila decides to end her relationship with the doctor, wanting to prevent her father from suffering more pain. Several days later, it is Sharmila‚Äôs birthday party. A number of guests are at the manor, including Doctor Shyam. A dancing girl (Aruna Irani) was also hired to performing mujra, a classical Kathak-style dance. The doctor goes to Sharmila's room to find her, and is spotted by Madan Singh. Madan Singh reports this to his brother Sunder Singh, who attacks the doctor in presence of the guests, telling him never return to the manor. Upset, Sharmila leaves her home the next morning to stay at a hostel. Sunder Singh is extremely upset by the situation, and Madan Singh adds to his woes by marrying the mujra girl. Sunder Singh refuses to accept the mujra dancer as his sister-in-law and has another heart attack. Doctor Shyam is called, and he suggests that Sunder Singh forgive Sharmila in order to ease some of his tension. However, Sunder Singh believes that Doctor Shyam is scheming to get close to Sharmila again. Based on this, Madan Singh convinces his elder brother that Doctor Shyam is not trustworthy and that he should be replaced by another doctor. Madan Singh brings in Doctor Lakhan and Nurse Veera (Bela Bose) to attend him. One night, Madan Singh asks Sunder Singh to sign a new will, with terms more favorable to Madan Singh. Shortly after, Sunder Singh has another heart attack. With the help of his accomplices, Doctor Lakhan and Nurse Veera, Madan Singh prevents Sunder Singh from taking any medicine, leading to Sunder Singh's death. Madan Singh then calls Doctor Shyam to the manor, telling him that Sunder Singh's condition is very serious. He accuses Doctor Shyam of murdering Sunder Singh and summons the police. Doctor Shyam manages to evade arrest. Madan Singh has Sunder Singh cremated, and sends a telegram to Sharmila to inform her of her father‚Äôs death. When she returns, she finds that the manor is haunted by her father‚Äôs ghost and informs her uncle, who has her declared insane. One of the manor's old servants gets suspicious and informs the police department. Officers there ensure him that the truth will be discovered. In the meantime, Sharmila has resumed her meetings with Doctor Shyam, although she refuses to marry him out of respect to her deceased father, who never gave his permission. She continues to have sightings of Sunder Singh's spirit in the manor. Some days later, Madan Singh finally sees the ghost of Sunder Singh. Fearful, he insists Sharmila and all others leave the manor. When Sharmila refuses to leave, Madan Singh shoots the spirit with a gun, revealing it to be a living person. The \\"ghost\\" tries to escape but is quickly caught. The \\"ghost\\" reveals himself to be the illegitimate child of Sunder Singh. He had initially come to the manor to take revenge upon Sunder Singh for abandoning him. Instead, he witnessed Madan Singh preventing Sunder Singh from taking his heart medicine, leading to Sunder Singh's death. Madan Singh caught the illegitimate son watching the murder and threatened him, saying he would have the son's mother killed if he didn't pretend to be Sunder Singh's ghost and frighten Sharmila to death. Prompted by his mother, he instead chooses to save his half-sister. The plot revealed, Madan Singh is arrested. The police discover that \\"Doctor\\" Lakhan was a criminal impersonating a doctor and \\"Nurse\\" Veera was a cabaret dancer.

It is often the \\"first point of publication for claims of responsibility by the group\\".  History  Among the founders of Amaq was Syrian journalist Baraa Kadek, who joined ISIL in late 2013, and seven others who originally worked for Halab News Network. According to The New York Times, it has \\"a direct connection with ISIS\\", from which it \\"gets tips\\". Its name was taken from Amik Valley in Hatay Province, which is mentioned in a hadith as the site of an \\"apocalyptic victory over non-believers\\". Amaq News Agency was first noticed by SITE during the Siege of Koban√Æ (Syria) in 2014, when its updates were shared among ISIL fighters. It became more widely known after it began reporting claims of responsibility for terrorist attacks in Western countries, such as the 2015 San Bernardino attack, for which ISIL officially claimed responsibility the next day. An Amaq cameraman shot the first footage of the capture of Palmyra in 2015. Amaq launched an official mobile app in 2015 and has warned against unofficial versions that reportedly have been used to spy on its users. It also uses a Telegram account. It had a WordPress-based blog, but it was removed without explanation in April 2016. On 31 May 2017, a Facebook post announced Amaq's founder, Baraa Kadek AKA Rayan Meshaal, had been killed with his daughter by an American airstrike on Mayadin. The post was reportedly made by his younger brother. Reuters could not immediately verify this account. On 27 July 2017, the US confirmed that Kadek had been killed by a coalition airstrike near Mayadin between 25 and 27 May 2017. In June 2017, German police arrested a 23-year-old Syrian man identified only as Mohammed G., accusing him of communicating with the alleged perpetrator of the 2016 Malm√∂ Muslim community centre arson in order to report to Amaq. On March 21, 2019, the U.S. Department of State officially deemed Amaq an alias of ISIL, and thus a Foreign Terrorist Organization.  Character  Amaq publishes a stream of short news reports, both text and video, on the mobile app Telegram. The reports take on the trappings of mainstream journalism, with \\"Breaking News\\" headings, and embedded reporters at the scenes of ISIL battles. The reports try to appear neutral, toning down the jihadist language and sectarian slurs ISIL uses in its official releases. Charlie Winter of the Transcultural Conflict and Violence Initiative at Georgia State University, and Rita Katz of SITE Intelligence Group in Washington say Amaq functions much like the state-owned news agency of ISIL, though the group does not acknowledge it as such. Katz said it behaves \\"like a state media. ISIS sees themselves as a state, as a country‚Äîand a country needs to have its own media\\". Amaq appears to have been created, or allowed to develop, by ISIS as a way to have a news outlet that is controlled by the group but is somewhat removed from it, giving ISIL more of the appearance of legitimacy.  Reliability  According to Chris Tomson of the Assad-friendly Al-Masdar News, Amaq \\"is usually accurate\\" when reporting ISIL advances but \\"never admits caliphate losses.\\"Tomson, Chris. 5 Syrian soldiers killed near Palmyra despite huge territorial setback for ISIS. Al-Masdar News. 2017-04-27. According to Rukmini Callimachi in The New York Times: \\"Despite a widespread view that the Islamic State opportunistically claims attacks with which it has little genuine connection, its track record‚Äîminus a handful of exceptions‚Äîsuggests a more rigorous protocol. At times, the Islamic State has gotten details wrong, or inflated casualty figures, but the gist of its claims is typically correct. The group has made it clear that it considers itself responsible both for acts carried out by its own personnel, as well as acts carried out by people who lack direct ties to the group but were inspired by its propaganda. In several instances, moreover, the Islamic State has claimed attacks before the identities of the killers were known\\". According to journalist Graeme Wood writing in The Atlantic in October 2017, \\"The idea that the Islamic State simply scans the news in search of mass killings, then sends out press releases in hope of stealing glory, is false. Amaq may learn details of the attacks from mainstream media‚Äîand often gets those details wrong, also like mainstream media‚Äîbut its claim of credit typically flows from an Amaq-specific source.\\" However, Wood continued, \\"A false claim of credit in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting will effectively shred the Islamic State's news agency's credibility. It will become a news agency that was once reliable, and now associates itself indiscriminately with heavily armed crazy people in casinos\\". According to an October 2017 article in The Hill, \\"Historically, ISIS has not been arbitrary in the attacks it claims have been carried out by its supporters. Experts who track the group closely say that when it comes to attacks in the West, if ISIS is claiming responsibility, there typically was some kind of connection between the perpetrator and the group. ... until recently, claims of responsibility put out through official channels were seen as reliable.\\" However, \\"That might be changing,\\" as ISIS loses territorial sovereignty in Syria. The Hill points to two incidents in the summer of 2017, the Resorts World Manila attack and a false claim that bombs had been planted at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. In addition, the claim of an ISIS connection to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting appeared to be false. According to Rita Katz on the SITE Intelligence Group website, calling a terrorist a \\"soldier of the caliphate (warrior from the caliphate)\\" in a statement issued by Amaq, was the usual way in which ISIS indicated that it inspired an attack. Centrally coordinated attacks were usually described in language such as \\"executed by a detachment belonging to the Islamic State\\", and are often announced by both Amaq and by ISIS' central media command.  On-line presence  In November 2019 Belgian police claimed to have carried out a successful cyberattack on Amaq's on-line presence, thus leaving ISIL without an operational communication channel.

Yousef is an ethnic Kurd, and served with fellow co-president Mansur Selum, an ethnic Arab. Early life State emblem of the Jazeera (also spelled \\"Jazira\\") Canton In her twenties, Yousef, then a guerilla, had been imprisoned by the Assad government for two years in Damascus on charges of having been a member of a secret organization aiming to break up Syria. Co- presidency of Jazeera Canton Yousef first held the office of co-president of Jazeera Canton in the northeast of the newly established Rojava federation. Yousef served as co-president with fellow co-president Humeydi Daham al-Hadi, an Arab tribal leader. Yousef's office was located in the former headquarters of the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Company in the oil-rich city of Rmelan, the city where the Rojava federation had been declared. =\\"Co-governance\\" and Kurdish-Arab cooperation= During her tenure as co-president, Yousef worked towards greater inter-sectarian cooperation particularly between Kurds and Arabs. The Rojava federation, Yousef said, \\"is something beyond the nation- state. It's a place where all people, all minorities, and all genders are equally represented.\\" Also during her tenure, Yousef pursued the policy of \\"co-governance\\" which, as she explained in an interview, ensures that \\"every position at every level of government in Rojava . . . includes a female equivalent of equal authority.\\" Co-presidency of the Rojava federation In March 2016, Yousef was elected co-president of the Rojava federation. The federation covered about 16 percent of Syria's land area. In an interview upon her election, Yousef described the mission of the committee as creating \\"a wider and more comprehensive system\\" in the areas liberated from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \\"that [gives] rights to all the groups to represent themselves and to form their own administrations.\\" Referring to the principle of co-governance's attempt to ensure that Syria is government so as to include the country's many ethnic groups (predominantly Arabs and Kurds), Abdulsalem Mohammed said that \\"Hediya [Yousef] represents Rojava and [Mansur] Selam represents northern Syria.\\" Mohammed, a Kurdish teacher and activist from Qamishli, added that \\"This is based on the principle of our co-chair system and different nations, and equality between women and men.\\" =\\"Democratic confederalism\\" and Kurdish separatism= In addition to supporting the policy of \\"co-governance,\\" Yousef also supports the policy of \\"democratic confederalism\\" which honorary Group of Communities in Kurdistan leader Abdullah Ocalan wrote in 2005 was \\"not a State system [but] the democratic system of a people without a State.\\" Yousef has spoken in support of Western intervention in the Syrian civil war but, in line with her democratic confederalist beliefs, opposes intervention for the purposes of establishing a Kurdish state separate from Syria. \\"We will not allow the fragmentation of Syria,\\" she said in July 2016. \\"We want the democratization of Syria.\\" The Unification of Rojava As the Syrian civil war unfolded and the Rojava federation emerged, Yousef voiced her \\"desire for Manbij [a city in the Governorate of Aleppo then occupied by ISIL forces] to be part of the democratic federal area [of Rojava] after its liberation.\\" This was part of a wider campaign to unify the cantons of Rojava into a contiguous federation. =Early offensives= Throughout June 2016, roughly three months after Yousef became co-president, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) carried out a campaign to liberate the territories still held by ISIL in northern Syria and to unify the cantons. On June 10, less than a week after liberated eight surrounding villages and the Manbij Military Council cut off ISIL's supply route between Manbij and the de facto ISIL capital of Raqqa, the SDF captured the city of Osajli Ten days later, the SDF captured Arima. =The liberation of Manbij= In July 2016, roughly one and a half months after the launch of the Manbij offensive by the SDF during which Osajli, Arima, and other cities were captures, ISIL suffered heavy losses in the west and north of the city of Manbij despite repeated attempts to break the SDF siege. As ISIL's expulsion from the city neared, Yousef announced that Manbij, a city of strategic importance, would soon join the Rojava federation via a popular referendum. The incorporation of Manbij would be a significant step toward uniting the currently non-contiguous Rojava federation cantons of Afrin and Kobani. On Thursday July 21, 2016, the Syrian Democratic Forces gave ISIL forces a 48-hour ultimatum to leave Manbij. ISIL refused the ultimatum, and clashes broke out on Friday. By Monday the 25th, the Manbij Military Council (MMC), aligned with the SDF, had gained control of a majority of the city. By August 5, the MMC had captured roughly 80 percent of the city. On August 6, Syrian Democratic Forces declares that they had gained \\"almost complete control\\" of the city. Manbij was liberated on August 15, 2016. =The al-Bab offensive= Shortly after the liberation of Manbij, the \\"al-Bab Military Council\\" was created for the planned offensive to liberate the city of Al-Bab from the ISIL.http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/140820162 References 21st-century women politicians Democratic Union Party (Syria) politicians Living people People of the Syrian Civil War Syrian Kurdish politicians Syrian women in politics Kurdish politicians Kurdish women Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Hediya Yousef"},{"id":"51112449","title":"2016 Kentucky Bank Tennis Championships"},{"id":"51112454","text":"Mansur Selum () is a Syrian politician.

It is a generic name for any composition for the instrument, but when capitalised (Piano Piece, Piece for Piano) the name is used to indicate a (usually) single-movement composition for solo piano that has not been given a more specific name (such as Sonatina, Allegro de concert or Le Bananier), for example: * Johannes Brahms's Sechs Klavierst√ºcke (Six Piano Pieces), Op. 118 * Arnold Schoenberg's Drei Klavierst√ºcke (Three Piano Pieces) * Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºcke As the German word ' may indicate other keyboard instruments besides the piano, not all Klavierst√ºcke are composed for the piano; for example, the pieces included in the Klavierb√ºchlein f√ºr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach are rather to be regarded as keyboard pieces than piano pieces. In 1768 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach published his Kurze und leichte Klavierst√ºcke, Wq 113. In this case each of the 11 pieces included in the volume has a separate title (Allegro, Arioso, Fantasia, etc.). For Mozart's compositions, Klavierst√ºck may refer to posthumously published pieces without a definite title (e.g. Klavierst√ºck in F, K. 33b), or, as in the Neue Mozart- Ausgabe, to various single-movement compositions for solo piano or other keyboard instrument.Wolfgang Rehm.

Another set of three piano pieces by Schubert is also known as his last three Impromptus.

It was released on October 6, 2017 by Loma Vista Recordings and Caroline International. The record had the working title Say10 and was initially due to be issued on Valentine's Day. However, the release was delayed due to Marilyn Manson being unhappy with the quality of the record by that date, as well as the band's touring commitments and producer Tyler Bates's schedule scoring films. It was further delayed by the death of Manson's father Hugh Warner, who died during production and to whom the album was later dedicated. The record features many of the same musicians who performed on the band's previous album, 2015's The Pale Emperor, including Bates and Gil Sharone. Longtime bassist Twiggy did not take part in recording sessions, despite Manson initially suggesting he would. Twiggy departed the group soon after the album was issued after a sexual assault allegation was made against him by a former girlfriend from the 1990s. He was replaced on subsequent tour dates by former the Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete. \\"We Know Where You Fucking Live\\" preceded the album as its lead single on September 11, followed by \\"Kill4Me\\" nine days later, which became the band's highest-peaking entry on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. Music videos were created for four tracks: the two aforementioned singles as well as \\"Say10\\" and \\"Tattooed in Reverse\\". The videos for \\"Kill4Me\\" and \\"Say10\\" feature Johnny Depp, while Courtney Love and Lisa Marie Presley appear in the video for \\"Tattooed in Reverse\\". The latter also charted on Mainstream Rock, making Heaven Upside Down their first album since 1998's Mechanical Animals to contain more than one song that appeared on the chart. The album received positive reviews from music critics upon release, with multiple publications saying it continued the creative resurgence that began with their previous album, although others criticized the violent lyrical content. It was a commercial success as well, debuting at number eight on the Billboard 200 and becoming their highest- charting album in over a decade in several countries, including major markets such as Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom. Manson was injured on two occasions during the Heaven Upside Down Tour. He sprained his ankle after jumping off the stage at one concert, and was crushed by a large stage prop at another. The latter incident resulted in the rescheduling of an entire leg of the tour. The band also embarked on two co-headlining tours with Rob Zombie: Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour and Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies Tour. To promote the former, the two collaborated on a cover of the Beatles song \\"Helter Skelter\\". Manson issued three other covers on soundtracks during the album's promotional cycle: \\"Stigmata\\", \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" and \\"Cry Little Sister\\". Background and recording alt=Image of the band's vocalist wearing black clothes and holding a microphone in his right hand. The background of the image is illuminated with blue stage lighting, and on the bottom left corner the hand of a concert-goer can be seen giving the 'devil- horns' signal. Marilyn Manson met Tyler Bates, the score composer of Californication, while playing a fictionalized version of himself in the season finale of the sixth season of the series. The two then collaborated on 2015's The Pale Emperor, the band's ninth studio album, which was described by numerous publications as the best album they had released in over a decade. In July 2016, Manson received the 'Icon Award' at the APMAs, where he revealed several details about the follow-up to The Pale Emperor, such as its working title of Say10 and a tentative Valentine's Day release date. He explained that the title originated from a note written in one of his workbooks from his time as a student at GlenOak High School. Manson doubted whether Bates would collaborate with him again following The Pale Emperor, saying relations between the pair deteriorated to such an extent during the supporting The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour that Manson threatened Bates on-stage with a box-cutter knife. Despite this confrontation, Bates agreed to work with the band, and renamed his music publishing company Box Cutter Music in honor of the incident. On May 8, 2017, Manson announced the album had been renamed Heaven Upside Down, and said recording had been completed. As with The Pale Emperor, Manson and Bates worked on the record while the latter was composing score material for the American television series Salem, the third season of which featured Manson as a recurring cast member. Parts of the album were recorded in Louisiana, where he was filming scenes for the series. The record was produced solely by Bates, and recorded at Bates's Studio City recording facility Abattoir Studios, with live drums recorded by The Pale Emperor contributor Gil Sharone. Despite initially suggesting that longtime bassist Twiggy would contribute to the writing and production of the album, Manson later confirmed that he was invited but did not participate during sessions at Bates's recording studio. According to Manson, after listening to pre-recorded basslines performed by Bates, Twiggy responded by saying he would be unable to \\"play them any better, and that the record sounded great [as it was]\\". Manson and Bates largely improvised during their writing sessions. Bates said that songs were created \\"out of a conversation, essentially, just between [Manson] and I, and we make it pretty much on the spot. It's me making music right from my head, and the lyrics are developed by Manson right there in the studio with me.\\" Manson described the collaborative process between the two as being \\"a very intimate, personal experience. ... We sit across from each other, with headphones on, we look each other in the eye when we're writing.\\" Manson opted not to record his vocals from inside a vocal booth, instead recording them while sitting at Bates's mixing console; the majority of vocals on the album were recorded in single takes, with minimal overdubbing. Bates sought to incorporate the intensity of the band's live performances into the album's production, describing the record as \\"intense, fun and violent. It's more immediate than The Pale Emperor, much more aggressive, and definitely much more imbued with Manson's fucked-up humor.\\" He also said: Composition and style The band's vocalist initially described Say10 as being a musical departure from The Pale Emperor, and said it would be more comparable to the band's earlier work, particularly Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals, but \\"with a new, different approach\\", and said it was \\"pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way [as The Pale Emperor]. It's got a chip on its shoulder.\\" He called it \\"by far the most thematic and over-complicated thing that I've done\\", and indicated it would contain some of his most politically-charged lyrics, but denied the political lyrical content related to the election of Donald Trump by saying most of its lyrics were written before the 2016 US presidential election. He had said he would not be voting in that election, explaining: \\"I don't think that, as an artist, I can make as much of a difference voting as I can [with] the commentaries I make in music\\". Manson dubbed Heaven Upside Down his \\"most precise and well-thought-out work\\", and compared its lyrics to those of 2000's Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), noting the majority of lyrics on both records were initially written as prose. He additionally described it as a concept album, and contrasted it with The Pale Emperor: \\"The last album was Faust, Mephistopheles. For me, this would be Pilgrim's Progress\\". Lyrical themes and subject matter on the record range from politics, violence, sex and romance, chaos and isolation, and capitalism, religion, drugs, paranoia, fear and mental illness. Musically, Heaven Upside Down was characterized by Manson as a hard rock and punk rock album, in the vein of Killing Joke, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and David Bowie's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps). Reviewers have additionally defined it as an industrial metal, punk rock, glam rock and gothic rock record. The title of opening track \\"Revelation #12\\" is a reference to both the Book of Revelation and the Beatles song \\"Revolution 9\\". \\"We Know Where You Fucking Live\\" was the first song Manson and Bates recorded for the album; its lyrics reference state surveillance and drone warfare. \\"Saturnalia\\" was the final song written for the album. Manson described its lyrics as being \\"the real heart of the record.\\" He was unaware of the severity of his father's terminal illness until two days before he died, on July 7, 2017, the same day the band finished recording \\"Saturnalia\\". Its lyrics contain numerous astrological and mythological references, specifically the astrological transit of Saturn ‚Äì Saturn return ‚Äì and the myth of Saturnus devouring his children. Manson conflated his father's death with the lyrical content: \\"Seeing my father dying, I felt like that was the circle of life that he'd want me to put the energy of death into rebirth, you know, the snake eating its own tail, Saturnalia, Saturninus, that whole concept.\\" \\"Je$u$ Cri$i$\\" was described by Manson as \\"my r√©sum√© ... It's basically something I would say with a [sarcastic] shrug when someone asked me, 'What do you do?' 'Well, I write songs to fight and fuck to.' He elaborated on the meaning of Heaven Upside Down as an album title: \\"I was going to call the record SAY10, but I didn't feel that that defined the album. I had the lyrics written for the song 'Heaven Upside Down', and I thought that defined the record more so because of the idea of time as a flat circle, constellations being defined by the negative space‚Äîthe blackness; the idea of looking at something from an opposite point of view.\\" Release and artwork The album was not released on Valentine's Day, prompting increasingly aggressive responses from fans on social media platforms. Manson later explained several factors caused the delay, including Bates's schedule scoring films, Manson being unhappy with the quality of the record by that date, as well as the death of his father, to whom Heaven Upside Down is dedicated. Bates also said recording was delayed due to the band's touring schedule; the pair had completed just six songs before beginning a co-headlining tour with Slipknot in the summer of 2016. At least three tracks were recorded sometime after Valentine's Day: \\"Revelation #12\\", \\"Saturnalia\\" and \\"Heaven Upside Down\\", with the album's name then being changed to the latter song title. Prior to the record's eventual release, Manson posted a series of videos on Instagram. The first of these, posted on March 22, 2017, was captioned \\"6:19. The time has come.\\" Numerous publications hypothesized whether 6:19 referred to a June 19 release date, a Bible verse, or the Eat Me, Drink Me track \\"If I Was Your Vampire\\", which features the lyric \\"6:19 and I know I'm ready\\". Further videos featured air-raid sirens and distant screaming, a hooded figure, and the Celebritarian Cross‚Äîan inverted variation on the Cross of Lorraine that had been previously used by Manson as a logo for his Celebritarian art movement in 2005; the symbol subsequently appeared on the Heaven Upside Down album cover. Heaven Upside Down was released worldwide on October 6, 2017, by Loma Vista Recordings in the United States, Caroline International internationally, and in Japan by Loma Vista in cooperation with Hostess Entertainment; Japanese editions contain a Mystery Skulls remix of \\"Kill4Me\\" as a bonus track. The booklet was printed on Bible paper, with the lyrics formatted to resemble biblical text. The record was mastered by Brian Lucey, the engineer who masters the majority of Bates's soundtrack work. According to Manson, Lucey was chosen because the album contains \\"some extreme experiments with sound. We were very particular in not allowing someone else to master it, who might accidentally eliminate them. We've got some very intense, alchemical, scientific, binaural sounds that sometimes even make me have a panic attack while I'm listening to it.\\" These sounds are most prevalent in the title track and \\"Saturnalia\\", which Manson highlighted as centerpieces of the record. Promotion and singles Manson performing at the alt=Image of the band's vocalist using stilts and wearing a long robe made of black feathers. In his hands are two elongated stilts, which he is holding aloft. The background of the stage is illuminated with orange stage lighting, and in the foreground numerous fans can be seen giving the 'devil-horns' signal. On the day of the 2016 US presidential election ‚Äì November 8 ‚Äì the band released a short teaser clip of a new video, \\"Say10\\". Created by director Tyler Shields, it featured images of Manson brandishing a bloodstained knife while standing above a decapitated corpse lying in a pool of blood. Numerous publications noted the corpse was dressed in similar clothing to the kind regularly worn by Donald Trump‚Äîa suit and red tie. Manson would later say the decapitated figure in the video \\"wasn't anyone except if you wanted it to be them.\\" The band ‚Äì which initially included Manson on vocals with Bates and Paul Wiley on electric guitars, Twiggy on bass and Sharone on drums ‚Äì began the first leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20, 2017 in Budapest, during which they debuted several new songs. During the tour, the group narrowly avoided injury in Moscow when their tour bus was involved in a collision with a semi-trailer truck, and Manson caused controversy in Eastern Europe when he referenced the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War during a concert in Kiev, saying: \\"You just made Moscow sound like your bitch.\\" The band performed in Moscow two days prior to the Kiev concert. Their cover of Ministry's \\"Stigmata\\" was released on July 28, when it appeared on the soundtrack to Atomic Blonde. \\"We Know Where You Fucking Live\\" was issued as the album's lead single on September 11, after premiering on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show. Its music video was directed by Bill Yukich and Perou, and was posted onto YouTube four days later. \\"Kill4Me\\" was issued as the album's primary airplay single in the United States, where it went on to become their highest peaking single ever on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. A series of advertisements created by Canadian pop artist Alex Kazemi to promote the album on Instagram were leaked online in late September, but were deemed too graphic to be used on the image hosting service. Music videos were subsequently released for \\"Say10\\" and \\"Kill4Me\\", both directed by Yukich and featured actor Johnny Depp. The North American leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour began on September 27, and was scheduled to incorporate appearances by the band at several music festivals, including the Aftershock Festival on October 22, at which Nine Inch Nails was also scheduled to appear. Manson indicated a possibility of joining that band on stage during the festival, after he and Trent Reznor mended a longstanding feud. However, Manson was injured on several occasions during the tour; he sprained his left ankle after jumping off the stage at Pittsburgh's Stage AE on September 29. The following night, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, he was crushed by a large stage prop, and lay unconscious on the stage for up to 15 minutes before being carried out of the venue on a stretcher to a nearby hospital. Manson had broken his fibula in two places, requiring a plate and ten screws to be inserted into his bone. The rest of the tour was then canceled, including their appearance at Aftershock, with all dates ‚Äì excluding festival appearances ‚Äì rescheduled to take place at the start of 2018. The band's founding guitarist, Daisy Berkowitz, died on October 22, 2017 at the age of 49; he had been diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer in 2013. Three days later, Manson announced he had \\"decided to part ways\\" with Twiggy after the bassist was accused of sexual assault by former girlfriend Jessicka Addams, who was the vocalist for alternative rock band Jack Off Jill. Addams said the incident occurred while she and Twiggy were a couple in the mid-90s. He was replaced on subsequent tour dates by former Racer X and the Mars Volta bassist Juan Alderete. Alderete's first show with the band, at the 2017 Ozzfest Meets Knotfest festival in San Bernardino on November 5, found Manson performing in a wheelchair as a result of injuries he sustained earlier in the tour. Manson attracted criticism from some publications after he used a replica assault rifle as a microphone during the concert, with some commentators arguing it was insensitive considering the city had previously been the subject of a terrorism-related attack, and that the concert took place hours after the Sutherland Springs church shooting in Texas. A cover of \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" ‚Äì recorded during the Heaven Upside Down sessions ‚Äì was featured on the soundtrack to 24 Hours to Live, and was issued through Var√®se Sarabande on December 8. \\"Tattooed in Reverse\\" was released as a promotional single when it was serviced to active rock radio formats in the United States on March 6, 2018, and peaked at number 35 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Chart. This made Heaven Upside Down the band's first studio album since 1998's Mechanical Animals to contain more than one charting song on Mainstream Rock. The song's music video was directed by Yukich, and featured singers Courtney Love and Lisa Marie Presley. Yukich also directed the music video for the band's cover version of Gerard McMahon's \\"Cry Little Sister\\", released in June and recorded for the soundtrack of The New Mutants. The band embarked on a second co- headlining tour with Rob Zombie on July 11, titled \\"Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour\\", following the \\"Twins of Evil Tour\\" in 2012. On the day the tour began, Zombie and Manson released their cover of the Beatles track \\"Helter Skelter\\", which featured former Manson band members John 5 and Ginger Fish. Heaven Upside Down was the last album to feature Sharone, who departed the band in March 2019. He was replaced on the subsequent \\"Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies Tour\\" by former Black Flag and Ho99o9 drummer Brandon Pertzborn. Shortly after the tour completed, Alderete was involved in a bicycle accident which left him with a diffuse axonal injury, a type of traumatic brain injury. A GoFundMe page was created to help cover the cost of his medical expenses. Despite this, Alderete is a credited performer on the band's next studio album, 2020's We Are Chaos. Critical reception The album was well received by music critics upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\". Album of the Year collected 19 reviews and calculated an average of 66 out of 100. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the album 6.2 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Several publications said the record continued a creative resurgence that began with their previous release, including AllMusic, which described it as a more satisfying album than the predecessor. This sentiment was echoed by both Loudwire, and The Boston Globe, which said: \\"No one expected this band to be doing some of its best work 20 years after it first shook up the zeitgeist, but here it is, continuing to evolve while toning down its more dated or cartoonish aspects. It just goes to show that a good album beats a good scandal every time.\\" Bloody Disgusting said it was their best release since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), and Loudwire included it on their list of the best hard rock albums of 2017. Consequence of Sound commented on Manson's stage injury: \\"Had the worst happened, Heaven Upside Down is the kind of career-defining record that [he] just might want to leave as his last great opus anyway.\\" Numerous publications lauded it for being a solid and concise album. Metal Injection commended the quality of songwriting, saying the record consistently introduced different styles and genres throughout. Similarly, Clash complimented the band for mixing various styles from their discography, saying that Heaven Upside Down fused three distinct genres from their previous work‚Äîthe industrial of Antichrist Superstar, the glam rock of Mechanical Animals, and the blues of The Pale Emperor. ABC News said it saw Manson returning \\"to his roots\\", which they described as him \\"playing overtly with taboos and openly baiting his critics.\\" Classic Rocks sister publication Metal Hammer described it as a solid album and said it illustrates how Manson can \\"still do what he got famous [for] doing: write biting, anti-establishment goth rock full of dark, playful imagery.\\" Singapore's The Straits Times dubbed it the album of the week while describing the record as exhilarating. Critics praised the quality of lyricism found on the album, specifically in light of the presidential election of Donald Trump. The Evening Standard said: \\"American life is scary enough right now without Marilyn Manson sticking his oar in. Nevertheless, [Heaven Upside Down] may offer some useful catharsis for those who feel like screaming\\", although their writer noted it \\"offers zero reasons to be cheerful.\\" Similarly, The List asked: \\"Is Marilyn Manson the first or the last person we need to hear in these troubled times?\\" while comparing the lyrical content to Grand Guignol, a term used to describe graphic, amoral horror entertainment. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock called it an astute album, saying that the band \\"update and renovate the goth-glam dazzle of Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar to better ram home [Manson's] top-line points: that religion is a pointless poison, politicians are society's true Satans and that fighting and fucking are the only reasoned responses to the current countdown to the Book of Revelations apocalypse that the world has chosen democratically for itself.\\" Alternative Press also commended the lyrical quality, saying the record was best enjoyed on headphones where the lyrics would \\"make your bladder flex. ... At the end of the [record], all that's missing is the sound of the [microphone] dropping.\\" The album received some mixed reviews as well, with several writers criticizing the lyrics to \\"Je$u$ Cri$i$\\". Spin criticized the \\"reprehensible\\" violent lyrical content found on the record, in light of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Conversely, Pitchfork said the lyrics were ineffectual, arguing they were easily eclipsed by the horror found in real life. Both Crack Magazine and PopMatters complimented the inclusion of punk elements, which the latter said helped the album match the intensity of the band's earlier work, but they were both critical of the lyrics. NME argued the record was too similar to the band's earlier work, and complained most of the songs lacked innovation. Drowned in Sound said that fans were \\"unlikely to see the power or the passion of Manson's classic run again ‚Äì it's very difficult to bottle lightning twice ... That said, [Manson] seems to have settled after many years of free-fall. In Tyler Bates he has found a collaborator who knows how to get the best from his twisted mind. It's business as usual, but after a decade of disappointment, it's good to know business is doing well.\\" Commercial performance Heaven Upside Down debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 with 35,000 album-equivalent units, 32,000 of which were pure album sales, making it the band's seventh consecutive top ten album on the chart. Industry forecasters had predicted it was on course to debut in the top ten with sales of between 25,000 and 32,000 copies. It became the band's fourth consecutive number one album on Billboards Top Hard Rock Albums, and their first to reach number one on Top Alternative Albums. It also debuted at number two on both Top Rock Albums and Top Album Sales, which acts as the current equivalent of the previous Billboard 200, before it was reconfigured to incorporate album-equivalent units. On its second week, the record dropped to number 84 on the Billboard 200.

In Canada, Heaven Upside Down matched the peak of The Pale Emperor by debuting at number four. The record was predicted to enter the top ten of the UK Albums Chart, making it the band's first top ten album in the country since Eat Me, Drink Me peaked at number eight a decade earlier. It went on to peak at number seven there with first-week sales of 6,636 copies ‚Äì their highest opening week figure since The High End of Low debuted with 7,746 copies in 2009 ‚Äì and the band's highest-charting album in the country since The Golden Age of Grotesque peaked at number four in 2003. In Spain, the album peaked at number six, making it their highest-charting album since The Golden Age of Grotesque peaked at number five 12 years earlier. The record debuted in France with sales of 4,745 copies. Heaven Upside Down entered the ARIA Charts at number four, making it their sixth top ten album in Australia, and their highest-charting since Mechanical Animals reached number one in 1998. It entered at number six on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, their fifth top ten studio album there. On the Japanese Oricon chart, the album debuted at number 29 with first week sales of 1,805 copies‚Äîexactly half the amount The Pale Emperor debuted with two years earlier.

They have organised the event for 35 times. Nevertheless, their favourite event is Saint Sava's Sunday () which has been carried out for 18 years in Teslic, and they try to enrich it and making it more interesting every year. In addition to the traditional events, SPKD Prosvjeta is also organising every year: * 7 art exhibitions; * 10 folklore events; * 5 book promotions; * 8 sales exhibitions of books. All these activities are made possible due to their numerous members within the society: * 80 members in Teslic; * 30 members in Viktovci; * ~50 members in Pribnic and ƒêuliƒá; * 15 members within the art department. Cooperation SPKD is known for its beautiful cooperation with the St. Sava Youth Community, the National Library \`Danilo Kis\` from Teslic and the 'Branislav Nusic' Amateur Drama Theater.

It fully protects a well-preserved area of Atlantic Forest and associated ecosystems along the coastal plain and mountains of the south of the state, home to endangered species of mammals and birds. There is some threat from illegal gathering of heart of palm. Location The Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Iguape (86.43%), Itariri (3.62%), Miracatu (5.59%), Peru√≠be (4.19%) and Pedro de Toledo (0.17%) in the state of S√£o Paulo. It covers an area of . The ESEC covers part of the coastal plain and mountains between Ilha Comprida to the southwest and Peru√≠be to the east. It is east of the SP-322 highway and south of the BR-116 - BR-101 highway. The Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve extends into the northwest part of the ESEC. The Prelado State Park on the coast adjoins the south part of the ESEC. The east of the park adjoins the Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve, Ilha do Ameixal Area of Relevant Ecological Interest and Itingu√ßu State Park. The Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge is offshore to the east of the ESEC. The coastal region of the ESEC contains the Serra da Jur√©ia, an inselberg connected to the mainland by a sandy alluvial plain. It is bounded to the northeast by the Paranapu massif, part of the Serra dos Itatins. Altitudes range from above sea level. The Una do Prelado River is the largest in the region, fed by various streams from the north side of the Serra da Jur√©ia and the Atlantic side of the Serra dos Itatins. The river is tidal for most of its length. The ESEC also holds the basins of the Rio Verde and the Guara√∫ River. Environment Average annual temperature ranges from . Average annual rainfall is . The climate is tropical humid with no dry season. At least of rain falls in the driest month. The main biome is Atlantic Forest, with ecosystems typically associated with it including pioneer formations of marine influence, beaches, salt marches, rocky shores and lowland and submontane rainforest. There are fields of open \\"campo\\" vegetation at the higher levels, and mangroves along the coast. It has one of the best preserved areas of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Some of the beaches are sheltered between rock formations, while others have long stretches of fine sand. The ESEC provides a sanctuary for rare and threatened species of mammals and birds including spider monkey, jaguar, otter, capybara and tinamou. The ESEC is mainly threatened by illegal gathering of heart of palm, and to a lesser degree by illegal logging and hunting. History Entrance to the ESEC The Serra dos Itatins State Forest Reserve, preserving a remnant of forest in the Serra dos ltatins, was created by decree 31.650 of 4 August 1958. Part of the Jur√©ia area was chosen by NUCLEBR√ÅS in the 1980s for the site of two nuclear power plants, Iguape 4 and Iguape 5. NUCLEBR√ÅS withdrew from the area in 1985 and a campaign was launched to protect the forest. On 20 January 1986 governor Andr√© Franco Montoro created the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station by decree 24.646 with an area of about to ensure the integrity of the existing ecosystems. The ESEC incorporated the state forest reserve, lands declared vacant by the state and other lands along the coast of S√£o Paulo state. The main objectives are preservation of nature and conducting scientific research. An area for the Guarani Indians was excluded, as was an area used for agrarian reform. The boundaries were redefined by law 5.649 of 28 April 1987. Law 12.406 of 13 December 2006 redefined the boundaries of the ESEC and reclassified the areas of the Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve, Itingu√ßu State Park, Prelado State Park and Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve. It also excluded the areas to the north of the ESEC that were now part of the Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station. The decree created the Jur√©ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units with about . It included the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station, Itingu√ßu and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge. This law was declared unconstitutional by the Procurer General of Justice of S√£o Paulo on 11 September 2007. The mosaic was suspended in 2009. A motion was passed on 29 June 2012 repudiating the order for 300 families of traditional residents to withdraw from the ESEC. Law 14982 of 8 April 2013 again altered the limits of the ESEC, re- categorising some areas. These were the Itingu√ßu State Park, Prelado State Park, Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve and Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve. The areas called Banhado Pequeno and Banhado Grande with in the Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station were incorporated in the ESEC, as was the area called Colinas Verdes (742 hectares). An area of to the north of the EXEC was excluded. The same law recreated the Jur√©ia-Itatins Mosaic made up of the Jureia-Itatins ESEC, Itingu√ßu and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama RVS.

Biography  Born from a day laborer and a washerwoman, Lebreton entered at age seven in an indienne factory in his hometown where he was taught the printing trade on fabrics. Barely able to spell, he learned, through perseverance, to read and write and, after a few years, he felt the desire to tell what he felt. Aged fourteen, he had succeeded, through saving his salary to complete his education by going to the theater, to be a great worker and educated in his workshop. The taste of poetry being born in him, he was induced by the inspiration and breathed in to the impressions of his soul, his pains, joys, hopes and loves. Marceline Desbordes-Valmore presented the poet's essays to ' and eventually, in 1836, a man of letters from Rouen, Ch. Richard, drew attention on him by writing a sketch of his life as a worker and thinker and contributed to the publication of a collection of his poems. Until then, Lebreton had remained in his workshop but by that time, the city of Rouen having acquired the Leber collection of books, Lebreton was appointed to the newly created position of sub-librarian at Rouen library to administer it. In 1848, Lebreton was elected to represent the Seine-Inf√©rieure department at the Assembl√©e constituante but wasn't reelected to the Assembl√©e l√©gislative. A religious poet, Lebreton, in his first poems, painted the misery of the worker without seeing no other remedy than resignation on earth and rest in heaven; Later, his outrage took a keener focus without going further. A member of several learned societies, this humble man also published several songbooks in his hometown of Rouen, although he was much better known in Paris. Lebreton's great work is his Biographie normande ; recueil de notices biographiques et bibliographiques sur les personnages c√©l√®bres n√©s en Normandie et sur ceux qui se sont seulement distingu√©s par leurs actions et par leurs √©crits et sa Biographie rouennaise ; recueil de notices biographiques et bibliographiques sur les personnages c√©l√®bres n√©s √† Rouen qui se sont rendus c√©l√®bres ou qui se sont distingu√©s √† des titres diff√©rents.

It is part of the AOC Limoux. It was purchased by Baroness Philippine de Rothschild and her two sons, Philippe Sereys de Rothschild and Julien de Beaumarchais de Rothschild in December 1998 and has been extensively renovated on a five-year project. Producing their first vintage in 2003.  History  Domaine de Baronarques was originally the property of the Abbey of St. Polycarpe, dating back at least to the 17th century when it was called Domaine de Lambert. After the French Revolution, it changed hands several times under the name of Domaine de Lambert, eventually belonging to Mr. Michel Tisseyre. At this point it was both a farm and a small vineyard. He began to grow more vines until he passed it on to his son, Guyonnet. Guyonnet Tisseyre was responsible for building the chateau on the property, from 1890 to 1900, engraving both initials on the facade of the new chateau. The emblem of the estate is theatrical mask depicting a human face, the original purpose of which was to ward off evil spirits. Located on the facade of the house and marking a real link with the Rothschild family's passion for the theatre. In 1998, Mr. Ch√©reau, a Marseilles lawyer and heir of the estate sold it to Baroness Philippine de Rothschild and her two sons. The three entrusts the management of the Domaine to the family company, Baron Philippe de Rothschild S.A. The estate was very run down, calling for extensive renovation of the vineyard and the winemaking facilities, a process that took five years. In 2015, Domaine de Baron'arques is renamed Domaine de Baronarques. The three wine names of the property were also slightly changed : from the 2013 vintage Domaine de Baron'arques became Domaine de Baronarques and La Capitelle du Domaine de Baron'arques became La Capitelle de Baronarques. Since the 2014 vintage, le Chardonnay de Baron'arques is Domaine de Baronarques - White wine. The Domaine is now a single 110 hectare (272 acres) estate, 43 hectares (106 acres) of which are planted in vines.  Terroir  There are six grape varietals planted at the Domaine ; three Bordeaux varieties which represents 70% of the vineyard (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc), and three Mediterranean varieties (Syrah, Grenache and Malbec). The team at the Domaine has created a chardonnay for the white wine. There are four separate climates that influence the vineyards at the Domaine. There is the terroir d'Autan, providing a warm and dry climate, the Mediterranean terroir, providing a warm and humid climate, the oceanic climate coming from the Atlantic and the terroir Haute Vall√©e a combination of the three previous terroirs. The soil at the Domaine is mostly chalky clay, with portions of gravelly, sandy soil on other parcels. The elevation of the Domaine is between 250 and 350 meters above sea level. The Domaine hand-picks its grapes in 12 kilogram boxes to keep them whole throughout the process, just as they do at Chateau Mouton Rothschild, Opus One and Almaviva (the first one belonging entirely to the Rothschild Family and the two latters are joint ventures). Domaine has 27 stainless steel vats end eight concrete vats in its vat room, allowing for separate vinification of all of the varietals and the different parcels.  Wines  Domaine de Baronarques produces three different wines : Domaine de Baronarques - Grand vin rouge, La Capitelle de Baronarques and Domaine de Baronarques - Grand vin blanc. The earliest vintage of the signature wine is 2003 and has been produced every year since then. La Capitelle was added in 2008 and Le Chardonnay in 2009. The AOC Limoux requires that the wine be composed of at least 50 percent Merlot.

Design  It includes a cylindrical tank with a mixing tool assembled on the bottom that typically operates at a peripheral speed of between 20 and 50 m/s, depending on the material to blend. The material is heated inside by a mixer, through the mechanical energy that is produced between the mixing tools and the material which generates mutual impacts of the particles.W. V. Titow M. Phil., Ph.D., C. Chem., F.R.S.C., F.P.R.I., C. Text., A.T.I. During the mixing phase, the Turbo-mixer creates an axial vortex. The structure and position of the blades inside the mixer guarantee homogeneous material dispersion. To avoid thermal degradation, it is usually combined with a cooler that cools down the dry blend to the temperature of around 45-55 C. Due to the poor heat conductivity of the cooler, the cooler is usually three times larger than the mixer as the cooling time is proportional to contact surface.  Applications  The typical uses of the Turbo mixer is for the production of PVC (dry-blend rigid or plasticized) and for other kinds of thermoplastic composites (like Master-Batch, Wood Plastic Composites, Additives, Thermoplastics Polymers). The largest high-speed mixer known on the market has a tank volume of 2500 litres, which corresponds to a PVC batch size of about 1160 Kg and is combined with a horizontal cooler 8600 l.

As a popular preacher he has been compared with William Williams of Wern (1781‚Äì1840). His reputation was made, however, by his sermons in English at Bedford Chapel in north London, in a less popular style. Life Born at Rhayader, Radnorshire, on 17 July 1819, he was son of John Jones (died 1829), a commercial traveller. After attending the village school, he was apprenticed about 1831 to a flannel manufacturer named Winstone at Llanwrtyd; in 1837 he obtained work at Brynmawr, first as a collier and then as a check weigher; and in 1839 moved to Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. He began preaching among the Calvinistic Methodists, but in 1841 joined the Independents. After attending three or four years of school at Llanelli, Jones was ordained first pastor of Bryn Chapel, nearby, in July 1844. In 1845 he moved to take charge of the churches of Hermon and Tabor, near Llandeilo. In 1850 he settled as pastor of Libanus Church, Morriston, near Swansea, and as \\"Jones Treforris\\" became known throughout Wales for his eloquence. In September 1858 Jones accepted the pastorate of the nonconformist congregation at Albany Chapel, Frederick Street, in north-west London. Succeeding there, he moved in 1861 to a larger church, Bedford Chapel near Oakley Square, where he ministered to December 1869. There Robert Browning was a seat-holder, and stated that Jones attracted listeners by the \\"outpour of impetuous eloquence\\" and his \\"liberal humanity\\". In failing health, Jones returned to Wales, and in January 1870 took on the new Congregational church at Walter's Road, Swansea. He was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1871‚Äì2. For his health he held the pastorate of the Collins Street Independent Church, Melbourne, from May 1877 to March 1880 to great acclaim. He returned to Swansea, and resumed the pulpit at Walter's Road in 1881, filling it till his death on 24 June 1882. Works A series of Jones's sermons appeared in Words of Peace, Melbourne, 1877‚Äì1878, and another in the Sunday Magazine, London, 1883. The Divine Order and other Sermons and Addresses by the late Thomas Jones of Swansea was published in London, 1884, edited by Jones's son Brynmor, with a short Introduction by Robert Browning. A short volume of selections, Lyric Thoughts of the late Thomas Jones, with Biographical Sketch, edited by his Widow was published in London in 1886. Jones himself published some pieces of Welsh poetry. He also lectured on such subjects as Mahomet (published in 1860), The Elevation of the Working Man, and the Martyr of Erromanga. Family Jones was twice married. By his first wife Jane Jones of Dowlais (died 1867), he had at least four sons and a daughter, including David Brynmor Jones, John Viriamu Jones of University College, Cardiff, and Leifchild Leif-Jones, 1st Baron Rhayader. He married, secondly, in February 1870, Annie Howell of Pembroke Dock.

He became enamoured of one of his subordinates, by the name of Trebonius, and after several unsuccessful attempts to seduce him, he summoned Trebonius to his tent and attempted force; but Trebonius slew him. Tried for murdering his superior, Trebonius explained what had happened, and was acquitted; Marius himself honoured the young soldier.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Marius\\", 14.Cicero, Pro Milone, 4.Scholia Bobiensia, Pro Milone, p. 279 (ed.

When the empress Messalina was arrested, Claudius placed his freedman, Narcissus, over the affair, in preference to Lusius, whom he believed too loyal to the empress. Lusius retained his position until 52, when Agrippina the Younger had him replaced, in order to prevent him from protecting Britannicus, Messalina's son.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 31, 33, xii. 42. * Lusius Quietus, originally a Moorish chief, who served in the Roman army with a body of Moorish cavalry. Trajan employed him against the Dacians in AD 101, and during the Parthian War, he took the cities of Edessa and Nisibis, and was then sent against the Jews, whom he subdued.

Lord was also the last private resident of Winterthur, a 175-room mansion and large estate that her father used to house his collection of American decorative arts; to breed cattle; and to develop horticulture. Winterthur became a public museum and program for conservation in 1951; as had long been her preference, Lord maintained a small, simple house on the estate (along with residences in New Haven, New York, and Florida). Early life Born January 14, 1922, in New York City. One of two daughters of Ruth Wales and Henry Francis du Pont. Her older sister was Pauline Louise du Pont (1918‚Äì2007). Lord grew up in Winterthur, Delaware; Boca Grande, Florida; and New York City. She attended Miss Chapin's School and graduated from Foxcroft School. Lord grew up in an era where wealthy women were generally expected not to go to college but rather to focus on obtaining a suitable husband and then raising a family. She was apparently hesitant to ask her father to attend college, but he acquiesced. She then went to Vassar, where she graduated valedictorian of the class of 1943. She later received a master's degree in Education from Yale. Personal Married George deForest Lord, a Yale English professor. Divorced 1977. They had four children: Pauline, George (Woody), Henry, and Edith, who died in infancy. Married John Grier Holmes, 1981‚Äì1997, until his death. Holmes was the former chief of the Yale Whiffinpoofs. Partnered with Harry G. Haskell, Jr. (2009) until her death in 2014. The two had been childhood friends but did not met again until both were in their 80s. Their commitment ceremony included only themselves and two ministers. Professional accomplishments Co-founder of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, in 1964. She became deeply involved with the theater's founding after being introduced by William Sloane Coffin to other Yale graduates who were interested in starting a local theater (Harlan Kleiman, Jon Jory, Newt Schenck and Betty Kubler). Lord was the president of the board of that theater from 1964-1990. She began work at Yale in 1970. She later became a research associate at the Yale Child Study Center, where she focused on child custody issues. At Yale, she performed a variety of roles, including co- leading support groups for parents of severely-ill children. She also wrote papers on various topics, including a teenage girl's right to refuse dialysis and the effect on the patient when the psychoanalyst dies. She wrote a well- received biography of her father that was published in 1999, when she was 77. The first chapter of the book is accessible online. At the time of her death, she was apparently working on a biography of her mother.

The mission was contracted by NASA and was flown by SpaceX using Dragon. This was SpaceX's last flight for Dragon CRS (Dragon 1) and concludes the NASA CRS-1 contract extension. The twenty (20) missions by SpaceX under the CRS-1 contract carried more than 94,000 pounds (43,000 kg) of cargo to the International Space Station, and returned about 74,000 pounds (33,000 kg) of equipment and specimens to Earth, according to NASA. The second contract (CRS-2) was awarded in January 2016 and will begin with the SpaceX CRS-21 mission planned for November 2020 using Dragon 2. The Dragon capsule C112 used for CRS-20 previously flew to the ISS on CRS-10 and CRS-16. It arrived at the ISS on 9 March 2020 at 10:25 UTC and was captured by the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm, the last-ever capture of a Dragon with Canadarm2.

Bartolomeo provides power and data transmission for up to 12 payload slots and is the first external commercial research platform to be installed on the ISS. Along with Bartolomeo, the Dragon cargo mission delivers about a ton of scientific experiments, including biological research investigations studying microgravity's impact on stem cells, intestinal diseases and chemical reactions. The Bartolomeo platform was robotically removed from Dragon's trunk section and installed outside ISS on 2 April 2020. A spacewalk to route power and communication wiring to the Bartolomeo facility for activation has been postponed. The EVA was originally planned in mid-April 2020, but the space station will not be at full staffing level of six crew members until autumn 2020. When activated, Columbus will have a new outdoor deck to host a range of materials science, Earth observation and space science instruments. Interoperable Radio System (IORS) is the foundation element of the ARISS next-generation radio system on ISS. A total of 4 flight units and 10 total units are being built by the ARISS hardware team. The first IORS radio system shipped on CRS-20 was installed in the ISS Columbus module by Expedition 63 Commander, Chris Cassidy on September 2, 2020. System activation was first observed at 01:02 UTC on September 2 by ARISS control station and amateur radio ground operators. Initial operation of the new radio system began as an FM cross band repeater. A second IORS flight unit is expected to be launched on a later 2020 cargo flight for installation in the Russian Service module. ISS National Laboratory The Dragon spacecraft was also packed with spare parts and replacement hardware for the space station's research facilities and life support systems. The components included upgraded hardware for the station's urine processing system, which converts human waste into drinking water. The new components allow NASA teams to test out modifications designed to extend the lifetime of the urine processing system's distillation assembly ahead of future missions to the Moon and Mars, which will require longer-lasting life support equipment.

Description The length of an adult shell attains 16.5 mm, its diameter 6.5 mm. It is superficially similar to Benthofascis conorbioides, but it does not resorb the inner whorls. (Original description) The biconic, moderately thick shell has an ovately fusiform shape. Its surface is spirally furrowed, smooth and shining. The spire is regularly conical and measures about one-third the total length of the shell. It consists of five whorls, ending in a small, blunt, turbinate protoconch of two and a-half smooth rounded whorls. The whorls of the teleoconch are slightly convex. They are separated by a well-defined linear suture and ornamented by six flat spiral ribs, the three posterior ones separated by flat shallow sulci of about equal width, the three anterior ones by linear grooves sometimes almost obsolete. The interstitial furrows are punctulatedly impressed. The body whorl is obtusely angled at the periphery, regularly attenuated anteriorly; ornamented with flat spiral ribs (about 30), separated by narrow furrows, crossed by sigmoidal lines of growth which produce the appearance of punctations in the interstitial furrows. The aperture is narrow, broadly emarginate in front and measures about half the length of the shell. The outer lip is thin and sharp on the edge, smooth within, much curved medially.Tate, R.

This forum is associated with numerous controversial topics and people regarding terrorism and terror financing. Description Its objective, as stated by the general coordinator of the conference, Fahd Albmal, was to create a union to mirror that of the GCC, aimed at discussing broad political reforms and social and political development throughout the gulf. He also indicated that it required four months of planning through the formation of a number of committees and Gulf leaders to complement the GCC. Adel Ali Abdullah, the spokesperson for the conference, stated that these countries, including UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman, were looking to ensure the stability of these countries and hopefully have Yemen join the league. Additionally, he indicated that they hoped to combat the dangers facing the region that threaten their Islamic identity and foreign security risks. Throughout its promotion, the forum indicated that it gathered political and intellectual elites ranging from academic thinkers, writers, politicians, and journalists from all of the Gulf States in the pretext of a forum or conference, representing all spectrums of society and doctrines of thought. Conference The conference was attended by 400 individuals from the 6 GCC countries, and hoped to publicize further this union.https://www.facebook.com/Ugforumgulf/info?tab=page_info It featured a series of seminars by 6 speakers over two days. At the end of the conference, the forum issued a statement calling on all citizens and the institutions of civil society to participate in achieving the objectives of the forum, which included comprehensive reform of the governments and people within the countries represented. The conference met in Bahrain at the Diplomat Hotel on October 14, 2011, lasting two days. This founding conference was held under the patronage of King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and was promoted via social media accounts. According to its Facebook and Twitter account this forum was meant be its inaugural panel. However, the Facebook page has not been active since the completion of that meeting in October 2011, nor has it been reported that a forum of that scale occurred since then.https://www.facebook.com/Ugforumgulf On the other hand, its Twitter page, followed by over 1,300 accounts, has been active between the initiation of the conference and April 2014. Its tweets include YouTube links to various workshops and updates of forum and board meetings that have occurred in Bahrain and Paris. Furthermore, it has tweeted various provocative statements including ones that refer to Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood protesters who died in escalated protests as Allah‚Äôs martyrs. It is reported that at the conference, the forum announced stances on controversial issues such as the Syrian Civil War and the insurgencies in Yemen stating that they should use whatever means necessary to fight back their repressive states and any form of aggression. They also discussed Western dangers that threaten Islamic identity. Board of trustees Additionally, during the conference a board of trustees was chosen, listing six individuals from each country represented, or 36 in total. Of these 36 individuals, at least 4 are known terrorists or are associated with terrorist groups/activities including Saad bin Saad al ‚ÄìKaabi, an al Qaeda financier and U.S. sanctioned terrorist, Abdul Rahman bin Omair al-Naimi, another al Qaeda financier and U.S. designated terrorist, Hassan Ahmed al-Diqqi, an extremist al Ummah party leader and Syrian rebel financier, and Abdullah Abdul Qader Ahmad Ali al-Hajiri, a Muslim Brotherhood activist, who has been convicted of treason and jailed in the UAE.

Examples of metacognitive beliefs are; \\"Worry is uncontrollable\\", \\"I have little confidence in my memory for words and names\\", and \\"I am constantly aware of my thinking\\". The development of the questionnaire was informed by the Self- Regulatory Executive Function model (Wells & Matthews, 1994) which is the metacognitive model and theory of psychological disorder. This model is the foundation for metacognitive therapy developed by Adrian Wells (see e.g. Wells, 2009). There are two versions of the metacognitions questionnaire. # The Metacognitions questionnaire (MCQ) first developed by Sam Cartwright- Hatton and Adrian Wells (1997), consist of 65 items and has a five-factor structure: 1) Positive worry beliefs, 2) Beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry, 3) Meta-cognitive efficiency, 4) General negative beliefs, and 5) Cognitive self-consciousness. Responses are required on a four-point scale ranging from 1 (do not agree) to 4 (agree very much), high scores reflect more reported problems with the item in question. # The Metacognitions questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30; Wells & Cartwright-Hatton, 2004) is a 30-item version of the MCQ consisting of the same five-factor structure, but the subcategories were renamed: 1) positive beliefs about worry; 2) negative beliefs about the controllability of thoughts and corresponding danger; 3) cognitive confidence; 4) negative beliefs about thoughts in general/need to control thoughts; and 5) cognitive self-consciousness. MCQ-30 uses the same four-point scale as MCQ. These questionnaires have established reliability and validity, are widely used and have informed research on the importance of metacognitive beliefs and metacognitive knowledge in psychological disorders. They are elevated across psychological disorders. However, there is also evidence that more specific metacognitive beliefs exist in different disorders. Following this work several questionnaires have been developed to measure more disorder-specific metacognitive beliefs. E.g. Wells proposed that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with a specific type of metacognitive belief concerning the dangerousness and significance of intrusive thoughts. These meta-beliefs are termed thought-fusion beliefs, and can be measured by the 14 item Thought Fusion Instrument (TFI; Wells, Gwilliam, & Cartwright-Hatton, 2001). There is an adolescent version of the MCQ that has been used in research on children (Cartwright-Hatton et al. 2004). References * Cartwright-Hatton, S., & Wells, A. (1997).

His campaign was endorsed by former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson. Levine ran on a platform of \\"Just Get It Done,\\" focusing on fixing street flooding and combating sea level rise, cleaning up government corruption, reforming the police department and city finances, and placing a priority on constituent service. In June 2017, Levine hosted the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors in Miami Beach. The event brought together over 300 mayors from across the country and was the first Conference of Mayors held in the city since 1962. = Climate change = During his tenure as Miami Beach Mayor, Levine has advocated publicly for action and attention to the issues of climate change. Levine was involved in implementing solutions to sea-level rise in Miami Beach such as installing new drainage systems, investing in cutting-edge pumps and physically raising roads.https://philiplevine2018.com/meet-philip-levine In 2016, he appeared in Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary Before the Flood and in an episode of the National Geographic Channel series Years of Living Dangerously, hosted by Jack Black, to discuss the reality and impact of sea-level rise in Miami Beach and across Florida. Before Levine took over as mayor, Miami Beach had a begun a 20-year, $200 million program to combat sea-level rise with new pumps, drain pipes and sea walls. When Levine took office, his first move to mitigate flooding was a $11 million contract for three storm pumps along Alton Road around the area where Levine owns real estate. That area had one of the lowest sea-levels in the entire City and suffered from the most flooding. Later, Levine fast-tracked a plan to raise roads in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood where Levine and partners owned real estate worth about $20 million. In Levine's two terms as mayor, the city signed close to $40 million in no-bid contracts, extensions and change orders to stop flooding. = 2018 Run for Florida Governor = Levine ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Florida in the 2018 election but lost in a crowded primary field.https://www.usnews.com/news/best- states/florida/articles/2017-11-01/miami-beach-mayor-expected-to-enter- florida-governors-race His gubernatorial platform included environmentalism, living wages, better public schools, gun safety policies and social equality;https://philiplevine2018.com/meet-philip-levine he was endorsed by the Miami Herald.\\"Here is the Miami Herald‚Äôs recommendation for Governor in the Aug. 28 Democratic primary\\" He finished third behind eventual nominee Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former U.S. Representative Gwen Graham.

History  The school was founded as a young monks' boarding school in 1886/1887, with the target to send young missionaries to the German colonies. In addition to the usual curriculum, students at the time also had to prepare their life as missionaries. Together with the Sankt Ottilien Archabbey the school was closed during World War II, as church-funded schools were not tolerated under the Nazi regime, instead the buildings were used as a military hospital. In the aftermath of the war the school was used as a reception camp for displaced people and refugees. In 1973, the school started to teach girls and extended its strictly classical curriculum to modern languages. Until 1976, the school was funded through the Sankt Ottilien Archabbey, since then it is financed through the Diocese of Augsburg. Traditionally, religious studies form a mandatory part of the curriculum, whereas Roman Catholic and Protestant students are taught separately. Until today a fraction of teachers consists of Benedictian monks.  Alumni  = Alumni association: Confoederatio Ottiliensis = Beyond establishing a network of former Ottilians, the alumni association of Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium aims to support and foster the network of the Gymnasium and future generations of students.

The painting was gifted to the museum by Helen Clay Frick, the daughter of Henry Clay Frick, who founded the Frick Collection. It is currently on display in the reading room of the Frick Art Reference Library, which was founded by Helen after her father's death. The painting depicts the Grand Canal (Venice). In the distance the Rialto Bridge is visible alongside the bell tower of the church of San Bartolomeo and the dome of the Church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice. Guardi has included this fifteenth century Italian Gothic Church as well as the more recent seventeenth century bell tower, documenting both historical and contemporary changes in the urban landscape. In the foreground of the painting Guardi paints the Palazzo Balbi built by Alessandro Vittoria from 1582 as the residence of the Venetian patrician family of the Balbi. Guardi fills the Palazzo Balbi with people pouring onto balconies. This brings the viewer's attention to the regatta, the traditional Venetian boat race. Guardi has depicted the most exciting part of the Regatta race: the paleto. The paleto is a turning post that stands in the middle of the Grand Canal. At this juncture, the boats begin to turn around and the winners normally take the lead. The figures in Guardi‚Äôs picture push their oars into the water in different directions in a hurry to spin their boats. The Venetian regatta race was normally preceded by bissone, traditional gondolier boats which would parade before the race to clear the waters and settle rowdy onlookers. Guardi paints these boats in bright colours with figures in matching costumes. Guardi's subject and style appears heavily Dutch influenced, with water, sky and light, prominent features in this architectural and perspectival composition.The cultural event and iconic architectural view was not uncommon in Guardi's time. Indeed, this very scene was also painted by Guardi's predecessor, Canaletto. Canaletto's The Grand Canal from the Palazzo Balbi in the Uffizi Gallery is painted from a similar viewpoint.
