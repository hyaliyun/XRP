Her days are happy until Hazuki Tokiwa (the \\"prince\\") with his arrogant demeanor gets under her skin, releasing her inner monster! Characters Nanoha Satsuki : Nanoha is the heroine of our story. She is an ordinary high school student who is a little clumsy, has average grades and a plain face. She feels that her only talents lie in separating food and folding handouts. Because she is such a simple girl, she is over-shadowed by her two best friends Renge and Nobara. Even though she is often forgotten, she still loves her friends dearly and is not jealous or spiteful. Nanoha is usually a very happy and easy-going girl, but one particular boy at her school gets under her skin, Hazuki Tokiwa. She calls this deep hatred for him her little monster. Because of this, she tries to avoid him at all costs, but in such a small school they are bound to run into one another at some point. At one of these encounters, Nanoha can't hold in her annoyance anymore and yells at Hazuki calling him arrogant. This one utterance changes Hazuki's world to the point where he eventually figures out that his friends, who are mainly girls, only hang out with him because he is good looking. Not wanting to be so shallow, Hazuki drops his old friends and begins to seek out Nanoha, the girl who is not afraid to be honest with him. Renge Midou : Renge is one of Nanoha's best friends. Considered the \\"genius princess,\\" Renge is beautiful and at the top of her class in every subject. She is a legend in which she doesn't study but simply memorizes everything that her teachers say. While she appears rather perfect to the rest of her classmates, she actually has a hard time making friends which makes her rather lonely. She cherishes both Nanoha and Nobara as her best friends. Nobara Ryuzaki : Nobara is one of Nanoha's best friends. She is beautiful to the point where she is popular even with the girls in the school. Being abandoned by her father and left with a huge debt has made things rough for her family but it has also made Nobara strong. She frequently dotes on Nanoha and is seen as a sort of knight to the other girls in the school. Hazuki Tokiwa : Hazuki is the prince of the school. Charming and beautiful he feels like he runs the school until one day when Nanoha calls him arrogant straight to his face. Finally realizing how shallow he had been acting Hazuki strives to change his ways and form friendships that are not based solely on looks.

The 2011 North Somerset Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of North Somerset Unitary Council in Somerset, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative Party stayed in overall control of the council. Background At the last election in 2007 the Conservatives gained control of the council with 46 seats. This was compared to 6 independents, 5 Liberal Democrats, 3 Labour and 1 Green Party councillors. In February 2011 Liberal Democrat councillor for Nailsea East Andy Cole said he would be standing in the election as an independent. Cole was one of a total of 182 candidates who stood in the election for the 61 seats on the council. These were 58 Conservatives, 53 Labour, 42 Liberal Democrats, 20 independents, 5 Green Party, 3 United Kingdom Independence Party and 1 from the All The South Party. The most candidates were in Weston-super-Mare West ward, where 12 people contested the seats. The Conservative administration of the previous 4 years was attacked over the cost moving the council offices to Castlewood in Clevedon and over the refurbishment of the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. However the Conservatives said they had been able to make savings and therefore not had to make as big cuts as other councils. Election result The results saw the Conservatives remain in control of the council after winning 42 of the 61 seats. Independents won 7 seats, the Liberal Democrats 6, Labour 5 and the Green Party 1 seat. The Liberal Democrats took 2 seats from the Conservatives in Weston-super-Mare Central and 3 seats from them in Weston-super-Mare West, but lost 3 seats back to the Conservatives in Weston-super-Mare South Worle. Meanwhile, Labour also gained 2 seats from the Conservatives in Weston-super- Mare East. Long time councillor and independent Nan Kirsen lost her seat in Pill to another independent Don Davies, standing for the Sustainable Pill and District Party, by 17 votes, while Andy Cole won his seat in Nailsea East as an independent after leaving the Liberal Democrats.

It is renowned for releasing super-budget-priced editions on CD of the complete works of J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and many other composers. The label also specialises in new recordings of early music, chamber, organ and piano music.  Mission  Since its inception, Brilliant Classics has sought to bring art music to the widest possible public by releasing all its recordings at budget and super-budget price. The distribution strategy of selling through supermarkets and drugstores (see History below) introduced classical music to a mass market when most other labels were selling to a specialised audience. One of its best-known sets is the complete works of J.S. Bach on 155CDs: this has sold more than 500,000 units. Though CD is still the primary medium for Brilliant Classics, all its new releases are available as downloads, and many are available on streaming services.  History  The label was founded in 1995, and its artistic director since then has been Pieter van Winkel, a pianist and record producer. Brilliant Classics releases were initially sold exclusively by the retail outlets of Kruidvat, a chain of drugstores in the Netherlands and Belgium. The retail price of each release was very low, encouraging mass consumption in a different business model to the release, distribution and marketing network then prevalent in the classical music world. The success of this venture led to international distribution in other European countries including the UK, where Brilliant Classics releases were sold in the Superdrug chain of stores, and Aldi and Rossmann supermarkets in Germany. In 2007 Brilliant Classics became part of Foreign Media Music, one of the Foreign Media Group (FMG) of companies based in Leeuwarden. In September 2010 the label was sold to a Dutch investment company, Triacta B.V., who performed a 'corporate carve-out' before selling the company on to Edel AG, a German entertainment group with a long presence in the core classical market through its ownership of Berlin Classics. Berlin Classics continues as a division of Edel as well as licensing content to Brilliant Classics. The label is now distributed across Europe and in North America, Australia and Far East.  Release policy  Since 2000, Brilliant Classics has issued more than a hundred releases per year, including on average more than six new recordings each month. The repertoire for new recordings is chosen on the basis of interest for the classical collector, interested in newly available or otherwise unavailable music in genres such as Renaissance and Baroque vocal music, Classical-era chamber music, composers from the turn of the 20th century and Minimalist piano music.  Box sets  Editions presenting either the complete works of a composer or a significant portion of their output are a speciality for Brilliant Classics. By the middle of 2015 the label had released boxed sets dedicated to C.P.E. Bach, J.S. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Boccherini, Borodin, Brahms, Cabez√≥n, Chopin, Corelli, Couperin, Dessau, Dvo≈ô√°k, Eisler, Faur√©, Frescobaldi, Martinu, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Sch√ºtz, Shostakovich, Richard Strauss, Tallis, Tchaikovsky, Telemann and Vivaldi. Not all of these sets are available at any one time owing to licensing restrictions but they are periodically reissued with new contents. The first of these boxed sets was one dedicated to the music of J.S. Bach. Nearly all the performances within the set were made according to historically informed performance practices, and (most unusually for such large sets) over half the set had been newly recorded for the purpose. This included a complete set of the 199 extant sacred cantatas, recorded over the period of a year by the Holland Boys Choir and their conductor, Pieter Jan Leusink, with the Netherlands Bach Collegium. \\"The spirit of the task,\\" remarked Gramophone magazine, \\"is clearly designed to provide a large audience with the opportunity to experience all these masterworks on period instruments, at an affordable price. A ridiculous price actually... In sum, these readings deserve to be recognised, primarily for their attractive and well-measured strides, but also for a lack of dogma or self-importance.\\" The initial editions of 5CD boxes sold over 100,000 copies of each volume within the Netherlands alone.  Artists  Though Brilliant Classics is primarily a repertoire-led label, it has nurtured the careers of several artists whose albums have become best-sellers for the label, and who have found international prominence through their recordings. The Hungarian pianist has recorded the complete sonatas of Mozart, several albums of Schumann, chamber music by Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann and Brahms and concertos by Mozart, Ravel, Rachmaninov and Bart√≥k, among others. The Dutch pianist Bart van Oort has recorded Classical and early Romantic music for the label from J.C. Bach to Chopin and John Field on instruments of the period; the Norwegian pianist H√•kon Austb√∏ made albums of Grieg (the complete Lyric Pieces), Scriabin's complete piano sonatas and Jan√°ƒçek's complete piano music. The Dutch harpsichordist and conductor Pieter-Jan Belder has recorded the complete sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (according to Classics Today, \\"Belder's Scarlatti survey offers hours upon hours of listening pleasure, and unquestionably constitutes a major achievement.\\") and music by Rameau, J.S. and C.P.E. Bach, as well as embarking on the first-ever complete recordings of both the sonatas by Antonio Soler and the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Other musicians working on the label within the Dutch early-music tradition have included Musica ad Rhenum with their director, the flautist , and the cellist/conductor Jaap ter Linden, who recorded a complete cycle of Mozart symphonies. From 2009 onwards, the Dutch pianist Jeroen van Veen has recorded several albums and collections of minimal piano music by composers including Philip Glass, Ludovico Einaudi and Simeon ten Holt. These albums have met with both commercial and critical success: Gramophone magazine described his P√§rt album as \\"absolutely brilliant\\". Among the most distinguished artists to record for Brilliant Classics is the Russian conductor Rudolf Barshai, whose cycle of Shostakovich symphonies (recorded 1994-2000) with the WDR Sinfonieorchester K√∂ln was quickly recognised as a leader in its field. According to Classics Today, \\"Barshai's intelligent, humane, passionate, and deeply felt readings undeniably realize the composer's intentions and certainly will stand the test of time. This Brilliant Classics set is such a bargain you almost feel guilty paying so little for it.\\" Brilliant Classics has also specialised in forming fruitful partnerships with historically informed Italian ensembles and musicians, including the violinist with L'Arte dell'Arco; Federico Maria Sardelli with Modo Antiquo; Enrico Casazza with La Magnifica Comunit√†; the harpsichordist and organist Simone Stella, who has recorded the complete keyboard music of the most important prebachian composers including Buxtehude, B√∂hm, Reincken, Walther, Froberger and Pachelbel; and the keyboard player and conductor has recorded albums of J.S. Bach, Telemann and Galuppi as well as leading the Frescobaldi Edition, which gathers on 17CD all the extant music by \\"one of the greatest composers of the first half of the 17th century\\". Young artists on the label include the Dutch recorder virtuoso Erik Bosgraaf, who has made recordings of music from Vivaldi to Boulez; the Spanish lutenist ; the Italian organist Stefano Molardi, who has recorded the complete organ works of J.S. Bach; and the Hungarian violinist Krist√≥f Bar√°ti, who has recorded solo and chamber repertoire from Bach to Brahms and Bart√≥k. The Italian pianist Vanessa Benelli Mosell made her first two recordings for Brilliant Classics (including \\"impressively refined and nuanced\\" Liszt: Gramophone).

The CCA served the arts and cultural community in Canada by providing research, analysis and consultations on public policies affecting the arts and Canadian cultural institutions and industries. The CCA was active on many fronts to advance the relevance of the arts in Canadian society.\\"About the cca.\\" Canadian Conference of the Arts. Retrieved 2012-11-01.  History  The CCA was founded in 1958, when the Canadian Arts Council adopted a new name at the same time as it submitted papers of incorporation. The name was one of several submitted to the federal government for consideration. Canadian Arts Council The Canadian Arts Council was founded in December 1945 by a coalition of sixteen arts organizations to be an advocate for artists of all disciplines. The birth of a national organization representing the interests of Canadian artists of all disciplines can be traced to the formation of the House of Commons Special Committee on Reconstruction and Re-establishment in 1942. This committee was one of several charged with identifying issues likely to face the country following the end of the Second World War and solutions reflective of Canada's post-war prosperity and global influence. Fifteen major cultural organizations met in Toronto in 1944 in order to draft a report for the committee on how the federal government ought to intervene in Canadian artistic and cultural development. Their three-part report, \\"Brief Concerning the Cultural Aspects of Canadian Reconstruction,\\" called for, among other things, the formation of a non-partisan national body to support and oversee the arts in Canada and the establishment of community arts centres across the country. During 1945, the coalition resolved that some kind of permanent association would be beneficial. The Canadian Arts Council was formed with the mandate to \\"act in collaboration [. . .] on matters affecting the common interests of the member societies.\\"Canadian Conference of the Arts. \\"'A Vigorous and Distinctive Cultural Life:' The Legacies of the Massey-L√©vesque Report and the Kingston Artists' Conference.\\" Crossroads 2001 Program: Arts and Cultural Policy in Canada ‚Äì The Last Half Century and Beyond (2001): 12. The council pushed for government action on issues pertaining to Canadian arts and culture, including making a presentation to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences in 1949. Following the formation of the Canada Council for the Arts, the Canadian Arts Council renamed itself the CCA in 1958.  Activities  The CCA has organized conferences and spoken out on all major Canadian policy proposals pertaining to arts, culture and heritage since its formation. Highlights include: * Twelve years of CCA leadership were rewarded with the adoption of federal Status of the Artist legislation in 1992; * Also in the 1990s, the CCA created the Cultural Sector Training Committee to improve work and training opportunities for members of the cultural labour force. The committee later became independent of the CCA as the Cultural Human Resources Council; * The CCA was the incubator and administrator of the national ArtsSmarts program from its creation in 1998 to 2005, when the Canadian Education Association took over; * The CCA was a founding member of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation, alongside the National Arts Centre, the Canada Council for the Arts and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (1992); * The CCA participated actively in the development and adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005); * Most recently, the CCA demonstrated its role as convener by bringing together 98 cultural organizations from coast to coast to support a common message to the government regarding copyright reform. This led to a presentation to Parliament of a series of amendments that reflected a large consensus in the cultural sector regarding this issue.\\"CCA Highlights.\\" Canadian Conference of the Arts.

Closure  On October 30, 2012, the Canadian Conference of the Arts released a press release announcing that it would be discontinuing operations. The release identified this decision was due to the loss of federal government support, which the organization had received regularly since the 1960s, and which during its final years accounted for approximately 60-70 per cent of its total operating budget. Responding to indications in spring 2012 that the federal government intended to fundamentally change its funding model, the CCA sought to redefine its business model and become an organization completely independent of government. The organization requested two years' worth of transitional funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage, but given six months of funding.

The list of recipients reads like a Who's Who of the Canadian cultural sector. The Dipl√¥me d'honneur is presented annually to a Canadian who has made a sustained contribution to the cultural life of the country, whether through volunteer activity, mentoring, patronage, individual arts practice or other recognized support. The Keith Kelly Award for Cultural Leadership has been awarded annually since 1998, when it was established to recognize the leadership shown by the former national director of the CCA during his tenure from 1989 to 1998. It is presented to a Canadian who has made a significant contribution to the arts through advocacy work or the development of cultural policy, or who has otherwise demonstrated leadership in the field.

This legislation liberalised various rules concerning adoption.

The Act instead allowed the identity of the adopter to be concealed behind a serial number.International advances in adoption research for practice by Gretchen Miller Wrobel and Elsbeth Catherine Neil The act was repealed on 5 November 1993. Scope of Power to make Adoption Orders This section explains that the mother and father of an infant child have the freedom to let someone adopt their child. But the choice has to be come to together. The child to be adopted may be from Wales or England and can be adopted by parents in Britain. Restrictions on Making of Adoption Orders In order to protect the adoptive children, restrictions on age are reinforced. No adoption will occur if the adopter is not at least 21 years old, is a relative of the infant, or is the mother or father of the infant. Consent to Adoption This section sets the rule to make sure all family members are in accordance to the adoption of the child. Consequently, an adoption will not take place unless the family of the infant agrees to it. Section 3, Number 1 reads: :An adoption order shall not be made except with the adoption. Consent of every person or body who is' a parent or guardian of the infant, or who is liable by virtue of any order or agreement to contribute to the maintenance of the infant: Provided that the court may dispense with any consent required by this subsection if it is satisfied- (a) in the case of a parent or guardian of the infant, that he has abandoned, neglected or persistently ill-treated the infant ; I (b) in the case of a person liable as aforesaid to contribute to the maintenance of the infant, that he has persistently neglected-or refused so to contribute ; (c) in any case, that the person whose consent is required cannot be found, or is incapable of giving his consent or that his consent is unreasonably withheld. Requirements must be met to ensure the child‚Äôs best interests are at hand. If it is the parent or guardians wishes to not know who is going to adopt their child, those wishes will be respected. If they have specific things they‚Äôd like the child to be raised in such as a religion or a name they‚Äôd like the child to be called, that can be put on file and be afforded to them too. Evidence of Paternity The court needs to make sure that the children that are up for adoption are really the children of whoever is claiming to be the parents. Marital intercourse proof must be presented by both parties: wife and husband. Section 4, Number 1 reads: :It is relevant to determine whether marital intercourse took place between a husband and his wife during a particular period, evidence that such intercourse did not take place may be given in the proceedings on the application by either of the parties concerned. Probationary Period Section 5, Number 1 reads: :After the expiration of three months from the commencement of this Act an adoption order shall not be made period. in the case of any infant unless- (a) the infant has been continuously in the care and possession of the applicant for at least three consecutive months immediately preceding the date of the order; and (b) the applicant has, at least three months before the date of the order, notified the welfare authority for the area in which he is for the time being resident of his intention to apply for an adoption order in respect of the infant. Details are closely monitored in order to not cultivate unlawful virtues because of the adoption of a child. Section 5, Number 3 reads: :Where, under subsection (1) of this section, notice is given to the welfare authority in respect, of an infant who is not, over compulsory school age, subsections (5) to (7) and (10) of section seven of the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, 1939 (hereinafter referred to as \\" the Act of 1939 \\" ). shall,, notwithstanding anything in that section or in section thirty-seven of the Children Act, 1948, but subject to the provisions of subsection' (2) of the said section seven, apply in relation to the infant and the person by whom the notice is given as they apply in relation to an adopted child and an adopter within the meaning of that section. Arrangements made by Adoption Societies If for some reason the adopted child must be returned to an adoption society such as a foster home, or orphanage, it is important that the child be left by his or her adopter, and met with a specific person that will accommodate their emotional needs. Section 6, Number 3 reads: :The period within which, under subsection of the said section six, an, adopter is required to apply for an adoption order or give notice to the adoption society of his intention, not to apply for such an order shall be six months from the expiration of the period specified in subsection of the said section six instead of three months from the expiration of that period. Local Authorities There are ‚ÄúLocal Authorities‚Äù that are part of the adoption counsel in any city, or state. Section 7, Number 1 reads, ‚ÄúEvery such local authority as aforesaid has power in connection with their functions under any enactment relating to children to make and participate in arrangements for the adoption of children.‚Äù All local authorities had to the right to revise documents of potential adopters; they kept and could access records of children in the adoption societies; and legal measures could be taken if they found things that were not befitting Citizenship of Adopted Children This section makes clear that if the adoptive parents of a child are citizens of the United Kingdom, that child will be a citizen as well. Treatment of Adopted Persons as Children of Adopters for Purposes of Intestacies, Wills and Settlements This section makes clear that if the adoptive parents of a child are citizens of the United Kingdom, that child will be a citizen as well. Provisions supplementary to s. 9 This section proclaims that an adopted person becomes the family member of anyone that is related to their adoptive parents. This section also states that all adoptions therefore must be done for the right reasons, not by intentions motivated by greed or gain. Other Effects of Adoption Order Marriage does not become invalid if one spouse has adopted a child and the other has not. Also if the father of a child decides he is going to bestow monthly or annual monies onto their child that has been adopted that will be repressed. If a mother were to bestow monthly monies onto her child that she had given up for adoption that would be acceptable, until she got married, then she would have to stop. Registration of Adoption Orders This section states that there are organized and kept records of children that were adopted, whom they were adopted by, when they were adopted, what their conditions were, how old the child and the parents were, all details would be put in the record. Section 12, Number 2 reads: (a) where the precise date of the infant's birth is not proved to the satisfaction of the court, the court shall determine the probable date of his birth and the date so determined shall be specified in the order as the date of his birth; (b) where the name or surname which the infant is to bear after the adoption differs from his original name or surname, the new name or surname shall be specified in the order instead of the original. If there was an infant who had not been requested to be adopted before, and now had someone interested in adopting them, their name and information would be directed to the Registrar General to cause the entry in the Registers of Births to be marked with the word ‚Äúadopted.\\" If there was an infant who had previously been the subject of an adoption order, the order would contain a direction to the Registrar General to cause the previous entry in the Adopted Children Register to be marked with the word ‚Äúre-adopted.\\" There are many more intricacies that are included in the Registration of Adoption Orders. Definition of \\"Relative‚Äù Section 13, Number 1 reads: :For the purposes of this Act, the expression ‚Äúrelative \\", in relation to an infant, means a grandparent, brother, ‚Äúrelative \\". Sister, uncle or aunt, whether of the full blood, of the half-blood or by affinity, and includes-(a) where an adoption order has been made in respect of the infant or any other person, any person who would be a relative of the infant within the meaning of this definition if the adopted person were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock; (b) where the infant is illegitimate, the father of the infant and any person who would be a relative of the infant within the meaning of this definition if the infant were the legitimate child of its mother and father. Interpretation and Construction This section is making clear the type of appropriate dialogue and certain words that will be used during the adoption process and in the work of adoption. Section 14, Number 1 reads: :Hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say ‚Äúadoption order\\" means an order under section one of the principal Act and includes, in sections eight, nine, ten, eleven and thirteen of this Act, an order authorizing an adoption under the Adoption of Children (Scotland) Act, 1930, or the Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland), 1929, or any enactment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the time being in force ; \\" adoption society \\" and \\"welfare authority \\" have the same meanings as in the Act of 1939 ; \\" compulsory school age \\" has the same meaning as in the Education Act, 1944; ‚Äúfather \\", in relation to an illegitimate infant, means the natural father. Application to Scotland This section makes clear which sections in the Act can be referenced to for the Adoption of Children Act, 1926; Adoption of Children (Scotland) Act, 1930; the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, and more. The United Kingdom worked closely with Scotland and their adoptive system, hence, the Registrar General for Scotland is often referenced to.

He served as the Coroner of New York County, New York. He was also active in politics as a member of the German Democrats and of Tammany Hall.  Early life  Messemer was born March 30, 1851 in New York City to Francis Messemer, a language interpreter and Gertrude Broschardt. His parents were immigrants from the small Pfalz region town of Schallodenbach. At the age of seven Messemer along with siblings Edward and Anna were orphaned when their parents and sister Cecilia perished in the sinking of the Hamburg-American Steamer 'Austria'. Messemer and his siblings were adopted by their paternal grandfather Peter Messemer, a former Mayor of Schallodenbach and president of the German Democratic party in New York. Peter Messemer gained prominence as a leading real-estate holder in \\"kleindeutschland\\", the modern day East Village and landlord of several businesses including an early piano factory. The elder Messemer's early involvement in politics and the Tammany machine had a lasting effect on the younger Messemer. Messemer's grammar school education was within the Roman Catholic parochial school of the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer. He graduated from St. Francis Xavier's College at the age of sixteen after which he studied for two years at New York University School of Law, but left before completing his degree. Having given up the prospects of becoming an attorney, Messemer graduated from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1875 (now New York University School of Medicine).  Medical career  Messemer served for fifteen years as physician of internal and nervous diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital, for ten years as surgeon of the 5th regiment of the N.G.S.N.Y. He began is tenure as Deputy Coroner and Coroner in 1883 be elected to office as Deputy Coroner on the Tammany ticket. He would serve in the position of Coroner til his death receiving a salary of $10,000 a year with a three-month vacation period. Messemer was a popular and strong advocate of medical reform and was a member of a number of medical societies. He served on several publication boards of the Medico-Legal Society pushing for mortuary reform. Messemer was also a life member of the New York Pathological Society, the Neurological Society, the Medical Society of the State of New York . He served from 1885 to 1886 as Health Commissioner of the city and was for nearly twenty years Medical Examiner in Lunacy of the State of New York and Medical Jurisprudence of New York County. Messemer was the consulting physician of the Germany Dispensary (later Lenox Hill Hospital, the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Leaks and Watts Children Home, Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, Half Orphan Asylum for Destitute and Abandoned Children, The Thalia Theater and Tammany Hall Messemer and his brother Dr. Edward Jean Messemer were active in medical educating regularly presiding over medical students residencies as well as teaching at medical schools in New York, Leeds, England, Paris and Montpellier, France, Marburg and Berlin, Germany. Messemer's most notable autopsy and inquest was of the 1885 death of railroad magnate William H. Vanderbilt, son and heir of the 'Commodore'.  Political career  M. J. B. Messemer's political ambitions began young with his father and grandfathers political prowess within the German community of New York and Tammany Hall. Messemer's intention for political power become evident upon the completion of his studies when he rand for Coroner. His association as one of the most senior members representing the German community and medical professionals began in 1875. He would attempt to run on at least four occasions for the position of Mayor of New York, but was always defeated in early ballots by the Irish opposition of Tammany. Messemer often acted as representative for the City of New York at State events in Washington and to visiting dignitaries, the most notable occasion being an evening cruise in honor of Prince Don Augusto in which anarchists attempted to bomb the vessel in an act of terror. He was known throughout his career for being particularly savvy when it came to political campaigning among the various ethnic groups of New York. It was known among many that he utilized his command of nearly every language in the city and cheery disposition to engage a more personal audience with voters. A number of political satires at the time mocked Messemer's name in relation to his ability to address any audience, some of these being; Michael J. B. Messemer and M. J. B. Messemer to the natives, M. Jean Baptiste Messemer to the French, Mike Messemer to the Irish, Michel Johann B. Messemer to the Germans, Maccaroni J. B. Messemer to the Italians, and the most satirical, Montgomery Jacqueminot Bleached Messemer.  Personal life and death  Messemer never married and devoted his life to his career and hobbies. Outside of his expansive medical practice he was an active member of the Liederkranz Society and Arion Society, the two largest German musical societies in the country at that time. He was a member of the Press Club and frequently traveled to Washington where he participated in language competitions, a talent which he derived from his father who had been an interpreter. He traveled frequently collected specimen from around the world and also enjoyed a healthy social life following the pursuits of 19th century New York society. It was this life style which was blamed for his failing at the end of his life. He resided at large townhouse at 144 Second Avenue with his brother for many years and later at 150 Second Avenue with his grandfather and two of his uncles. He spent the last six months of his life travelling through the Southwest and Europe. He died at Mentone, France on February 21, 1894. Following his death his will was contested by a German woman, Charlotte von Keuhnau who attempted to withdraw several thousands dollars from a Rothschild bank in Germany. Messemer's brother Edward had an injunction filed and later was awarded the entirety of the estate.

The infecting virus is an enveloped, positive- sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid recepter. Infection causes calf enteritis and contributes to the enzootic pneumonia complex in calves. It can also cause winter dysentery in adult cattle. It can infect both domestic and wild ruminants and has a worldwide distribution. Transmission is horizontal, via oro-fecal or respiratory routes. It has, like other coronaviruses from genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Embecovirus, an additional shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE). Virology BCoV has 95% similarity with human coronavirus OC43 and 93% to porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. According to a 2006 study, those three strains may have diverged during the 19th century, while all circulating BCoV lineages had a most recent common ancestor around 1940s, with all earlier bovine lineages extinct. An earlier article by the same authors compared BCoV and HCoV-OC43, and several methods yielded most probable divergence dates around 1890, leading authors to speculate that an introduction of the former strain to the human population might have caused the 1889‚Äì1890 flu pandemic. Clinical signs and diagnosis Infection normally occurs in calves between the ages of one week and three months. Gastrointestinal signs include profuse diarrhea, dehydration, depression, reduced weight gain and anorexia. Respiratory infection in the calf produces a serous to purulent nasal discharge. Clinical signs may worsen with secondary bacteria infection. Infection in adults is normally subclinical, the exception being with winter dysentery, which affects housed cattle over the winter months. Clinical signs include profuse diarrhea and a significant drop in milk yield is seen in winter dysentery outbreaks. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the history and clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis of an enteric coronavirus infection is achieved by performing electron microscopy or an ELISA on a faecal or tissue sample. In respiratory disease, diagnosis is confirmed by performing a direct fluorescent antibody test on nasal washes ‚Äì which identifies the viral antigen. The haemagglutination inhibition test can be used to establish the strain of coronavirus. Treatment and control Animals should be treated symptomatically. The disease can be controlled by vaccinating the dam with a live vaccine (ATCvet code QI02) whilst she is pregnant as this provides antibodies to the virus in the colostrum. Additional management factors such as ensuring adequate colostrum intake in newborn calves, using appropriate hygiene methods and ventilation of housing reduce disease incidence.

During a ten-month period lasting from January 1 to October 29, 1941, no music licensed by ASCAP (1,250,000 songs) was broadcast on NBC nor CBS radio stations. Instead, the stations played songs in the public domain, regional music and styles (like rhythm and blues or country) that had been traditionally disdained by ASCAP.

Nancy Peterson, another passenger on the bus, mistakenly believes Dan Carter has stolen her suitcase. It turns out both are entertainers. They end up with each other's bags, then become better acquainted after the mix-up. The conniving Lew represents Dan and tries to get him to take the same bad gig the girl singers just left. Lew also meets a couple of delicatessen owners, Leo and Harry, who might have money to invest in his performers' careers. The agent has an impersonator, Glendon, pretend to be the producer of bandleader Bob Crosby's television program. Everybody excitedly believes that Lew has booked them on the TV show. Lew continually tries to get in to see Crosby's actual producer, totally in vain. He lies to the singers that Crosby won't book them because he is jealous of Dan's ability as a singer. A furious Nancy barges into the TV studio to berate Crosby and his producer, who have no idea what she is talking about. Nancy boards a bus, headed back home. Crosby's producer, however, says he's been interested in Dan for quite a while, and ends up with an opening on tonight's show after Lew locks the scheduled performers in a closet. Nancy refuses to believe Lew that the gang really is performing on tonight's show, until she spots Dan singing on a TV in a store's window. She races back to New York just in time to join the others on the show.

The parish within the Church of England structure has its roots in the Roman Catholic Church and survived the English Reformation largely untouched. Church of England parishes are currently each within one of 44 dioceses divided between the provinces of Canterbury, with thirty dioceses and York with fourteen. There are around 12,500 Church of England parishes in all. Each parish is administered by a parish priest (also called Vicar or Rector based on historical practices) who may be assisted in pastoral duties by a curate or curates, who are also ordained but not the parish priest. There are wide variations in the size of parishes and church-going populations. A parish priest may have responsibility for one parish or for two or more and some are part of a team ministry. By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial unit but to the people of its community or congregation.  Etymology  From the Greek paroikia, the dwellingplace of the priest, eighth Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus (c.602‚Äì690) applied to the Anglo-Saxon township unit, where it existed, the ecclesiastical term parish. First attested in English late 13th century, the word parish comes from the Old French paroisse, in turn from Latin paroecia,paroecia, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus which is the latinisation of the Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± (paroikia), \\"sojourning in a foreign land\\",œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus itself from œÄŒ¨œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ (paroikos), \\"dwelling beside, stranger, sojourner\\",œÄŒ¨œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus which is a compound of œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨ (para), \\" beside, by, near\\"œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus + Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ (oikos), \\"house\\".Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus History Escomb Church County Durham Saxon c.670-675 The introduction of Christianity and its development under √Üthelberht of Kent (c. 560‚Äì616) required an organisational unit for ecclesiastical administrative purposes. From the Greek paroikia, the dwellingplace of the priest, eighth Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus (c. 602‚Äì690) applied the ecclesiastical term parish to the Anglo-Saxon township format where already in existence. Generally the township and parish coincided but in the North some townships may have been combined and in the South, where populations were bigger, two or more parishes might be made out of one township. Townships not included in a parish were extra-parochial. There may have been much less uniformity than these general guidelines imply. Extended since the 973-975 reign of Edgar (c. 943‚Äì975) the process of parish organisation appears to have been completed during the fifty-year reign of Edward III (1312‚Äì1377). A parish boundary marker commemorating the ancient custom of Beating the bounds In general Church of England parishes owe their origin at first to the establishment of a minster church by a body of clergy. That usually large parish was soon further subdivided into the smaller parishes described above, each associated with an estate church founded by Anglo-Saxon or, later, Norman landowners using the minster foundation template and according to the authority of their nobles.Pounds, N.J.G. (2000) A history of the English parish: the culture of religion from Augustine to Victoria, Cambridge University Press, 593 p., Having provided the land and usually the church building the landowner reserved the right, by ownership of the advowson, to select a parish priest subject to the bishop's approval. One parish may have been situated in different counties or hundreds and in many cases parishes contained in addition to its principal district several outlying portions, usually described as 'detached', intermixed with the lands in other parishes. A present-day parish boundary may even correspond to that of an Anglo-Saxon estate of more than one thousand years ago but is more likely to date from the 17th century when boundaries were rearranged to fit a parish with a landowner's responsibilities and thereby avoiding potential further dispute. Some sparsely populated areas of England were outside any parish, i.e. extra- parochial until the 19th century, though a very few technical exceptions remain (most notably royal peculiars). The term unparished area, used for most urban areas, relates to civil parishes and not ecclesiastical parishes. Parish priest A window commemorating a priest who served his parish for 47 years Each parish should have its own parish priest (who might be termed its vicar or its rector), perhaps supported by one or more curates or deacons - although as a result of ecclesiastical pluralism some parish priests might have held more than one parish living, placing a curate in charge of those where they did not reside. The church property was technically in the ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish. Now, however, it is common for a number of neighbouring parishes to be placed in the charge of a single vicar who takes services at them by rotation, with additional services being provided by lay readers or other non- ordained members of the church community. In the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion, the legal right to appoint or recommend a parish priest is called an advowson, and its possessor is known as a patron. The patron can be an individual (or jointly or by rotation), the Crown, a bishop, a college, a charity or other religious body. Appointment as a parish priest gives the incumbent the privilege of a benefice or living. Appointment by patrons is now governed under the Patronage (Benefices) Rules 1987. In mediaeval times and subsequently, such right of appointment of a priest could be used to influence local opinions but a patron's candidate always had to be approved by the diocesan bishop. An example can be seen in the article on Grendon, Northamptonshire. It was frequently used to promote particular religious views. For example, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick presented many puritan clergy. In the 19th century Charles Simeon established a trust to purchase advowsons and install evangelical priests. Ownership of an advowson now carries little personal advantage, save kudos;Process for appointing a parish priest the right to sell church advowsons was reduced by successive legislation being rendered impossible after 1936 and, subject to local covenants, church patrons traditionally contributed to the church's upkeep. Parish administration The business affairs of the parish were administered by its vestry, an assembly or meeting of parishioners or their representatives to make the necessary decisions. Following the Registration Act of 1836, from 1 July 1837 the Church vestry's civil as distinct from ecclesiastical responsibilities devolved in gradual steps to the purely civil parish and its parish council. The Established Church also began its own administrative reforms. The ecclesiastical parish's remaining business affairs are now administered by the vestry's replacement, its parochial church council, which is partly ex officio and partly elected from the congregation. It is worth noting that a few purely civil parishes had been created between the English Civil War and the wholescale Victorian reforms, but they were few in number: Bedfordshire for example had just one in the county and it was not created until 1810.Central Bedfordshire Council =Parish clerk= The ancient parochial office of clerk went in early times under the Latin name \\"Aquae Bajulus\\", in English \\"Holy Water Bearer\\" since the sprinkling of holy water was recognised as an important duty of this office. He had many other duties as a kind of general assistant to the parish priest; these included participation in church services and accompanying the priest on various occasions. At his induction into office he received the holy water and sprinkler (probably from the Archdeacon). By an injunction of the King's Visitors in 1548 (reign of King Edward VI) the parish clerk's duties were redefined and the custom of holy water sprinkling was abolished. The clerk then began to be an assistant to the churchwardens in collecting money for the benefit of the poor as well as continuing in some of his other functions. Parish clerks were appointed on the nomination of the parish priest and their tenure was regarded as a freehold. By Act 7 & 8 Vict. cap. 59 only the archdeacon or the bishop could remove him from office (in case of misconduct). Sometimes the character and abilities of the tenured parish clerk did not suit the parish priest and he would appoint someone else more to his liking leaving the original parish clerk in a sinecure.Cutts, E. L. (1895) A Dictionary of the Church of England; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; p. 445-46 =Vestry's responsibilities= In the absence of any other authority (which there would be in an incorporated city or town), the vestry, the ecclesiastical parish administrative centre, was the recognised unit of local government, concerned for the spiritual but also the temporal as well as physical welfare of parishioners and its parish amenities, collecting local rates or taxes and taking responsibility for the care of the poor, roads, law enforcement, etc. For example, parishes carried out the duties as legislated by the Poor Law. What follows is a snapshot of the system at a particular point in time: 1835 In 1835 more than 15,600 parishes looked after their own: > * \\"churches and burial grounds, parish cottages and workhouses, their common > lands and endowed charities, their market crosses, pumps, pounds, whipping > posts, stocks, cages, watch houses, weights and scales, clocks and fire > engines. * Or to put it another way: the maintenance of the church and its > services, the keeping of the peace, the repression of vagrancy, the relief > of destitution, the mending of roads, the suppression of nuisances, the > destruction of vermin, the furnishing (billeting) of soldiers and sailors, > even to some extent the enforcement of religious and moral discipline. These > were among the multitudinous duties imposed on the parish and its officers > by the law of the land. * The parishes spent not far short of one-fifth of > the budget of the national government itself.\\"Sidney Webb, Beatrice Potter. > English Local Government from the Revolution to the Municipal corporations. > Publisher: Longmans, Green and Co., 1906 Central government placed its obligations on parishes without specifying how they should be carried out. So no two parishes were organised in the same way, unless by coincidence. Parish boundary stone between the parishes of Grouville and St Clement Channel Islands, (1909) showing the names of the constables The responsible householder found himself bound to serve in succession in the onerous and wholly unpaid public offices of *Churchwarden, *Overseer, *Surveyor of Highways, *Constable; by rotation every man was called upon in church to send his team or go in person to labour for six days on the roads. The whole parish had to turn out, when summoned, to join in the hue and cry after suspected felons such as robbers. This general ability to carry out the sheriff's rights followed a sheriff's posse and were known as the sheriff's posse. The property-less employee escaped the tithes and taxes and received, when destitute, the parish pay. Under the Settlement Act 1662, aka Poor Relief Act, at the discretion of the Overseers of the Poor, he was liable to be sent back to the parish where he was born or otherwise legally settled. However, he could obtain a settlement certificate to enable him to seek work elsewhere. He might thus live in a new parish but without becoming settled by contribution receive no benefits from the new parish; only from his parish of origin. Increasingly from the 17th century, the wealthy classes in town or country could buy exemption from, or commute for money, many of the innumerable personal obligations imposed by the parish, and largely interacted with the vestry therefore only as a taxing authority. The practice of the lord of the manor or his nominee appointing the priest, by virtue of his advowson, diminished markedly after the Tudor period. Civil parish Civil parishes and their governing parish councils evolved as ecclesiastical parishes began to be relieved of what became considered to be civic responsibilities. Their initially coterminous boundaries began to diverge. Poor Law administration did not suit the subdivision of old parishes with population change and as communities and congregations expanded following the Industrial Revolution. Again, it was better for poor law administration districts, civil parishes, to fit county boundaries. Ecclesiastical parishes not always did. So the word parish acquired a secular usage. Since 1895, a parish council elected by the general public or a (civil) parish meeting administers a civil parish and became the level of local government below a district council.

He has been the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi since February 2015. He is also an elected (third consecutive term) MLA from Patparganj constituency. In Government of NCT of Delhi, he holds the portfolios of Education, Higher Education, Technical Education, Finance, Planning, Excise, GST, Vigilance, Services, Tourism, Land & Building, Art, Culture & Language. Previously, he was a cabinet minister in the Government of NCT of Delhi between December 2013 and February 2014. Prior to being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Delhi in December 2013, Sisodia was a social activist and journalist. He is a member of the National Executive Committee of the Aam Aadmi Party, and is also a founding member of the Aam Aadmi Party. Sisodia has written a book Shiksha: My Experiments as an Education Minister, which chronicles the journey of education reforms in Delhi and has received wide acclaim for its practical insights on education transformation. Early life and career Manish Sisodia was born in a Rajput family of Phagauta village in Hapur district of Uttar Pradesh. Born to a father who was a public school teacher, he was enrolled into the government school in his village. Later, he commenced his career as a journalist after completing a diploma in journalism, awarded by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in 1993. Manish Sisodia also worked as radio jockey in FM radio station during his early career. He used to host several programs like \\"Zero Hour\\" for All India Radio in 1996 and then worked for Zee News as a reporter, news producer and news reader between 1997‚Äì2005. Activism Sisodia's association with the Chief Minister of Delhi and AAP's founding chief Arvind Kejriwal goes back to their time together as leaders of the non-profit Parivartan, founded by the latter to take up cases of citizens who struggled to engage with the government without paying hefty bribes to officials. After formally quitting journalism, Sisodia along with Kejriwal founded Kabir, a non-profit that organised public hearings with government officials and people. He was one of the key members of the group that drafted the Right to Information Act. Subsequently, Sisodia became a key participant in the Anna Hazare led India Against Corruption movement of 2011 that sought a Jan Lokpal bill. He was involved in drafting the first version of that proposed legislation and was jailed for his involvement in protests. Political career Manish Sisodia won the 2020 Delhi Vidhan Sabha election by defeating Ravi Negi in Patparganj Constituency Sisodia was one of the key founding members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He became a member of its Political Affairs Committee. He was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the December 2013 Delhi Assembly election, when he defeated Nakul Bhardwaj, a Bharatiya Janata Party candidate, by 11,476 votes in the Patparganj constituency of East Delhi. In the February 2015 Delhi Assembly election, which resulted in a landslide victory for AAP, he was again elected from Patparganj, defeating Vinod Kumar Binny of the Bharatiya Janata Party by over 28,761 votes. In 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, he again defeated Ravinder Singh Negi, a BJP candidate by over 3000 votes. Education reforms When the AAP came to power in Delhi, Sisodia decided to bring in radical reforms to the ailing public education system. One of the first decisions he took as Delhi's Finance Minister in 2015 was to double the funding for the public education program. Every year since then, the Delhi government has allocated a quarter of its total budget to education, making it the highest proportion in the country. One of the most visible hallmarks of these reforms is the reconstructed building infrastructure: modern classrooms equipped with tech-based teaching aids, and also football fields, field hockey turfs, auditoriums and science laboratories. Delhi also has parent-led School Management Committees (School Boards), creating accountability structures within the communities that the school serves. Delhi government has successfully conducted several mega PTMs (Parent Teacher Meetings) which provided a space for the teachers and parents to engage in meaningful conversations for the betterment of students. Under Sisodia's leadership, many interventions have happened inside the classrooms. Advanced teacher training modules that encourage educators to focus on learning outcomes have significantly bridged the learning deficit. Government runs a statewide program, Mission Buniyaad, to improve the foundational learning outcomes of the students. Sisodia has experimented with new age curricula viz Happiness Curriculum and Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum which instill values and skills in the students and prepare them to live a happy, meaningful and productive life. As a result of Sisodia's efforts, Delhi's education system has seen many positive changes. Since 2016, Delhi government schools have performed better than the private schools in 12th board examinations. There was a 20 per cent increase in the number of students between class three and five who can solve arithmetic division problems because of the effective implementation of Mission Buniyaad. Around 8 lakh students attend daily Happiness Classes, while around 7 lakh students are attending Entrepreneurship Classes which are impacting their mindsets and behaviour positively. In 2018, he delivered the keynote address at the Harvard India Conference at the Harvard Kennedy School on the Government's Education and Healthcare reforms. In 2017, he presented the Delhi Education model at the Global Education conference in Moscow, in front of educationists from 70 countries. Economic reforms During Sisodia's tenure as the Finance Minister in Delhi, the government's budget has almost doubled in 5 years - from ‚Çπ31,000 crore in 2014-15 to ‚Çπ60,000 crore in 2019-20[24]. Such an increase was possible due to an increase in the tax base by ending the ‚ÄúRaid Raj‚Äù and plugging leaks. Sisodia has also started one of its kind Outcome Budget, which is one of the most comprehensive in India linking public spending to over 2,200 output indicators and 1,549 outcome indicators across 39 departments. This is considered as a revolutionary step in improving the political accountability of public finance. Political and social views In his budget speech for 2016-17, Sisodia said that the aim of the government is not spending the allocated money, but ensuring that every rupee spent makes a difference in the lives of the people. He has said that elections should be fought on the agendas of education and health and not on caste and religion. At the World Education Conference in Moscow in 2018, Sisodia said that the real contribution to society is the building of a quality education system in the country and the task of education is to equip the students to address present-day challenges, including terrorism, pollution, corruption and gender discrimination. In 2019, he said that students should be enabled to become job providers rather than job seekers. He has also said that India needs an education system which ensures a high minimum quality of education to all its students and not just 5% students who can afford to pay for it.

Built by Robert Mann in 1730 to replace an earlier building, the house and estate passed through the ownership of several members of Mann's family before coming into the Cornwallis family. The house was enlarged to its current size in 1825. The house sits in a prominent location, part way down a south-facing slope which provides excellent views of the grounds and the Weald beyond. Gardens close to the house contain formal walks laid out in 1825 with specimen trees planted then and later. The house is a Grade I listed building and the garden and park is listed Grade II*. Other buildings and structures in the park are also listed. Linton Park is now the corporate headquarters of Camellia plc, an international agricultural company. History From the late 14th century, a house by the name of Capell's Court stood on the site of Linton Park. It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell who held the property from the late 14th century to the mid-15th century. It was then sold to the Baysden family who held it until the late 16th century, when it was sold to Sir Anthony Mayney. Mayney's grandson sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis Wythen. Wythen's daughter, Catherine, inherited the estate and, following her second marriage to Brigadier-General Sir George Jocelyn, the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann. Around 1730, Mann demolished Capell's Court and built the first part of the present house. On his death in 1751, the house passed to his son Edward Mann. Edward Mann died in 1775 without children and the house passed to his brother the diplomat Sir Horace Mann. Sir Horace had taken the name of the estate as his territorial designation when made a baronet in 1755, but was permanently resident in Florence. Sir Horace Mann was a friend and long-time correspondent of Horace Walpole. After a visit to Edward Mann at Linton Park in 1757, Walpole wrote to Sir Horace in Florence that: \\"the house is fine and stands like the citadel of Kent; the whole county is its garden.\\"Letter to Sir Horace Mann, 3 September 1757 - On the death of Sir Horace in 1786, the baronetcy and the house passed to his nephew, Sir Horatio Mann MP, of Boughton Place in nearby Boughton Malherbe. The house, seen from a distance Sir Horatio died in 1814 and the house was inherited by James Cornwallis, Bishop of Lichfield, who was the widowed husband of Mann's older sister, Catherine. Cornwallis became the fourth Earl Cornwallis on the death of his nephew Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis in 1823, but died himself in 1824. The estate passed to his son James, the fifth Earl. On the fifth Earl's death in 1852, the property was inherited by his daughter Julia. In 1862, she married William Amherst, Viscount Holmesdale (later, after her death in 1883, the third Earl Amherst). By 1888, the estate was in the possession of Fiennes Stanley Wykeham Cornwallis MP (created 1st Baron Cornwallis in 1927), grandson of the fifth Earl Cornwallis's other daughter Jemima Isabella Mann. He owned the house until his death in 1935. His first son, Captain Fiennes Wykeham Mann Cornwallis MC, was killed in an IRA ambush near Gort, County Galway in 1921, and so the first baron was succeeded by his second son, Wykeham Stanley Cornwallis. The second baron sold the house in 1937 and it became the property of Olaf Hambro, a member of the Hambro banking family. Following the death of Hambro in 1961, the house was sold to the Daubeny family. The house and its nearest surrounding land were sold to the Freemasons in 1974 and were briefly operated as a school before passing into corporate ownership. Buildings The north side of Linton Park house showing its position on an escarpment and the view beyond Robert Mann's original 1730s house was a two-storey brick building seven bays wide with a break front. This was extended for the fifth Earl Cornwallis in 1825 by Thomas and William Cubitt. The Cubitts' alterations included adding a third storey to the original house and building two-storey wings four bays wide on each side. The house was also refinished with stucco render. Its hipped roof is covered with slates. The entrance to the house is on the north side through a single storey portico. The north fa√ßade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine panes. moulded stucco cornices run above the ground and first floor windows. The east and west fa√ßades are five bays wide with a two-storey projecting bay on the east end and a single-storey projecting bay on the west end. Due to the slope of the site, the south fa√ßade, which overlooks the main part of the grounds, stands on a raised and terraced platform with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the fa√ßade has the same general arrangement as the north fa√ßade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed. Internally, a number of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations including the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail. To the north- east of the house is the estate's former stable building. This was built around the time of the fifth Earl's extension of the house and is aligned on a north-south axis. The building comprises three three-storey gable-fronted pavilions separated by a pair of two-storey wings. The fa√ßades are of brick, with the west fa√ßade painted white and the east unpainted. The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion. Close to the stables is an underground brick-built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel. The ice house dates from 1788. The main house is a Grade I listed building and the stables and the ice house are listed Grade II. Park Formal gardens at Linton Park, 1906 Approached across parkland along a tree-lined drive from a lodge to the north, the house sits in a landscape of approximately of parkland, woodland and farmland part way down a south facing greensand slope overlooking the valley of the River Beult. Although now simplified without the intensive planting used in earlier centuries, elements remain of the formal gardens designed by John Claudius Loudon in 1825 that were previously arranged on the north, south-east, south and west sides of the house. Immediately to the south of the house is a wide long terrace with a stone balustrade. From the centre of this, aligned with the central portico of the house, stone steps descend in three flights over grass covered terraces to an oval lawn around the perimeter of which runs a gravel path and from which paths run to the east and west. In the centre of the lawn is a sundial. A wide lawn to the south-east of the house is ringed by paths and divided by another on a north-south access. This is interrupted by flights of steps and a fountain pond. Two small temples are positioned amongst trees part way down the slope. To the west of the house Loudon laid out a flower garden. Later in the 1860s this was replanted with roses, but it is now lawns. At the south end of a walkway through this section of the garden is a water and rock garden known as \\"Jacobs Well\\". From the north end of the walk an avenue of giant sequoias planted in 1864 runs north-west towards the parish church of St Nicholas. Other Giant Sequoia are planted around the gardens. Close to the church, at the end of a paved walk is a small Gothic folly designed by Richard Bentley. South of the avenue is a grass amphitheatre cut into the slope. The southern perimeter of the formal garden is formed by a Ha- Ha. To the south, beyond the formal gardens, the steepness of the slope reduces and the estate continues as open parkland with a tree-fringed lake about south of the house. The gardens and parkland are listed Grade II*, with a number of features in the garden also individually listed for their group value with the house and park. The north lodge, the steps to the south of the house, the sundial on the oval lawn and the folly are all listed Grade II. The estate is private property and is not open to the public, but the Greensand Way long distance walk crosses the parkland east-west to the north of the house and a public footpath crosses the southern parkland close to the lake on a similar alignment.

Located from Pune, the temple is \\"one of the larger and more famous\\" of the Ashtavinayaka, the eight revered shrines of Ganesha in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The temple lore describes how Ganesha retrieved the wish-giving jewel Chintamani for his devotee, the sage Kapila from the greedy king Gana and how he pacifies the uneasy mind of the god Brahma, who meditated on him in Theur. The temple is associated with the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi (dated between 13th to 17th century). Though the temple is believed to have existed since antiquity, the current structure of the temple was built by him or his descendant. The Chintamani Temple was also a spiritual magnet for the Peshwa rulers, especially Madhavrao I (1745‚Äì1772) who renovated and made additions to the temple structure. Location Theur is located in the Haveli taluka of Pune district, near the confluence of river Bhima and the conjoint river Mula-Mutha. Religious significance Though Theur is prescribed to the fifth temple to be visited in the Ashtavinayak circuit, pilgrims often visit Theur second in the circuit after Morgaon, as it is a more convenient route. The Mudgala Purana narrates: Gana or Guna or Ganasura was the son of king Abhijit and his wife Gunavati. A strong, but greedy and hot-headed warrior king, Gana pleases the god Shiva ‚Äì Ganesha's father with his worship. Shiva grants Gana the kingship of the three worlds ‚Äì heaven, earth and underworld and decreed that Gana could not be killed by anything that possessed any of the three gunas. Once, Gana and his entire arrives at the hermitage of the sage Kapila, who owned the wish-granting jewel Chintamani. Kapila serves the prince and his army with delicious food created with the help of the jewel. The greedy prince desires to acquire the jewel, however the sage refuses. However, Gana seizes it from the sage. Kapila, a devotee of Ganesha, prays to Ganesha to retrieve the gem. Ganesha with his army appears in Gana's dream; one of his soldiers cuts Gana's head. Gana wakes up and marches towards Kapila's hermitage with his army, intending to slay the sage. Abhijit tries to dissuade his son and advises him to return Chintamani to the sage, but in vain. Gana starts to destroy the hermitage. Ganesha's shakti (\\"power\\") ‚Äì the goddess Siddhi appears and creates a thousand-armed warrior Laksha, who destroys Gana's army while Ganesha himself beheads the arrogant prince. Ganesha returns the jewel to Kapila, however, the sage chooses to have his Lord instead of the jewel itself. So, Ganesha stays on in Theur with Kapila, taking the name of the jewel Chintamani.Grimes pp. 118‚Äì9 The name Theur originates from the Sanskrit word Sthavar meaning stable. According to another legend, the god Brahma meditated here and his restless mind became sthavar due to Ganesha's blessings. Since Ganesha got rid of Brahma's Chintas (\\"worries\\"), he became known as Chintamani. According to another tale, the god-king Indra worshipped Ganesha here under the Kadamba tree to get rid of the sage Gautama's curse. The place was thus known as Kadamaba-Nagar, the town of Kadamba trees. History Though Theur is believed to a Ganapatya (sect which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being) pilgrimage centre since ancient times, the current temple was built by the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi or his descendant Dharmadhar (Dharanidhar). The exact date of the temple is unknown. Morya Gosavi often visited the temple on his trips between his home town Chinchwad and Morgaon, the foremost of the Ashtavinayaka temples. On every fourth lunar day after the full moon, Morya used to visit the Theur temple. According to a story, as per his guru's orders, Morya performed penance at Theur by observing a strict fast for 42 days, within this period, he is believed to have \\"divine revelations\\". Ganesha is believed to have appeared in the form of a tiger to Morya and granted him siddhi (spiritual powers). The Theur temple along with other Ganapatya centres near Pune, enjoyed royal patronage from the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire during the 18th century. The Peshwas, who worshipped Ganesha as their kuladaivat (\\"family deity\\"), donated in land and/or cash and/or made additions to these Ganesha temples, especially Theur and Morgaon. The Theur temple has been a spiritual magnet of the Peshwas, especially Madhavrao I. Madhavrao, who also renovated the temple, used to visit before engaging in any battle and after a battle to thank for the success in battle. Madhavrao also spent in his last days in the precincts of the temple. In the period of extreme illness that led to his death, Madhavrao tried to please the Lord by performing him a perennial abhisheka of milk. Chimaji Appa, brother and military commander of the Peshwa Baji Rao I, donated a large European bell, which still hangs in the temple. He had acquired it as war booty from the Portuguese after seizing the Vasai Fort. Currently, the temple is under the administration of the Chinchwad Devasthan Trust, which also governs Morgaon and Siddhatek Ashtavinayak temples.As per the official receipt of donation, provided by the Morgaon temple Architecture Described as \\"one of the larger and more famous\\" of the Ashtavinayaka temples, the temple's main gate located to the North is relatively smaller compared to the scale of the temple, however the central icon of Chintamani-Ganesha faces East. The temple has a wooden Sabha-mandapa (assembly hall), which was built by Madhavrao. The hall also has a black stone water fountain in it. Besides the central shrine dedicated to Ganesha, there are number of smaller shrines in the temple complex: Mahadeva (Shiva) temple, Vishnu-Lakshmi temple, Hanuman temple etc. Behind the temple is the Peshwa Wada ‚Äì the Peshwa Palace. Once the residence of Madhavrao, today the day-to-day activities of the temple are carried from this place. Like other Ashtavinyaka icons, the central icon of Ganesha is considered self-manifested and hardly any features are visible except the elephantine head ‚Äì studded with jewel eyes ‚Äì and trunk, which turns to his left. The icon is interpreted to be seated in cross-legged posture. The icon is smeared with sindur like rest of the Ashtavinyaka images. Temple festivals The temple celebrates three main festivals. The Ganesha Prakatostav which corresponds to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The festival is celebrated from the first to the seventh day of the Hindu month of Bhadrapada, where Ganesh Chaturthi is the fourth day. A fair is held on this occasion. The Maghotsav festival is held to commemorate the birthday of Ganesha - Ganesha Jayanti, which falls on the fourth day of the Hindu month of Magha. The temple festival is celebrated from the first to the eighth of the month. A fair is also organized. The Rama-Madhav Punyostav on the eighth day of the Kartik month commemorates the death anniversary of the temple's best known patron, Madhavrao and his wife Ramabai, who performed Sati on his funeral pyre and was burnt with him.

Biography Yadams√ºren was born in Setsen Khan aimag, Outer Mongolia (modern day Dornod aimag) on 25 December 1905 to a family of craftsmen: his grandfather was a woodcarver and his father painted yurts. His uncle Choidasha was a Buddhist monk and Yadams√ºren studied woodblock printing with him at the local monastery from the age of eight to fifteen. Yadams√ºren grew up in a time of upheaval; Mongolia gained independence from Qing China in 1911, and by the communist Mongolian People's Republic, closely aligned with the Soviet Union, had been established. In 1930 Yadams√ºren relocated in Ulan Bator where he initially worked as a typesetter. He then trained as a political commissar at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow (1933‚Äì1937) and worked for the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's Central Committee for a year. Between 1938 and 1942 he studied at the Surikov Art Institute under Sergei Gerasimov and Igor Grabar. Returning to Ulan Bator, Yadams√ºren used the techniques he had learned in Moscow to produce oil paintings in a socialist realist style. His work at this time depicted events in the early history of the Mongolian People's Republic and patriotic figures such as Marshall Choibalsang and S√ºkhbaatar. Yadams√ºren produced over 200 paintings in this style, including First Congress of the MAKHN,MAKHN = Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (, ) Capturing Kyakhta, First Encounter of S√ºkhbaatar's Partisans and the Gamin,Gamin () refers to soldiers of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, from the Chinese word g√©m√¨ng, meaning \\"revolutionary\\". and Portrait of S√ºkhbaatar. He also worked as an art teacher. In the 1950s Yadams√ºren moved away from European oil painting techniques and turned to flat, solid colours in gouache, reminiscent of earlier Buddhist art. He also began to explore a greater diversity of subjects ‚Äì not just revolutionary and patriotic, but figures from Mongolia's earlier history, and scenes from everyday pastoral life. This neotraditional style became known as Mongol zurag and Yadams√ºren is considered one of its pioneers. His 1958 work The Old Fiddler (), depicting an old man holding a morin khuur (horse-head fiddle), is credited with bringing the style to national audience. It remains one of Mongolia's most frequently reproduced paintings. As well as painting, Yadams√ºren was interested in Mongolian folk costume. He worked with Byambyn Rinchen to publish two collections of traditional Mongolian dress in 1961 and 1974. His wife and daughter also made costumes from his designs, and together they outfitted many of the country's leading theatre companies.

Indigenous people are \\"those ethnic groups that were indigenous to a territory prior to being incorporated into a national state, and who are politically and culturally separate from the majority ethnic identity of the state that they are a part of\\". There are internationally recognized definitions of indigenous peoples, such as those of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank. This list is grouped by region, and sub- region. Note that a particular group may warrant listing under more than one region, either because the group is distributed in more than one region (example: Inuit in North America and eastern Russia), or there may be some overlap of the regions themselves (that is, the boundaries of each region are not always clear, and some locations may commonly be associated with more than one region).  Definition  Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, and may consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as coples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.Jose R. Martinez Cobo This historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an extended period reaching into the present of one or more of the following factors: * Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them * Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands * Culture in general, or in specific manifestations (such as religion, living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community, dress, means of livelihood, lifestyle, etc.) * Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the main, preferred, habitual, general or normal language) * Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world * Other relevant factors. * On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.Definition of indigenous peoples  Africa  = African Great Lakes = Hadza people, who are indigenous to the African Great Lakes *Hadza (Hadzabe): Tanzania, Singida region: southeast, south and northwest of Lake Eyashi. *Sandawe: Tanzania, Dodoma region: Kondoa district, between Bubu and Mponde rivers, Singida region. *Pygmy peoples: Twa *Bangweulu Twa: Northern Zambia, Bangweulu Swamps, *Great Lakes Twa: Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo *Kafwe Twa: Southern Zambia, Kafue Flats *Lukanga Twa: Central Zambia, Lukanga Swamp *Nsua: Western Uganda Maasai traditional dance. *Nilo-Saharan speakers Kalenjin: Kenya Maasai: Kenya, Tanzania Samburu: Kenya, Tanzania *Bantu speakers Abagusii: Kenya Kikuyu: Kenya Luhya: Kenya *Bukusu: Kenya, Uganda *Afroasiatic speakers Iraqw: Tanzania Rendille: Kenya = Central Africa = Baka pygmy dancers in the East Province of Cameroon.

The faith of the Druze is a blend of Islam's Ismailism, Judaism, Christianity, Neoplatonism, Pythagoreanism, Gnosticism and Greek philosophy. The foundational text of the faith is the Epistles of Wisdom. Even though they have been a minority for their entire history, they have played a significant role in shaping the history of the Levant. Although the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, Druze are usually not considered Muslims.

The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200‚Äì1000 BC). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture. ... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period.\\" (pp. 6‚Äì7).

War of the Jews 9:2. although a small number of Jews managed to remain over the centuries despite persecution by the various conquerors of the region, including the Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, and the British. Additionally, a substantial number of Jews returned from diaspora during the 19th and 20th centuries (mainly under the Zionist movement), as well as after the modern State of Israel was established in 1948. This was coupled with the revival of Hebrew, the only Canaanite language still spoken today.

Grade I listed, it was built by the actor David Garrick to honour the playwright William Shakespeare, whose plays Garrick performed to great acclaim throughout his career. During his lifetime Garrick used it to house his extensive collection of Shakespearean relics and for entertaining his family and guests. It passed through a succession of owners until coming into public ownership in the 1930s, but it had fallen into serious disrepair by the end of the 20th century. After a campaign supported by distinguished actors and donations from the National Lottery's \\"good causes\\" fund, it was restored in the late 1990s and reopened to the public as a museum and memorial to the life and career of Garrick. It is reputedly the world's only shrine to Shakespeare. Description The temple is an octagonal domed building with a nod to the Pantheon, Rome, constructed in undecorated brick with a single east-facing entrance. It was built in the Classical style popularised by the Italian architect Palladio with an Ionic portico, four columns wide by three deep, flanking the entrance. Several steps lead up to the portico. Inside, glazed arched windows reaching to the ground face the river. A deep curved recess in the west wall provides room for a statue. Outside, a lawn and garden provide views over the Thames to the south. History =Construction= Garrick's Temple in its riverside setting Garrick built the temple on land adjoining a villa that he had bought in October 1754 to serve as a country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 lanterns, to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house. At some point in 1755 he decided to build a summer-house by the riverside which he intended to dedicate to his muse Shakespeare as a \\"temple\\" to the playwright. The temple's architect is unknown as his decision to build it is not recorded in his own papers. Robert Adam and Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown have both been suggested as possibilities. An \\"Ionic Temple\\" of similar design stands in the gardens of Chiswick House a few miles away. This may well have been the inspiration for Garrick's Temple, as Garrick had spent his honeymoon at Chiswick House a few years earlier in the company of his wife's guardians the Burlingtons. On 4 August 1755, his neighbour and friend Horace Walpole wrote to a correspondent: \\"I have contracted a sort of intimacy with Garrick, who is my neighbour. He affects to study my taste; I lay it all upon you ‚Äì he admires you. He is building a graceful temple to Shakespeare: I offered him this motto: Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo tuum est [If I inspire and give pleasure, it is because of you].\\" A year later, Walpole wrote in another letter: The garden in front of the temple was laid out in accordance with Garrick's friend William Hogarth's theory of the Line of Beauty. An S-shaped path ran between flowering shrubs in accordance with the theory's preference for serpentine shapes. Walpole donated a grove of Italian cypresses to plant in the garden. It was widely admired in its time and its idyllic prospect so moved Samuel Johnson that he told Garrick: \\"Ah, David, it is the leaving of such places that makes a deathbed so terrible.\\" =Contents= Adrien Carpentiers's portrait of the sculptor Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac depicts him with a model of the statue of Shakespeare for Garrick's temple. The temple's interior was furnished as a shrine to Shakespeare. It was dominated by a statue of the playwright commissioned by Garrick from the French Huguenot sculptor Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac at a cost of 300 guineas (¬£315, equivalent to approximately ¬£32,000 now). Roubiliac chose to model the statue on the Chandos portrait of Shakespeare while Garrick himself is said to have posed for the sculpture. Its appearance is rather more reminiscent of Garrick than Shakespeare; it is said that the actor struck a pose and exclaimed, \\"Lo, the Bard of Avon!\\" to illustrate how he wanted Shakespeare to be portrayed. The statue's head was not to Garrick's satisfaction, and Roubiliac had to replace it with another, carved from a different type of marble. During Garrick's lifetime the statue was displayed in the temple. On his death it was willed to the British Museum, where it is still on display in the King's Library. A copy of the statue, donated by the museum, is currently displayed in the temple. Garrick exhibited his collection of Shakespeare relics in the temple, including a chair made from a mulberry tree which had supposedly been planted by Shakespeare in the grounds of New Place, his house at Stratford upon Avon. The chair was designed by Hogarth, according to Walpole, and had a medal of Shakespeare carved into its backrest. The chair survives and is today owned by the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. Other items on display included various personal effects of Shakespeare such as \\"an old leather glove, with pointed fingers and blackened metal embroidery\\", a dagger and \\"a signet ring with W.S. on it.\\" The collection was sold and dispersed on the death of Garrick's widow; he had collected so much Shakespearean memorabilia that it took ten days to auction it all. =Usage= Roubiliac's statue of Shakespeare, for which Garrick himself was the model Garrick employed the temple not just as a museum but as a working building. As well as using it as a quiet place to learn his lines and write letters, the actor used it to entertain his wife and guests for afternoon tea and dinner. The painter Johann Zoffany, a prot√©g√© of Garrick, painted a number of scenes of the actor, his wife and their friends on the lawn and in front of the temple. One of his guests, the letter-writer Mrs Delany, described the scene at one such entertainment in a letter of 1770: His visitors were encouraged to pay homage to the Bard by writing verses in Shakespeare's honour and placing them at the foot of the statue. Garrick had the best of them published anonymously in the London journals. Some found this practice cloying; Samuel Foote commented sarcastically that Garrick had \\"dedicated a temple to a certain divinity... before whose shrine frequent libations are made, and on whose alter the fat of venison, a viand grateful to this deity, is seen often to smoke.\\" Voltaire, too, used the temple as a subject of ridicule in a letter to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise published in 1776. Some of Garrick's contemporaries suspected that, as a rumour had it, the temple was not merely intended for Shakespeare's glorification but for Garrick's own. It was seen as an effort to associate the actor indelibly with the playwright, or even equating the two. In August 1774, the temple and gardens were the centrepiece of Garrick's elaborate silver jubilee celebrations to celebrate 25 years of marriage. The London Chronicle reported: Garrick also opened the temple and garden to the public on special occasions. Each May Day, seated on the chair noted by Mrs Delany and accompanied by his wife, he would give the poor children of Hampton money and cakes. A woman who attended one such May Day event later recalled: \\"When I was called up, I took my six [children] into the Temple, where Mr Garrick was sitting by the fine bust with great cakes before him; he took down all their names, and then gave a shilling and a piece of plum-cake to every individual one; not even leaving out poor babes in their mothers' arms.\\" =Preservation and restoration= Garrick's Villa and Temple in 1815 The temple and villa remained in the hands of Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple House could be demolished. The lawn and temple were subsequently opened to the public. They have remained in public ownership ever since. During the Second World War the temple was used as a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a conservation area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of ¬£37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours. By the 1990s the temple's condition had deteriorated again and it had suffered heavy vandalism. The Richmond and Twickenham Times reported in 1994 that it was in a state of \\"dangerous disrepair\\" and had suffered from \\"the theft of lead from the roof and graffiti spray-painted on the walls of the Georgian folly.\\" Vandals had also hacked away one of the wooden columns supporting the portico. In 1995 a campaign was launched to restore the temple and the garden and put them back into use for cultural purposes. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided ¬£70,000 in 1998‚Äì99. Other local groups and a campaign led by the actor Sir John Gielgud provided additional funding to carry out restoration work. The restoration fund was also supported by the actors Sir Peter Hall, Sir Donald Sinden and Richard Briers, and Dame Judi Dench, Jeremy Irons and others have subsequently made donations. The restoration work was undertaken by Donald Insall Associates. The temple was reopened to the public in late 1998, and in early 1999 the garden was replanted to replicate its original Georgian appearance. The British Museum provided a copy of Roubiliac's statue of Shakespeare to occupy the vacant niche where the original had once stood. The temple was populated with an exhibition on Garrick's life and career, including copies of portraits by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany. The project was completed by April 1999. Today the temple is managed by Garrick's Temple Partnership, which brings together the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare Trust, the Temple Trust, the Thames Landscape Strategy and Hampton Riverside Trust. The Garrick's Temple to Shakespeare Trust is chaired by the actor Clive Francis, and Liz Crowther is a member of the Temple Management Committee. The temple is open to the public on Sunday afternoons between April and September. It is used for concerts, annual general meetings and private events, and runs an educational programme for local schoolchildren in conjunction with the nearby Orleans House.

Riantiarno; born 6 June 1949 in Cirebon) is an Indonesian actor, director, and playwright. Beginning his acting while in high school, he studied under Teguh Karya, acting in several movies and plays, until eventually establishing his own theatre troupe, Teater Koma, in 1977. His works, with their highly political messages, were often censored by Suharto's New Order government. In 1998 he won the SEA Write Award for his play Semar Gugat. Biography Riantiarno was a twin born in Cirebon, West Java on 6 June 1949 to M. Albertus Sumardi, a railway employee, and Agnes Artini; his twin brother was named Pujo Purnomo. He attended State Elementary School IV from 1955 to 1961, followed by State Junior High School II from 1961 to 1964. He then studied at State Senior High School I and II; during this time, he joined the Tunas Tanah Air troupe and read poetry at the local RRI station. After graduating from high school, Riantiarno left for Jakarta to attend the Indonesian National Theatre Academy (Akademi Teater Nasional Indonesia). At the academy, he studied Constantin Stanislavski's theories on realism and took an unregistered course under Teguh Karya. After the course was banned, he assisted Karya in the founding of the troupe Teater Popular, where he continued to practice acting under Karya's leadership. He also took up playwrighting and directing during his time. While working with Karya, Riantiarno performed in several plays and films. His credits with Teater Popular include Shakespeare's Macbeth, Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, Karel ƒåapek's The White Disease, and his own Doa Natal (Christmas Prayer). Riantiarno also acted in several of Karya's films, including Cinta Pertama (First Love) and Kawin Lari (Elope). In 1971, he began studying at the Driarkara School of Philosophy, and in 1975 left Teater Populer to travel throughout the archipelago and see various forms of traditional Indonesian theatre and other forms of folk art, including wayang and ketoprak. Finishing his travels, Riantiarno founded Teater Koma on 1 March 1977, with Rumah Kertas (Paper House) being its first production. The title of the troupe was drawn from Riantiarno's belief that \\"theater is a journey without periods but filled with commas\\". After taking a six-month hiatus to study at the International Writing Program in Iowa City, Iowa, in 1978, his troupe produced the well-received Maaf, Maaf, Maaf (Sorry, Sorry, Sorry). Another play, JJ, followed in 1979. During this period, the New Order government banned plays with \\"dissident\\" themes, often picking playwrights and writers deemed potential dissidents up for questioning arbitrarily. Riantiarno himself experienced repression several times, with his 1985 play Opera Kecoa (Cockroach Opera, depicting prostitutes, transsexuals, and corrupt officials) causing all of his subsequent plays to require explicit permission from the government before being performed. The performance of barongsai was forbidden Another of his plays, 1988's Sampek Engtay (based on the Chinese legend Butterfly Lovers), ran afoul of the New Order's discriminatory practices. Due to numerous pieces of legislation limiting Chinese Indonesian culture, the use of Chinese symbols was forbidden, as was the traditional barongsai (lion dance). Two years later Riantiarno was interrogated in response to his play Suksesi (Succession), which touched on themes of nepotism. In 1995, Riantiarno wrote Semar Gugat (Semar Accuses), using characters, such as Semar, from Javanese wayang. He received a SEA Write Award in 1998 for the work. After the fall of Suharto in 1998, Riantiarno's plays continued to contain political messages. Opera Sembelit (The Constipation Opera) dealt with \\"overbloated leadership\\", while Republik Bagong (Bagong's Republic) is a satire of inept leadership and an overabundance of political parties set in a wayang context.

The film won five awards, including three Emmy Awards. The story is set at Folsom Prison, where the movie was filmed on location in the prison itself amongst the prison population. Plot Larry Murphy was convicted of first degree murder and is serving a life term in Folsom Prison for shooting his father, which he feels was justified because his father was raping his stepsister. In prison he is nicknamed \\"Lickety Split\\" by the other inmates, but remains a loner who has only one person he calls a friend: a black inmate named Stiles. The film centers around his obsession for running around the prison yard. Larry has no idea how fast he is actually running until the prison psychologist (Geoffrey Lewis) has the prison sports writer time him. Once the warden (Billy Green Bush) finds out just how fast Murphy is, he has the state track and field coach (Ed Lauter) bring up a couple of his distance runners to run against Murphy. Murphy beats them and ultimately allows the track coach to train him in anticipation of the upcoming olympic trials. Before that can happen however, a new track has to be built to proper specs in the yard for Murphy to run on so he can register an official time to be eligible to compete at the olympic trials. The Warden asks the inmates to volunteer to build the new track. Stiles manages to swing a deal with the head of the white gang, Dr. D, (Brian Dennehy), to get a conjugal visit with his wife three months early so he can see his new baby. Instead of Stiles' wife showing up, one of Dr. D's drug \\"mules\\" is put in her place so that Stiles can bring in some drugs. Stiles refuses to participate and goes back to his cell resulting in the \\"mule\\" getting arrested. Stiles tells Murphy what happened and Murphy convinces Stiles to go into isolation. Stiles is killed after the prisoners are let out however. The conflicts continue with Murphy and the white gang, and the black gang and as a result, the white gang boycotts the building of the track and forms a picket line that the other gangs refuse to cross. As the story continues, the truth unfolds and a gang fight ensues as the blacks and the Hispanics challenge the validity of the picket line. The track is built and Murphy clocks a qualifying time while beating Frank Davies (considered to be one of the fastest milers in the U.S.) to be able to compete in the Olympic trials. Murphy is then called before the U.S Olympic board where it is learned that it was never the board's intention to let a convicted murderer compete at the Olympic trials. Murphy is antagonized by the board member to try to find out if Murphy is sorry for what he did to his father. In a fit of anger, Murphy admits he would \\"blow him away\\" all over again given the same set of circumstances. With his shot at the Olympics over, life at Folsom Prison returns to normal. Murphy hears that Frank Davies qualifies for the Olympics with an exceptional time. He then goes to his cell and grabs the stopwatch (given to him by Dr. Janowski) and his spikes. Murphy sets himself up on the start line with the obvious intention of seeing how he would have done had he raced against Davies. Murphy races as hard as he can while grabbing the attention of the prison inmates once more. As he crosses the finish line, a group of inmates are waiting with huge anticipation as to how Murphy did. An inmate grabs the stopwatch and yells out that Murphy beat Davies time at which point Murphy throws the stopwatch against the prison wall, smashing it to pieces. Cast * Peter Strauss ...

Warden Earl Gulliver * Ed Lauter ... Jerry Beloit * Burton Gilliam ... Jimmy-Jack Development The film originated as a story by Patrick Nolan. According to Peter Strauss, Nolan was \\"an English professor\\" and the story \\"sat on the shelf until I expressed a desire to ABC to do something totally contrary to what I had played in previous roles. Young Michael Mann from Chicago was brought in to write the script.\\" Mann had been wanting to direct a TV movie for ABC, and originally his project was to be Swan Song (ultimately directed by Jerry London\\"Swan Song (1980)\\", IMDb accessed 25 Sep 2016), but that was delayed due to an injury on the part of lead actor David Soul.\\"The Jericho Mile\\" by J. D. LaFrance, Radiator Heaven 03 April 2015 accessed 25 Sep 2016 Michael Mann had been hired by Dustin Hoffman to do a rewrite on the film Straight Time (1978). This was based on a novel by Eddie Bunker, and as part of his research, Mann spent a lot of time with Bunker and visited Folsom Prison. Mann later recalled: > I thought that it'd be a downtrodden prison population with kind of a > forceful population of prison guards controlling convicts. And it was the > exact inverse. All the guards looked like ‚Äî there used to be these ads in > the back of magazines for Charles Atlas: \\"You can build up your body if you > buy this elastic rubber band thing.\\" These guys all looked like the before > [picture]... And the prison population guys who were working out were > aggressive. You could tell they were very self-possessed. [They] found any > way they could of expressing their individuality in terms of wearing shorts > or basically a lot of hip-hop wardrobe was observable in the early '70s in > prison systems. Mann became fascinated by life inside the prison, which was he says was run by three gangs: the Black Guerrilla Family, Bluebirds (later the Aryan Brotherhood) and the Mexican Mafia. \\"It was as if the whole of our body politic, our culture, our society had all been compressed and into a geographically compressed space,\\" he says. \\"Almost like a lab experiment. A bad lab experiment. And so all the dynamics that were outside were inside on steroids.\\" Michael Mann recalled in another interview: > I walked by one cell one day in one of the cell blocks and there were these > pictures on the wall of a man and his wife having sex on a conjugal visit. > There was the birth of their child, in bad black-and-white photographs, and > it just rocked me. Because I knew enough to know that this guy was doing the > hardest kind of time. And the hardest kind of time is when you really are in > tune with the world that you are excluded from. Every minute, every hour, > every day. And that‚Äôs also a form of‚Äìthat is the reality. And this guy was > escaping it not at all. And that was very poignant, and that became the idea > for the character Stiles [played by Richard Lawson], who gets killed part of > the way through, that he didn‚Äôt have Playboy centerfolds in his cell. He had > real pictures of the real life that he wasn‚Äôt part of. And Murphy was an > authentic character who starts to have expectations. And if you have > expectations, now you‚Äôre approaching, your head‚Äôs approaching where Lawson > is, as his expectations are destroyed, because he can‚Äôt race outside. The > ending of the film is really kind of a counterpoint. He runs and wins the > fastest time, so there‚Äôs a triumph, and at one and the same time, he‚Äôs lost > his soul. Strauss says he \\"was so impressed\\" by Mann's script \\"I asked if he could direct it.\\" He ran 70 miles a week to prepare for the role. Strauss' fee for an ABC movie around this time was $200,000 a movie. Production Mann secured permission to shoot in the prison itself. He recalls: > We were told by the warden that there'd be individual stabbings, and that > happens routinely. But if there was a gang war or a race war, they'd throw > us out and we couldn‚Äôt finish shooting. And we had 28 convicts in major > roles in the picture. So I wanted to organize it in a way so that this > wouldn't happen. So through Eddie Bunker, I was able to talk to people who > ran M.A., the Black Guerrilla Family and also the Hells Angels. And Taft- > Hartleyed about eight or nine of each group's guys to be actors in the film. > And the deal I made with them, the quid pro quo, was that there can't be a > gang war and there can't be a race war while we're in here. And so there > still was violence around us. I thought that the actors would be terrified. > I thought the crew would be OK, but the actors would be intimidated. It was > just the other way around. The actors just kind of integrated with whoever > they were playing. Among the cast was a former convict turned playwright called Miguel Pinero, who Mann says was popular with the inmates. \\"Here was Peter Strauss, a big star from Rich Man, Poor Man ‚Äî but Pinero was the guy everyone wanted to meet,\\" says the director. \\"Prisoners would bring him glasses of water with a napkin wrapped around it, so his fingers didn‚Äôt get wet‚Äîthese small gestures of respect were their form of courtesy.\\" Strauss enjoyed working with Mann: > I just adore him. He is one of the finest directors I have ever worked with. > If he asked me to do something that was the pits for me, I'd do it. Let's > see... what would be the pits... Three's Company, I would do that for him. > The Jericho Mile is not a film about prison or prison reform. There are no > rape scenes in the shower, no banging of cups on dining room tables. It's a > study of a human being who is at the lowest point of our social structure... > to care about him... to find ways to create in him hope and expectation. > It's one of the most extraordinary films I have ever made for TV. Reception The Christian Science Monitor called it \\"a minor TV classic.\\" The Los Angeles Times said it \\"has such scope, energy and potential, it should have been a theatrical feature.\\" The New York Times praised its \\"outstanding performances.\\" The movie was the seventh-highest rating show of the week (the six higher ones were all regular series).

It is the type species of the genus Caulerpa, the type location being Alexandria, Egypt.AlgaeBase Retrieved August 18, 2011. It grows rapidly and forms a dense mass of vegetation on shallow sandy areas of the sea. Description Caulerpa prolifera A plant of C. prolifera consists of a number of blades or laminae linked by underground stolons which are fixed to the sandy substrate by rhizoids.Morphological Diversity within the Algae Retrieved August 18, 2011. The blades contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis though the green colour is somewhat masked by other pigments. Like other members of the order Bryopsidales, each C. prolifera plant is an individual organism consisting of a giant single cell with multiple nuclei. Chloroplasts are free to move from one part of the organism to another as a response to the level of light at any point and there is a network of fibrous proteins that facilitates movement of organelles.The Cell Biology of the Bryopsidales Retrieved August 18, 2011. Even when derived from the same source, individual plants of C. prolifera show great variability of form and it has been shown that this is in part related to the level of light. In bright locations, plants are compact, highly branched and dense, while in shady locations, populations typically have blades that are longer and thinner and can more efficiently make use of the limited light available.Morphological Plasticity of Caulerpa prolifera (Caulerpales, Chlorophyta) in Relation to Growth Form in a Coral Reef Lagoon Retrieved August 18, 2011. Two distinct forms of the alga are recognised, Caulerpa prolifera f. obovata (J.Agardh) and Caulerpa prolifera f. zosterifolia (B√∏rgesen). Distribution C. prolifera occurs in shallow European waters, the Mediterranean Sea and the warm eastern Atlantic Ocean and also the eastern seaboard of the United States, Mexico and Brazil, as well as certain other scattered locations. Biology Caulerpa spp help consolidate the seabed and enable seagrasses to colonize the area. C. prolifera grows rapidly with growth taking place at night at the tips of blades and stolons. At dawn, the new tips are white, but during the day chloroplasts move into the newly available space. If parts of the plant become covered in sediment, chloroplasts can be withdrawn and moved to more productive parts.Cytoplasmic organization and rhythmic streaming in growing blades of Caulerpa prolifera Retrieved August 18, 2011. Under normal conditions, asexual reproduction occurs by fragmentation of the plant. Pieces of tissue only a few millimetres across are capable of growing into new plants.Ceccherelli, G., L. Piazzi., 2001. Dispersal of Caulerpa racemosa fragments in the Mediterranean: lack of detachment time effect on Establishment. Bot. Mar. 44, 209-213. Less usually, C. prolifera may undergo sexual reproduction by holocarpy. This may occur under conditions of stress with the entire cytoplasm undergoing gametogenesis and the original organism being left as a husk. Such conditions occurred in 2005 after the passage of Hurricane Wilma over a lagoon in the Caribbean Sea. On that occasion, there was a synchronous spawning of C. prolifera and many other siphonous green algae. Besides turbulent water movement, the hurricane caused the sea temperature to drop from 29 to 19 ¬∞C in a few hours. This thermal anomaly seems to have triggered the mass spawning.Unusual synchronous spawning by green algae (Bryopsidales), after the passage of Hurricane Wilma (2005) Retrieved August 20, 2011.

It is accessed via the A48 road between Cardiff and St. Nicholas at the top of \\"The Tumble\\" hill leading up from Culverhouse Cross and Coedarhydyglyn Lane which leads to Drope to the north. The estate lies between the villages of St Georges-super-Ely (to the northwest) and Downs (to the south) just inside the boundary of the Vale of Glamorgan. History Set in extensive gardens, the house, made of stone with stuccoed elevations and stone plinth, was built in 1820 for Llewelyn Traherne (1766‚Äì1841), replacing an earlier 18th century building, Old Coedarhydyglyn, which lay on the high ridge to the southwest to the east of the present walled garden. The earlier house had been built in 1767 and was owned by John Llewellin, who married Edmund Traherne of Castellau's sister. When John died in 1786, the estate was inherited by Llewelyn Traherne, the son of his sister (who had married Edmund Traherne), and Coedarhydyglyn became the principal seat of the Traherne family. The old house was demolished in 1823, although parts remain. The replacement building was said to be \\"in the style of Edward Haycock Snr, of Shrewsbury, who designed Clytha House, Monmouthshire\\". Its owner, Reverend John Montgomery Traherne, during the 19th century, was a notable scholar and collector of scientific manuscripts. During the 1880s, Coedarhydyglyn was reportedly a breeding centre for the golden oriole. Sir Cennydd Traherne, born here on 14 December 1910, was a notable owner in the 20th century; he was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan from 1952 to 1974. Architecture Local map The site contains four listed buildings, listed on 13 September 1994. The main house and outer buildings are Grade I listed, the Coach-house and stables are Grade II* listed, and the Gate and Gatepliers beside the South Lodge and the Gate and Gatepliers midway along the drive are Grade II listed. The house and estate are also listed on the Cadw/Icomos Register of Landscapes, Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. The main house is a square, white stuccoed two-storey building. It contains sash windows and \\"a central single- storey green sandstone portico with four unfluted Doric columns\\" at the main entrance. The roof is made of slate, while the eaves are wide and bracketed. Outside the canted central three bays on the west front is a verandah. A fretwork frieze is located at the top of the building. Grounds The property is situated in the centre of a park. Secluded and quiet, the parkland is on rolling ground facing away from the trunk road and contains partially fenced pasture. The highest part of the grounds are in the area of Old Coedarhydyglyn and its walled garden. Below this is a dry valley that has a stream in what is known as the \\"Dell\\" area. The stream is culverted at one point before emerging in a woodland section that, flowing to a pond near the standing house. On the south-west side of the garden is a wooden Japanese tea- house. Other features include a pinetum, terraced garden, as well as a walled kitchen garden. A small court, located on the east side of the property, is partly closed by a rubble wall, while a wall with arched opening is situated on the east side in the area separating the house from the service range. A gravel drive, gravel yard, stable block and coach house are also located on the grounds. A woodland of conifers and rhododendrons were mainly planted in the 1940s and 1950s, possibly by Alfred Parsons and partners. There are single trees, clumped areas, as well as beech tree belts. Other plantings include pines and large sycamore. Oaks and limes are situated along the drive. The property is one of many sites used for the filming of the Doctor Who series. The Cardiff Naturalists Society has an outdoor meeting near the house in the summer months. A neolithic flint axe head was unearthed near Coedarhydyglyn during the ploughing of a field. Cardiff and The Vale Natural Burial Meadow Within the south west corner of the grounds is Cardiff and The Vale Natural Burial Meadow. The natural burial ground is open to the public to visit all year round and offers full interments, the burial of ashes and ashes scattering. Graves are not marked by memorials but their positions are precisely recorded by GPS. The National Grid coordinates for each grave is registered. The meadow occupies high ground and has extensive views over Cardiff and The Vale of Glamorgan, with Castell Coch, St Fagans, the Millennium Stadium, and the Garth mountain. The meadow was nominated for Cemetery of the Year in 2013, awarded by The Good Funeral Awards. The burial meadow is operated by Leedam Natural Heritage, who operate several natural burial grounds across the UK.

Lucas served in the Second Boer War, World War I and the Irish War of Independence, during which he was captured by the Irish Republican Army. Early life Lucas was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, on 1 March 1879. He later attended Marlborough College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career Lucas was commissioned as a second lieutenant into 2nd Battalion, the Royal Berkshire Regiment, on 7 May 1898.Cuthbert Lucas Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives He served with the battalion in South Africa during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902, taking part in operations in the Orange Free State from February to July 1900, in Transvaal from July to November 1900, and later in Cape Colony south of Orange River. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 August 1900, while in South Africa.Hart's Army list, 1903 After the end of the war in June 1902, Lucas and the rest of the 2nd battalion was sent to Egypt, where they arrived on the SS Dominion in November 1902. He later served in the Egyptian Army and Sudan Civil Service. He served in World War I with the British Expeditionary Force and fought at Gallipoli in 1915 where he was promoted to command the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division. He led the brigade during the Battle of the Somme and into 1917 before becoming Commandant of the Machine Gun Corps Training Centre in 1918. He was appointed General Officer Commanding 4th Division in October 1918 during the closing stages of the War. On 30 June 1919, Lucas was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He was made Commander of 17th Infantry Brigade in Ireland, and of Fermoy Barracks, on 30 October 1919, and on 26 June 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, he was captured by the IRA while he was fishing on the Munster Blackwater near Fermoy along with Colonels Tyrell and Danford. After Danford was wounded during an unsuccessful attempt to escape from a moving car the same day, the volunteers freed Tyrell to attend to Danford‚Äôs wounds. Both Colonels were subsequently taken to a military hospital at Fermoy. General Lucas was subsequently held in West Limerick and East Clare. A letter from his wife, announcing the birth of their child, and addressed simply \\"to the IRA\\", was delivered to him and his captors allowed a subsequent exchange of letters between the couple. His letters home remain in the possession of his descendants and were shown on an episode of the BBC Television programme Antiques Roadshow. The IRA moved him to East Limerick from where Lucas escaped four weeks later. It is believed his captors purposely relaxed the guard to allow him to escape rather than be faced with the possibility of executing him. While being transferred from Pallas RIC barracks to Tipperary military barracks in a routine army patrol they were ambushed and Lucas received a slight injury. In 2014 Barbara Scully, a granddaughter of one of the IRA volunteers involved, George Power, published his recollections to his family of the kidnap in the Irish Times. This brought a friendly reply from General Lucas' granddaughter, Ruth Wheeler, in which she stated that General Lucas risked a court martial for stating that during his kidnap and time in captivity he was treated as ‚Äúa gentleman by gentlemen‚Äù and was held by ‚Äúdelightful people\\". Ireland's Defence Forces have published online Bureau of Military History witness statements by the IRA volunteers involved in the kidnap, as well as those who guarded General Lucas while he was held as a prisoner of war. In 2020 Lucas' granddaughter, Ruth Wheeler, and other members of the Lucas family published the letters he wrote and received while in captivity online. Limerick Councillor Emmett O'Brien and other local people in March 2019 announced an intent to re-enact the capture, imprisonment, and release of General Lucas on the anniversary in 2020. Lucas became Assistant Adjutant General at Aldershot Command in 1924 and served with the staff at General Headquarters, British Army of the Rhine from 1927 before he retired to Stevenage in 1932. He died on 7 April 1956 and is buried in Graveley, Hertfordshire. Family He married Joan Holdsworth in October 1917, who died on 6 September 1979 and is also buried in Graveley, Hertfordshire.

Randoph Barnes Marcy, The Prairie Traveler: A Hand-book for Overland Expeditions, Published by Authority of the War Department, (1859) The Itinerary was derived from the report of Lieutenant R. S. Williamson on his topographical survey party in 1853, that was in search of a railroad route through the interior of California. United States War Department, Joseph Henry, Spencer Fullerton Baird, United States Army, Corps of Engineers, Reports of explorations and surveys: to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, Volume 5, A.O.P. Nicholson, Printer, 1856 Southern route to the Goldfields Transportation and commerce to the northern part of California from Southern California prior to 1849 was carried north along the coast via El Camino Real or later diverted to the north, from the San Fernando Mission inland via El Camino Viejo \\"the old road\\", a route over the mountains north of Los Angeles, along the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, turning west across the coast ranges to reach Oakland and San Francisco. During and after 1849, transportation and commerce to the gold mines of the Mother Lode from the south became a northern extension of the Southern Emigrant Trail up the east side of the San Joaquin Valley from the El Camino Viejo. The 49er route from Los Angeles followed El Camino Viejo to San Fernando Mission then northward over the steep Fremont Pass, across the Santa Clarita Valley and up through the San Francisquito Canyon to San Francisquito Pass and north to Elizabeth Lake. From the lake the route was north through the foothills via Willow Springs Canyon, then northwest to Mud Spring where the road divided. From Mud Springs, El Camino Viejo turned west northwest to Cow Springs and west to Portezuela de Castac or Castac Pass (now Tejon Pass). Beyond Castac Pass, El Camino Viejo turned west up what became Cuddy Canyon and Cuddy Valley where it turned down the Arroyo San Emigdio to Rancho San Emidio one of the few settlements in the then trackless and unsettled southern San Joaquin Valley. Another route, not well known or used, diverted north from \\"the old road\\" at Castac Pass to follow La Ca√±ada de las Uvas or Grapevine Canyon down into San Joaquin Valley. The most direct wagon route was directly north from Mud Spring, across the Antelope Valley to Cottonwood Creek, following it up the east slope of the Tehachapi Mountains to cross them at the old Tejon Pass, then descending the west slope to the canyon of Tejon Creek, which the road followed down through Rancho El Tejon into the San Joaquin Valley. This road over the old Tejon Pass was later described it as \\"one of the worst roads he ever saw,\\" by Lieutenant R. S. Williamson who made the survey of the pass for a railroad route through the Tehachapi Mountains. He found a better route further west at La Ca√±ada de las Uvas, the Grapevine Canyon route, where he sent his own wagons . His recommendation would popularize the Grapevine route for later teamsters and emigrants. The old Tejon Pass route was abandoned in favor of the route through Grapevine Canyon and Fort Tejon Pass was shortened taking the name Tejon Pass. Harrison Irving Scott, The Ridge Route: the Long Road to Preservation; California HISTORIAN, www.californiahistorian.com website, accessed November 14, 2011 , \\"The name Tejon formerly belonged to another pass 15 miles further east. Lieutenant Robert Stockton Williamson of the Pacific Railroad surveyed the area in 1853. His party crossed the Tehachapis by \\"one of the worst roads he ever saw.\\" Hearing of a better road further west, he scouted it and found it would be far more practicable for wagons if the bulk of the traffic henceforth went that way. The name Tejon was transferred west to today's \\"Tejon Pass.\\" Once in the San Joaquin Valley the route proceeded north following the eastern foothills of the Sierras, crossing the various creeks and rivers near these eastern foothills of the Sierra's to avoid the marshes in the valley, until they reached the goldfields of the Mother Lode. Also in 1853, a Los Angeles businessman, Henry Clay Wiley installed a windlass atop the Fremont Pass to speed and ease the ascent and descent of the steep Santa Clara Divide, and built a tavern, hotel and stable nearby. In 1854, Wiley sold out to Sanford and Cyrus Lyon and it began to be called Lyon Station. At the same time Phineas Banning obtained the business of supplying Fort Tejon. \\"Tales of Elsmere Canyon\\" by Jerry Reynolds, accessed June 23, 2011 The Castac Pass now became known as the Fort Tejon Pass. In the next few years, settlements and miners camps gradually spread along this route along the Sierra foothills looking for new gold mines. Cattle and horses from Southern California, were driven north along the route and immigrants and teamsters continued to follow it. Ferries began to be established at the various crossing places. Kern River gold rush In 1853, D. B. James and Brigham James made the first discovery of gold at the Kern River in the huge but until then nearly unsettled Mariposa County. With unclaimed placer gold sites becoming more scarce in the Mother Lode region to the north, a stampede to the southern mines followed. Traffic to the south boomed. To make it practical to get the business of supplying the Kern River gold miners from San Pedro, Phineas Banning made a few adjustments to the old road, carving a small cut through the Santa Clara Divide then running eastward before descending down Elsmere Canyon to Lyon Station.Phineas Banning Biography, Historical Society of Southern California website, accessed June 23, 2011 By 1855, Phineas Banning's wagon trains were carrying supplies from Los Angeles via Fort Tejon to Fort Miller (in what is now Fresno County) and for the Kern River gold rush. Phineas Banning & the Alexanders & Other Partnerships Several thousand miners participated in the Kern River Gold Rush but most were disappointed. Over the following seven or eight years other discoveries were made nearby at White River, Keyesville, Owens River, in the Slate Range and in the Coso District that caused other mining booms. These kept the Stockton‚ÄìLos Angeles Road active, connected with two trails cut across the Sierra Nevada mountains over which pack trains carrying supplies were sent to these new mines. A wagon road was also constructed from Visalia through Keyesville and Walker Pass to Owens Valley. By 1858 there were three stamp mills in the Kern River district, several other stamp mills were constructed a few years later to mill the ore of the Coso and Owens River districts and the freighting of supplies to these places became a major business in Los Angeles and Stockton.Eugene L. Menefee and Fred A. Dodge, History of Tulare and Kings Counties, California, Historic Record Company, Los Angeles, California, 1913. In 1858, the southern portion of the road from Los Angeles to Visalia was taken as part of the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail, being used until 1861 when the American Civil War put an end to its use. Commercial use by long haul freight wagons, stagecoaches, and livestock continued until the mid 1870s when the railroad from northern California reached Los Angeles. The route of the Stockton‚ÄìLos Angeles Road The route began at Stockton leaving the city toward the southeast toward the foothills of the Sierras to avoid the marshes called \\"tules\\" and the often flooded lowlands or lakes along the course of the San Joaquin River and the lower reaches of its tributaries. Due to competing ferry crossings and bridges, or the condition of the roads, different roads roughly paralleling the route would be taken. One of these was the old French Camp Road, which was better drained than the Mariposa Road during the rainy season. The route from Stockton crossed San Joaquin County to Dry Creek (now Lone Tree Creek) about two miles north-northeast of modern Escalon then on to the crossings of the Stanislaus River either at Heath & Emory's Ferry up river from modern Oakdale or at Taylor's Ferry Crossing in Oakdale or further down river at Islips Ferry. The route then continued southeast to the Tuolumne River crossings at either Dickinson's Ferry, the principal ferry on the route, near modern Waterford, California or at Davis's Ferry, down the river from Dickinson's Ferry. From Dickinson's Ferry there is mileage data compiled by the Prairie Traveler Itinerary. The route reached the Merced River, upriver from Snelling, after . The three main crossings of the Merced River were located within downstream from Merced Falls, a set of rapids on the Merced River east of Snelling. These ferries were Young's Ferry, Belt's Ferry, (later Murray's Ferry), and Phillips' Ferry. Phillips's Ferry was the place farthest east, upriver, where the Mariposa and Merced County boundary line crossed the Merced River; Murray's was only a short distance below Phillips's; but above Young's. John Outcalt, History of Merced County, California: with a biographical sketch of the leading men and women of the county who have been identified with its growth and development from the early days to the present, Historic Record Company, Los Angeles, 1925, p.99 Here the route had reached the edge of the eastern foothills and now it followed them southward, because such a route was nearer the mines and the river crossings were much easier than in the level plains below, that were more difficult to travel especially in wet weather and during the spring floods. From Phillips' Ferry the route ran from the Merced River to Bear Creek. Then after it came to the crossing of the Mariposa River, were John and \\"Paddy\\" Bennett, kept the Union post office. Another 10.39 miles and the road came to Newton's Crossing on the Chowchilla River or \\"Big Mariposa\\" was reached. This section of road from Phillips Ferry to Newton's Crossing became the boundary line between Merced and Mariposa Counties when Merced County was created from Mariposa County in 1855. Theodore Henry Hittell, The codes and statutes of the State of California, Volume 1, A. L. Bancroft, 1876, p.497 From Newton's Crossing it was to Fresno Crossing on the Fresno River, about twelve miles east of what is now Madera, California. From \\"Fresno Crossing\\" the route continued to the crossing at Cottonwood Creek and beyond in another came to McCray's Ferry and Millerton on the south bank of the San Joaquin River with Fort Miller, midway on the route to Los Angeles. From Fort Miller it was to the Slough of King's River and more to Campbells Crossing on the Upper Kings River, above modern Reedley, California. William Campbell and John Poole operated Poole's Ferry at Campbells Crossing from 1851 to 1857. Smith's Ferry was established by James Smith and his wife, at what is now Reedley in 1855. Smith's was the only ferry boat on the Kings River that could be approached at high water and outlasted other Kings River ferries, being operated by the Smith family until 1874. Smith kept a two-story, 11-room hotel nearby.Poole's Ferry, Smith's Ferry, THE HISTORICAL MARKER DATABASE, accessed September 12, 2011 In 1858, W. W. Hills established Hills Ferry upstream at Poole's Crossing on the King's River at what became Scotsburg.Paul E. Vandor, History of Fresno County, California, with biographical sketches of the leading men and women of the county who have been identified with its growth and development from the early days to the present, Historic Record Company, Los Angeles, 1919, p.98Kings River - Centerville, THE HISTORICAL MARKER DATABASE, accessed September 12, 2011 From Campbells Crossing it was to the crossing at St. John's Creek, the first and northernmost of the creeks of the \\"Four Creeks\\" which was crossed by the wagon-road. These streams were commonly known as the \\"Four Creeks\\" but were distributaries of the Kaweah River that divided itself after emerging from the Sierra's forming a delta before entering Tulare Lake to the west. From St. John's Creek it was only to the Kaweah River, the second and principal one of the \\"Four Creeks.\\" Between these two streams the town of Visalia grew up from its beginning in 1853, located west downstream from the original route of the road. From the Kaweah River River it was to Cameron Creek, the third of the \\"Four Creeks.\\" From Cameron Creek it was only to Deep Creek, fourth and southernmost of the \\"Four Creeks\\". From Deep Creek the Stockton-Los Angeles road ran to the Tule River. From 1854 Peter Goodhue operated an emigrant trail stopping place on the bank of the Tule River until the river changed its course in 1862. It was also the site of the Tule River Stage Station for the Butterfield Overland Mail, from 1858 to 1861. R. Porter Putnam, who ran the place in 1860, later founded Porterville there in 1864. From Tule River the Stockton-Los Angeles route ran to More's Creek (now Deer Creek). The road then ran southeast to Stickneys Ferry on White Creek, (now White River). About southeast of More's Creek midway to White River, Fountain Springs was established before 1855, at the junction of the Stockton‚ÄìLos Angeles Road and the road to the Kern River gold mines. From Stickneys Ferry it was to the Depot Camp and the road crossing of Poso Creek. From the Depot Camp it was to the Kern River crossing at Gordon's Ferry. From Gordon's Ferry it was to the Depot Camp on Tejon Creek. From the Tejon Depot Camp it was up the Grapevine Canyon, to Fort Tejon and on to the summit of the Fort Tejon Pass. From the summit of Fort Tejon Pass it was to the summit of the road in the Coast Range in San Francisquito Pass. From the pass it was down San Francisquito Canyon to the southeast fork of the Santa Clara River and the Rancho San Francisco. From there it was another to the summit of the Lyons Station and Fremont Pass. From the top of Freemont Pass it was of a steep descent to the bottom of the pass, and on to Mission of San Fernando in the valley and another to the Rancho Cahuenga at the crossing of a branch of the Los Angeles River. From the Cahuenga crossing it was another through Cahuenga Pass to Los Angeles. Decline of the road In the 1870s, construction of the railroad through the San Joaquin Valley and to Los Angeles, drew population from the Sierra foothills into the towns along the rail line and replaced long distance hauling of freight and passengers on the road. Diversion of water for irrigation dried up the lowlands of the San Joaquin Valley in the 1880s ending its role as the only passable road in bad weather, and the road fell further into disuse.

Engaging in business there, he became prosperous enough to purchase a lot southeast of the county courthouse after twenty years of life in the city. On this lot he erected three buildings facing the street; they are the front portions of the present rowhouse. The rear two buildings were completed between that time and his 1865 death, upon which event the rowhouse was sold.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vaikuntanathan and his consort Lakshmi as Vaikuntavalli. It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis and is closely associated with Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the Tamil month of Thai is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. Legend Entrance of the temple The legend of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangur. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangur are located.R. 2001, pp. 470-1 The Temple The temple complex has a single prakaram(closed precincts of a temple). The sanctum here is believed to be on par with celestial vaikuntam. It is located in Thirunangur, a small village, 10 km away from Sirkali en route to Thiruvenkadu. The temple tank is located to the north of the temple. The presiding deity is believed to have worshiped by sage Uthankar and King Uparisarvasara.Ayyar 1993, p. 535R. 2001, pp. 570 The presiding deity, Vaikuntanathar (also called Thamaraikannudiyabiran - the one with lotus eyes), his consort and the festival images are housed in the sanctum. The temple has only one shrine. Religious significance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar, Thirumalisai Alvar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. Worship practices and festivals thumb The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Vaikuntanathan and his consort Vaikuntavalli. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. Temple tank outside the main entrance During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai, the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought to the temple from Thiruvali-Thirunagari. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Thai (January‚ÄìFebruary). The highlight of the festival is Garudasevai, an event in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is also brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region which draws thousands of visitors.

The shrine of the consort of Narayana Perumal is located in the second precinct around the sanctum. The image of the presiding deity is sported in the sanctum in standing posture facing east. The temple tank is located opposite to the gopuram. Religious significance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar, Thirumalisai Alvar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. Worship practices and festivals vimanam - structure over the sanctumthumb The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Narayana Perumal and his consort Pundarikavalli. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai, the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought to the temple from Thiruvali-Thirunagari. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Thai (January‚ÄìFebruary). The highlight of the festival is Garudasevai, an event in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is also brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region which draws thousands of visitors.
