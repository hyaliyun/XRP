The game combined elements of flight simulators and RPGs as players earned experience points for combat, earn money and maintain other statuses. Story The game takes place on an alternate Earth in an era resembling the 1940s. Air pirates have taken to the skies and have placed fear into the hearts of others worldwide. The player assumes the role of a nameless, faceless pilot whose parents were murdered by air pirates, motivating the character to join the Air Patrol Association (APA), a squadron of mercenary pilots hired to clear the skies of air pirate activity. Gameplay Freedom Wings features a primarily stylus based interface; players had to maintain speed, altitude, direct the plane and select all options with the stylus (although a manual maneuvering mode was optional). The rest of the plane's functions such as switching targets, firing and viewing radar screen were dependent on the DS buttons. The game forced players to limit their flying time; the longer the player stayed out flying, the more the fuel would deplete, forcing the pilot to head for the nearest friendly airfield to refuel. From headquarters, players could save their game, take off alone or connect the game to wireless multiplayer mode. The players were urged to go to the airport café where they got new information on where larger air pirate targets were located through other characters. One major point in the game was shop where players could spend their money on new parts and equipment, (which varied depending on which airfield the player was on at the time), resulting in better combat and flight performance.

Biography  Natalia Aleksandrovna Gippius was born in 1905 in St. Petersburg in a family with long traditions in the arts. Her aunt was the famous poet Zinaida Gippius, and her other aunt was also a painter, and studied with Ilya Repin. After attending a specialized art school in Perm (1924–1928), Natalia Gippius was admitted in the VKhuTeIn-Polygraphic Institute of Moscow in 1928, and studied under D. Moore, A. Deineka, N. Udaltsova, M. Rodionov and K. Istomin. At the VKhuTeIn she met her future husband, Konstantin Lekomtsev, a very talented portrait painter. After graduating in 1935, she did the typical road- show for a Soviet artist in the 1930s. She travelled around in the Soviet Union, depicting the construction of socialism in Mordovia, Kuban, Altai, and Saransk. She painted female tractor brigades, collective farms and army hospitals, often with a distinct inspiration from the 1920s Avant-garde. In 1937 she becomes a member of the Artists' Union in Moscow. Starting from the 1950s and through the 1970s, she focused on her beloved Moscow, and depicted the old Moscow, the Muscovites and the building of the New Moscow. She becomes then a member of the urban artists' group \\"Moscow through the Windows of a Bus\\", active in Moscow from 1965 to 1985. Her lively temperas with their almost festive perception of life act as a mirror of the times. The Moscow scenes are snapshots taken in an effort to capture a moment of the beauty of city life. Her spontaneous art reveals all that which a passer-by could miss, all that ordinary citizens are often too busy to notice. Gippius' works are genuinely original among her contemporaries, making her art all the more isolated and precious.

Biography He was born on September 27, 1855 in Detroit, Michigan. His mother, Caroline Joy, was an accomplished artist, musician, and gardener. His father, Julius Sterling Morton, a newspaperman and a leader in Nebraska territorial and state politics, was central to the founding of Arbor Day. J. Sterling Morton served as United States Secretary of Agriculture in the second administration (1893–1897) of President Grover Cleveland. In 1880, Morton married Carrie Jane Lake, the daughter of Nebraska Supreme Court Judge George Lake. They had two children, Jean, who married Joseph Cudahy of the Chicago meat packing company, and Sterling, who married Sophia Preston Owsley, a granddaughter of Carter Henry Harrison, a popular mayor of post-Civil War Chicago. Two years after Joy Morton’s first wife died in 1915, he married Margaret Gray, who became a local leader in health care. At 15, Morton began to manage the family farm and estate. He also took a job at the local bank. At age 18, he fell ill with spinal meningitis. Needing physical exercise and an outdoor environment for full recovery, he farmed his own land for two years. Later, he worked for railroads in Omaha, Nebraska, and Aurora, Illinois, before joining a Chicago salt distribution company in 1880. By 1886 he owned the firm, naming it Joy Morton and Company, and branched out into the distribution and processing of agricultural products in Nebraska and Illinois. In 1910 he incorporated his salt firm as the Morton Salt Company. He remained the company's president until 1930, when Daniel Peterkin, Sr. became president while Morton served as chairman of the board until his death in 1934. Brand names Among Morton’s brands are Morton Salt and Argo Starch. Morton also supported the development of the teleprinter and formed the Morkrum company with the inventor Howard Krum. The company was later renamed to Morkrum-Kleinschmidt, then to Teletype Corporation. It was sold to American Telephone & Telegraph Company in 1930 for $30,000,000. Civic duties Morton took an active interest in the future of Chicago, chairing the Chicago Commercial Club’s railway terminal committee for Daniel Burnham's and Edward Bennett’s 1909 Plan of Chicago. Morton also served on the Chicago Plan Commission for 25 years and was a staunch advocate of inland waterway transportation and building air rights. His advocacy of air rights in Chicago helped make possible the construction of buildings above railway lines, such as the Merchandise Mart. Throughout his life, Morton believed that inland waterways were essential to the development of commerce and to the growth of cities. Morton Salt was the last firm to use the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal to transport goods from Chicago to the Quad Cities via the Mississippi River before the United States entered into World War I. Morton Arboretum In 1922, Morton established the Morton Arboretum on of land adjacent to his estate in Lisle, Illinois. Today, the Morton Arboretum has grown to . As Morton began to define the direction his arboretum should take, he sought the advice of Charles Sprague Sargent, the director of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum. They agreed that the Morton Arboretum should exist to display woody plants that grow in temperate zones around the world, to educate the public about them, and to conduct research on their management and preservation. Arbor Lodge After his father's death, he hired the architect Jarvis Hunt to redesign and enlarge Arbor Lodge into a 52-room mansion and used it as his family's summer home. After he began his own arboretum, Morton honored his father by giving Arbor Lodge, the family estate known as the birthplace of Arbor Day, to the State of Nebraska as its first state park. Arbor Lodge is officially known as Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum.

Compensatory growth is a type of regenerative growth that can take place in a number of human organs after the organs are either damaged, removed, or cease to function. Additionally, increased functional demand can also stimulate this growth in tissues and organs. The growth can be a result of increased cell size (compensatory hypertrophy) or an increase in cell division (compensatory hyperplasia) or both. For instance, if one kidney is surgically removed, the cells of other kidney divide at an increased rate. Eventually, the remaining kidney can grow until its mass approaches the combined mass of two kidneys. Along with the kidneys, compensatory growth has also been characterized in a number of other tissues and organs including: * the adrenal glands * the heart * muscles * the liver * the lungs * the pancreas (beta cells and acinar cells) * the mammary gland * the spleen (where bone marrow and lymphatic tissue undergo compensatory hypertrophy and assumes the spleen function during spleen injury) * the testicles * the thyroid gland * The Turbinate's A large number of growth factors and hormones are involved with compensatory growth, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood and probably varies between different organs. Nevertheless, angiogenic growth factors which control the growth of blood vessels are particularly important because blood flow significantly determines the maximum growth of an organ.

The wooden framing is painted black and the panels between the frames are painted white. The style was part of a wider Tudor Revival in 19th-century architecture. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the movement as a \\"Cheshire speciality\\", but states that it was not created in Cheshire and is not confined to the county. The earliest example noted by Pevsner is the Henry VII Lodge in Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire, built in 1811. The other example he gives is the Court House in Worsley, which was built in 1849. The first Cheshire architect to be involved in the movement was T. M. Penson who restored the house at No. 22 Eastgate Street, Chester in 1852 in the black-and-white style. This was followed by his further restorations in Eastgate Street, at Nos. 34–36 in 1856, and No. 26 in 1858. However, Pevsner considers that Penson's works were \\"moderate in size and not very knowledgeable in detail\\". The movement was improved when John Douglas and T. M. Lockwood \\"discovered the medium\\". They were the principal architects of the movement, and they \\"transformed the street frontages of the city with their black and white buildings\\". Major examples of their work are Lockwood's building opposite Chester Cross at No. 1 Bridge Street of 1888 and the terrace of buildings on the east side of St Werburgh Street of 1895–99 by Douglas.

Eugenio Pacelli (future Pope Pius XII) was a nuncio in Munich to Bavaria from 23 April 1917 to 23 June 1920. As there was no nuncio to Prussia or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the German Empire. Pacelli was appointed Nuncio to Germany on 23 June 1920, and his nunciature was moved to Berlin after the completion of a concordat with Bavaria in 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff would stay with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor Robert Leiber and Sister Pascalina Lehnert – housekeeper, friend and adviser to Pacelli for 41 years. Nuncio to Bavaria (1917–1920)=Appointment= Pope Benedict XV appointed Eugenio Pacelli as nuncio to Bavaria on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as titular Bishop of Sardis and immediately elevating him to archbishop in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Pacelli left for Bavaria. =The Vatican Peace Initiative= Eugenio Pacelli at the Imperial Headquarters with the peace proposal of Benedict XV to Emperor Wilhelm II. Once in Munich, he conveyed the papal initiative to end the War to German authorities.Emma Fattorini, Germania e Santa sede, Le Nunziature di Pacelli tra la Grande Guerra e la Republica de Weimar, Societa Editrice il Mulino, Bologna, Italia, 1992, pp. 45–85. He met with King Ludwig III on 29 May and later with Kaiser Wilhelm IIMarchione, 2004, p. 11. and Chancellor Bethmann- Hollweg, who replied positively to the Papal initiative. Pacelli saw “for the first time a real prospect for peace”.Burkhart Schneider, Pio XII. Pace, Opera della Giustizia, Edizione Paolini, Roma, 1984, p. 16. However, Bethmann- Hollweg was forced to resign, and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September. Pacelli was “extraordinarily disappointed and depressed”,Burkhart Schneider, Pio XII. Pace, Opera della Giustizia, Edizione Paolini, Roma, 1984, p. 17. since the German note did not include the concessions promised earlier. For the remainder of the war, he concentrated on Benedict’s humanitarian efforts.Ronald Ryschlak, Hitler the War and the Pope, Genesis Press, Columbus MS, USA, 2000, p. 6. After the war, during the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919, Pacelli was one of the few foreign diplomats to remain in Munich. According to Pascalina Lehnert, who was personally there at the time, Pacelli calmly faced down a small group of Spartacist revolutionaries, who had entered the nunciature by force in order to take his car. Pacelli told them to leave the extraterritorial building, to which they responded, \\"only with your car\\". Pacelli, who had previously ordered to disconnect the starter, permitted the car to be towed away, after he was informed that the Bavarian government had promised to return the vehicle at once.Lehnert, 15–16. Several versions of this incident and alleged later incidents are much more colorful, but, according to the relator in the beatification process in the Vatican, \\"mostly based on imagination\\". Peter Gumpel, conversation 9 October 1994. The popular view may also overlook his cordial relations with socialist politicians like Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann, and his prolonged secret negotiations with the Soviet Union (see below). “Pacelli is simply too intelligent to be irritated by something like this” opined the Bavarian representative at the Vatican.Bayrisches Geheimes Staatsarchiv München, Bayrische Gesandtschaft beim Päpstlichen Stuhl, 1919, Faszikel 967, 139, 167. On the night of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch, Franz Matt, the only member of the Bavarian cabinet not present at the Bürgerbräu Keller, was having dinner with Pacelli and Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber.Schmidt, Lydia. (2000). Kultusminister Franz Matt (1920–1926): Schul-, Kirchen- und Kunstpolitik in Bayern nach dem Umbruch von 1918. CH Beck. . The American diplomat Robert Murphy, then in Munich, writes that \\"all the foreign representatives at Munich, including Nuncio Pacelli, were convinced that Hitler's political career had ended ignominiously in 1924. When I ventured to remind His Holiness of this bit of history (in 1945), he laughed and said: 'I know what you mean – papal infallibility. Don't forget, I was only a monsignor then'.\\"Robert Murphy, Diplomat among Warriors Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y., 1964, p. 205. Nuncio in Berlin (1920–1929) Pacelli meeting with local authorities in 1922. Pacelli's public popularity surpassed that of any German cardinal or bishop by 1929.Nikolaus Junk, Im Kampf Zwischen Zwei Epochen, Mainz 1973, p. 381. Several years after he was appointed Nuncio to Germany on 23 June 1920, and after completion of a concordat with Bavaria, Pacelli resigned as nuncio to Bavaria and was appointed first nuncio to Prussia, keeping in personal union the office of nuncio to Germany.Alberto Vassallo-Torregrossa succeeded Pacelli as nuncio to Bavaria. A nunciature was opened in Berlin and Pacelli moved there in 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff would stay with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor Robert Leiber and Sister Pascalina Lehnert – housekeeper, friend and adviser to Pacelli for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was doyen or Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. There he met notables like Albert Einstein, Adolf von Harnack, Gustav Stresemann, Clemens August Graf von Galen and Konrad Graf von Preysing; the later two he elevated to cardinal in 1946. He worked with the German priest Ludwig Kaas, who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was politically active in the Centre Party.Ludwig Volk, Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933, . While in Germany, he enjoyed working as a pastor. He traveled to all regions, attended Katholikentag (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.They were published by Ludwig Kaas, Eugenio Pacelli, Erster Apostolischer Nuntius beim Deutschen Reich, Gesammelte Reden, Buchverlag Germania, Berlin, 1930. =Negotiations with the Soviet Union (1925–1927)= In post-war Germany, Pacelli worked mainly on clarifying the relations between Church and State (see below). But in the absence of a papal nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education and the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.Hansjakob Stehle, Die Ostpolitik des Vatikans, Piper, München, 1975, p. 139–141. “An enormously sophisticated conversation between two highly intelligent men like Pacelli and Chicherin, who seemed not to dislike each other”, wrote one participant.Hansjakob Stehle, Die Ostpolitik des Vatikans, Piper, München, 1975, p. 132. Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until Pope Pius XI ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. =Pacelli and the Weimar Republic= Pacelli supported the Weimar Coalition with Social Democrats and liberal parties. Although he had cordial relations with representatives of the Centre Party such as Marx and Kaas, he did not involve the Centre in his dealings with the German government.Rudolf Morsey, Eugenio Pacelli als Nuntius in Deutschland, in Herbert Schambeck, Pius XII. Duncker & Humblot, Berlin, p. 131. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the Saar region, supported the appointment of a papal administrator for Danzig and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.Rudolf Morsey, Eugenio Pacelli als Nuntius in Deutschland, in Herbert Schambeck, Pius XII. Duncker & Humblot, Berlin, p. 121. Pacelli was critical of German policy regarding financial reparations, which he considered unimaginative and lacking a sense of reality.Karl Heinz Harbeck, Akten der Reichskanzlei. Das Kabinett Cuno, Boppard, 1968, p. 544. He regretted the return of William, German Crown Prince, from exile as destabilizing. After repeated German acts of sabotage against the French occupation forces in the Ruhr valley in 1923, German media reported a conflict between Pacelli and the German authorities. The Vatican denounced these acts against the French in the Ruhr.Emma Fattorini, Germania e Santa Sede, Le Nunziature di Pacelli tra la Grande Guerra e la Republica de Weimar, Societa Editrice il Mulino, Bologna, Italia, 1992, pp. 265f. When he returned to Rome in 1929, praise was heaped by Catholics and Protestants alike on Pacelli, who by now had become more popular than any German cardinal or bishop, which he had largely excluded from his negotiations and dealings with the German government. Legacy It is commonly argued that Pacelli modeled his own wartime papacy on his observations of the actions of Benedict XV during World War I, due to his personal involvement with the peace entreats to the Triple Alliance powers (countries from which private donations were essential to keeping the Vatican solvent during this period), although there were no similar negotiations with France or England.Phayer, 2008, p. 3.

It is listed as a Scheduled Monument. Location The Victoria County History describes the location of the fort as follows: An earlier description gives more detail: Although the river Wear now touches the site only on one side, the local topography suggests that the site may have been chosen because, at that time, the river enclosed it on three sides, the river having since adopted a more easterly course across its floodplain. Structure Although the entire site has been overgrown with trees for over a century, there are remains of earthworks at the western end. Here, where the land is level, a bank and outer ditch were constructed, enclosing a wedge-shaped area which is 120 metres wide at the western end, narrowing to 50 m at the eastern end, and extending 145 m from east to west. The bank is about 6 m wide and 5 m high. The ditch, which is located rather more than 20 m west of the bank, has a maximum depth of about 2 m. It is not certain where the entrance to the fort was located. It may have been at the northern end, where there is a gap in the ditch, or at the extreme southern end, but the area has been disturbed by landscaping, making interpretation difficult. Only limited excavation has been carried out on the site, but there is some evidence that the interior of the bank was strengthened with a stone wall; the excavation unearthed at least one stone bearing a stonemason's mark, which dates the work to the Middle Ages. Origin of the name The name \\"maiden\\" probably means a \\"fortification that looks impregnable\\" or one that has never been taken in battle.

Early life Atkinson was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, the son of Robert Atkinson and Mary Tabb Mayo Atkinson. He attended Yale University and Hampden-Sydney College, graduating from the latter in 1825.. Upon graduation, he studied under Judge Henry St. George Tucker and practiced law for eight years before turning to theology. In January 1828, he married Josepha Gwinn Wilder, with whom he had three children. Parish ministry Atkinson was ordained deacon by the Rt. Rev. William Meade on November 18, 1836, and ordained priest the following year. As deacon, Atkinson served as assistant minister at Christ Church in Norfolk, Virginia. After his ordination to the priesthood, he became rector of St. Paul's Church in Norfolk. In 1839, he moved to Lynchburg to become rector of St. Paul's Church in that town, remaining there for five years. In 1843, Atkinson moved again, to Maryland, where he became the rector of St. Peter's Church in Baltimore.. In 1843 and 1846, he was elected bishop of Indiana, declining the honor both times. In 1852, he became rector of Grace Church in the same city, a new parish organized, in part, by members of St. Peter's. Bishop of North Carolina Atkinson was elected Bishop of North Carolina on May 28, 1853, following the resignation of Bishop Ives in December the previous year. He was consecrated on October 17, 1853 by Bishops Thomas Church Brownell, Charles Pettit McIlvaine, George Washington Doane, James Hervey Otey, George Trevor Spencer, and John Medley. Atkinson became the 58th bishop in the Episcopal Church. As bishop, Atkinson founded a church school for boys in Raleigh and the Ravenscroft School in Asheville. He urged the religious instruction of slaves. Initially opposing secession, after the American Civil War began, Bishop Atkinson affiliated with the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. After the war, in 1866, Atkinson recommended placing the operation of black Episcopal churches fully in the hands of black clergymen, and the Diocesan Convention passed a series of resolutions doing so. Two years later, he opened the Episcopal school for blacks near Raleigh that eventually became St. Augustine's College. In 1867, he attended the first Lambeth Conference at Lambeth Palace. As his health declined, Atkinson requested the election of an assistant bishop, and Theodore Benedict Lyman was elected to that position in 1873. Atkinson died on January 4, 1881 at his home in Wilmington; he was buried on January 7 within St. James Episcopal Church in Wilmington, North Carolina.

It is stationed at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota operating RQ-4 Global Hawk remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) role. The group was first activated during World War II as the 319th Bombardment Group, the first Martin B-26 Marauder group in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) during the war. The group received two Distinguished Unit Citations during the war. In 1945, the group was re-equipped with the North American B-25 Mitchell in combat in the MTO before returning to the US to transition to the Douglas A-26 Invader. After retraining the group deployed to Okinawa, where it flew combat missions over China as part of Seventh Air Force against Imperial Japanese forces until the war's end. One of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, Deke Slayton, flew A-26s from Okinawa as a part of the group's 438th Bombardment Squadron in 1945. The group was reactivated in the reserve in December 1946. It does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped, and when mobilized in 1951 for the Korean War, its personnel were used to man other units and the group was inactivated. It again became part of the reserve force in 1955 as the 319th Fighter-Bomber Group, but was inactivated in 1957, when the reserves converted to the troop carrier mission. It remained inactive until 1991. In 2019 the group was reactivated at Grand Forks Air Force Base as the Operations Group in charge of all active duty RQ-4 Global Hawk operations. History=World War II= 319th Bomb Group B-26 Marauders taking off en-masse from a desert base in North Africa, 1943 The 319th Bombardment Group trained in Louisiana in Martin B-26 Marauders and after completing initial training, the group reported in October and November 1942 to England for staging to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it was assigned to the Twelfth Air Force. After it moved to Algeria as the first Marauder unit in that theater, arriving with just 15 aircraft and losing group commander Col. Alvord Rutherford over France en route, the 319th entered combat for the first time on 28 November, bombing and strafing warehouses, docks, and railroad yards at Sfax in Tunisia. From then to March 1943, the group bombed German and Italian targets in Tunisia and Libya, including airfields and enemy shipping along the Mediterranean Coast. The 319th trained in French Morocco from March, then returned to combat in June 1943, attacking enemy targets on Italian islands in the Mediterranean, including Sicily, Sardinia, and Pantelleria. From bases in Algeria and Tunisia, the group supported the Allied invasion of Italy, bombing bridges and marshalling yards during the late summer and early autumn of 1943. In November, it moved to Sardinia, to strike Axis targets in central Italy. Early in 1944, the 319th supported Allied ground forces as they advanced in the Cassino and Anzio areas. Later in the year, using North American B-25 Mitchell bombers the group attacked German supply lines in northern Italy, bombing bridges, marshalling yards, and roads. In March, it earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for raids on marshalling yards in Rome and Florence that damaged enemy communications without destroying cultural monuments. For supporting the Allied ground advance in Italy during April, May, and June 1944, the group earned the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. During the summer, it bombed bridges over the Po River in northern Italy using B-25 bombers to block the stream of German supplies and reinforcements going southward. The 319th Bombardment Group supported the invasion of southern France in August 1944 by attacking coastal batteries, radar stations, and bridges. From Corsica, it hit railroad bridges in Northern Italy and late in the year attacked railroad lines through the Brenner Pass that connected Germany and Austria with Italy. In January 1945, the 319th returned to the United States, where it began to train with Douglas A-26 Invader aircraft for operations in the Pacific Ocean Theater. Between May and July 1945, the group moved by ship to Okinawa, and on 16 July flew its first mission against Japan. From then until the end of the fighting in early August, the 319th attacked enemy targets such as airfields and industrial centers on Kyūshū and occupied Shanghai area of China, and shipping around the Ryukyu Islands and in the East China Sea. In November and December 1945, the group returned to the United States. =Air Force reserve=Initial activation and mobilization for the Korean War The group was activated again in the reserve under Air Defense Command (ADC) at Mitchel Field, New York in December 1946, although as a headquarters only, with no squadrons assigned. Its four World War II squadrons had all been allotted to the National Guard,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 541Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 542Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 543–544Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 544–545 and it was not until April 1947 that it was assigned squadrons, the 46th Bombardment Squadron, a newly-constituted unit,The World War II 46th Bombardment Squadron had become the 22d Antisubmarine Squadron and was then disbanded. Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 114–115. and the 50th Bombardment Squadron, which had been disbanded during the war.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 215 The group was filled out in July 1947, when two more disbanded squadrons, the 51st and 59th Bombardment Squadrons, were reconstituted and assigned to the group.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 217Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 232–233 At Mitchel, the group trained under the supervision of the 113th AAF Base Unit (later the 2230 Air Force Reserve Training Center), although it is not clear whether any of its elements were fully manned or equipped during this period. In July 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC. The 319th's stay at Mitchel ended when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949. President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget also required reductions in the number of groups in the Air Force to 49.Knaack, p. 25 and group was replaced as the reserve flying unit at Mitchel by the 84th Fighter Group, a corollary reserve unit integrated with the active duty 52d Fighter Wing.Cantwell, p. 73Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 150–151Ravenstein, pp. 85–86 A-26 Invader in flight The group moved on paper to Reading Municipal Airport, Pennsylvania, where it replaced the 322d Bombardment Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 202–203 Under the new organizational model, it became part of the 319th Bombardment Wing.Ravenstein, pp. 168–169 At Reading the group trained under the supervision of the 2237th Air Force Reserve Training Center. Although the group was assigned four squadrons rather than the three of active duty units, they were manned at 25% of normal strength.Cantwell, p. 74 Runway length at Reading, however, led ConAC to decide to station a troop carrier unit there, and the group was inactivated on 2 October 1949 and its equipment and personnel were transferred to the 512th Troop Carrier Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 20–21 The group activated again about a month later, on 10 October 1949 at Birmingham Municipal Airport, Alabama, where it replaced the 514th Troop Carrier Group. Training at Birmingham was conducted by the 2587th Air Force Reserve Training Center. All reserve combat and corollary units were mobilized for the Korean war,Cantwell, p. 87 and the 319th was called up on 10 March 1951. Its personnel and aircraft were used as fillers for other units,Cantwell, pp. 96, 137 and the group was inactivated on 22 March. Fighter operations F-84s as flown by the group The reserve mobilization for the Korean War had left the reserve without aircraft, and reserve units did not receive aircraft until July 1952.Cantwell, p. 139 The Air Force desired that all reserve units be designed to augment the regular forces in the event of a national emergency. The six reserve pilot training wings, including the 8710th Pilot Training Wing at Memphis Municipal Airport, Tennessee, had no mobilization mission. On 18 May 1955, the 8710th was discontinued and replaced by the 319th Fighter-Bomber Wing.Cantwell, p. 146 The group, redesignated the 319th Fighter-Bomber Group, was activated as the wing's flying headquarters, with the 46th Fighter-Bomber Squadron as its only component. The group flew Republic F-84 Thunderjets until 1957, when it began to receive North American F-86 Sabres. Despite its designation as a fighter bomber group, its mission initially was in the air defense role and it was gained by ADC upon mobilization.'Cantwell, p. 152Cantwell, p. 148 Later the group assumed a tactical fighter role. In 1957, the 50th Fighter-Bomber Squadron was added to the group, although it was located at New Orleans Naval Air Station, under what was termed the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were pressuring the Air Force to provide more wartime airlift. At the same time, about 150 Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars became available from the active force. Consequently, in November 1956 the Air Force directed ConAC to convert three reserve fighter bomber wings to the troop carrier mission by September 1957. In addition, within the Air Staff was a recommendation that the reserve fighter mission given to the Air National Guard and replaced by the troop carrier mission.Cantwell, p. 168 Cuts in the budget in 1957 also led to a reduction in the number of reserve wings from 24 to 15.Cantwell, pp. 168–169 The 319th Fighter-Bomber Wing and its support elements were inactivated on 16 November 1957 in this reduction of reserve wings. Although the 319th Group was also inactivated that day, its place was taken by the 445th Troop Carrier Group. =Reactivation at Grand Forks=Bomber operations B-1 Lancer from the 319th refueling The group was reactivated at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota in on 1 September 1991 as the 319th Operations Group when Strategic Air Command (SAC) implemented the Objective Wing organization for its units. The group was assigned to the 319th Wing and was assigned the 46th Bomb Squadron, flying the Rockwell B-1B Lancer, the 905th Air Refueling Squadron, flying the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and the 319th Operations Support Squadron. Shortly after the group was activated, President George H.W. Bush directed on 28 September that the group no longer keep half of its aircraft on nuclear alert and the group began to focus on training for conventional bombing missions. This became the group's primary mission in February 1993.History of Grand Forks, pp. 9–10 In July 1992, the Air Force reorganized its combat commands. SAC's The bomber mission and the 319th Wing were assigned to Air Combat Command (ACC), while the air refueling mission was assigned to Air Mobility Command (AMC). In this reorganization, the 905th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned from the group, although it remained at Grand Forks. In late February and March 1992, the group set a dozen world time-to-climb records to various altitudes with its Lancer aircraft.History of Grand Forks, p.14 However, the transfer of the air refueling mission required a major realignment of the tanker force and by 1994, the Air Force decided that Grand Forks was to become one of three \\"super tanker\\" bases. On 1 October 1993, the 319th transferred from ACC to AMC. It regained the 905th Air Refueling Squadron, but the 46th Bomb Squadron was transferred to the 319th Bomb Group.History of Grand Forks, p.10The 319th Bomb Group was a new organization, and not related to the 319th Operations Group, despite the similarity of its name to 319th Bombardment Group. Air refueling operations In 1994, the 319th gained the 906th, 911th and 912th Air Refueling Squadrons equipped with KC-135R and KC-135T aircraft. In its first active years, he group deployed aircrews and aircraft to support Operation Provide Comfort, humanitarian relief to Kurds fleeing Iraq to in Turkey; Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no fly zone in southern Iraq; Operation Vigilant Warrior, the deployment of forces to Saudi Arabia to counter threats from Iraq; Operation Deny Flight, enforcing the no-fly zone in Bosnia Herzegovina; Operation Uphold Democracy, the removal of a military junta in Haiti; and Operation Constant Vigil, counter-drug operations based in Panama. Toward the end of 1998 and into 1999, the group deployed resources to the Persian Gulf and Europe in support of Operation Desert Fox, attacks on Iraqi WMD sites for failing to comply with United Nations mandates; and Operation Allied Force, operations in Kosovo against Serbia. During the summer of 2000, the group operated from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida as major repairs were made to the runways at Grand Forks. From MacDill, the 319th continued to deploy for Operations Northern and Southern Watch and also Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia Herzegovina, operating from Istres-Le Tubé Air Base, France. Following the 9/11 attacks, the group stood up a quick reaction alert force to support homeland defense in Operation Noble Eagle, and deployed resources for Operation Enduring Freedom.History of Grand Forks, p.11 The group's deployments included deployments in which it was the primary force provider for expeditionary operations. In those cases, a 319th Air Expeditionary Group was activated as a provisional unit, deployed to a makeshift tent city somewhere in the arid desert of Southwest Asia. From the start of air operations over Afghanistan 7 October, by 2 November 2001 the 319th Air Expeditionary Group ad flown over 150 sorties and more than 1050 hours; pumping over of gas into more than 450 planes. The expeditionary group includes not only operational, but maintenance organizations. Its deployment location was not officially identified, but is likely to have been Masirah Air Base, where the RAF and USAF have long had facilities. The group began to diminish in size in June 2007, when the 911th Air Refueling Squadron inactivated. The 906th Squadron followed on 2 October 2009, and the 912th on 1 October 2010. The group's first refueling squadron, the 905th, was the last operational squadron of the group. The wing frequently deployed elements to Southwest Asia, occasionally being the major force provider for the 319th Air Expeditionary Group. They both inactivated on 31 December 2010, as manned flying operations ended at Grand Forks.Research Division, Air Force Historical Research Agency, Air Force Organization Change Status Report, December 2010, Maxwell AFB, AL Lineage * Established as the 319th Bombardment Group (Medium) on 19 June 1942 : Activated on 26 June 1942 : Redesignated 319th Bombardment Group, Medium on 20 August 1943 : Redesignated 319th Bombardment Group, Light on 3 February 1945 : Inactivated on 18 December 1945 * Activated in the reserve on 27 December 1946 : Inactivated on 2 September 1949 * Activated in the Reserve on 10 October 1949 : Ordered to active duty on 10 March 1951 : Inactivated on 22 March 1951 * Redesignated 319th Fighter-Bomber Group on 12 April 1955 : Activated in the reserve on 18 May 1955Lineage through 1957 in Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 198–199. : Inactivated on 16 November 1957 * Redesignated 319th Bombardment Group, Heavy on 31 July 1985 (remained inactive) * Redesignated 319th Operations Group on 29 August 1991 : Activated on 1 September 1991 : Inactivated on 31 December 2010 =Assignments= * III Bomber Command, 26 June 1942 * Eighth Air Force, September 1942 * XII Bomber Command, November 1942 * 47th Bombardment Wing, attached c.

The first to set foot in the territory of French West Africa that would become Senegal arrived in 1953. The first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly of Senegal was elected in 1966 in Dakar. In 1975 the Baháʼí community elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of Senegal. Baháʼís claimed there are 34 local assemblies in 2003. The most recent estimate, by the Association of Religion Data Archives in a 2005 report estimates the population of Senegalese Baháʼís at 24700.  Early Phase = ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan = ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá mentions Baháʼís traveling \\"…especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" …the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration….\\" = Establishment and growth = During the late colonial period of the region the Baháʼí Faith first arrived. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub- Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s. The first Baháʼís to enter French West Africa came in 1953 and dispersed to several regions - Labib Isfahani was the first Baháʼí to settle in what became Senegal and named a Knight of Baháʼu'lláh. He come from the community of Baháʼís in Egypt. Isfahani's brother Habib came to join him in April 1954. There were over 1000 Baháʼís across North-West Africa which was organized into a regional National Spiritual Assembly including French West Africa in 1956. In 1959 Baháʼí marriage ceremonies were legalized and the first such marriage had Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga in attendance. Growth in the Senegalese community came partly by pioneers and partly from converts. In early 1962 the family of Rouhani Ardekani stayed for six-months in Senegal and in 1966 returned to settle permanently. The first Baháʼí of Senegalese origin converted in March 1962. In 1963 the communities of French West Africa, then included a small group of Baháʼís in Dakar. With the help of Baháʼís originally from Gambia in Dakar the community formed the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Dakar on 21 April 1966. During much of the 1960s-1970s Hermione Vera Keens-Douglas Edwards composed letters for the communities of the former French West Africa for their Nineteen Day Feasts. Additional one well known Baháʼí made an impact in Senegal and beyond - Robert Hayden, who had become a Baháʼí in 1943, was named Poet Laurette of Senegal in 1966 after winning the 1965 first World Festival of Negro Arts festival Grand Prix de la Poesie with over ten thousand people from thirty-seven nations in attendance on April 7, 1962 and went on to further acclaim. In 1975 the Baháʼí community elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of Senegal and by the beginning of 1978 there were 30 local assemblies. The first regional Baháʼí conference of the Casamance region happened in 1979 with participants from Gambia and Senégal in December 1978, and at the end of that year there were 35 assemblies.  Modern community  Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development (SED) beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Representatives of the national assemblies of Gambia, Mauritania and Senegal gathered in 1983 at a regional conference in Dakar along with other Baháʼís and heard talks ranging from opposition to the religion to the role of women in the community. Meanwhile, Baháʼís of Senegal assisted the neighboring community in the Cape Verde Islands with promulgating the religion. In 1983-4 some Baháʼís visiting from Switzerland toured several countries of western Africa - in Senegal they were able to meet with government officials, women's civic groups and were interviewed for local television. In 1984 several activities took place - a Spring school was held, the Baháʼí women's committee held a children's conference, and a regional youth conference was held. In 1985 tutorial schools were opened in two villages. In 1989 a Baháʼí professional traveled the country offering dental care as a service. The community celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2003 and the community has ongoing prayer meetings, Study circles, and classes for children open to the public. There are also SED projects looking at marketable skill development. Baháʼís from Senegal were among those at the regional conference at Abidjan called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008. = Demographics = In 2003 the Baháʼís reported the Baháʼí community of Senegal is composed mainly of Senegalese scattered in about 300 locations across the country of whom the vast majority are native Senegalese. Baháʼís reside in 382 localities in Senegal, and there are 34 local Spiritual Assemblies. Social and economic development projects include classes for young teenagers. In 2001 Operation World estimated the Baha'i population at almost 19,000, growing at over 8% per year. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated the 2005 population of Senegalese Baháʼís at 24,700.

Career  Former student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure , Jean Michel Berthelot began his career as a teacher of philosophy in secondary education. After a PhD under the direction of Raymond Ledrut, he became professor of sociology at the University of Toulouse from 1982 to 1997, where he directed the CERS (Centre d'études et de recherches sociologiques) and the doctoral school. In 1997, he joined the University of Paris Sorbonne, first Paris V and then Paris IV. He was Secretary General of the International Association of French speaking sociologists Language (AISLF), from 1992 to 2000, as well as Secretary General of the journal \\"Les Cahiers Internationaux de Sociologie\\".  Epistemology and history of sociology  Berthelot's philosophy and history of social sciences was influenced by Kant, French historical epistemology of Bachelard, Canguilhem, Koyré and Gaston Granger, the falsifiability of Popper and Lakatos and the epistemological reflections of sociologists, from Durkheim, Weber and Simmel to Passeron, Adorno and Habermas. Jean-Michel Berthelot's epistemological work combined the philosophy and history of science in the study of sociological theories to understand the logic of construction and justification of sociological knowledge. Berthelot created a typology of sociological explanations, constituted by six logical schemas of intelligibility: causal, actancial, hermeneutic, structural, functionalist and dialectic. These types of explanation were the result of formalization of theory and arguments in the history of sociology. Berthelot, at the same time, criticized the epistemic relativism and defended the pluralism and openness in sociology, which makes him, in the contemporary debate on philosophy of social sciences, a rationalist and constructivist. The pluralism in sociology, in Berthelot's epistemology, is not only inevitably, but even fruitful for the research and theoretical debate.

It is native to shallow waters throughout North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Etymology The johnny darter's Latin name comes from the Greek root words etheo, meaning to filter, stoma, meaning mouth, and nigrum, meaning black. Geographic distribution The johnny darter is found from Saskatchewan and Colorado to the Atlantic seaboard and from Hudson Bay south to the Gulf Coast drainage systems. They are the most common darter in Minnesota and Ohio.http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Home/species_a_to_z/SpeciesGuideIndex/johnnydarter/tabid/6664/Default.aspx Description The johnny darter can reach a length of TL though most only reach about . Males weigh a little over 2.0 grams, and the females weigh about 1.6 grams. These small, slender fish have brown to yellow scales, paler sides, and whitish bellies.http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Etheostoma_nigrum/ They have no bright colors and generally just have brown or black markings on a lighter tan background. These markings are usually a series of black \\"w\\" or \\"x\\" shapes along their sides running along their lateral lines. On the fish, the opercles (or bony areas forming the gill covers) have scales, whereas the preopercles (bone at the start of the cheek), napes, and breasts are scaleless. The johnny darter has two dorsal fins, the first has hard (spinous) rays, while the second is soft-rayed (flexible). The pectoral and pelvic fins are close to each other behind the gills. The pectorals are large and fan-like and are situated on the lower sides of the fish. The pelvic fins are small and round and situated in the ventral side of the fish.http://ndis.nrel.colostate.edu/wildlifespx.asp?SpCode=010604 They have a rounded tail fin on the ventral side, as well. Habitat, diet, and predators Johnny darters prefer clear water with sandy and gravelly bottoms. They like slow-moving water, but can be found in moderately cloudy, moving water, as well. They are bottom dwellers and stay on rocks at the bottoms of small ponds and streams with their heads facing into the current. Of all the darter species, the johnny darter is the most tolerant of diverse conditions. Since this darter is a benthic, its mouth is a subterminal where the nose is only slightly beyond the mouth and is situated in an inferior position that makes it easy for it to eat and catch food. Its diet is varied, but as young fish, it tends to eat copepods, small crustaceans, and waterfleas. As it grows, the fish start eating larger waterfleas, different types of larvae, including midges, mayflies, and caddisflies, and the occasional sideswimmer. These darters are generally eaten by larger predatory fish, such as burbots, lake trout, smallmouth bass, walleyes, and yellow perch. Breeding The spawning season is May and most of June, when the water temperatures are between 12 and 24 °C. Males arrive first to establish territories throughout the pond, lake, or stream. Spawning occurs in the shallow water, pools and slow runs, with large rocks, logs, cans, shells, or other debris. When a female approaches the nest, the male darts at her and chases her out of the territory. However, when she approaches the nest upside down and tries to enter, the male will accept her. They then both turn upside down and the female will lay between 30 and 200 eggs on the underside of the debris. Johnny darters are not monogamous and the female and male will spawn with other fish. A single nest may hold up to 1000 developing eggs. The male will guard the nest and keep them oxygenated and will eat the ones that develop fungus until the embryos hatch, which is after about six to 10 days. Conservation status These fish are not considered threatened throughout most of their range. They are considered vulnerable only in Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. In Minnesota, they have no special conservation status, but are protected by state law.

The Car Ensemble was founded in Rotterdam in 1984 by the Dutch artist and designer Herbert Verhey and had its premiere that year in the Tom Tom Club in that city. The scores were built up of blocks with improvisation instructions to which the conductor had the opportunity to allow each segment a longer or shorter duration. The Car Ensemble made use of engine sounds, car horns, the sound of doors and car radios, mixed with vocals, saxophone and percussion. Those who operated the cars in the orchestra mostly had previously been involved with the Concert For Thirty Cars (\\"Concert voor 30 Autos\\") by Herbert Verhey, performed on October 23, 1983, at a remote helicopter platform near Rotterdam. On invitation of the Goethe Institut, the Car Ensemble performed on September 5, 1985, in Düsseldorf, Germany. The cars for that occasion were operated by the local artists Marcel Hardung, Adolf Lechtenberg, Julia Lohmann, Gisela Kleinlein and Klaus Richter. The musicians were from the Netherlands: Marjo Kroese (vocals), Bob Stoute (percussion) and Alan Purves Alan Purves, Band members (percussion). A recording of this concert was issued in 1986 on flexi disc by Time Based Arts in Amsterdam. For performances of the Car Ensemble in Amsterdam on June 13 and 14, 1986, in the framework of the Romantic Aesthetics Festival, a drive-in cinema was set up whereby the Car Ensemble made use of a local radio station to broadcast additional sounds, conversations and instructions to the audience in their cars. The British cinematographers Richard Heslop and Daniel Landin for that occasion were invited to direct a film, Procar in cooperation with Herbert Verhey and to be used for back-drop projection. The remastered audio recording of the event later on became the soundtrack of the film. In 1987, Procar (16 mm, black and white, 19 mins.) was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival.Berlin International Film Festival, Panorama 1987 The last performance of the Car Ensemble was on August 16, 1987, at the invitation of the Boulevard of Broken Dreams, a theatre festival held that year in 's-Hertogenbosch. The Car Ensemble for that occasion worked together with the Dutch artist Willem de Ridder, whereby the latter in a radio broadcast directed citizens with their cars to a parking lot in the city to take part in the orchestra. Although dissolved by Verhey in the fall of 1987, he gave one final performance with the Car Ensemble (\\"Nederlands Auto Ensemble\\") in June 1990 in Hilversum (the Netherlands) on request of Han Reiziger for his TV program on classical and contemporary music, Reiziger in Muziek. Han Reiziger—who in 1983 had also broadcast the Concert For Thirty Cars—then operated one of the cars of the orchestra.

The game was released on March 24, 2009 on PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Microsoft Windows. The game, developed by Beenox on all platforms except the Nintendo DS which was developed by Amaze Entertainment, allows users to play through scenes from the movie as Ginormica, B.O.B., and The Missing Link, and features drop-in/out co-op. A significant feature has Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Will Arnett, and Rainn Wilson reprising their roles from the movie, however Hugh Laurie & Kiefer Sutherland do not, they are replaced by James Horan & Fred Tatasciore respectively. Gameplay Players take control of B.O.B., Missing Link, Dr. Cockroach PH.D. and Ginormica/Susan Murphy in all platforms, as well as Insectosaurus on the Nintendo DS version of the game. Each level is divided into multiple stages in which the player takes control of each monster's unique abilities to fight off enemies. The Missing Link can stick to the sides of large robotic bosses, take control of missile turrets, and outwit his opponents with superior acrobatic skills. B.O.B. has to solve complex puzzles one step at a time in 3-D mazes, can turn floating plasma generators into personal turrets, slide through grates and use enemies as living key cards/ammunition. Ginormica can use cars, Jeeps and hover platforms as roller skates to dash, kick, jump, and duck enemies and fight all bosses to devastate enemies. If the player chooses co-op mode, Dr. Cockroach can either appear as a secondary player with B.O.B. or deploy his \\"Multiplayer Drone\\", which can shoot obstacles, enemies, and other items. Dr. Cockroach also has a \\"DNA Lab\\", where he uses Monster DNA collected throughout the game to purchase upgrades, extra content (3D models, concept art, etc.), and extra levels. The music was composed by Jim Dooley, with live brass recorded at the Warner Brothers Eastwood Scoring Stage. Plot The player starts out trapped in a monster containment facility under the command of General W. R. Monger, with Insectosaurus, Susan (A.K.A. Ginormica,) B.O.B., The Missing Link, and Dr. Cockroach. . Susan breaks a wall and the monsters escape and disable a giant anti-monster robot known as the US Avenger, but are recaptured by Monger, who is accompanied by a force of soldiers, tanks, and helicopters. Meanwhile, a giant crater appears, around which the military puts blockades and the President of the US tries to negotiate with an alleged extraterrestrial being.

One of the largest council estates (public housing) in the UK, it occupies an extensive area of land west of Roehampton village and runs between the Roehampton Lane through-road and Richmond Park Golf Courses. Designed by a London County Council design team led by Rosemary Stjernstedt, the estate is renowned for its mix of low and high-rise modernist architecture consisting of Alton East (1958) styled a subtle Scandinavian-influenced vernacular and its slightly later counterpart: Alton West (1959).Open University, http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the- arts/history/heritage/roehampton-alton-east-alton-west-estates At Highcliffe Drive on Alton West the LCC essentially retained the Georgian landscape and placed within it five ultra-modern slab blocks: Binley, Winchfield, Dunbridge, Charcot and Denmead Houses (all grade II* listed buildings), inspired by Le Corbusier's Unite d'Habitation. Overall, the estate, which celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2009, has over 13,000 residents, making it one of the largest in the United Kingdom. The architecture is mainly split between brutalist architecture and its Scandinavian-inspired counterpart. Planning for redevelopment of the area is currently under way by Wandsworth Council.Alton area masterplan , Wandsworth London Borough Council. Retrieved: 17 October 2015 The Alton is sub-divided into 10 smaller neighborhoods, each with their own signage. They are, in alphabetical order: Arnewood, Danebury, Highcliffe, Hyacinth, Ibsley, Manresa, Norley, Tangley, Tunworth and Wanborough. Alton East The Alton East Estate consists of point blocks and low-level housing. The design \\"represents a desire by some architects to formulate a British version of modernism that was more sensitive to context and referenced a traditional vernacular.\\"Modern Architecture London, http://modernarchitecturelondon.com/pages/alton-east.php West aspect of Eashing Point on the Alton East Estate, 1957 Alton West The Corbusier- inspired \\"slab\\" blocks of the Highcliffe neighbourhood in the Alton West estate, Roehampton, London, \\"floating\\" within the Georgian landscape. At the time of its completion in 1958, Alton West was considered by many British architects to be the crowning glory of post-World War II social housing. What made Alton West so special at the time was its response to its setting. Built on a large expanse of parkland on the edge of Richmond Park, Alton West was a direct translation of Le Corbusier's idea of the Ville Radieuse or park city, sets of \\"point\\" and \\"slab\\" blocks being surrounded by the beauty of Richmond Park below. On this natural landscape at Alton West stood a number of different housing configurations: 12-storey \\"point\\" blocks with four flats per floor; terraces of low-rise maisonettes and cottages; and, perhaps most famously, five 11-storey \\"slab\\" blocks, heavily influenced by the Unité d'Habitation by Le Corbusier, completed in 1952. Notable buildings and establishments Robert Clatworthy sculpture, Bull Roehampton has a rich history and, now, to a certain extent so does the Alton Estate itself. Within the locale of the footprint occupied by the estate there are several notable buildings and establishments * The Cornerstone – (Roehampton Parish Great Hall – also serves as a community centre providing social facilities for locals) * The Highcliffe – (Perhaps the Alton's most famous landmarks: 5 Grade II* Listed tower buildings, developed as part of the Narrow-Fronted Maisonette concept of the 1950s inspired by Le Corbusier) * Maryfield Convent – (An order called The Poor Servants of the Mother of God) * Mount Clare – (A smaller campus which is part of Roehampton University centered around an eponymous manor house) * Parkstead House – (A stately home with a long and varied history which now forms a main campus of Roehampton University) * Clanfield House is one of eight red brick blocks of maisonettes built during the 1950s, on the east section of the Estate. It is an example of early attempts to create urban utopian communities, particularly in the use of allotments in front of Clanfield House.

He served as Roman Catholic Bishop of Cleveland from 1847 to 1870. Biography The son of peasants, Rappe was born in Audrehem, Pas-de-Calais, to Eloi and Marie Antoinette (née Noël) Rappe. He was one of ten children and labored in the fields until October 1820, when he entered the College of Boulogne (then under Benoit Haffreingue). After graduating in 1826, Rappe entered the seminary of Arras and was later ordained to the priesthood by Bishop (later Cardinal) Hugues de la Tour d'Auvergne- Lauragais on March 14, 1829. He then served as pastor of Wismes until 1834, when he became chaplain to the Ursuline monastery in Boulogne. Pastor In 1839 he accepted an invitation from Bishop John Baptist Purcell to join the Diocese of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the United States, arriving there in October 1840. He was sent to Chillicothe to learn English from the scholar, William Marshall Anderson. Purcell named him pastor of St. Francis de Sales Parish in Toledo.\\"Rappe, Louis Amadeus\\", The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Rappe ministered to the Catholic laborers on the Miami and Erie Canal and the settlers along the Maumee River; his unofficial parish limits extended from Toledo to the Indiana border and as far south as Allen County. He was a strong temperance advocate. To educate the children of his flock, he established a branch of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, building a convent and school for them. Having hitherto labored by himself, he eventually received the Rev. Louis De Goesbriand as an assistant in 1846. Bishop Amadeus Rappe statue on the grounds of St. John's Cathedral, Cleveland, Ohio On April 23, 1847, Rappe was appointed the first bishop of the newly created Diocese of Cleveland by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 10 from Bishop Purcell, with Bishop Richard Vincent Whelan serving as a co-consecrator, at Cincinnati. Two days after his consecration, he published his first pastoral letter, in which he expressed his desire \\"to be regarded as your friend and father, rather than your superior.\\" At that time, the diocese contained 42 churches and 21 priests; the first and only Catholic church in Cleveland was St. Mary's on the Flats. He soon established the city's first parochial school, which doubled as a chapel. St. John's Cathedral, Cleveland Rappe purchased an episcopal residence in 1848, and also laid the cornerstone of the new St. John's Cathedral on October 22 of that year. He founded a seminary at his residence that year as well. In 1849 he went to Europe to recruit clergy for the diocese, returning in 1850 with four priests, five seminarians, two Sisters of Charity and six Ursuline nuns. The Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary opened St. Mary's Orphan Asylum for Females in 1851. The Sisters of Charity opened St. Vincent's Asylum for Boys in 1852. Rappe consecrated St. John's Cathedral on November 7, 1852, and, a hospital being badly needed due to the Civil War, established St. Vincent Charity Hospital in 1865. He also introduced into the diocese the Grey Nuns (1856), the Good Shepherd Sisters (1869), the Little Sisters of the Poor (1870), the Friars Minor (1867) and the Jesuits (1869), and organized the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine as a new congregation.\\"Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 86 Rappe eventually met strong opposition. His eyesight began to fail, and upon returning from the First Vatican Council he resigned as bishop on August 22, 1870. He left the diocese with more than 100,000 Catholics, 107 priests, 160 churches, and 90 schools. He spent the next seven years at St. Albans (town), Vermont, attending to the missions in Vermont and Canada. He was later offered another diocese, but declined. He died at St. Albans on September 8, 1877, at the age of 76 and was buried in St. John's Cathedral in Cleveland.

They were among the originators of the benga music, a music genre with origins in Kenya's Luoland. History=Early years= Born in 1954 in Gem, Siaya District Collela attended Ngere High School where he was introduced to music in the school band. By the time he was through with education, Collela had a basic knowledge of music. Near his father's house, there lived a guitar-player and after school, together with others, he usually went to his place and watched him play. That is how he developed an interest in the guitar. He was still a child and his parents like others, did not want him to become involved in music. The risk of being found out was high and the punishment heavy. When his parents and parents of his friends caught them, they were beaten severely. They built their own little guitars which they strummed on the way back from school. When they came near home, they hid them. That is how they learnt the guitar. “We couldn't help doing it, it was in our blood,\\" said Collela. =Victoria Jazz= On leaving school in 1971, Collela joined the then Victoria Jazz. In the same year, with Ochieng' Nelly Mengo (Dr Nelly), they released their first record with AIT produced by Phares Oluoch Kanindo. Ochieng Nelly Mengo was born in Nyanza in 1950 and developed interest in music while still at school. He began to play a home-made guitar when he was very young. He played for and danced with his school friends. Things went on like that until he left school in 1966, and continued playing in the village until 1969 when he joined George Peter's band. In 1970, he joined the late George Ramogi (the leading figure in Luo music), but left him the same year. In December 1970, they founded Victoria Jazz. The association between Dr Nelly and Collela lasted for only one year before they split up, with musicians going different ways. Only three members - Opiyo Emma, Okeyo Achayo and Collela - remained and the band had to start again from scratch. It was not until two years later that the band regained its footing and continued recording with AIT. In 1976, they switched to EMI. Recordings at AIT were on the Sungura, and later, Lolwe labels. Dr Nelly founded his own band, Tausi, and own label, Hundhwe, with Kericho's Chandarana Records. After the collapse of EMI, Kanindo started his own POK Music Stores but at the back of their minds, they were thinking of starting their own label because of the tribulations they had suffered while recording on other people's labels. Dr Nelly's return in 1976/77 did not last and again Victoria Kings split into A and B because some musicians did not believe in starting their own recording company which they viewed as a source of more problems. Collela asked those who believed in the idea to join him and in 1979 Oula Records was formed. \\"Oula\\" means the spontaneous flow of water, the streams that form after the rain. “Oula will always flow. Meaning: Whether people like it or not, we will continue playing the music” Collela said in late 1990s. More problems were to come as the band split further and Victoria C led by Awino Lawi was formed. The success of Victoria Jazz in the 1970s overshadowed other musicians like Festo Ochuka, Ojwang' Ogara and Keri Were who actually introduced the benga beat. Before benga, rumba, twist and chachacha were very popular. Benga is versatile and can turn into twist, rumba, and into any other music beats. Everything can turn into benga. The benga style - its rhythms - has a certain sweetness which comes from the bass and solo guitars. It is a flavor people like. When you hear benga, you cannot help but dance. Dr Nelly explained that benga was infectious because it is the thoughts that enter the dancers when they dance to benga. It is really a traditional Luo concept even though other people may now like it. It is a word in Dholuo. “When you dance, you get back down like this, you get up, move like this - that is the meaning of benga,\\" Dr Nelly once explained to a reporter. Asked why benga practitioners play love songs all the time, Collela said: \\"We realized that it is really love songs that sell, which is why we play many of them.\\" Death Collela Mazee died in the evening of Tuesday 7 March 2000 at Masaba Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya after being admitted to the hospital on the 4th Saturday suffering from cardio- pulmonary arrest. The musician left three widows, Hellen, Janet Aloo and Betty, and 15 children and 6 grand children. Benga lovers remember Collela for his platinum Dholuo hit songs Jack Jack (1974), Hellena Nyaduse (1976) and his high-riding hit, Solea (2000) among others. \\"Dr Nelly\\", Ochieng' died on Wednesday 30 May 2014 at his rural Kabondo home, Rachuonyo District, after an illustrious entertainment career spanning several decades.

Political career Burges first served in Parliament as Member of Parliament for Helston from 1787 to 1790). He then served as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1789 and 1795 before becoming a Baronet on 21 October 1795 and Knight Marshal of his majesty's household in November of the same year, where he played an important role in the coronation of George IV.David McClure, \\"BBC Local Hero Caroline Burges and Eglinton Castle\\" http://www.ayrshirehistory.org.uk/Shorts/localhero.htm Writing and poetry Burges was an ambitious and productive writer. He was well established; being a friend of William Cumberland and John Graves Simcoe;John Graves Simcoe, 1752-1806 by Mary Beacock Fryer, Christopher Dracot, p89 and a patron of Thomas Dermody. He was connected by marriage to Lord Byron. He wrote music for Ode to the Passions by William Collins and wrote the prologue to Vortigern and Rowena (1796). He exchanged poetry with royalty and wrote long poems. The Birth and Triumph of Love was published in 1796 and the 16,000 line poem was very poorly received. It was quoted as a project that was known for its lack of success. Despite the ignominy Burges still had a prestige and funds available where he could indulge his literary interests. He wrote an introduction for William Henry Ireland Shakespearian forgery and Thomas Dermody stole money from him. Burges continued to publish poetry and he had a play in Drury Lane. Despite being championed by Lord Byron, no other plays followed. He wrote an introduction to a later edition of the Pilgrim's Progress sequel, Progress of the Pilgrim Good-Intent in Jacobinical Times. In this introduction he revealed that the true author of the work was his gifted sister Mary Ann Burges. Family Burges married three times; his first marriage to Elizabeth Noel, second daughter of Edward Noel, 1st Viscount Wentworth in 1777 produced no children.

It was not put into production and only the three prototypes were built. Development In August 1923 the Air Ministry issued specification 26/23, which called for a day bomber powered by a Rolls Royce Condor III engine which could carry a 550 lb (250 kg) bomb load with a 500-mile (800 km) range. In response, Handley Page designed what was known at the time as the C/7 Handcross but retrospectively became the H.P.28 Handcross after the introduction of the familiar H.P. type numbers in about 1927. The Handcross was constructed from wood and fabric throughout. It was a three-bay biplane with equal-span wings without stagger or sweep. The wings had parallel chord but the lower planes were significantly narrower than the upper; only the lower planes carried dihedral. Ailerons, with back-set hinges to provide aerodynamic balance, were mounted on the upper planes alone. The wide-track divided main undercarriage had legs mounted on the wing front spar below the innermost interplane struts, braced to the fuselage. The fuselage was flat sided with a pronounced dorsal fairing or decking and a similar ventral fairing below. The pilot sat in an open cockpit below the upper wing, with the gunner in a dorsal position behind him. The gunner could also access two spaces in the belly: a prone position below the pilot for bomb aiming, or a rearward-firing gun position behind this. The tail surfaces were conventional, rudder and elevators being horn-balanced; the rudder reached down below the fuselage bottom, protected by a small tailskid. The V-12 watercooled Condor engine was cooled by a radiator in the nose below the boss of the two bladed metal Leitner-Watts propeller. Handley Page were awarded an order for three prototypes and the first of these flew at the company's Cricklewood base on 6 December 1924, piloted by Hubert Broad. After test flights there it went to RAF Martlesham Heath on 1 January 1925 for Air Ministry tests and eventually in June for competitive trials against other manufacturers' entrants. Meanwhile, the other two machines had been completed, the second going to RAE Farnborough for use in an experimental radio programme and the third retained at Cricklewood. It was used to find solutions to several problems that the Martlesham flights had revealed. The original fuel tanks, mounted just outboard of the innermost interplane struts and projecting both above and below the upper wing were found to be the source of aerodynamically-induced vibration at high angles of attack, so they were modified to have a top face matching the upper wing surface. The exhaust pipes were modified to avoid flame dazzle and flow into the cockpit by discharging at the forward end via \\"rams horn\\" exits; the ventral gun position was canvassed over, for there was such a draught through the dorsal and ventral openings that neither position was usable. The Hawker Horsley won the specification trials, so no more Handcrosses were built. The last one stayed at Cricklewood until 1926, serving as a test machine and the second, moved from Farnborough to Martlesham, remained with the Armaments Trial Flight until 1928. The first machine was fitted with several different wooden two- and four-bladed propellers for comparison with the original metal two-bladers.

Career  Woman of the Colonies (1861), Paris, Musée d'Orsay. Cordier was born in Cambrai. In 1847, a meeting with Seïd Enkess, a former black slave who had become a model, determined the course of his career.Described in his Mémoires, Musée d'Orsay exhibition from 3 February 2004 to 2 May 2004, Facing the other : Charles Cordier, ethnographic sculptor, page 5. His first success was a bust in plaster of a Sudanese man \\"Saïd Abdullah of the Mayac, Kingdom of the Darfur\\" (Sudan). This was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1848, the same year that slavery was abolished in all French colonies. It is now housed at The Walters Art Museum. In 1851, Queen Victoria bought a bronze of it at the Great Exhibition of London. From 1851 to 1866, he served as the official sculptor of Paris's National History Museum, creating a series of spectacularly lifelike busts for their new ethnographic gallery (now housed in the Musee de l'Homme, Paris). Cordier did not only use 'exotic' models: in the course of his ethnographic work he depicted European types from different parts of France and beyond. His artistic credo was however in conscious opposition to the largely Eurocentric viewpoint prevailing in his day. Addressing the French Society of Anthropology in 1862, Cordier stated: > \\"Beauty does not belong to a single, privileged race, I have promoted > throughout the world of art the idea that beauty is everywhere. Every race > has its own beauty, which differs from that of others. The most beautiful > black person is not the one who looks most like us.\\" (\\"Le beau n'est pas propre à une race privilégiée, j'ai émis dans le monde artistique l'idée de l'ubiquité du beau.

The collection is estimated to consist of more than 10 million images and photographs as of 2009. Additional images were acquired by Cushman through his solicitation of donations from major Hollywood film studios, individuals and their families during his 37-year tenure with the Academy. Biography=Early life= Cushman was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His initial interest in film began in 1950, when he went to the Rialto Theater in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to watch a reissue of the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He also took some post-graduate courses at UCLA. Cushman worked as a research fellow with the American Film Institute (AFI). He was also employed by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where he created program notes for the museum's film series. Cushman held both of these positions prior to joining the Academy. =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences= In 1972, Cushman joined the staff of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and became photographic curator of the Margaret Herrick Library's collection of photographs. Under Cushman's guidance as curator, the Academy developed and organized the Margaret Herrick Library's photographic collection, which now has more than 10 million individual photographs as of 2009. Cushman obtained archival photographic collections from some of the film industry's most important studios, including the collection from United Artists. He also solicited donations to the library from individuals including Harold Lloyd, the family of Douglas Fairbanks, Buster Keaton, Katharine Hepburn and George Cukor. Linda Mehr, director of the Margaret Herrick Library, credited Cushman with make the library's collection of industry photography more user friendly, \\"He also developed the protocols of organizing the material so it was accessible. Cushman developed his own method of cleaning and preserving photographs, which allowed for the retrieval and removal of photos which had been previously adhered to books. Cushman's method, which removed paper, glue and other chemicals from the photographs proved valuable to the library's efforts to preserve and restore the images. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the library's director praised Cushman's methods as curator, \\"This cleaning process not only removed them from that paper but also got rid of the residual chemicals, so you could keep them in better shape.\\" Cushman restored his Los Angeles house, a Queen Anne Victorian home constructed in 1895. The home was named a Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument in 1979. Works authored Cushman contributed writings and photographs to a number of books on Hollywood and the entertainment industry. His contributions included: * \\"Mary Pickford Rediscovered: Rare Pictures of a Hollywood Legend\\" * \\"Douglas Fairbanks\\" - Cushman contributed as the book's photographic editor * \\"Hollywood's Chinese Theatre: The Hand and Footprints of the Stars from the Silents to Star Trek\\" * \\"Hollywood at Your Feet: The Story of the World-Famous Chinese Theatre,\\" co-written by Stacey Endres.

In May 2013, Snow's was ranked number 2 on the magazine's Top 50 list of the best barbecue in Texas. The 2017 list saw Snow's trade places with Austin's Franklin Barbecue to retake the number 1 position. In early 2018, 82-year-old pitmaster Tootsie Tomanetz was nominated as a semifinalist for a James Beard Award.

Founded in 1999, MECA was the grassroots organization fighting to secure the legal recognition of same- sex marriage through education and outreach in California. Its mission statement is to secure the freedom and the right of same-sex couples to enter into legally recognized civil marriage, having all the federal and state benefits and responsibilities which that entails. Marriage Equality California merged with it coalition organization Equality California in 2004. Most of the work performed by Marriage Equality California is now performed as a local project of its original parent organization Marriage Equality USA. History Under the leadership of L.J. Carusone and Mark Levine, the Marriage Equality California Chapter was created. On February 14, 2000, at a protest in Beverly Hills, Marriage Equality California became one of the first marriage-equality organizations in the country to organize a \\"mass-marriage protest\\" at a city clerk's offices on Valentine's Day, a tradition that has continued every February and spread throughout the 58 counties of California and to New York City. Levine writes he: > promised the police and court officials that we would not be violent in any > way. And court officials, in turn, graciously agreed to waive the marriage > license fee, since we all knew they would reject our attempts to get > married. I remember it was a beautiful day, and a joyful one: We all smiled > ear-to-ear knowing we were attempting something that was then impossible but > which every one of us thought would eventually become possible. Marriage Equality California was entirely volunteer driven with no paid staff, and educated Californians through rallies & demonstrations, educational programs, outreach, and media representation. From 1999 to 2002, Marriage Equality California was the primary advocate for marriage equality in California, and was an advocate for California Assembly bill 1338, California's first civil-unions bill and the second civil-unions bill in the nation after Vermont's.

Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Rossville, Vermilion, Illinois; Roll: T623_349; Page: 10A; Enumeration District: 96. University of Michigan Redden enrolled at the University of Michigan where he became one of the stars of Fielding H. Yost's famous \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams of 1901, 1902, and 1903. The 1901 team compiled a record of 11–0 and outscored its opponents 550–0. In Redden's sophomore, junior and senior years, Michigan was 33–0–1 and outscored opponents by a total of 1,764 to 18. At the end of his senior season, Redden was a unanimous first-team All-Western selection, including designations by the Chicago Record-Herald, The Chicago Daily News, and The Inter-Ocean. He was one of only five players upon whom the \\"Western football critics have been able to unanimously agree.\\" The Chicago Daily News also designated Redden as the captain of its 1903 All-Western team and explained its choice as follows > Redden's cool head in a game, his speed and strong playing mark him as the > most legitimate selection for captain among all the other captains ... > Redden's speed up the field on punts, his ability to stiff arm every > interferer without slackening up that speed, and his open-field tackling > mark him as the best end for the pure type of end work the west has seen in > years. Offensively his skill lies in assisting his tackle in boxing an > opponent and assisting the runner after he has passed the line. Redden was also selected as a third-team All-American by Walter Camp. After he graduated, one paper noted the impact his loss would have on the 1904 team: \\"The loss of Captain Redden will be felt keenly. For four years he was regarded as the greatest end the west ever produced.\\" An all-around athlete, Redden was selected as the captain of Michigan's football and baseball teams in his senior year. One newspaper summed up Redden's athletic career at Michigan as follows > Redden was captain not only of this year's Michigan football team but also > of the selected All-Star Western team. He is a natural football player and > is one of the best ends the Middle West has ever produced. He is also > captain of the school track team, being the only man who has had the > distinction of holding both stations of honor at the same time. Football coach and lawyer With the success of Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams, his former players were in great demand as coaches. Dan McGugin went to Vanderbilt, Willie Heston to Drake, Albert E. Herrnstein to Purdue and Ohio State, Paul J. Jones to Western Reserve, Bruce Shorts to Nevada and Oregon, William Cole to Virginia, Frank Longman to Arkansas and Notre Dame, Joseph Maddock to Oregon and Utah and Fred Norcross to Oregon State. And in 1905, Redden was hired as the football coach at Kentucky University. In November 1905, a newspaper reported on Redden's progress at Kentucky: \\"What Redden is doing at Kentucky is best shown by the record his moonshiners made in this Northwestern game. Undoubtedly, the close, hard game given the purple bv Redden's pupils, helped pull Northwestern down to the weakened condition in which Stagg's men found McCormick's players.\\" In 1906, Redden, who had also been a star in baseball at Michigan, signed to play baseball with the Indianapolis Indians in the American Association. By 1908, Redden had opened a law practice in his home town of Danville, Illinois, where he also became involved in politics. In October 1908, Redden agreed to take time out from his law practice to join Coach Yost's staff to whip the Michigan football team into shape. Redden was given responsibility over the linemen. For a portion of the 1911 season, Yost left Redden in charge of the team while Yost traveled to the East to watch Penn play Jim Thorpe's Carlisle Indians. Redden remained on Yost's coaching staff through the 1912 season. For several years, Redden had continued his law practice in Illinois but had \\"been able to spare a few weeks to return to Ann Arbor and help out\\" as Yost's assistant. By 1912, Yost concluded he needed a year-round, full-time staff of assistants. Redden returned to Illinois, where he worked at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, from 1915–1917 as an assistant physical education director, line coach for the Knox football team, and as head baseball coach. World War I Curtis Redden cropped from 1903 Michigan football team photograph Redden enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War I. He served as a lieutenant colonel of the 149th Field Artillery with the Rainbow Division in France. His unit was among the first to leave for France. In April 1918, newspapers published a letter from Redden to a friend back home describing the Illinois artillery unit's \\"baptism of fire.\\" He described the heavy shelling the unit withstood > And so it went from day to day, but oftimes the nights were very bad. At > night, when the infantry launched its raids, or the enemy his, or the > infantry became nervous and called for help, the guns stamped like stallions > and snorted their breaths of fire. The blackness of the night became a > series of dots and dashes, until the world resembled a vast radio station, > spelling hell, hell, and hell again. To this must be added the shriek of > shells, the whistle of fragments, the automatic hammer effect of the machine > gun, the rattle of the rifle fire, the rockets and star shells out over No > Man's land—all combined to make the night weird, hideous, fascinating, > sublime. In November 1918, Redden was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 149th Field Artillery Regiment. Redden survived the many battles in which his unit fought only to come down with pneumonia after the army of occupation began its march into Germany. Redden died of pneumonia in January 1919 at a hospital in Koblenz, Germany. Redden had been in command of the artillery unit since October 1918. Redden was buried in Germany on a slope near the point where the Rhine and Moselle Rivers meet. Newspapers described his funeral as follows > With an escort of more than 600 enlisted men besides the officers of the > 149th and 67th artillery brigade, of which the regiment was a part, the > cortege passed through Coblenz with Redden's horse, 'Sergeant,' taking the > place of honor immediately behind the gun carriage bearing the flag-draped > casket. In line with the custom of military funerals, the dead officer's > boots were in the stirrups, with the toes pointing to the rear. At the grave > three volleys were fired by an infantry squad and a bugler sounded the > plantive notes of 'taps.' Redden has since been reburied in Spring Hill Cemetery in Danville, Vermilion County, Illinois, USA. In 1921, one of the columns in Memorial Stadium at the University of Illinois was dedicated to Redden. The funds to purchase the column were donated by friends of Redden from his days at Michigan and by the men who served with him in the 149th Field Artillery. The column was dedicated at a ceremony prior the 1921 Michigan-Illinois game. The Michigan Alumnus magazine in November 1921 reported: \\"This column will stand for all time to perpetuate the memory of Colonel Redden and as a bond of union between the two great universities.\\" Head coaching recordSee also * Michigan Wolverines Football All-Americans ReferencesExternal links * 1882 births 1919 deaths American football ends 20th-century American lawyers Indianapolis Indians players Michigan Wolverines football players Michigan Wolverines football coaches Transylvania Pioneers football coaches American military personnel of World War I United States Army colonels People from Danville, Illinois Deaths from pneumonia People from Vermilion County, Illinois Players of American football from Illinois ","title":"Curtis Redden"},{"id":"23828924","title":"Sir William Sutherland Cup"},{"id":"23828942","title":"Swimming at the 2005 Maccabiah Games – Women's 50 metre freestyle"},{"id":"23828959","text":"Mohamed Asif Din (born 21 September 1960) is a former English cricketer who played county cricket for Warwickshire from 1981 to 1995.

It was established in 1985 and closed on 27 April 2018. It was part of the Hope House Church.  History  Hope House School was established in 1985 as part of the mission of Hope House Church and was known as Barnsley Christian School. It changed its name to Hope House School in September 2012 and Hope House School Trust was set up as a company with charitable status to be the proprietor of the school. It shared premises with the church in a town centre building and drew its pupils largely from Christian families who were members of the two local churches. However, this changed over the years with a growing intake from non-Christian families but the school retained its Christian character. It was one of twenty-seven independent schools to be issued with a warning notice from the Department for Education in November 2017 that failed to meet its independent school standards. It noted its pupils were not developing respect for different faiths and beliefs, didn't have easy access to drinking water and the outdoor space was too small. Its fees depended on the age but ranged from £370 a month for juniors and up to £455 a month for the older students. It closed on 27 April 2018 due to a change in legislation that made it difficult to maintain the independent choices the school could make, no longer having the freedom it once had, increase in running costs and falling numbers.

It is produced in the United States by the Magellan Systems International, which became a division of DuPont. Preparation M5 fiber is prepared by a condensation polymerization between tetraaminopyridine and dihydroxyterephthalic acid using diphosphorus pentoxide as a dehydrating agent. The polymer mixture is then heated and extruded to form brightly blue polymer fibers. The fibers are then washed extensively with water and base in order to remove the phosphoric acid generated by the hydration of diphosphorus pentoxide from the polymer. To remove water from the fiber structure and enable the intermolecular hydrogen bonds to be created, thus increasing the strength of the polymer, the fiber is heated and exposed to controlled stress. This aligns the molecular structure of the fiber in a better configuration for tensile and compressive strength. Properties M5 has a tensile strength of 4 GPa,. Other aramids- (such as Kevlar and Twaron) or UHMWPE-fibres (such as Dyneema and Spectra) range from 2.2 to 3.9 GPa. M5 is the most fire resistant organic fiber yet developed.

The Blue Raiders capped one of the best seasons in school history with their first bowl win during the FBS era as the Sun Belt's representative in the New Orleans Bowl, where Conference USA representative Southern Miss had never lost in three previous tries before getting throttled by a spirited Middle Tennessee team.

It's the most wins for the Blue Raiders since the 1992 squad won 10 and the win streak is the longest since the 1985 team won 11 straight. Astonishing junior quarterback Dwight Dasher was named the New Orleans Bowl Most Valuable Player after accounting for 363 yards total offense – 201 rushing and 162 passing – rushing for two touchdowns and passing for two more. For good measure Dasher also became one of just eight quarterbacks in FBS history to rush for 1,000 yards and pass for 2,000 in the same season. His 201 yards rushing established a New Orleans Bowl record and he became the only quarterback in Blue Raider history to surpass 1,000 yards rushing in a season. While the spotlight would shine on Dasher it was still that blue-collar, blue- clad defense that stiffened after a slow start and dominated the game following the opening quarter when it surrendered two touchdowns on Southern Miss' first two drives. It allowed just 18 points the remainder of the game, while the Blue Raider offense piled up 42 points. The defense also had two interceptions compliments of Alex Suber and Danny Carmichael. Making the turnovers even more impressive was the fact Southern Miss quarterback Martevious Young had thrown just two interceptions all season and had 165 consecutive completions without a pick before Suber turned him over in the second quarter. Suber's interception would set up a touchdown that enabled Middle Tennessee to rally and tie the game, 14-14. Carmichael's interception sealed the game and capped a tremendous Blue Raider career on a high note. The win demonstrated the continued growth of Middle Tennessee's program under fourth-year head coach Rick Stockstill, who has led the Blue Raiders to both of their bowl appearances of the FBS era.

MTV.com. Retrieved December 11, 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $211 million worldwide. Plot Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.), a successful architect, is due to fly home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), who is about to give birth. On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), who is going to LA to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes at the Grand Canyon. When Ethan misuses the words \\"terrorist\\" and \\"bomb\\" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. Peter, now on the No Fly List and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles. Ethan stops to buy marijuana, and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee (Danny McBride) refuses to accept Ethan's \\"Stage name I.D.\\" it leads to a violent altercation. After a night at a rest stop, Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he has forgotten to unload the ashes of Ethan's father when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, before deciding to return, and covering for his absence by saying he had gone to buy breakfast. Ethan takes over driver duty so Peter can get some rest after a sleepless night, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. Peter calls his friend, Darryl (Jamie Foxx), for assistance and decides to part with Ethan, but Darryl persuades Peter otherwise. They arrive at Darryl's house for rest. During their conversation, Ethan discovers hints that Sarah may have been unfaithful, triggering Peter to question Sarah's timely pregnancy. Darryl throws both of them out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethan's father's ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin. Darryl lets them use his Range Rover to make the rest of the trip. Ethan and Peter get high and begin to bond, but Ethan then mistakenly drives to the Mexico–United States border. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana. The Mexican Federal Police lock Peter up, but Ethan steals a truck and breaks him out, causing several car crashes in the process. Peter decides to stop at the Grand Canyon for Ethan, who finally scatters his father's ashes. Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peter's wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood. Sarah delivers the baby safely, and Peter expresses his discomfort at his new daughter being named Rosie Highman. Ethan leaves to meet with a Hollywood agent while telling Peter to call him. At the end, Ethan guest stars on an episode of his favorite television program, Two and a Half Men with Peter and Sarah watching it in bed with their daughter. Ethan texts Peter during the episode, indicating that the two have become friends.

It is the fourth largest iron-ore producer in the world and the largest in Africa. History Kumba Iron Ore is a successor of Kumba Resources. Kumba Resources was listed on the JSE in 2001. Kumba Resources was reorganized in November 2006 when coal and heavy minerals operations were spun off to newly created companies Kumba Iron Ore (Heavy minerals) and Exxaro Resources(Coal). Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. listed on the JSE in November 2006 with a market capitalization of R36 billion. Operations Kumba Iron Ore owns 74% in Sishen Iron Ore Company (SIOC). Rest of SIOC is owned by Exxaro, SIOC Employee Share Participation Scheme and the SIOC Community Development Trust. Through the SIOC, Kumba Iron Ore owns Thabazimbi, Sishen and Kolomela iron ore mines. In 2010, Kumba Iron Ore was one of the more successful divisions of Anglo American plc, continuing to pay dividends to shareholders while Anglo American and Anglo Platinum had suspended dividends in 2008. = Mining Operations = Sishen Mine Sishen Mine is situated in Kathu in the Northern Cape Province. It is one of the largest open pit mines in the world Kumba Iron Ore has reported that Sishen Mine has reserves for a 19-year life of mine. Mining methods at Sishen are opencast mining. Ore is transported to the beneficiation and jig plant. The Sishen mine jig plant is the largest of its kind in the world. By July 2016, production had been halved and workforce cut by 31%, in response to the slump in global iron ore prices. = Thabazimbi Mine = Located close to Thabazimbi in the Limpopo Province, mining operations started in 1931. Mining is by opencast methods. In a deal brokered in 2013, the high-grade haematite ore produced at Thabazimbi mine would be sold only to ArcelorMittal SA, while Kumba Iron Ore managed operations. However, in February 2015, Kumba announced that the Thabazimbi mine was no longer economically viable. = Kolomela Mine = Kolomela mine is located at Postmasburg in the Northern Cape Province. Mining operations started in 2011, and the company has reported a 25-year mine lifespan. 2019 iron ore production: 13.2 MT. = Controversy = In 2010, Kumba Iron Ore started legal proceedings against Imperial Crown Trading 289 and the Ministry of Mines for the issuance of a mining licence after ArcelorMittal SA did not complete paperwork by the due date and failed to convert their 21.4% undivided share.

He served as the Director of The Hastings Center from 1969 to 1983, president from 1984 to 1996, and president emeritus from 1996 to 2019. He was the author or editor of 47 books. Life and career=Education= Daniel Callahan was born in Washington, D.C. on July 19, 1930. In high school Callahan was a swimmer and chose to attend Yale University because of its competitive swimming program. While at Yale, he was drawn to interdisciplinary studies and graduated in 1952 with a double degree in English and Philosophy. He received the M.A. degree from Georgetown University in 1956 and the Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard in 1965.Daniel Callahan Director of international programs www.The futureoflife.com The hasting center www.thefutureoflife.com/speakers/callahan.htm =Catholic intellectual= From 1961 to 1968, Callahan worked as executive editor of Commonweal, a Catholic journal of opinion. Callahan became an influential writer and author within Catholic intellectual circles during this period, which was a tumultuous time in the Catholic Church. In addition to numerous articles in Commonweal, he wrote or edited nine books, including The Mind of the Catholic Layman, Honesty in the Church, and The Catholic Case for Contraception. The historian Rodger Van Allen once described Callahan as “perhaps the most influential Catholic layman of the 1960s.” =Abortion issue= During the late 1960s, Callahan left the Catholic Church—later explaining his disenchantment in the book Once a Catholic—and became interested in the intersection of medicine and ethics. With support from the Population Council and the Ford Foundation, Callahan traveled around the world to study how different countries approached the issue of abortion, as well as ethical issues in family planning and population control. The result was the groundbreaking 1970 book Abortion: Law, Choice, and Morality. Callahan would remain involved in debates over abortion for years to come and was often interviewed by the media on this subject. He described himself as \\"51 percent pro-choice. In 1984, he and wife Sidney Callahan—who took a pro-life position—co-edited a book, Abortion: Understanding Differences, that included essays from people on all sides of this issue. The couple's longstanding differences on abortion were once the subject of a feature in People magazine and they engaged in a number of public debates on abortion, including on PBS's MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour. = Bioethicist = In 1969, Callahan cofounded the Hastings Center with Willard Gaylin, a noted psychiatrist. The center, originally named the Institute for Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, and based in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, was the world's first research organization devoted to bioethics. It played a pioneering role in developing this field by bringing together scholars from across different disciplines, including medicine, law, science and philosophy. Such noted leaders in bioethics, such as Arthur Caplan and Robert M. Veatch, began their careers at the Hastings Center. Callahan served as the center's director from its inception to September 1, 1996.In honour of Daniel Callahan: A medieval disputation on bioethics www.Acessmyliabry.com November 01, 1996. Humane care international. Margaret A. Somerville During that time, he wrote numerous articles and edited multiple books, including on issues of death and dying and genetics. = Health care = In 1987, Callahan published Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society, a book that argued that U.S. society would need to limit expensive care for those very elderly Americans, who were unlikely to live long or good lives. The financial cost was too high, he argued, and came at the expense of pressing needs such as education. In his book he also proposed an \\"age-based standard for the termination of life- extending treatment\\". Upon its publication, The New York Times Book Review wrote: \\"This is a pivotal work that poses hard questions and proposes provocative answers. Setting Limits promises to be the benchmark for future moral, medical and policy discussions of aging.\\" The book attracted wide attention and generated significant controversy, including two volumes of essays debating or criticizing Callahan's ideas. In 2009, Callahan was interviewed by NPR about his reflections on Setting Limits as he aged and responded to charges of hypocrisy for benefitting from expensive medical interventions. Callahan followed up on Setting Limits with a series of books on health care, aging, technology and mortality. These included What Kind of Life: The Limits of Medical Progress (Simon & Schuster, 1990), The Troubled Dream of Life: In Search of a Peaceful Death (Simon & Schuster, 1993); False Hopes (Simon & Schuster & Rutgers University Press, 1998); What Price Better Health? Hazards of the Research Imperative (University of California Press, 2003); Medicine and the Market: Equity vs. Choice (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006); and Taming the Beloved Beast: Why Medical Technology Costs are Destroying Our Health Care System (Princeton University Press, August 2009). Callahan lectured widely on his ideas on health care during this period through the United States and Europe. = Awards and recognition = Callahan was an elected member of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences; a member of the Director's Advisory Committee, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and of the Advisory Council, Office of Scientific Responsibility, Department of Health and Human Services. He was awarded the Freedom and Scientific Responsibility Award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1996.http://www.thehastingscenter.org/team/daniel-callahan-2/ Daniel Callahan He was awarded the 2008 Centennial Medal of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Popularly known as Mighty Mufulira Wanderers, the club has won 50 trophies and has also produced some of the country’s greatest players. However they have struggled in recent years, spending nine years in Division I between 2006 and 2015, and having not won any honours since 1997. History=1953–1959: Early years= Mufulira Wanderers Football Club was formed in 1953 as Mufulira Mine Team when mine workers demanded their own team to rival the town’s municipal-run team Mufulira Football Club which later became Mufulira Blackpool. So the Mufulira Mine Team came into existence from the merger of teams that took part in tribal matches and like Blackpool, affiliated to the Copperbelt African Football Association. The team played their games at Mutende ground and was coached by Welfare Officer Jim Crow. The British influence was unmistakable in the names Blackpool and later Wanderers, as well as the striped shirts that both teams wore. Some of the first players in the Wanderers team were Dominic Mwenya, George Kangwa, Joseph Choongo, Fidelis Bwete, McLean Kabwe, Alphonso Bwalya and Penius \\"Kapenta\\" Chirwa. The newly formed team competed favourably against teams like Roan Mine, Nchanga Mine, Rhokana Mine, Luanshya All Blacks, Chingola Eleven Wise Men, Bancroft North End and town mates Blackpool. Apart from the main team, the club had two reserve sides whose games would precede those of the first team on match day. In 1956, Samuel “Zoom” Ndhlovu, who would go on to become Wanderers’ most iconic figure and Zambia's greatest forward of the sixties, joined the team from Kankoyo Mine School and started out in the third team. He was joined by George Sikazwe the following year and the two were the youngest members at the club. By 1959, goalkeeper Bwete and the trio of Ndhlovu, Sikazwe and Chirwa had formed a combination which would launch the team to greater heights. The same trio was co-opted into the welfare section of mine community development as club organizers together with Harwood Chimaliro, who would go on to serve as Wanderers’ administrator for 20 years until his retirement in 1978. =1960–1969: Beginning of dominance= In 1960, coach Crow and the club organizers went on a recruitment drive of talented youths at the various club centres within the mine township. This was how Laurent Chishala, Willie Kunda and Elijah Mwale became part of the team. Others were brothers Goodson and Sandford Mvula, Kenneth Simwanza, Joseph Menzu, Patrick Nkole and Rodson Chewe. The two reserve teams were still a feature so there was a steady supply of players and competition for places in the first team, of which Ndhlovu, Sikazwe and Chirwa were now part of, was very stiff. In April 1962, Wanderers' home ground Shinde Stadium was opened and Tolomeo Mwansa joined the team as first choice goalkeeper. In the same year the National Football League (NFL) was formed and the team's name changed to Mufulira Wanderers. Although the NFL only required a main team and one reserve side, Wanderers continued with their three team system which led to a formidable first team. While most teams in the NFL were mergers between their African and European versions, Wanderers were predominantly an all-African side for the simple reason that Mufulira was a political hot-bed during the colonial days. It was only in the late sixties when the political scene had settled that Scottish centre half Hugh McNeillie aptly named \\" the man of iron\\" and centre forward Tony Panter joined the club at the prompting of coach Doug Sammons and \\"Zoom\\" Ndhlovu. The composition of the team had by then changed into a mixture of youth and experience with McClean Kabwe, Ndhlovu and Sikazwe being the oldest players supported by younger players such as Dickson Makwaza, Joseph \\"Kanono\\" Musonda, Bedford Kaputo, Mwansa, Simwanza, Mwale, Kunda and Chishala. The inclusion of McNeillie at centre half steadied the defence and Dickson Makwaza in particular benefited from the presence of the rugged Scot. After missing out on the inaugural NFL championship of 1962 which was won by Roan United, coach Doug Sammons retained the same team and Wanderers won the title the following year. This signalled the beginning of their dominance on the Zambian soccer scene. The men from Shinde then set their sights on winning all of the silverware on offer, especially the Castle Cup. The reason for this was that from 1962, Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) would compete for the Inter-Rhodesia Castle Cup which saw the Castle Cup champions of each country fighting for the prestigious Super Cup. In 1965, it was decided to do away with the trophy by having one last final, and that the winners of the trophy, which had previously been won by Southern Rhodesian clubs Bulawayo Rovers and Salisbury Callies, would keep the trophy for good. Wanderers won the right to compete in this final through by defeating City of Lusaka 5–2 in the local final with Kunda grabbing a hat-trick. Wanderers left no stone unturned during preparations for the Super Castle Cup final. By this time, golfer Harry McQuillan was the coach, with Lewis Rennos as physical trainer. The final turned out to be one of the most famous matches in Zambian football history as the Mighty men squared off with City Wanderers before a racially segregated crowd of 18,000 on 17 October 1965 at Glamis Stadium in Salisbury. The Zambians took the lead with two quick goals from Kunda and Mwale but City pulled a goal back through striker Kenneth Makoni. Ndhlovu put Wanderers further ahead to leave the scores 3–1 at the break. Wanderers then allowed City back into the game when goals by captain Alan Hlathwayo and Richard Chimiya tied the game but with extra-time looming, Mwale cut in from the left to score a late and historic winner for a final score of 4–3.Anon. \\"Mufulira take Castle Cup\\" Times of Zambia, 18 October 1965 p. 14 After the match, the team returned to the dressing room and word soon went round that Ian Smith had unilaterally declared a state of Independence (UDI) so General Manager Hansworth of Wanderer's sponsors Roan Consolidated Mines, who had accompanied the team to Salisbury, ordered their hasty departure for the airport where they boarded their chartered plane without going through immigration formalities. On arrival at Ndola Airport, the players were driven home in private vehicles and the Super Castle Cup was permanently in Wanderers’ custody. Wanderers were the dominant team in Zambian football in the sixties and won the League a record 5 times, including 3 in a row from 1965–67. Ndhlovu was by then player-coach and he still thrilled fans everywhere Wanderers played with his mesmerizing dribbling skills. His prowess was recognized when he became the first footballer to win the Zambian Sportsman of the Year award in 1964 and there was a benefit match between Wanderers and Kitwe Sports to mark his 10 years in professional football in 1966. The team built up a large following of admirers throughout Zambia and won several more cups including Zambia's inaugural Charity Shield in 1967, and their famous green and white striped shirts were widely regarded as a symbol of success. At this point, a number of talented schoolboys were welcomed into the team – Robertson Zulu from Kantanshi Secondary School while Mettu Mumba, Noah Chishiki and Abraham Nkole were picked from Mufulira Secondary. In 1968, Ndhlovu left for a six-month coaching course with Blackpool in England and Sikazwe stood in as coach. In September 1969, striker Robertson Zulu set a club record by scoring 9 goals when Wanderers beat Kabwe United 14–1 in a Heinrich Cup tie, on his way to winning the Zambian League's top goal-scorer award and helping Wanderers to a fifth league title. Wanderers were a cut above the rest of the teams and it was around this time that they earned themselves the \\"Mighty\\" tag. Their success was attributed to having a fine reservoir of players as well as the good administration of the team.Ngoma, Mike \\"Face to Face\\", Sunday Times of Zambia, 24 April 1983 p. 8 =1970–1979: Dominance continues= The dominance continued into the seventies with Ndhlovu still a key player and Zambian national team captain Makwaza manning the defence. The team had a ‘never-say-die’ attitude and developed a habit of scoring late goals to win matches, often from a losing position. Thus the phrase \\"Mighty awina ichungulo\\" (bemba saying meaning \`Mighty wins in the dying minutes’) was coined. In 1970, Makwaza’a defensive partner in the national team Dick Chama joined Wanderers from Bancroft Blades although he returned to Blades after a season, at the end of which Wanderers finished second on the league table after Kabwe Warriors who ascended to the championship when the National Football League awarded them points for a match against Mindola United who had used an unregistered player. The decision took Warriors above Wanderers in the league standings, who in turn boycotted the prize giving ceremony and returned the runners-up trophy and prize money in protest.Mulenga, Alfred \\"1970 – The ‘controversial year’\\" Times of Zambia, 29 December 1970 p. 9 Wanderers also had the distinction of featuring three brothers from the Nkole family in the same team – Abraham (who was a goalkeeper but at times played as a striker), and defenders Patrick and Edward. One memorable moment for the three was the 1971 Castle Cup final at Dag Hammarskjoeld Stadium in Ndola when they featured in the victorious Wanderers’ team; with Abraham delivering a hat-trick to steer his team to a hard-fought 5–4 win against a resilient Roan United who had trailed 4–1 at the interval. Bernard ‘the Bomber’ Chanda was a major signing from Roan United in 1971, finishing the season as joint top scorer in the Zambian league in 1973 although Wanderers had failed to win a single cup in the previous season as Warriors swept all the silverware on offer. They won the Castle Cup two years running in 1973–74, which they would keep for good as a new trophy was introduced. They were also the first winners of the Champion of Champions trophy in 1974 against town mates Blackpool though they finished as runners-up to Green Buffaloes in the league. They would go on to win the Champion of Champions cup six more times. By virtue of winning the Champion of Champions trophy, Wanderers were Zambia's first representatives in the inaugural African Cup Winners Cup in 1975, the same year that Ackim Musenge joined the team from another Mufulira side Butondo Western Tigers together with Brines Mulenga and George Mungule. They lost to eventual winners Tonnerre Yaoundé of Cameroun in the quarter-finals. Later in the year, the Independence Cup replaced the Castle Cup and Wanderers’ name was the first to be etched on the new trophy when they beat Green Buffaloes 2–1 in Lusaka. They however had to give up the cup the following year to town mates Blackpool who beat Butondo 4–3 in the final. The emergence of Warriors with Godfrey Chitalu in red-hot form meant Wanderers faced stiff competition in the league. The Kabwe team won the league 3 times in a row as did Green Buffaloes so Wanderers had to wait until 1976 for their first title of the seventies. By this time, Ndhlovu had retired and striker Thomas Bwalya emerged as a key player who placed 5th during the voting for African Footballer of the Year in 1977, won by Tunisia's Dhiab Tarek.Oliver, Guy (2007) Almanac of World Football 2008 – The definitive guide to the global game. Headline Publishing Group Zambian international midfielder Evans Katebe was another dependable player during this period. Wanderers made history by becoming the first Zambian club to make it to the semi-finals of the Africa Club Champions Cup by beating Mouloudia Club d'Alger of Algeria 3–2 on aggregate in September 1977, after goals by Bwalya and Benson Musonda saw them wipe out a 2–1 first leg deficit.Sikazwe, Sam \\"Mighty Wanderers Sail Through\\" Times of Zambia 25 September 1977 p. 10 In the semi-finals, they faced Hearts of Oak of Ghana in the first leg in Lusaka. Bwalya was on target once again, scoring a brace as Wanderers triumphed 5–2 but were eliminated on away goals after Hearts prevailed 3–0 in Accra. Wanderers repeated the feat the following year but this time in the Africa Cup Winners Cup when their quarter-final opponents Navy of Zanzibar withdrew but they lost the semi-final to Algerian club Milaha Athletic Hussein Dey (MAHD) featuring a 19-year-old Rabah Madjer, again on the away goals rule with a 2–2 aggregate score after winning the home leg 2–1. Later that year, player power forced out the club's McDonald Mtine-led executive after some friction between members and the new management team which saw the return of former Chairman Efford Chirwa, celebrated a seventh league title at the end of the season.Chola, Gunston & Lwanga Davies “Wanderers players fire executive” Times of Zambia, 8 August 1978 p. 8 When the Mighty men won the league title in 1978, it would be their last league triumph for almost 20 years. As Zambian Champions, Wanderers represented Zambia in the Africa Club Champions Cup in 1979. After defeating Simba of Tanzania 4–0 in Dar es Salaam in the first leg of the first round, Wanderers hosted the Tanzanians for the second leg on 1 April 1979 in Lusaka, in what appeared to be a formality game. It turned out to be a catastrophe as Wanderers were thrashed 5–0 and dumped out of the competition 4–5 on aggregate. The local press had a field day calling it Wanderers’ ‘most miserable performance in history’ and ‘a big April Fool’s Day affair.'Sikazwe, Sam (1979) \\"Wanderers Bow Out in Disgrace\\" Times of Zambia, 2 April 1979 p. 8 =1980–1989: League title eludes Wanderers= After winning the league title in 1978, Wanderers experienced several near-misses for the next 15 years, and their record of 7 league titles was surpassed by rivals Nkana FC who set a new record of 11 league wins. They however continued to dominate cup competitions, earning the tag of Zambia’s most ‘winningest team’, and becoming known as the ‘legendary cup fighters’ as they filled up their Chawama Hall trophy cabinet with all the cups on the local scene. Ashols Melu joined the team in 1980 from Konkola Blades and Efford Chabala also established himself as first choice goalkeeper. The following year, brothers Benjamin and Kalusha Bwalya crossed over from Mufulira Blackpool and Wanderers would consistently finish in the top 5 of the league, finishing second in 1984, 1985 and 1989. In the mid- eighties, players such as Charles Musonda and Johnson Bwalya featured prominently for Wanderers and when Chabala just missed out on the Footballer of the Year award to Kabwe Warriors’ Jack Chanda in 1985, it prevented what would have been a five-year clean sweep after wins by Melu (1983), Kalusha Bwalya (1984), Johnson Bwalya (1986) and Melu again in 1987. At the end of 1985, Kalusha left to play professional soccer with Cercle Brugge in Belgium and was followed by Musonda the following year. Wanderers beat Nkana 2–1 to win the BP Challenge Cup in July 1986 at the end of which Johnson also left for Swiss club Fribourg. The team enjoyed several cup successes in this period such as the Heroes & Unity Cup in 1985, 1987 and 1988 and the Independence Cup of 1988. In 1989, Melu signed up with Greek club Olympiacos for $100,000 which is still the record fee received by Wanderers for a player transfer. =1990–99: League title returns to Shinde= When Melu's European career ended in 1992, he returned to find coach Ackim Musenge had left for greener pastures in Botswana so he joined the coaching bench with the team wallowing in mid-table. The following season, he replaced Michael Kapembwa as head coach and led the Mufulira team to second position at the end of the season.Chirwa, Dingi \\"Coach Melu bemoans Wanderers raw deal,\\" The Weekly Post, 21 Nov – 3 Dec 1992, p. 20 In 1994, Wanderers led the table for most of the season but faltered in the last 3 games and surrendered the lead and the title to Power Dynamos. The disappointment was blamed on Melu's frequent absences on national duty as he was one of the Zambian national team's assistant coaches.Siame, Exildah \\"Mighty heap blame on Melu\\" Times of Zambia, 20 January 1995 p. 8 The team carried on built around Collins Mbulo, Justin Kunda, Allan Kamwanga, Alex Musungu, Bilton Musonda, Vincent Mutale, Paul Chellah and Nelson Banda. The long wait for the league championship finally ended with back to back titles in 1995 and 1996. In January 1997 Melu died and his assistant George Lwandamina took over as coach, assisted by Frederick Kashimoto. Wanderers lost the league title to Dynamos but retained the Challenge Cup and this turned out to be their last trophy to date. When Allan Kamwanga served as Zambian captain in May 1998 in a COSAFA Cup game against Mozambique in Lusaka, it meant no less than six Wanderers players had captained the country – Ndhlovu, Makwaza, Musenge, Melu, Chabala and Kamwanga. =2000–2009: Relegation= The end of the nineties saw a change in Wanderers’ fortunes. The changing economic horizon saw Mufulira Mine taken over in a wholesale privatisation exercise and the new owners Mopani Copper Mine did not place recreational activities at the top of their priority list. Furthermore, conflicts within the club's executive did not help matters, with two rival executives fighting for control of the club at one point. In 2000, the unthinkable happened; reduced funding meant Wanderers were no longer able to compete against their rivals and poor performance in the league culminated in their relegation to Division I when they finished 4th from the bottom. By a stroke of good fortune, Railway Express, a team which ended the season above them was disbanded and Wanderers retained their Super League status though there was an uproar from several quarters, not least from the teams which were next in line for promotion from the first division. However, the decision stood and Wanderers continued in the Super League.Kachingwe, Chris & Kambikambi, Yuyo \\"FAZ saves ‘Mighty’\\" Times of Zambia, 24 January 2001, p12 In 2002, they found themselves in the same situation. Needing a win to survive relegation in their final game of the season against Nkwazi FC at Shinde on 16 November 2002, Wanderers could only manage a goalless draw and were demoted causing untold anguish among their fans. Reports went round of Wanderers trying to avoid relegation by pushing for an increase in the number of teams but lightning could not strike twice as the behind-the-scene manoeuvres came to nought and Wanderers found themselves playing Division I football the following season. This was the first time Wanderers had ever been relegated. In 2004, Wanderers finished 2nd in Division I (North) and won promotion back to the top league but sponsorship and administration problems persisted and they made a swift return to the second tier. Wanderers continued to struggle in Division I (North) under reduced funding from Mopani Copper Mines and regularly fallen short of the promotion places. In 2009, they were in strong contention for elevation behind fellow fallen giants Nkana FC, with Kamwanga as coach. While Nkana won promotion, Wanderers missed out on the second promotion slot to Ndola Lime. =2010-2017: Struggles in Division I and return to the Premier League= In 2010, Kamwanga was replaced with former teammate Harrison Chongo, with the team drifting towards the relegation places.Tembo, Benedict, \\"Wawa: Hard-tackling, skilful defender\\" Zambia Daily Mail 12 March 2011, p. 10 The team started out well in the 2011 season and was second on the table but tragedy struck when Chongo was taken ill at half-time during a league game against Prison Leopards on 11 May 2011. He was rushed to hospital where he was treated for high-blood pressure but died the following day.Kumwenda, Victor \\"Harrison ‘Wawa’ Chongo dies\\" Zambia Daily Mail 13 May 2011 p. 12 The team then fell off the two promotion places. Wanderers finished the 2011 season in 4th position with 13 wins, 5 defeats and 16 draws. When the team lost 4 league games only two months into the 2012 season, coach Kellies 'Paymaster' Mwaba was replaced by former Nchanga Rangers Assistant Coach Israel Mwanza in June 2012. After a reasonable start, the team dropped off towards the end and finished the season in 7th position. When the 2013 season kicked off, Wanderers started with a point from their opening two games and this prompted the club to re-hire former coach, midfield legend Frederick Kashimoto. Mwanza briefly left Mufulira for Chingola in protest against the appointment until it was clarified that Kashimoto was coming in as an assistant coach. However, the poor results continued with a draw and two more losses in the next three games and in the last week of April 2013, the club executive announced that Mwanza had been fired and replaced by Emmanuel Nthala with Frederick Kashimoto as Technical Advisor, in an interim capacity, who led the team to 2–1 win away to Ndola United in their first match in charge. In October 2013, both Kashimoto and Nthala were fired with Wanderers facing relegation in 14th position in the 18-team Division I North League, with 24 points from 26 matches. Moses Kashimoto was appointed as player-coach in an interim capacity. The team was almost demoted and finished the season in 14th place, only one place above the relegation places with seven wins, sixteen draws and eleven defeats. In February 2014, former Zambian international defender Manfred Chabinga was named coach and tasked with returning Wanderers to the top league. He achieved this when Wanderers won promotion with a game to spare after coming from behind to draw with Grinaker FC in Chililabombwe and end a nine-year hiatus from the Zambian Premier League. Wanderers went on to lose the final league match 1–0 to Ndola United at Shinde to end the season in second place with 64 points, one behind champions Forest Rangers and a point ahead of Kalulushi Modern Stars. Wanderers marked an impressive return to the Zambian top league by finishing in 5th position in the 2015 season. With the 2016 season barely a few weeks old, Chabinga announced that he had resigned citing frustration with reports from Mufulira suggesting the club executive members meddled in team selection and had conducted player transfers without consulting him. The club then tried to appoint Egyptian Ahmed Suliman but had to backtrack when it emerged that he did not have the qualifications required to coach a Super Division side. Chabinga's former assistant Chewe Mulenga was appointed interim coach until July 2016 when Portuguese Paulo Jorge Silva signed a two-year deal. What started out as an indifferent season turned into a downward spiral with the team going on a seven-game winless streak which culminated in a 4-0 humiliation to league leaders Zanaco on 10 September 2016. The result saw Wanderers slide into the relegation zone with four wins, seven defeats and fourteen draws and led to the sacking of Silva. Ahmed Suliman who had gone back to Egypt in the interim period and obtained his CAF 'C' Licence, was appointed in his place. The team managed to preserve their Super League status thanks to back to back victories over NAPSA Stars and ZESCO United, which were their sixth and seventh wins of the season, to finish in 11th position. At the end of the season, they set an unenviable record for the most draws with eighteen. An exodus of several key players during the off season saw Wanderers kick off the 2017 season with new faces and the team lost their first two games of the season including an embarrassing 4-1 home defeat to promotion side City of Lusaka and when Suliman took a swipe at the club's executive for letting go of influential players, he was sacked for admonishing the executive in the media. Moses Kashimoto took charge on temporary basis but could not prevent a 6-0 thrashing at the hands of defending champions Zanaco. Former National Assembly, Nakambala Leopards and Napsa Stars coach Wilson Mwale was then engaged on a three-year deal but his first game ended in a 2-0 defeat to Lumwana Radiants leaving Wanderers bottom of the twenty team league with one goal scored and fifteen conceded. Mwale however said he was confident of turning the situation around. “Let the supporters remain calm,\\" he said in an interview with the Zambia Daily Mail. \\"I have taken over teams in worse conditions than Wanderers before, let them give me a bit of time. I think Mighty will be back where it is supposed to be. This is just the fourth game. Yes, we are losing for now but results will come very soon.\\" After 22 league matches, Mwale had only managed to win three and with the team still stuck in the relegation zone, the club's executive decided to move him up to the position of Technical Director and replaced him with his former assistant Justin Chinama. Despite an improvement in results, Wanderers could only finish fourth from bottom and were demoted at the end of the season. However Wanderers won promotion in the 2018 season with one game to spare. Colours and badge From the time the club was founded, its home colours were green and white stripes, white shorts and green socks until the 1970s when all green shirts were introduced. This has remained Wanderers' preferred kit over the years though at times, they have used an all green strip. During the 1982 season, blue shirts and white shorts were introduced and in 1985, the team used an all blue strip. The 2016 season saw the return of the striped shirts reminiscent of the most successful period in the team's history, though this time with green shorts. The Wanderers away strip has more often than not been all white, which is what the team is using currently. The current kits are designed by Mafro. Wanderers were one of the first Zambian clubs to have a company's logo on its shirts, when they had Huyeco on their shirts in 1986. Since then, the name on the front of Wanderers' shirts has often been that of their main sponsors such as Mufulira Division of ZCCM in the late '80s and Mopani Copper Mines in 2014. However, there were several seasons in between when their shirts did not carry a company logo and when the club won the Zambian Premier League title in 1997 after a long period of failure, the shirts carried the club's nickname 'Mighty'. Wanderers currently have a kit sponsorship deal with Dickinson, a company contracted to Mopani. For the most part, Wanderers' shirts did not carry a badge until the late '80's when a simple green and white ball surrounded by the words 'Mighty Mufulira Wanderers FC' was introduced, though it did not appear in all of the subsequent seasons. At the same time that the NATSAVE sponsorship was announced in April 2015, a new club logo was unveiled and it incorporates the team's year of establishment, a mine shaft, the team's nicknames surrounding a football on a shield, with a ribbon bearing the team's name at the bottom. Stadium Shinde Stadium is Wanderers’ home ground and is located in Section Eight of Mufulira mine township. It was opened in 1962 and prior to that, the team used Mutende ground which used to be in what is now Section Five of the mine township. The capacity of Shinde is 12,000 and the ground hosted national team matches in the sixties and seventies. In the early eighties, Shinde was closed for renovations so Wanderers used Central Sports Ground for their home matches for the 1981 and 1982 seasons although this was also closed for part of 1981 after fans stoned visiting teams. Wanderers then had to use John Yumba Kachofa Stadium, the home of Mufulira Blackpool. In June 2005 Wanderers lost a league match to 2–1 to Red Arrows at Shinde and fans accused the referee of biased officiating and ran amok. The riot left several vehicles damaged and the Football Association of Zambia responded by closing the stadium for the rest of the season. In August 2008, Wanderers fans again rioted at Shinde when a league match against Kitwe United was abandoned following a pitch invasion when the home team conceded a late equalizer. The fans later took their anger into the stadium car park were they damaged United's team bus and official's vehicles. The punishment was again closure of the stadium for the rest of the season. In July 2012, Mopani Copper Mine announced an allocation of US$100,000 for rehabilitation works at Shinde, conceding that the facility was in a state of disrepair. Phase one was planned to enhance security of the infrastructure before major rehabilitation works could commence. It involved construction of a wall boundary, perimeter fencing of the playing surface, referees' changing rooms and toilets and was completed in early April 2013. The second phase will involve work on the grandstand, terraces, electrical works, the camp house and club offices, Chawama Hall and sports complex and players' dressing rooms.Kapembwa, Darious. \\"Shinde works on course\\" The Post 12 April 2013 p. 38 Wanderers planned to use John Yumba Kachofa Stadium for their home games during the 2013 season but had to change plans and moved to the much smaller Central Sports Ground after the collapse of a section of the perimeter wall at Kachofa Stadium. Wanderers returned to Shinde halfway through the 2014 season and this added impetus to their promotion push. And at the end of the 2014 season, they secured promotion to the Super League after finishing second to Forest Rangers with a point's difference. Shinde recently received a facelift and jointly hosted the COSAFA Under 20 Men's Tournament with Nkana Stadium in Kitwe sponsored by Mopani. These renovations are on-going.

Soon after arriving, he sees a boy and is instantly attracted to him. He later discovers that the boy is Clifford, the son of his next door neighbor. Clifford and Brady quickly become friends and hang out together. Brady is obviously uncomfortable around girls, so Clifford teaches him some moves that may help him out. During one such session, Clifford feels Brady's crotch; Brady jumps away, and Clifford teases him that he is aroused. Brady avoids Clifford for a while, but then starts hanging out with him again. A little while later, Clifford kisses him and Brady flees. He later confronts Clifford about the fact that he is gay and the two of them avoid each other. In the meantime, Brady is being set up by his mother with Peggy, a Christian girl who realizes that Brady is gay. While Brady and Clifford are on the outs, Peggy asks Brady if he has boy troubles, which Brady angrily denies. Eventually, Brady goes back to see Clifford and the two of them start kissing. Brady flees, confused by what is happening to him and torn between his religious beliefs and his strong feelings. He decides to go with his feelings and eventually sleeps with Clifford. Brady's mom knows something is wrong, but can't figure out what it is. The night that Clifford and Brady sleep together, Brady had told her that he was being driven to a church sleepover by Peggy. When he gets back the next day, she tells him that Peggy was in a car accident and confronts him about what is happening. He tells her that he is gay and she reacts badly and pressures him into breaking up with Clifford. She also gets Brady to go to a camp to \\"fix\\" him. Clifford is heartbroken and goes to join his dad in Barcelona, but not before asking Brady to reconsider. Brady says he can't, but then goes home to his mother and refuses to go to the camp. She insists that he is making the biggest mistake of his life and he says that he already has.

It was active from about 1996 through 1998 and disbanded in 2001. History The organization was announced on May 20, 1996, chaired by Chris Gladwin of Zenith Data Systems. It first based its technology on the RangeLAN2 products licensed by Proxim Wireless, which were originally developed around 1994. The RangeLAN2 name was later changed to OpenAir, and IEEE 802.11 standards were later mentioned, although the Wi-Fi Alliance controlled the trademark for those protocols. In 1998 Mike Jones of Intermec Technologies was its chairman and its membership included: AMP (now part of Tyco Electronics), Citadel, Cruise Technologies, Data General, Fujitsu Personal Systems, Hand Held Products, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, IDWare, Intermec Technologies, Kansai, Kinetic Computer, LXE, MaxTech, Mitsubishi Electronics America, Monarch Marketing Systems (subsidiary of Paxar, then part of Avery Dennison), Motorola, NEC Computer Systems Division, Percon (formerly a division of PSC Inc., later IntelliTrack), Proxim Wireless and Sharp Corporation. Hand Held Products (later Honeywell) marketed Dolphin RF devices to extend Ethernet and a barcode scanner. RangeLAN2 RangeLAN2 was a broad family of wireless devices developed by Proxim Wireless, and is a trademark of that company. It also refers to the RangeLAN2, used by these devices, which was subsequently officially renamed OpenAir. RangeLAN2 devices have typical bandwidths of about 2 Mbit/s, and an indoor range of about , similar to 802.11b. RangeLAN2 uses spread-spectrum radio transmission technology. These devices can interoperate with 802.11b and can still be used today. Support for RangeLAN2 products was aimed primarily at the Microsoft Windows market, but drivers for some RangeLAN2 products (such as PCMCIA cards) for Mac OS 9 were developed, although these did not get wide distribution. Linux drivers were also developed for many RangeLAN2 devices. Typical RangeLAN2 figures: * Radio Data Rate: 1.6 Mbit/s per channel, 800 kbit/s fallback rate * Channels: Supports 15 independent, non-interfering \\"virtual channels\\" * Official Indoor Range: Up to 500 feet (~150 m) radius (not necessarily reached in practice) * Official Outdoor range: 1,000+ feet (300+ m) radius OpenAir The protocol operated in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and used frequency hopping with 0.8 and 1.6 Mbit/s bit rates via 2 or 4 bits per symbol frequency-shift keying modulation. This protocol was in use prior to the adoption of the IEEE 802.11b standard, and was in competition with it, and uses approximately the same portion of the radio spectrum. When 802.11b was adopted as a standard, the RangeLAN2 market began to contract and OpenAir use declined.

After the dissolution of the German Imperial Admiralty (Kaiserliche Admiralität) on 1 April 1889, the Imperial Naval High Command, the Office of the Inspector-General of the Navy, and the Imperial Naval Office (Reichsmarineamt) were established as successor institutions. The Imperial Naval High Command was headed by a commanding admiral, directly subordinate to the emperor, Wilhelm II of Germany. With the same obligations and rights as a commanding general of the army, this admiral fulfilled the duties of a Chief of the Naval Staff. Under instructions from the emperor, he commanded all naval units at sea and ashore. When the German Emperor decided to take over the supreme command of the Navy himself on 14 March 1899, the Imperial Naval High Command was disbanded. This happened mainly at the instigation of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, to increase the power of his Imperial Naval Office (Reichsmarineamt). Some of the powers of the Imperial Naval High Command were transferred to the previously existing Admiralty Staff.

Russia's space industry comprises more than 100 companies and employs 250,000 people. Most of the companies are descendants of Soviet design bureaux and state production companies. The industry entered a deep crisis following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, with its fullest effect occurring in the last years of the 1990s. Funding of the space program declined by 80% and the industry lost a large part of its work force before recovery began in the early 2000s. Many companies survived by creating joint- ventures with foreign firms and marketing their products abroad. In the mid-2000s, as part of the general improvement in the economy, funding of the country's space program was substantially increased and a new ambitious federal space plan was introduced, resulting in a great boost to the industry. Its largest company is RKK Energiya, the main manned space flight contractor. Leading launch vehicle producers are Khrunichev and TsSKB-Progress. The largest satellite developer is ISS Reshetnev, while NPO Lavochkin is the main developer of interplanetary probes. , a major reorganization of the Russian space industry is underway, with increased state supervision and involvement of the ostensibly private companies formed in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  History = Post-Soviet adjustments = The Mir space station in 1998 The space industry of the Soviet Union was a formidable, capable and well-funded complex, which scored a number of great successes. Spending on the space program peaked in 1989, when its budget totaled 6.9 billion rubles, amounting to 1.5% of the Soviet Union's gross domestic product.Harvey, pp.7-8 During the perestroika period of the late 1980s, the space program's funding began to decrease, and this was seriously accelerated by the economic hardships of the 1990s. The Russian Federation inherited the major part of the infrastructure and companies of the Soviet program (while others, such as Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, became Ukrainian), but found itself unable to continue the appropriate level of financing. By 1998, the space program's funding had been cut by 80%. To coordinate the country's space activities, on 25 February 1992, the Russian Federal Space Agency was created. During Soviet times, there had been no central agency; instead, the design bureaus had been very powerful. To an extent, this continued during the first years of the agency, which suffered from a lack of authority while the design bureaus fought to survive in the difficult environment.Harvey, p.281-282 = The crisis years = In 1993, the most prestigious program of the industry, the Buran space shuttle, was canceled. It had been worked on for 20 years by the industry's best companies, and the cancellation immediately resulted in a 30% reduction in the industry's work force. 300,000 people worked in the industry at the end of 1994,Harvey, p.8 down from 400,000 in 1987,Harvey, p.6 and the space program's funding now amounted to just 0.23% of the country's budget. The final phase of the space program's contradiction took place during the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Much of the budgeted money never arrived at the companies. The space industry continued to shed work force, and soon only 100,000 people remained. Wages were also cut: for example at the leading rocket engine producer NPO Energomash, the average monthly salary during this time was 3,000 rubles ($104).Harvey, p.9 The space industry's physical infrastructure declined greatly, and this was symbolised by a roof collapse in 2001 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome which destroyed the Buran shuttle which had flown the one and only flight of the program in 1988. No funds were available to look after the shuttle's hangar in Baikonur and it collapsed on the shuttle in May 2002.  Foreign partnerships  Entrance to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow. Since 1994, Khrunichev's Proton-M rocket has earned Russia's space industry $4.3 billion. During the crisis years, of the main ways for the industry's companies to survive was to look for foreign partnerships. In this respect, Khrunichev was particularly successful. On 15 April 1993 Khrunichev created the Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia joint venture with the American company Lockheed. In 1995, due to the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, it was transformed into International Launch Services (ILS). The joint venture marketed launches on both the Proton and the American Atlas rockets. The United States had given permission for the appearance of Proton on the international launch market, but introduced a quota to protect the launch market from \\"Russian dumping.\\" Despite this, the Proton, built by Khrunichev, was successful and by the end of 2000 had earned launch contracts worth over $1.5 billion. Since 1994, the Proton has earned $4.3 billion for the Russian space industry as a whole, and in 2011 this figure is expected to raise to $6 billion.Statement by Vladimir Ye.Nesterov, Khrunichev Director-General, at Press Conference on 15 July 2010 Khruhichev 2010-07-29. Another successful company was Energomash, whose extremely powerful RD-180 engine was installed on American Atlas V rockets. The rocket's manufacturer Lockheed Martin initially bought 101 RD-180 engines from Energomash, earning the company $1 billion in hard currency.Harvey, p.197 = New federal space plan = A GLONASS-K satellite, produced by Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems In the early 2000s, during Vladimir Putin's presidency, the Russian economy started recovering, growing more each year than in all of the previous decade. The funding outlook for Russia's space program started to look more favourable. In 2001, the development of the GLONASS satellite navigation system was made a government priority with the introduction of a new Federal Targeted Program. The main contractor for GLONASS, NPO PM (later renamed ISS Reshetnev), thus received a boost in its finances. In total, 4.8 billion rubles was allocated for the space program in 2001, of which 1.6 billion was earmarked for GLONASS.Harvey, p.284 By 2004, Russia's space spending had grown to 12 billion rubles. In 2005, a new strategy for the development of the country's space program, titled the Federal Space Plan 2006–2015, was approved. It stipulated the completion of the International Space Station, development of the Angara rocket family, introduction of a new manned spacecraft and completion of the GLONASS constellation, among others.Harvey, p.317 In the mid-2000s, funding of the space program continued to improve substantially, amounting to 21.59 billion rubles in 2005 and rising to 23 billion rubles in 2006. In 2007, 24.4 billion rubles was spent on the civilian space program, while the military space program's budget was 11 billion rubles. The industry also continued to receive very substantial funds from exports and foreign partnerships.Harvey, p.285 Under Dmitry Medvedev's presidency, space technology was named of the key areas of the country's modernisation programme. Spending increased to 82 billion rubles ($2.4 billion) in 2009. In 2011, the government is planning to spend 115 billion rubles ($3.8 bln) in the national space programs. =2013 reorganization of the Russian space sector= As a result of a series of reliability problems, and proximate to the failure of a July 2013 Proton M launch, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry was undertaken. The United Rocket and Space Corporation was formed as a joint-stock corporation by the government in August 2013 to consolidate the Russian space sector. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said \\"the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems.\\" Three days following the Proton M launch failure, the Russian government had announced that \\"extremely harsh measures\\" would be taken \\"and spell the end of the [Russian] space industry as we know it.\\" Preliminary information indicates that the government intends to reorganize in such a way as to \\"preserve and enhance the Roscosmos space agency.\\"  Structure of the industry  A Soyuz- FG rocket launching a Soyuz-TMA spacecraft. Soyuz-FG is produced by TsSKB Progress, while Soyuz-TMA is made by RKK Energia The largest company of Russia's space industry is RKK Energiya. It is the country's main human spaceflight contractor, the lead developer of the Soyuz-TMA and Progress spacecraft and the Russian end of the International Space Station. It employs around 22,000-30,000 people.Harvey, p.268 Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center (TsSKB Progress) is the developer and producer of the famous Soyuz launch vehicle. The Soyuz-FG version is used to launch manned spacecraft, while the international joint-venture Starsem markets commercial satellite launches on the other versions. TsSKB Progress is currently leading the development of a new launcher called Rus-M, which is to replace the Soyuz. Moscow-based Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center is one of the commercially most successful companies of the space industry. It is the developer of the Proton-M rocket and the Fregat upper stage. The company's new Angara rocket family is expected to be put into service 2013. The largest satellite manufacturer in Russia is ISS Reshetnev (formerly called NPO PM). It is main contractor for the GLONASS satellite navigation program and produces the Ekspress series of communications satellites. The company is located in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai, and employs around 6,500 people. The leading rocket engine company is NPO Energomash, designer and producer of the famous RD-180 engine. In electric spacecraft propulsion, OKB Fakel, located in Kaliningrad Oblast, is one of the top companies. NPO Lavochkin is Russia's main planetary probe designer.

In object-oriented languages, access to objects is achieved through references (or, equivalently, pointers). A typical call is of the form: x.f(a, ...) where f denotes an operation and x denotes a reference to some object. At execution time, however, a reference can be void (or null). In such cases, the call above will be a void call, leading to a run-time exception, often resulting in abnormal termination of the program. Void safety is a static (compile-time) guarantee that no void calls will ever arise. History In a 2009 talk, Tony Hoare traced the invention of the null pointer to his design of the Algol W language and called it a \\"mistake\\": Bertrand Meyer introduced the term \\"void safety\\".Bertrand Meyer: Attached Types and their Application to Three Open Problems of Object-Oriented Programming, in ECOOP 2005 (Proceedings of European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Edinburgh, 25–29 July 2005), ed.

It contains a wide variety of natural formations. It is the ninth longest cave in South Dakota. It measures a distance of . It was discovered in 1876 when a log flume that supplied water to mining operations in town of Hayward broke and spilled onto the side of the hill. As the water flowed down the hill it started flowing into a small hole in the hillside. The local miners who went up to fix the flume noticed this abnormality and became suspicious of where this water was going. After fixing the flume, the men decided to go inside and explore. After about , the men came to a large drop off which went down about . They exited the cave, and went out into the woods where they cut down a tree and then used this tree as a ladder to access the cave. The miners then noticed that the majority of the cave was made out of limestone. Knowing that limestone doesn't contain any gold deposits, they abandoned the cave as a mining opportunity, and left it alone. Some of the local townspeople heard news of this discovery, and became very curious as to what they might find inside the cave. The cave was created by a very long process stretching over a 360 million year time period. It started during the Mississippian Period, during which the entire Black Hills area was covered by a large inland sea. In this sea lived many kinds of sea creatures, and crustaceans. As these sea creatures died, their bodies sunk down to the sea floor. The flesh rotted away leaving behind many solid bone fragments which then compressed, and over time hardened into a rock known as limestone. The cave has a cornucopia of rooms including the Entrance Room, Post Office, Image Room, Big Room, Fairyland, Rope Room, Geode Room, The Rouge Room (Party Room), Arrowhead Room, and the Floral Room. The cave also includes boxwork and many dripstone formations including stalactites, stalagmites, columns, helictites and flowstone.

He served as Bishop of Columbus from 1868 until his death in 1878. Life and church The body of Bishop Rosecrans is entombed in St. Joseph Cathedral (Columbus, Ohio). Sylvester Rosecrans was born in Homer, Ohio, to Crandell and Jane (née Hopkins) Rosecrans. His father's family originally came from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and settled near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania before moving to Kingston Township, Ohio. His mother was the granddaughter of Stephen Hopkins, the Colonial Governor of Rhode Island and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and grandniece of Esek Hopkins, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy during the Revolutionary War. Sylvester was the youngest of four sons, who included William Rosecrans, who would later become a famed Union general of the Civil War. Raised in a Methodist family, Rosecrans was raised in Licking County and attended Kenyon College, an Episcopalian institution. While attending Kenyon, he received a letter from his brother William in 1845, announcing his conversion to Catholicism. Sylvester was received into the Catholic Church that same year and, leaving Kenyon, enrolled at St. John's College in Fordham, New York. After graduating from St. John's in 1846 with high honors, he decided to enter the priesthood and was sent by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell to study at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome. He there earned his doctorate in theology and was ordained priest by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi June 5, 1852. After touring through Italy, France, England, and Ireland, Rosecrans returned to the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and was appointed pastor of St. Thomas Church in Cincinnati. He was then assigned as a curate at St. Peter in Chains Cathedral and a professor at Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West. In 1859 Archbishop Purcell opened a college for Catholic youth in connection with the seminary and named Rosecrans as its President. However, the college was later closed with the outbreak of the Civil War. On December 23, 1861, Rosecrans was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati and Titular Bishop of Pompeiopolis by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on March 25, 1862 from Archbishop Purcell, with Bishops Martin John Spalding and John Henry Luers serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Cathedral. Following the consecration of Edward Fitzgerald as Bishop of Little Rock, Arkansas, in February 1867, Rosecrans replaced him as pastor of St. Patrick Church in Columbus. He was named the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Columbus on March 3, 1868. The new diocese included Central, South Central, and Southeastern Ohio, roughly running from the Scioto River on the west across to the Ohio River along the east, and comprised 32 parishes and about 41,000 Catholics. No railroad had as yet penetrated some of the counties, and Rosecrans was forced to make many of the journeys on his visitations by stagecoach, wagon, or steamboat. He was excused from participating in the First Vatican Council (1869–1870) in order to attend to the needs of his new diocese. During his 10-year-long tenure, Rosecrans founded St. Aloysius Seminary for young men in 1871, solemnly dedicated the diocese to the Sacred Heart in December 1873, and established the diocesan newspaper, The Catholic Columbian, in 1875. He also founded St. Mary's of the Springs Academy for Young Ladies, St. Joseph's Academy, St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, and Sacred Heart Convent. But his greatest achievement was the construction of St. Joseph's Cathedral, which cost $220,000 and was consecrated on October 20, 1878. He died the next day, aged 51. There is a high school in Zanesville, Ohio named after him called Bishop Rosecrans High School.

Impaired driving is punishable under multiple offences in the Criminal Code, with greater penalties depending on the harm caused by the impaired driving. It can also result in various types of driver's licence suspensions. There is a related, parallel offence of driving with a blood alcohol level which exceeds eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood (.08). The penalties are identical for impaired driving and driving with a BAC greater than .08. The Criminal Code gives the police and peace officers a number of powers to assist in the enforcement of the applicable laws, and there are a number of presumptions that assist in the prosecution of offences. History One of the first reported criminal cases regarding drinking and driving in Canada was an Alberta decision in 1920 called R. v. Nickle. In that case, the appeal court found that the act of driving while intoxicated was an unlawful act that could support a manslaughter conviction.Rex v. Nickle (1920), 34 C.C.C 15 (S.C. Alta. App. Div.) In 1921, the Parliament of Canada first created a summary conviction offence for drinking and driving, called \\"driving while intoxicated\\". At the time, the courts interpreted intoxication to mean substantial inebriation, and more than just being under the influence of alcohol. The minimum penalty for the first offence was seven days in jail. The minimum penalty for the second offence was one month in jail. The minimum penalty for a third offence was three months in jail. In 1925, Parliament amended the Criminal Code to include a new offence of driving while intoxicated by a narcotic. The offences were also amended to include \\"care or control\\" of a motor vehicle, not just driving. (See below.)Impaired Driving in Canada, p 1. In 1930, Parliament changed the offence to a hybrid offence, giving the Crown the option to proceed with the more serious indictable offence procedure.Impaired Driving in Canada, p 2. Difficulties arose regarding how to prove someone was in care or control of a motor vehicle, and what the test should be. In 1947, Parliament amended the Criminal Code again, adding a presumption of care or control when a person was found sitting in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle. This did not answer all of the problems regarding the test (i.e. when a person is not found in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle). Many of the court's answers to those questions remain in conflict today. In 1951, Parliament re-worded the law, making it an offence to operate or have care or control of a motor vehicle while the driver's ability to operate the motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or other drugs. The breathalyzer was made into a practical police tool by Robert Frank Borkenstein in 1952, which allowed for the police to measure a person's blood alcohol concentration. The first Canadian test of the breathalyzer was in Ontario in 1954. By 1962, police were using the breathalyzer for \\"mass testing\\". However, the test was voluntary, and could only be used as confirmatory evidence. In 1969 (fifteen years after the introduction of the breathalyzer into Canada), Parliament created an offence of driving while \\"over 80\\" (over 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood). In 1976, Parliament made the penalty the same as driving while impaired, created the offence of refusing to provide a breath sample (with the same penalties), and created laws allowing the police to use roadside screening devices. Both offences are now set out in the same section of the Criminal Code, section 320.14. After 1976, there were additional changes to the minimum penalties, and the introduction of new offences (impaired driving causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death). By 2008, drinking and driving cases made up 12 per cent of all criminal charges, making it the largest single offence group. In 2008, it was estimated that 53,000 drinking and driving cases are heard every year in Canada. The conviction rate was 73 per cent, which exceeded the rate for all criminal convictions by 13 per cent. Notwithstanding the higher rate of conviction, drinking and driving cases are more likely to go to trial than any other criminal offence, and are often fought on both technical issues and alleged police violations of section 8, section 9, and section 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Impaired Driving in Canada, pp. 2–3 2008 also saw the most recent amendments by Parliament to the law on drinking and driving. The Tackling Violent Crime Act came into force on July 2, 2008. The changes included adding new evidentiary restrictions on defendants trying to raise \\"evidence to the contrary\\" regarding the presumption of a person's blood alcohol concentration, created mandatory standard field sobriety tests that can be requested by a police officer, created additional means to allow police officers to test for the possible presence of drugs in a driver's body, increased the minimum sentences to their current level ($1000 fine for the first offence, 30 days in jail for the second offence, and 120 days in jail for the third offence), and created new offences for \\"over 80\\" causing death or bodily harm and refusing to provide a sample where operation caused death or bodily harm.Impaired Driving in Canada, pp. 35–36 Testing for alcohol and drugs=Approved instrument demands= If a police officer has reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence under section 253 within the past three hours due to alcohol, they can demand that a person provide suitable breath samples into an approved instrument.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254.Impaired Driving Laws, Department of Justice. Note: DOJ lists the \\"post driving\\" restriction as two hours. The results of those samples may be introduced as evidence at a later trial. If it is later determined that the officer did not have reasonable grounds, then the taking of the breath samples violated the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the person can apply to have them excluded as evidence under section 24(2) of the Charter. Police officers can obtain reasonable grounds from observations they make and information they receive, including the results of the other demands listed below. These breath samples are typically taken at a police station by a qualified technician, after a person has been arrested. Blood samples If a person is unable to give breath samples (usually due to injuries suffered from a traffic collision), a police officer can make a demand for blood samples, under the direction of a medical doctor, and performed by the same doctor or a nurse. =Approved screening device demands= If a police officer has a reasonable suspicion that a person has alcohol in his or her body, and that he or she has been operating or has had care or control of a vehicle within the past three hours, the police officer can demand that person provide a suitable sample into an approved screening device. These devices are usually calibrated to display fail if a person has a BAC above 0.1 percent, warn or caution if a person has a BAC between 0.05 and 0.1 percent, and a numerical value if the person has a BAC below 0.05 percent. These breath samples are typically taken at the roadside by an investigating police officer. Typical observations supporting a reasonable suspicion is if a driver has an odour of an alcoholic beverage on their breath, or if they admit they had a drink. =Field sobriety tests= If a police officer has a reasonable suspicion that a person has alcohol or drugs in their body, and that they have been operating or have had care or control of a vehicle within the past three hours, they can demand that that person perform physical coordination tests, referred to as Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). SFSTs are requested in order to allow the officer to establish \\"reasonable grounds\\" for making an approved instrument demand, by establishing that there is reasonable and probable cause which lies at the point where \\"point where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion\\".Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc at p. 114, 115 \\"Reasonable grounds\\" is necessary to sustain the use of evidence obtained from the approved instrument demand, blood demand, or drug evaluation demand, and thereby support a conviction based on that demand. Commentary varies on whether a suspect can refuse taking SFSTs in Canada. Some sources, especially official ones, indicate that the SFSTs are mandatory,What are my rights if the police think I’ve been taking drugs and driving?, Steps to Justice (advises that FST is mandatory)Breathalyzer and roadside tests (Ont.), legalline.caAlcohol and Drug Impaired Driving - Tests, Criminal Charges, Penalties, Suspensions and Prohibitions - RCMP whereas other sources are silent on FST testing.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/what- must-i-legally-do-when-police-pull-me-over/article25829415/ What must I legally do when police pull me over?], Globe and Mail, 4-Aug-2015. Canada Criminal Code § 254(2)(a) provides that, \\"If a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol or a drug in their body and that the person has, within the preceding three hours, operated a motor vehicle ... the peace officer may, by demand, require the person ... to perform forthwith physical coordination tests\\".Criminal Code § 254, http://laws- lois.justice.gc.ca The assertion regarding mandatory compliance with an SFST demand is based on \\"failure to comply with a demand\\", as an offence under § 254(5) of the Criminal Code, but it is unclear whether § 254(5) applies to refusal of SFSTs (provided the suspect agrees to take an approved instrument chemical test). There are some reports that refusal to submit to an SFST can result in the same penalties as impaired driving. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether there has ever been a prosecution under this interpretation of \\"failure to comply with a demand\\" as applied to SFSTs. Canada Criminal Code § 254(1) and (5) addresses this, but only with respect to chemical testing (breath, blood, etc.)Canada Code §254 (full text of criminal code) (full text, .pdf) Of note, it is generally advised to comply with a demand to submit to the approved instrument chemical test. A legal challenge to sufficiency of \\"reasonable grounds\\" to submit to the approved instrument demand, blood demand, or drug evaluation demand, is typically addressed in court, under the Exclusionary Rule.Improperly or Illegally Obtained Evidence: The Exclusionary Evidence Rule in Canada , International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy (12-2005) (.pdf)cf., Exclusionary Rule (US) =Drug evaluations= If a police officer has reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence under § 253 within the past three hours due to drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol, they can demand that the person submit to an evaluation by an evaluating officer to determine if the person is impaired by drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol. If the evaluating officer has reasonable grounds that the person is impaired by alcohol, they can make an approved instrument demand. If the evaluating officer has reasonable grounds that the person is impaired by drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol, they can make a demand for blood or urine samples. Fatigue toxins and effects due to illness have been held to be drugs for the purposes of the statute. =Refusing to comply= If any of the above demands are lawfully made, it is a criminal offence to fail or refuse to comply with them, unless the person can show they had a reasonable excuse. The penalties are identical to the penalties for other drinking and driving offences. Proving blood alcohol concentration When a person gives a breath sample into an approved instrument by a qualified technician, a determination still needs to be made of what the person's BAC was at the time of the offence. That requires evidence of two things: *The person's BAC at the time of giving the breath samples, and *Based on the person's BAC at the time of giving the breath samples, the person's BAC at the time of the offence. =Presumption of accuracy= To work out the person's BAC at the time of giving the breath samples, the prosecutor can rely on a Certificate of a Qualified Technician, which states what the results were of the analysis of the breath samples, and is evidence of its contents.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, s. 258. This is commonly referred to as the presumption of accuracy. It is still open for the defence to call evidence showing why the results are not accurate, leaving it for the court to weigh the evidence. If there is no Certificate, or the Certificate is flawed, the prosecutor can always call the qualified technician to give evidence about the accuracy of the results. The prosecutor may still call the qualified technician if there is a Certificate in order to counter the defence's evidence. Typically, the Certificate will round the BAC results down to a hundredth of a percentage (e.g. 0.116 percent is truncated to 0.11 percent). =Presumption of identity= To work out the person's BAC at the time of the offence, the prosecutor generally needs to show the following: *The breath samples were taken as soon as practicable, *The first breath sample was taken within two hours of the offence, and *A second breath sample was taken 15 minutes or more after the first sample. If the three criteria are met, then the lower of the two results is presumed to be the person's BAC at the time of the offence. This is commonly referred to as the presumption of identity. The presumption can be rebutted two ways, depending on whether the defence is challenging the accuracy of the results. If defence is challenging the accuracy of the results, they need call evidence that shows: *the approved instrument was malfunctioning or not being operated properly, *the malfunction or improper operation resulted in a reading of a BAC in excess of 0.08 percent, and *the person's BAC would not have been in excess of 0.08 at the time of the offence. The last criteria is typically met by calling reliable evidence of how much the person had to drink prior to the offence, and expert evidence of what their BAC would have been at the time of the offence as a result of the drinking evidence. If defence is not challenging the accuracy of the results, they only need to call evidence on the last criteria, and have the expert give evidence why it would not be inconsistent with the breath sample readings. (This is typically called the \\"bolus drinking\\" scenario, primarily in Canadian jurisprudence.)\\"Bolus drinking\\" refers to the delay between consumption of alcohol, and absorption of the alcohol in the bloodstream. A prerequisite to most alcohol absorption is the alcohol passing the pyloric sphincter at the junction between the pylorus of the stomach and the duodenum of the small intestine. (interactive image at innerbody.com) This is also the reason for slower absorption of alcohol on a full stomach. If the prosecutor is unable to rely on the presumption of identity (usually because the first reading was taken outside of the two hours), they can still \\"read- back\\" the readings by calling their own expert evidence. Sentencing A person convicted for any drinking and driving offence (which includes a refuse to comply offence) faces an automatic Canada-wide driving prohibition, and either a fine or jail sentence and the possibility of probation. The minimum sentences are:Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255.Criminal Code, RSC 1989, c C-46, s. 259. *For a first offence, a $1000 fine and a 12-month driving prohibition, *For a second offence, 30 days of jail and a 24-month driving prohibition, and *For a third or subsequent offence, 120 days of jail and a 36-month driving prohibition. Drinking and driving offences are prior offences for refuse to comply offences, and vice versa. If no one is hurt or killed, and the prosecutor is proceeding by summary conviction, the maximum sentence is 18 months of jail. If no one is hurt or killed, and the prosecutor is proceeding by indictment, the maximum sentence is 5 years of jail. If another person suffers bodily harm because of the offence, the maximum sentence is 10 years in jail. If another person is killed because of the offence, the maximum sentence is a life sentence. If a person is convicted of both impaired operation/care or control and operation/care or control with a BAC in excess of 0.08 percent, the defendant can only be sentenced for one of the offences (the prosecutor chooses which one).R. v. Prince (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (S.C.C.) The same does not apply if a person is also convicted of a refuse to comply offence. A province is allowed to set up special ignition interlock device programs specifically to limit criminal driving prohibitions. Not all provinces have such specific programs, but if they do, and a person is enrolled in one, then they can drive during their prohibition period with an interlock device, beginning as follows: *For a first offence, 3 months after the day of sentence, *For a second offence, 6 months after the day of sentence, and *For a third offence or subsequent offence, 12 months after the day of sentence. Driving otherwise while on a driving prohibition is a criminal offence. =Driving Prohibitions vs. Suspensions= Canada is a federal state, and responsibility for road safety with respect to drunk driving falls on both Parliament and the provincial legislatures. Typically after an impaired driving offence is committed, the accused will be subject to both a prohibition imposed under federal law (criminal law) and a driver's licence suspension under provincial law. It is important to note that while Parliament may prohibit an accused from driving, in the absence of provincial legislation, this does not affect the validity of the driver's licence of the accused. Nonetheless the accused may be charged with driving while prohibited under criminal law despite possessing a valid driver's licence. Often the provincial suspensions are more severe than the criminal prohibition. For instance many jurisdictions require the accused to complete a remedial program and participate in the ignition interlock program, failing which will result in an indefinite suspension until the conditions are met. Also an accused may be suspended from driving for medical reasons if a physician reports that the accused has a serious alcohol problem likely to result in an unacceptable risk to the public should the accused operate a motor vehicle. The Criminal Code provides that an accused may be prosecuted for either driving while prohibited or driving while disqualified. The former refers to driving in contravention of a criminal court order of prohibition while the latter refers to driving while suspended under provincial legislation relating to a suspension for an impaired driving offence. Administrative driver's licence suspensions Administrative licence suspensions are separate from the driving prohibitions that are ordered as part of a criminal sentence. While drinking and driving are criminal offences, which is the jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament, the provinces have jurisdiction to regulate their roads and highways (see Canadian federalism). Therefore, the provinces have the ability to administratively suspend a person's driver's licence separately from any criminal proceedings. Licence suspensions can occur in three ways: 1) having a high BAC, but not enough to commit a criminal offence, 2) a police officer having reasonable grounds that a drinking and driving offence has occurred, and 3) being found guilty of a drinking and driving offence. Driving with a suspended licence can result in being charged with either criminal or provincial offences. =High blood alcohol concentration= When a person blows into an approved screening device, they might not register a BAC high enough for a fail, but they will still register a significantly high BAC. The provinces deal with that situation in different ways. There may also be different type of suspensions for novice drivers who are not allowed any BAC above zero. *Alberta - Length: 24 hours; Reason: a police officer reasonably suspects the person's ability to operate a vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drug, but does not charge them with a criminal offence. While the 24 hour suspension remains on the books, drivers may also receive a 3-day non-criminal suspension and other penalties should their blood alcohol concentration test 0.05 or over (warning), but not above the criminal 0.08 (failure). New drivers will receive a 30-day non-criminal suspension for a blood alcohol concentration of greater than zero.

It was begun by Alfred Maudslay publishing his first long-form description of the Archaeology at Chichen Itza (London: R.H. Porter and Dulau, 1889-1902). This work is still fundamental for the study of Neotropical plants and animals, because it contains almost all that was known of the biodiversity of Mexico and Central America at the time of its publication. Leading scientists of the day were the authors of the volumes. The whole series has 63 volumes with 1677 lithograph plates (more than 900 of which are in color) depicting 18,587 subjects. In total, 50,263 species are treated, of which 19,263 are described as new. Archaeology was added to the already monumental project because of new discoveries in the region. Since the Biologia Centrali-Americana was published, several volumes have been reprinted, but on the whole the series is rare in libraries and mostly absent from Latin American research institutions. The original volumes were printed on acid paper and have suffered from handling of the now brittle pages. The Smithsonian Institution has digitized the encyclopedia for distribution via the internet.

(1991). Old Queens, NY in early photographs. New York: Dover The Queensboro Bridge starts near the middle of the plaza. It has a New York City Subway stop for the , the Queens Plaza station below ground along the eastern edge, and another stop for the , the Queensboro Plaza station above the west central part of the plaza on elevated tracks.  History  South side before renovation The location was the center of the 18th century village of Dutch Kills; two millstones were preserved as relics of that time, to be displayed in a green space. = 20th century = The plaza itself was built to accommodate the connection of the Queensboro Bridge to Queens Boulevard, which opened in 1909. A street, named Jane Street, was widened by and was renamed Bridge Plaza North and South. Grassy medians, cut off at each intersection, divided the main and service lanes of the plaza. Sculptures made out of flowers and trees, including a \\"crescent with a Japanese cherry tree at its center\\", were prevalent. At the time, it was spacious, with only a few buildings on the sides and a solitary flagpole in the center of the plaza. Immediately to the southeast of the plaza was the Sunnyside Yard, a storage yard for the Pennsylvania Railroad (now NJ Transit Rail Operations). The addition of railroads and a bridge made Queens Plaza easily accessible from Manhattan. Queensboro Bridge Plaza, as it was originally called, soon experienced an increase in real estate development. By 1915, the bridge was overcrowded with traffic, and subway tracks were built above the plaza. The Queensboro Plaza station, a large two-level subway hub for the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation and Interborough Rapid Transit Company, opened above Queens Plaza in 1916-1917. The construction of the Queensboro Plaza station necessitated the removal of Queens Plaza's landscaped medians. From the 1920s through World War II, Queens Plaza served as the location for many factories and warehouses, some of which later became office buildings, as well as a financial hub with several banks. The Brewster Building, a factory along the plaza, made horse-drawn carriages, Rolls-Royces and other cars, and the Brewster F2A Buffalo fighter plane. The Long Island Savings Bank, Silvercup Bakery and Chase Manhattan Bank Building also were built on the plaza. Other banks included the Corn Exchange Bank, First National City Bank, and Title Guarantee and Trust Company. By 1928, 86,000 cars went through the Queensboro Bridge and onto the plaza each day. Queens Plaza came to be characterized as a \\"a new downtown\\", supplanting the Hunters Point section of Long Island City in that regard. In 1933, the Queens Plaza station, an underground subway station on the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line, opened at the southeast corner of the plaza. In the 1970s, Queens Plaza became a place for drug dealers, pimps, and prostitutes to frequent, and was filled with trash, drugs, and broken glass. Later, \\"aging Chinese takeout restaurants, humid fried-chicken joints, sad-seeming doughnut shops, [and] the Queens Plaza Municipal Parking Garage, a brown concrete structure resembling a 1970's filmmaker's idea of an intergalactic battle station\\" opened along the plaza. Strip clubs appeared in the 1990s, around the time that rehabilitation of the plaza started to be considered. = 21st century = Skyline of Queens Plaza in May 2017 By the early 2000s, Long Island City was going through gentrification, and new buildings were being put up, especially around Queens Plaza. In 2001, the area was rezoned, and 2,500 of about 5,000 apartments were built or planned within two blocks of the plaza. City officials decided to clean up the plaza, since the area was being gentrified. In 2005, the U.S. Congress approved a measure to demolish the municipal parking lot and turn it into a park. In 2009, $75 million was earmarked to clean and spruce up the area and to renovate the plaza. The renovation itself cost $45 million. It created a new public park within the plaza, on the former site of the municipal parking lot; the park was envisioned as an \\"urban oasis\\" or neighborhood meeting place. Another new public park, named Dutch Kills Green, was built as part of the renovation; it has 500 trees, wetlands, and pavers for storm drainage. It is right next to two new hotels: the 16-floor, 183-room Hilton Garden Inn, and a 31-floor, 160-room Marriott. New office buildings are also coming into the area. Even though the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company moved two-thirds of its employees from the Brewster Building on Queens Plaza North back to Manhattan in 2006 because of the distance and lack of restaurants in Queens Plaza, airline company JetBlue and advertising and public relations firm Publicis later moved into the same former factory. Real estate developer Tishman Speyer was also looking for tenants for its Queens Plaza South skyscraper, named 2 Gotham South. While only 1,000 people lived on the streets immediately surrounding the plaza as of the 2000 United States Census, the area has been undergoing substantial new development. About 4,700 new rental units in 25 new residential buildings were expected to be completed in the Queens Plaza area by around 2019, as it grows along with the rest of Long Island City.

Proceeds from the song went to the Hispanic Federation to assist relief efforts for those in Puerto Rico who were affected by Hurricane Maria. =Books= In October 2006, Leguizamo's memoir, Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life, was released. During an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, he stated that his memoir was very candid about experiences involving other celebrities he had worked with. He stated that working with Arnold Schwarzenegger on Collateral Damage (2002) was one of the most enjoyable experiences he'd had as an actor, that Schwarzenegger's accent let him say things that others would think were sexist or homophobic if said by someone else, that Steven Seagal was an egotist with diva tendencies, that Kurt Russell continuously called him a \\"faggot\\", and that Leonardo DiCaprio was a \\"patron of prostitutes\\". In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts published the graphic novel adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, Ghetto Klown. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in Queens, New York, his involvement in '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, and some of the colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thus: \\"Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It's a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience.\\" The comic is illustrated by Christa Cassano.Parkin, JK (January 1, 2015). \\"Exclusive preview: John Leguizamo's 'Ghetto Klown'\\".

Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain. Thus, the chain of responsibility is an object oriented version of the \`if ... else if ... else if ....... else ... endif\` idiom, with the benefit that the condition-action blocks can be dynamically rearranged and reconfigured at runtime. In a variation of the standard chain- of-responsibility model, some handlers may act as dispatchers, capable of sending commands out in a variety of directions, forming a tree of responsibility. In some cases, this can occur recursively, with processing objects calling higher-up processing objects with commands that attempt to solve some smaller part of the problem; in this case recursion continues until the command is processed, or the entire tree has been explored. An XML interpreter might work in this manner. This pattern promotes the idea of loose coupling. The chain-of-responsibility pattern is structurally nearly identical to the decorator pattern, the difference being that for the decorator, all classes handle the request, while for the chain of responsibility, exactly one of the classes in the chain handles the request. This is a strict definition of the Responsibility concept in the GoF book. However, many implementations (such as loggers below, or UI event handling, or servlet filters in Java, etc) allow several elements in the chain to take responsibility. Overview The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns that describe common solutions to recurring design problems when designing flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse. What problems can the Chain of Responsibility design pattern solve? * Coupling the sender of a request to its receiver should be avoided. * It should be possible that more than one receiver can handle a request. Implementing a request directly within the class that sends the request is inflexible because it couples the class to a particular receiver and makes it impossible to support multiple receivers. What solution does the Chain of Responsibility design pattern describe? * Define a chain of receiver objects having the responsibility, depending on run-time conditions, to either handle a request or forward it to the next receiver on the chain (if any). This enables to send a request to a chain of receivers without having to know which one handles the request. The request gets passed along the chain until a receiver handles the request. The sender of a request is no longer coupled to a particular receiver. See also the UML class and sequence diagram below.  Structure = UML class and sequence diagram = A sample UML class and sequence diagram for the Chain of Responsibility design pattern. In the above UML class diagram, the \`Sender\` class doesn't refer to a particular receiver class directly. Instead, \`Sender\` refers to the \`Handler\` interface for handling a request (\`handler.handleRequest()\`), which makes the \`Sender\` independent of which receiver handles the request. The \`Receiver1\`, \`Receiver2\`, and \`Receiver3\` classes implement the \`Handler\` interface by either handling or forwarding a request (depending on run-time conditions). The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions: In this example, the \`Sender\` object calls \`handleRequest()\` on the \`receiver1\` object (of type \`Handler\`). The \`receiver1\` forwards the request to \`receiver2\`, which in turn forwards the request to \`receiver3\`, which handles (performs) the request.

Objects that participate in the chain are called responder objects, inheriting from the \`NSResponder\` (OS X)/\`UIResponder\` (iOS) class. All view objects (\`NSView\`/\`UIView\`), view controller objects (\`NSViewController\`/\`UIViewController\`), window objects (\`NSWindow\`/\`UIWindow\`), and the application object (\`NSApplication\`/\`UIApplication\`) are responder objects. Typically, when a view receives an event which it can't handle, it dispatches it to its superview until it reaches the view controller or window object. If the window can't handle the event, the event is dispatched to the application object, which is the last object in the chain. For example: * On OS X, moving a textured window with the mouse can be done from any location (not just the title bar), unless on that location there's a view which handles dragging events, like slider controls. If no such view (or superview) is there, dragging events are sent up the chain to the window which does handle the dragging event. * On iOS, it's typical to handle view events in the view controller which manages the view hierarchy, instead of subclassing the view itself. Since a view controller lies in the responder chain after all of its managed subviews, it can intercept any view events and handle them.

Joe is a third-person rail shooter video game produced by Konami and released in 1992 for video arcades. It is based on the cartoon series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and stars four characters from the show: Duke, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, and Roadblock. Gameplay The game is a third-person rail shooting game, in which each player chooses one of four G.I. Joe operatives: Duke, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, or Roadblock. Up to four people can play the game at once. Each character either stands or automatically runs forward in a 3D perspective, and their player can use the joystick to move them left or right as well as raise or lower an aiming crosshair: this allows for the latter's movement through most of the screen. Each character is armed with a gun that has unlimited ammunition as well as a missile launcher, which comes with 3 to 5 missiles and can hold up to nine. Players use these weapons via a standard shoot button, and a missile launch button that allows for larger-scale destruction at the cost of one charge. Power-ups can be acquired that allow the player rapid fire by holding down the shoot button, add another missile to their supply, or restore their character's life energy. The object of the game is to find Cobra's hidden stronghold and stop Cobra Commander's latest campaign to take over the world. There are three missions in the game, each composed of several areas, including a chemical plant, an air base, a weapon plant, a jungle, a cavern base, and a battleship. Enemies include Viper soldiers and various Cobra vehicles such as FANG II, HISS II, Razorback and Hurricane. The bosses consist of Tomax and Xamot, Metal-Head, The Baroness, Major Bludd and Destro, with the final battle taking place between the G.I. Joe team and Cobra Commander.

Hieronymus Joseph Franz de Paula Graf Colloredo von Wallsee und Melz (Jérôme Joseph Franz de Paula, Count of Colloredo-Wallsee and Mels; ) was Prince- Bishop of Gurk from 1761 to 1772 and Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg from 1772 until 1803, when the prince-archbishopric was secularized. After secularization, Colloredo fled to Vienna and remained the non-resident archbishop of Salzburg, bereft of temporal power, until his death in 1812. He is most famously known as a patron and employer for Mozart. Life He was born in Vienna, Austria, the second son of Count Rudolf Wenzel Joseph Colloredo von Wallsee und Melz (1706–1788), a high-ranking Imperial official. Hieronymus was brought up in a strict religious household, and since his health did not allow him to pursue a military career, he was educated at the Theresianum Academy in Vienna, and studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and theology at the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum in Rome. =Accession= The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg fell vacant in December 1771, and (with considerable pressure from the Imperial court in Vienna), Colloredo, who had been Prince-Bishop of Gurk since 1761, was elected Prince- Archbishop on 14 March 1772 on the 13th ballot. According to Clive, \\"it was an unpopular choice in Salzburg whose citizens remained cool to him until the end.\\" Clive continues, \\"he was extremely autocratic and his dictatorial attitude at times provoked the hostility of the cathedral chapter and of civic officials.\\" =Policies= Hieronymus von Colloredo, 1787 During his thirty years as ruler of Salzburg, Colloredo implemented reforms similar to those carried out in the Austrian Empire under Joseph II; see Josephinism. According to Halliwell, he \\"was ultimately successful in his main aims, but the struggle was a perpetual one ... Colloredo had to establish like-minded people in each institution – ecclesiastical, educational, legal, medical, fiscal, administrative and publicistic – and persuade the reluctant populace to change its entire mentality.\\" Halliwell adds that Colloredo \\"attracted European-wide admiration for his efforts.\\" Colloredo also resembled Joseph II in moving the Roman Catholic religion within his domains in a direction similar to Protestantism. Halliwell writes: \\"Pilgrimages and superstitious practices were banned, processions were restricted, church decoration was limited, musical settings of the Mass were shortened and sacred German hymns introduced ... These changes led to deep resentment, and Colloredo and the architect of the pastoral letter [that implemented the policy], Johann Michael Bönike, were called 'secret Lutherans'. His diocesans would quip: \\"Our Prince von Colloredo has no Gloria nor Credo.\\" =End of Colloredo's secular rule= On 12 December 1801, as French troops under Napoleon drew near to occupying the city, Archbishop Colloredo fled Salzburg, never to return. In 1803, in the course of the German mediatization, the prince-arcbishopric was secularized, ending the secular rule of Colloredo. Salzburg was awarded instead to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had lost his own state in the Napoleonic upheavals. Later, Salzburg was incorporated into Austria (1805), then Bavaria (1809), then finally into Austria again (1816). Colloredo, as archbishop, remained the ecclesiastical head of the archdiocese (but not in residence) until his death, aged 79, at Vienna in 1812. Colloredo and Mozart Colloredo is well known to history as a patron and employer of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He became exceptionally annoyed with Mozart's frequent absences. After a number of arguments, he ultimately dismissed him with the words, \\"Soll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn nicht!\\" (\\"He should just go then; I don't need him!\\") Mozart's letters to his father recount his indignation at what he portrays as abusive and insulting behavior by the Archbishop. In his letter of 13 June 1781, Mozart recounts that the final indignity of his dismissal by Colloredo was administered by the Archbishop's steward, Count Arco (Karl Joseph Maria Felix, 1743–1830): > ...if they don't want me – that's fine by me; --instead of Count Arco > accepting my petition or obtaining an audience for me to send it in later or > persuading me to let the matter rest and think it over, enfin, whatever he > wanted --no, he throws me out of the room and gives me a kick up the > backside. – Well, in plain language this means that as far as I'm concerned, > Salzburg no longer exists.... Leopold Mozart stayed in Salzburg but \\"continued to bemoan the failure to replace musicians who had left or died, and the consequent shambles in the court music.\\" Colloredo \\"sometimes played the violin in the court orchestra.\\" In popular culture Hieronymus von Colloredo was played by Nicholas Kepros in the 1984 film Amadeus.

The poems circulated in the city of Vila Rica (present-day Ouro Preto) via pamphlets for several years before the 1789 Minas Conspiracy, but were discontinued after the Conspiracy was dismantled, as Gonzaga was sent to exile in the Island of Mozambique. It is said that the Cartas Chilenas were loosely based on and inspired by Montesquieu's Persian Letters. The poems were compiled for the first time and published in 1863. They were re-edited several times after that, reaching their present form in 1957 thanks to the extensive research of Portuguese philologist Manuel Rodrigues Lapa. Plot and setting Cartas Chilenas is a satirical poem in the shape of an epistolary novel, indirectly written \\"in honor\\" of Luís da Cunha Meneses, then-governor of the Captaincy of Minas Gerais, and the Portuguese Crown. It begins with a fictional foreword, in which an anonymous Brazilian man explains how the book came into being: he obtained a copy of a series of letters from a man coming to Brazil from an unnamed Hispanic America country, and decided to translate these letters from Spanish to Portuguese in order to keep the Brazilian governors from making the same mistakes made by Fanfarrão Minésio, the tyrannic governor of Chile.

It is based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr., with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by drug addiction and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their reality is overtaken by delusion, resulting in catastrophe. Selby's novel was optioned by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite initial struggles to obtain funding for the film's production. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways. The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive critical response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell. Plot Sara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a Brighton Beach apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks an escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation. At the advice of a friend, Sara visits a physician who prescribes her amphetamines to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. As time passes Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop amphetamine psychosis. Tyrone is caught in a shootout between drug traffickers and the Sicilian Mafia and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post bail. As a result of the gang warfare, the local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price has doubled and the minimum purchase is high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal symptoms, strains their relationship. Sara's increased dosage of amphetamines distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show, and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes electroconvulsive therapy instead. After the heroin shipment falls through, Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy heroin directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's gangrenous arm. A doctor realizes that Harry is a drug addict and calls the police resulting in both Harry and Tyrone being arrested. Back in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a pimp, Big Tim. She subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request, in exchange for more heroin. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated, and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry—married and successful—arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.

Aronofsky had been a fan of Selby's work during his school years. In a 2001 interview with the BBC, Aronofsky described Selby's work, saying \\"Anyone that reads Selby's work can see how intense his world is. He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books. I knew that once I made a larger film it would be very difficult to do a project like this. I live my life not wanting to have any regrets, and I knew that Selby was cool, that he's a badass\\". Eric Watson, producer and co-writer of Pi (1998), convinced Aronofsky to adapt the novel into a film. Selby was open to the idea and granted permission. Aronofsky and Watson optioned the film rights for $1,000, which was considered a large sum for them at the time. Aronofsky was still struggling financially after Pi, and financiers were also unconvinced on his idea of Requiem for a Dream. A screenplay had been written by Selby years prior, which was 80% similar to Aronofsky's. The pair compared their works, but Aronofsky wanted to cast younger characters to enhance the impact of drugs. However, the producers were against hiring a younger cast as they felt the film would be too unsettling for audiences; the director reluctantly agreed. = Casting = A number of actresses were considered for the role of Sara Goldfarb, but many of them rejected the part. Faye Dunaway turned it down.Rebello, Stephen (June 1, 2002). \\"Through The Eyes Of Faye Dunaway\\". Movieline. Retrieved October 2, 2016. Ellen Burstyn also initially rejected the part due to the depressing content, but her manager convinced her to see Aronofsky's previous work; she was impressed and agreed to be cast in the lead role. Giovanni Ribisi, Neve Campbell and Dave Chappelle were all considered for the role of Harry Goldfarb, Marion Silver and Tyrone C. Love, respectively. All three declined. The producers settled with Jared Leto, who was keen on the challenge, followed by Jennifer Connelly—\\"When I read the script, it was really something I wanted to do. I thought the script was ... brilliant. It was so creative ... I thought it was really brave. It was talking about really important issues\\", she said. Marlon Wayans read the novel three times and auditioned five times for the role of Tyrone before he was offered the part, eager to work with the director. In preparation for filming, Leto spent time living on the streets of New York, surrounded by people who were in the same situation as his character. He also starved himself for months, losing to play his heroin-addicted character realistically. Aronofsky requested that Leto and Wayans refrain from having sex and consuming sugar so that their cravings would appear genuine on-screen. Burstyn also spent time in Brooklyn, learning about the lives of particular women, and how narrow it is. She found that \\"Their life is about getting enough money to put food on the table to feed their children, and that's it\\". Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. She also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. = Filming = Filming lasted 40 days, on location in and around Coney Island, including the boardwalk, amusement parks and Brighton Beach. To capture Sara Goldfarb's weight loss throughout the film, Burstyn wore two fat suits; one simulated an additional in weight and one . Burstyn also dieted during a two-week break in the filming schedule, allowing her to lose . Makeup artists designed nine wigs and four necks for her, with some of the prosthetic pieces taking up to four hours to apply. Connelly's wardrobe consisted of pieces that she had made during her time preparing for the role.During a grocery store scene, real drug addicts were brought in as extras. Aronofsky has recalled that some were injecting themselves during filming. One bathtub scene was inspired by Satoshi Kon's 1997 anime film Perfect Blue. Post-production also included approximately 150 special effects, created by Amoeba Proteus, a digital effects company formed by Aronofksky and his friends. After filming was completed, Burstyn said, \\"I don't think I've ever been this challenged in a role—it was harder than The Exorcist\\". Connelly also spoke of how \\"it was hard, really hard to go through, emotionally. It was draining, sad, and uncomfortable\\". = Editing = As with Aronofsky's previous film, Pi, montages of extremely short shots were used throughout the film (sometimes referred to as hip hop montage). While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts, Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight close-ups. Long tracking shots, including shots where the camera is strapped to an actor and facing them, known as Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Aronofsky alternates between extreme close-ups and extreme distance from the action, with sharp cuts of reality between a character's fantasy. The camerawork forces the viewer to explore the characters' states of mind, hallucinations, visual distortions, and corrupted sense of time.Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope, p.32 Bloomsbury Academic The film's use of intertitles (summer, fall, winter), help illustrates the temporal progress of addiction. The average length of scenes also shortens as the film progresses, from around 90 seconds to 2 minutes in the beginning, until the climactic scenes, which are cut very rapidly accompanied by incidental music. After the climax, there is a short period of silence and serenity. Pixelation and a fish-eye lens are also techniques used to help reinforce the effect of drugs and the viewer's distance from the character, respectively. Reception= Box office = Requiem for a Dream premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2000, and the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival on September 13 before a wide release a month later. In the United States, the film opened on October 6, 2000, and grossed a total of $3,635,482, averaging $64,770 per theater. In other territories, the film earned $3,754,626, bringing a worldwide total of $7,390,108. =Rating= In the United States, the film was originally rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America, but Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied, and Artisan Entertainment decided to release the film unrated. An R-rated version was released on video, with the sex scene edited, but the rest of the film identical to the unrated version. =Critical response= Requiem for a Dream received positive reviews from critics with an approval rating of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The critical consensus states, \\"Though the movie may be too intense for some to stomach, the wonderful performances and the bleak imagery are hard to forget\\".\\"Requiem for a Dream Movie Reviews\\" . Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved June 29, 2019. The film also has a score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Film critic James Berardinelli considered Requiem for a Dream the second-best film of the decade, behind The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.\\"Top 10 Movies of the Decade\\" . ReelViews.com. Retrieved March 1, 2011 Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ out of four stars, stating,\\"What is fascinating about Requiem for a Dream ... is how well [Aronofsky] portrays the mental states of his addicts. When they use, a window opens briefly into a world where everything is right. Then it slides shut, and life reduces itself to a search for the money and drugs to open it again\\". Elvis Mitchell, writing for The New York Times, gave the film a positive review, stating, \\"After the young director's phenomenal debut with the barely budgeted Pi, which was like watching a middleweight boxer win a fight purely on reflexes, he comes back with a picture that shows maturation\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, lauded the film as an \\"agonising and unflinchingly grim portrait of drug abuse\\" and \\"a formally pleasing piece of work—if pleasing can possibly be the right word\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that \\"no one interested in the power and magic of movies should miss it\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, who gave the work an \\"A\\" grade, argued that it \\"may be the first movie to fully capture the way drugs dislocate us from ourselves\\" and said, \\"The movie, a full-throttle mind- bender, is hypnotically harrowing and intense, a visual and spiritual plunge into the seduction and terror of drug addiction\\". Scott Brake of IGN gave the film a 9.0 out of 10 and argued, \\"The reason it works so well as a film about addiction is that, in every frame, the film itself is addictive. It's absolutely relentless, from Aronofsky's bravura cinematic techniques (split screens, complex cross-cutting schemes, hallucinatory visuals) to Clint Mansell's driving, hypnotic score (performed by the Kronos Quartet), the movie compels you to watch it\\". However, some critics had a less positive response. Dessen Howe of The Washington Post opined that the characters are \\"mostly relegated to human mannequins in Aronofsky's visual schemes\\", but praised Burstyn's performance. David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor wrote, \\"the filmmaking gets addicted to its own flashy cynicism ... the picture sometimes seems as dazed and confused as the situations it wants to criticize\\". William Arnold, writing for Seattle Post-Intelligencer, stated, \\"Aronofsky hurls the full grammar of the cinema at us like a film student on an adrenaline rush: slow-motion, fast-forward, jump cuts, surreal fantasy sequences, endless glaring close-ups of dilating pupils, bizarre hand-held tracking shots through the mean streets\\". Arnold compliments the filmmaker's style but thought the editing was \\"brutalizing and counterproductive\\". Some critics characterize Requiem for a Dream in the genre of \\"drug movies\\", along with films such as The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting, Spun, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. = Accolades = Burstyn was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, but lost all three to Julia Roberts. The film won the AFI Award for Movie of the Year in 2001. In 2007, Requiem for a Dream was listed on the ballot for the American Film Institute's list of AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). In a 2016 international critics' poll conducted by the BBC, Requiem for a Dream was tied with Toni Erdmann (2016) and Carlos (2010) at 100th place in a list of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000. The film was listed as the 40th best-edited film of all time in a 2012 survey by members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell. The string quartet arrangements were written by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang, and was performed by the Kronos Quartet. The soundtrack was re-released with the album Requiem for a Dream: Remixed, which contains remixes of the music by various artists including Paul Oakenfold, Josh Wink, Jagz Kooner, and Delerium. The track \\"Lux Aeterna\\" is an orchestral composition by Mansell, the leitmotif of Requiem for a Dream, and the penultimate piece in the film's soundtrack. The popularity of this piece led to its use in popular culture outside the film, in film and teaser trailers, and with multiple remixes and remakes by other producers.

It served as an important ceremonial and administrative center for the advancement of the Lima Culture, a society which developed in the Peruvian Central Coast between the years of 200 AD and 700 AD. With the intended purpose of having the elite clergymen (who politically governed several valleys in the area) express their complete religious power and ability to control the use of all the natural water resources (saltwater and freshwater) of the zone, a Great Pyramid was constructed in the Huaca. As a whole, the structure is surrounded by a plaza, or central square, that borders the outer limits, and by a large structured wall dividing it into two separate sections. In one section there were benches and evidence of deep pits where offerings of fish and other marine life took place in order to attain the favor of the gods. The other section is an administrative area. This area contains various small clay structures and huts made of adobe–with some walls still standing–whose function seemed to be to act as the courtyards and patios of the enclosure which is over 500 meters in length, 100 in width and 22 in height. Other remains have been uncovered belonging to the Wari Culture (500 – 1000 AD), which was a direct influence on the Lima Culture society towards the ends of its time period. Of particular note are the remains of the “Señor de los Unkus” (The Lord of the Unkus), which belonged to the first tomb within the ceremonial center to have been discovered completely intact. This tomb holds three separate burial shrouds containing the remains of three adults–two of which have masks–and those of a sacrificed child.

He was active in Paris as a printer and worked exclusively for the University of Paris from 1520 to 1546. In addition to his work as a printer; Colines worked as an editor, publisher, and punchcutter. Over the course of his lifetime, he published over 700 separate editions (almost 4% of books published in 16th-century Paris). Colines used elegant roman and italic types and a Greek type, with accents, that were superior to their predecessors. These are now called French old-style, a style that remained popular for over 200 years and revived in the early 20th century. He used rabbits, satyrs, and philosophers as his pressmark.Colines's satyr pressmark Life Colines was born between 1480 and 1490, possibly south of Paris, where his siblings later owned farms. He probably studied at the University of Paris and probably worked for the elder Henri Estienne, and replaced Estienne as press director after his death in 1520. Colines married Estienne's widow, Guyonne Viart, and inherited charge of the press and her six children. He continued working in Estienne's shop until Robert Estienne (Estienne's son) entered the business in 1526, by which time Colines had set up his own shop nearby at Soleil d'or and helped Robert become established as a printer without ties to the university. One scholar, Jeanne Veyrin-Forrer, believes Colines may have furnished French old-style typefaces to his step- son, Robert Estienne. For the next 13 years Colines would cut most of his common print types: romans, italics, and his two best Greeks. In 1528 he began to use italic type. Colines was recognized for using rabbits near a tree as part of his pressmark, but after moving to Soleil d'or he started using satyrs and philosophers as his pressmarks. In 1539, Colines left Soleil d'or and moved his presses outside Paris's wall, at the sign of the four evangelists, where he stayed until his death in spring in 1546. Colines let his stepson-in- law, Chaudière, take over his location at Soleil d'or and would send him projects either because Colines was ill or overloaded. Upon Colines's death it was Chaudière and not Robert who took over Colines' backlist. Work Woodcut title-page border printed by Colines Colines may not have been a major contributor of technical innovations relating to typography, but he certainly was an intellectual pioneer in his field. Many of the important written structural elements that we expect to find in books are components that he contributed: title page organization, chapter headings, page numbers, table of contents, bibliographies, etc. In his work for the University of Paris, Colines printed classics by Cicero, Virgil, Euclid, and others. Although he was not a scholar himself, he extended the range of the Estienne firm's learned and scientific works to include the natural sciences, cosmology, and astrology. He is credited with the design of Italic and Greek fonts and of a Roman face for St. Augustine's Sylvius (1531), from which the Garamond types were derived. Compared to Henri Estienne's Romans, Colines spaced the letters more generally and altered some letters to be thinner. In 1529–1531 and in 1536, Louis Blaubloom, also known as Cyanaeus, helped Colines print more editions of the many books Colines was printing. In 1537, Colines started to collaborate with his step-son François Estienne in writing and printing schoolbooks. Starting in 1539, Colines was appointed as one of three officials who had to inspect paper before it was sold. Scholar Veyrin-Forrer estimates that during Colines's busiest times he had three presses and about 15 workers press workers and 10 foundry workers. =Textbooks= Woodcut from Estienne's De Dessectione Colines's editions of science books were illustrated with large woodcuts and included editions of Silíceo edited by Rhaetus, Sarzosa, and Fernel. He published versions of Galen's medical texts translated into French. In 1528 Colines started using italics purposefully in his texts, starting with Saint Augustin, and also started using a Greek typeface, starting with Cicero's De senuctute translated into Greek by Theodorus Gaza. When Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples became a tutor for the royal family, he commissioned Colines to print three Latin primers, which included accent marks to indicate long and short vowels, printed in black and red. In 1528, Colines printed De literis syllabis et metris by Terentianus Maurus, with commentary by Nicolas Brissé. For this book, Colines used a roman Gros Romain font which appears to be modeled after one of Aldus Manutius's types from Venice. This was part of a greater trend of changing typography styles in France. Also around this time, a new italic typeface derived from the Gros Romain appears in Colines's 1532 printing of Paul of Aegina's Opus de re medica. The typeface \\"lacks the curves that terminated the ascenders of the earlier face, while conserving the graceful shape of the ligature et.\\" In 1536, Colines printed his most famous edition: Jean Ruel's De natura stirpium, which incorporated a unique garden woodcut on its title page. The same year, Colines printed Demonstrationes by Oronce Finé, which contained a border design reserved for Fine's works. Colines printed Praxis criminis persequendi by Jean Milles de Souvigny in 1541. Colines published De dissectione partium corporis humani libri tres, an anatomy textbook 10 years in the making, in 1545. Charles Estienne wrote the text and his friend Etienne de la Riviėre, a barber-surgeon, illustrated much of it. The woodcuts were based on illustrations and drawings by Berengario, Perino del Vaga, and Mannerist models from the Fontainebleau School. The work was published in Latin and French, and was popular enough to be pirated in Germany. The French version of the anatomy textbook was Colines's last publication. Illustration of an imaginary murder trial from Praxis criminis persequendi by Jean Milles de Souvigny and printed by Simon de Colines =Religious books and Parliament= In addition to textbooks, Colines also published a few editions of scriptures and some devotional books. In 1522, Colines printed the four Gospels with commentary by Lefèvre d'Étaples called Commentarii initiatorii in quatuor Evangelia. The book was not submitted to the Parisian Faculty of Theology for approval as had been decreed the previous November, and the theologians fined Colines on 9 June 1523, and threatened to seize the remaining copies. Colines argued that the printing had started in Meaux before the decree, and the theologians consented to let him keep his remaining copies as long as he did not sell them. In 1545, after Lefèvre's death, Parliament censored Commentarii. In 1524, Colines printed Lefèvre's French translations of both the New Testament and the Psalms; however, Colines also published anti-Lutheran pamphlets (Antilutherus), much to Robert Estienne's and Lefèvre's disapproval. Colines was careful to petition for approval from Parliament. In 1526, the theologians prohibited the sale and possession of French language scriptures. In 1525 and 1527 Colines published Books of Hours with decorations by Geoffroy Tory. Both books together are called the Tory Books of Hours. Colines also published Books of Hours in the 1540s. Colines's miniature Vulgate was widely circulated and went through 50 editions. In 1541 Colines revised a Latin Bible folio with diacritical marks which contained a geographical index by Robert Estienne in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The volume, over 800 pages long, was a difficult printing job and published by Galliot du Pré and Lyonese Antoine Vincent. Colines published a few more anti-Lutheran books in 1526. Colines printed several works by Josse van Clichtove, including Clichtove's refutation to Johannes Oecolampadius (1527) and Clichtove's commentary (1529) on the decrees of the Councils of Sens in 1528. Colines also printed a book of polemical essays by Johann Eck in 1526. Colines published many books by Erasmus, often for schools. After Erasmus's Colloquia was censured, two secretly printed editions (1528 and 1532) bore Colines's typeface called Mignonne. When Colines printed a New Testament with commentary by Erasmus in a single volume (Testamentum Nouum per Des. Erasmum recognitum) in 1533, he used a typeface even smaller than the Mignonne. In 1542, French Parliament decreed that all books entering Paris should be examined, in order to make sure they contained no \\"Lutheran errors\\". The decree also stipulated that all books should contain the name and address of their printer. In 1544, Parliament published a list of censored books, and anyone still owning the books after three days could be incarcerated. The list included four books Colines had published. Colines published few new works after this decree. Reception Colines's types were renowned among and often praised by authors and poets of the period including Hubert Sussaneau, Salmon Macrinus, Nicolas Bourbon, and Jean Visagier.

The image shows actors Tiana Alexandra and Mark Dacascos The Center for Asian American Media (CAAM) was founded in 1980. The San Francisco-based organization, formerly known as the National Asian American Telecommunications Association (NAATA), has grown into the largest organization dedicated to the advancement of Asian Americans in independent media, specifically the areas of television and filmmaking. History A Formula for Change was a report published by the Task Force on Minorities in Public Broadcasting appointed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). It was released in 1978 which outlined the deficiency of programs for minorities in the public sector of media. Individual producers, television stations, and advocates for minority representation formed the Minority Consortia in which NAATA was one of the key components within this core group. The inception of NAATA, now known as CAAM, at the beginning of the 1980s came at a key moment in the historical development of Asian American media. Earlier in 1971, Los Angeles-based activists and artists established Visual Communications (VC), a community-based organization. This organization was instrumental in helping to create many early examples of Asian American filmmaking, including the first Asian American feature film, Robert A. Nakamura's Hito Hata: Raise the Banner in 1980. In New York, Asian CineVision (ACV) formed in 1976 and pursued similar goals as VC, helping to nurture a nascent East Coast filmmaking community. By 1978, ACV had organized the first festival named Asian American International Film Festival which showcased many independent Asian American filmmakers in the event. Along with CAAMFest, CAAM as a nonprofit organization helps in funding and disseminating Asian American film and media. CAAM also has career opportunities, several programs, and community building initiatives. Public broadcast With the support of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the Center for Asian American Media works with the national Public Broadcast Service (PBS) and its regional networks, local PBS stations, PBS series such as POV and the Independent Television Service (ITVS). Since launching the groundbreaking Asian American anthology series “Silk Screen” (1982-1987) on PBS, CAAM continues to bring award-winning works to millions of viewers nationwide. CAAM is one of five minority public broadcasting consortia designated by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to provide programming to the Public Broadcast Service (PBS). Over $3 million has flowed through CAAM's Media Fund since 1990, putting life into (or polish onto) dozens of acclaimed and award-winning projects. Film festival Other commitments forced CAAM to shelve the festival in 1985 but beginning in 1986, CAAM took over planning, programming and management of the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival. Since then, the SFIAAFF has since become the largest of its kind in America, with over 100 films screened over the course of 10 days and two cities (San Francisco and Berkeley). Unlike similar festivals, such as VC’s Los Angeles Asian American Film Festival, the SFIAAFF was a non-competitive showcase but starting in 2005, it created its first competitive awards for Best Asian American Feature and Best Asian American Documentary, providing a cash prize to emergent filmmakers to help support their project development. In 2007, the Wallace Foundation awarded CAAM with $514,000 to use current digital media to broaden and diversify the audience for the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival. Some films that came from CAAM and its supported films are: Who Killed Vincent Chin?, Days of Waiting, a.k.a. Don Bonus, American Revolutionary: The Evolution of Grace Lee Boggs, K-Town'92, Minding the Gap. With the expansion of the festival, CAAM announced in January 2013 the name change of the SFIAAFF to CAAMFest. The new Festival will showcase film as well as other avenues of artistic expression and community engagement, such as music, food, and interactive workshops. Since 2013, CAAMFest has served as a platform for all film and media supported by CAAM, filled with sponsors, awards, presentations, and galas. Although it for media, CAAMFests have become festivals that celebrate film as well as music and food. After 2013, some festivals have been themed like CAAMFest35 in 2017, yesterday today tomorrow, which highlighted CAAM's past, present, and future in Asian American media. CAAMFest36 in 2018 had a theme of Culture, In Every Sense.  Programs  CAAM works with the mass media to share with the world diversity and Asian Americans experiences. In order to achieve their goal, CAAM created the following programs: Public Media: Since 1982, CAAM has made hundreds of films and presented Asian American works on public television. CAAMFest. Media Fund: CAAM created the Media Fund in 1990 in order to give money to Asian American filmmakers. For independent Asian American filmmakers, taking money from CAAM had both benefits and risks attached. CAAM offered funding through the Media Fund during and after production, which granted filmmakers the assets to create their productions and avenues to publicize their work. Those who chose to take the Media Fund also had to waive broadcasting rights to CAAM. It also has certain conditions that those filmmakers had to follow, in that filmmakers did not have the independence to determine if their films would be broadcast at peak times. Showing these films at non-peak viewing hours lessened the attention to each production, posing a risk to the independence of filmmakers deciding to take the media fund or not. However, if the independent Asian American filmmakers took the money from CAAM then they had higher chances of broadcasting the work, although slim because only 14% of the 193 projects from 1999-2001 were chosen. Multi-Platform Storytelling or Trans-media Storytelling: Through the use of various media outlets, CAAM ensures that Asian American works are presented. Memories to Light: Asian American Home Movies: CAAM created this program to encourage Asian American communities to document in film their stories and experiences through the making of home movies. CAAM then collects and share those home movies to the world. Educational Distribution: CAAM has the largest number of movies, documentaries and other Asian American works that are used for educational purposes. CAAM Fellowship Program is an opportunity to foster growth among Asian American documentary filmmakers, producers, and directors. This is path available to those who wish to develop their own skills alongside mentors and fellows, whether current cinematographers or those looking to get into the directing or producing aspects of film.

An early record of the village is shown on a map of the Cumbria area by Christopher Saxton in 1567, in which the village is known as Gilcrosse. Etymology The name Gilcrux may be derived from the Brittonic elements *cīl meaning \\"a nook/retreat\\", and -crṻg meaning \\"an isolated or abrupt hill\\", and may have originally meant \\"hill retreat\\". Also possible is derivation from Gaelic *cil-cruaich, \\"a church with a cross\\". The present form of the name has been influenced by Old Norse gil, \\"a ravine\\" and Latin crux, \\"a cross\\". History Census data shows the changes in the population of the parish over time. Censuses are recorded at 10-year intervals in the United Kingdom with the earliest records for population coming from the 1801 UK census. The graph in Figure 1 shows that the population increased steadily until 1891, after which it decreased slowly to its current figure. thumb Figure 1 (Population Change) The increase in population is explained by John Marius Wilson in his Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, the increase in residents was due to the extensions of coal mines in the area. Figure 2: Occupational Structure of Gilcrux, 1831 Census data also reflects the social structure of the parish in 1831. The pie chart in Figure 2 shows the proportion of Gilcrux's workforce in very broad categories. Half of the total population worked as labourers and servants on the parish farms, and were most likely employed by those in the 'Employers and Professionals' group, which make up almost a quarter of the total population. Governance Gilcrux, is part of the Workington constituency of the UK parliament. The current Member of Parliament is Sue Hayman, a member of the Labour Party. The Labour Party has won the seat in every general election since 1979; the Conservative Party has only been elected once in Workington since the Second World War: in the 1976 Workington by-election. For the European Parliament residents in Gilcrux vote to elect MEP's for the North West England constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Ellen & Gilcrux Ward of Allerdale Borough Council, formerly part of Cockermouth Rural District and the Dearham and Broughton Division of Cumbria County Council. The village also has its own Parish Council together with part of Bullgill; Gilcrux Parish Council. Landmarks The village contains St. Mary's church, which sits atop of a mound in the centre of the village. The church dates back to Norman times and was renovated in the late 13th century. The church has an Anglo-Danish Norse cross on its roof and contains a glass altar screen of Leonardo da Vinci's painting of The Last Supper. The Village also contains a newly refurbished village hall, building work started on the village hall in January 2010, and was completed in March 2012, costing £580,000, much of which came from national lottery funding. The refurbishments included a glass entrance lobby, more meeting rooms, a bar area and improved toilet facilities. The Village also contains the Beeches Caravan Park, the villages close proximity to the Lake District make it and attractive location for tourists, with the caravan park being open all year round. Transport By road, Gilcrux is close to two major roads, the A596 which is around north of the village, and the A595 which is around to the south. These two roads link the village with the town of Carlisle which is around away. A bus service is the only form of Public Transport in Gilcrux. The 39 bus is active on Tuesdays and Fridays and completes its route from Bothel to Carlisle once on these days The nearest train station is Aspatria railway station which is roughly away from Gilcrux. The station runs trains everyday northbound towards and southbound towards . Demographics According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 the population of the parish was 303, with the parish containing 119 households in total. reducing at the 2011 Census to a population of 299 in 132 households. There are 145 people between the ages of 16 and 74 that are economically active, with 9 people in that age bracket unemployed and a further 66 economically inactive. Employment within the parish is split between the extractive and manufacturing industries, in which 41% of the population are employed, and the service industry, which employs the remaining 59% of the economically active employed population of Gilcrux. The census data also allows us to see the mean distance that the residents of Gilcrux have to travel to their place of employment, the figure given is this could suggest that few people remain in the parish to work and instead commute to large settlements each day for work.

Development The Avenger was designed to meet the requirements of the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles, including the maximum empty weight. Design goals included low-cost, an aesthetically attractive look and accommodation for a tall, pilot. Although originally designed to accept the 1/2 VW powerplant the aircraft can achieve an empty weight as low as with the use of a lighter weight engine, such as the Rotax 277 or the 2SI 460-35. The Avenger was initially marketed with the now-discontinued Rotax 277 engine, but the use of this engine has been criticized as leaving the aircraft underpowered. Reviewer Andre Cliche says: Design The Avenger structure is entirely constructed from wood, with a low wing braced to the landing gear. The wooden-framed wing is covered with aircraft fabric. The engine cowling is fibreglass. The conventional landing gear features a steerable tailwheel and main-gear suspension. The cockpit features an optional removable canopy. The Avenger has an estimated construction time of 400 hours from the kit. In 2015, the kit price (without paint, varnish, pilot/passenger restraints, instruments, upholstery, engine, engine mount or propeller) was US$5999, with the plans selling for US$300. Recommended engines include the Rotax 503, Rotax 447, 2SI 460-35 or 1/2 VW.

The fort was considered the largest masonry \\"blockhouse\\" ever built; it burned in November 1863. The \\"castle\\" had been built in 1836 as a home for Col. James McKay. This was part of the government acquisition of land in 1841 and was used as the Commandant's Quarters. Fort Porter had not been used for some time when the Civil War started. It was used as Headquarters of the 74th Regiment, NYNG. Ten 60 by 18 foot barracks were constructed and used as a recruiting center. In 1898, the post was reactivated for the Spanish–American War and used as Headquarters for 13th U.S. Infantry. In 1917, it was reactivated again for World War I and used as U.S. Army Base Hospital 23 until the unit shipped out. At the close of World War I it was used as U.S. General Hospital 4 for returning wounded. In 1926, the property was sold to provide approaches to new Peace Bridge at Front Park, and all evidence was removed.

Mexico is the world's most populous country to have completely abolished the death penalty. History A Mexican execution by firing squad in 1916 There is significant history of abolitionism in Mexico, dating back to the 19th century. Following the Plan of Ayutla, the 1857 constitution was drafted, which specifically outlawed the death penalty for political crimes, and allowed abolition for ordinary crimes in the future. Mexico's government at that time was quite unstable, and the express abolition of political crimes could have been linked to concern that the lawmakers themselves could become subject to the punishment if there was an uprising. Personal experiences too may have been a factor, as many Mexicans had experienced political repression. There was widespread condemnation of the death penalty in the media, and many Mexican literates were familiar with the work of Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria. Following the rule of Porfirio Díaz, the death penalty article was amended in the reform which led to the current Constitution of Mexico. The last non- military execution in Mexico was in 1957 in Sonora, and the last military execution (of a soldier charged with insubordination and murder) was in 1961, so the official abolition of the military death penalty in 2005 and of the civil death penalty in 1976 lagged the de facto cessations by 44 and 19 years, respectively. Mexico is a majority Roman Catholic country, with 88% of the population identifying themselves as adherents. The Vatican has made numerous statements criticizing capital punishment, and this may be a factor in the debate in Mexico. During a debate in 2018 during the 2018 Mexican general election candidate Jaime Rodríguez Calderón proposed to reinstate the death penalty for drug traffickers, hijackers, infanticides and serial killers. =Mexican Drug War= Green Party billboard promoting the restoration of the death penalty The Mexican Drug War has fueled rising rates of violent crimes such as kidnapping and murder, prompting a reemergence of capital punishment into the political discourse. The Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), the fourth biggest political force in the country, waged a campaign to promote restoration of the death penalty, including the use of billboards, as part of promotion of the party for the 2009 election for seats in Congress. There have been proposals to amend the 1917 Constitution to allow capital punishment from both the PVEM and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but both were rejected. Surveys in 2009 suggested that up to 70% of the population supported the restoration of the death penalty, however it is unlikely that the constitution will be changed, as both religious and human rights groups have strongly opposed restoration. A 2017 poll study found younger Mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment. Constitution: Article 22 Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited. Specifically, penalties of death, mutilation, infamy, marks, physical punishments, torments, excessive fines, confiscation of assets, and others are abolished. Confiscation of assets does not include the application of said assets to pay for civil responsibilities caused by a crime, or when used to pay taxes or other fines. Nor will it be confiscation when said assets are part of illegal activities, or when they are related to organized crime, or when proof of ownership cannot be established. International relations In 1981, Mexico ratified the American Convention on Human Rights, a treaty of the Organization of American States, which prohibits the death penalty from being restored if eliminated.American Convention on Human Rights , art 4.2 ratified 2 Mar. 1981. Mexico does not extradite to countries that are seeking the death penalty, and has successfully defended 400 of its citizens charged with a capital offence in the United States. This has in the past led to American fugitives crossing the border into Mexico in order to avoid the death penalty. In 2002, President Vicente Fox cancelled a trip to the United States to meet US President George W. Bush, in protest of the then imminent execution of a Mexican national, Javier Suárez Medina, in the U.S. state of Texas. Medina had been convicted in 1989 for killing an undercover police officer in Dallas. According to Mexican officials, Suárez was not informed about his right to consular access, and fourteen countries lobbied the United States Supreme Court on behalf of him. In 2003 Mexico filed a complaint against the United States at the International Court of Justice, alleging that the US had contravened the Vienna Convention by not allowing 54 Mexicans sentenced to death to contact diplomatic officials.

A British blockading force, which had been conducting patrols in the region in the aftermath of the battle of St Marcou earlier in the month, encountered two French vessels attempting to sail unnoticed between Le Havre and Cherbourg. Closing with the French, the British commander Sir Francis Laforey sought to bring the French ships to battle as they attempted to turn back to Le Havre before the British squadron could attack. The French were unable to escape, and Laforey's ship, the fifth rate , engaged the French corvette Confiante, while two smaller British ships chased the Vésuve. After a brief exchange of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore close to the mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre. Background By 1798 the British Royal Navy had successfully contained the French Navy within its own harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting the movements of the French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein.Gardiner, p. 105 To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.Woodman, p. 102 During the spring of 1798, Muskein concentrated over 50 of the landing barges in Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and on 6 May launched an attack on the Îles Saint- Marcouf while a combination of wind and tide prevented the blockade squadron from intervening. The fortified islands were too well-defended however and over 900 French soldiers died in the ensuing battle before the French abandoned the attack. The French subsequently dispersed the remaining landing barges to various ports on the Normandy coast. In response the Royal Navy increased its patrols in the region with the intention of intercepting the convoys and destroying the barges.Gardiner, p. 107 French movements along the coast were not solely confined to landing barges: on 29 May 1798 two warships, the 20 or 24-gun Confiante under captain de vaisseau Etienne Pévrieu, and the 20-gun Vésuve under lieutenant de vaisseau Jean-Baptiste-Louis Lecolier, sailed from Le Havre, travelling westwards across the Baie de la Seine to Cherbourg, accompanied by a small, armed cutter.James, p. 119 Battle of 30 May=Engagement at sea= On the morning of 30 May, a British squadron sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling to the west and gave chase, Captain Laforey leading in the 38-gun , followed by the bomb vessel , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald, and the 12-gun cutter , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett.Clowes, p. 342 Discovering the British in pursuit, Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore, tacking in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range. Laforey continued his approach, and a 06:00 successfully tacked Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve, which had turned back towards the shore. Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships, their attacks had little impact. Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore, pursued by Vesuvius and Trial. Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante, which was attempting to turn back towards Le Havre. The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near the mouth of the Dives River. At 06:30, Hydra caught up with Pevrieux on the Confiante and began a heavy fire, which the French warship returned when possible. The exchange continued for 45 minutes until 07:15, when Confiante, having suffered serious damage, drove aground on a sandbank near Beuzeval, a village a short distance to the west of the mouth of the Dives. As Confiante struck the sandbank, her mainmast collapsed, rending further manoeuvre under hostile fire impossible.James, p. 120 Vésuve too drove ashore to avoid the British attack, Lieutenant Lecolier managing to beach his ship within the Dives estuary itself. As the rising tide brought the corvette off the beach, Lecolier made a brief attempt to escape westwards towards Caen, but Trial and Vesuvius were alert and drove Vésuve back to the shore.Clowes, p. 343 There the two small British vessels opened up a distant fire on the corvette, as did Hydra to the west against Confiante. At 09:30, the falling tide forced the British ships to retreat off-shore, Laforey gathering his vessels approximately northeast of the beached French convoy. =Attack by boats= During the day, the French strengthened the positions of both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable. At 10:00 on the morning of 31 May, Laforey sent the boats from his squadron inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties. As the British attack proceeded against Confiante, the crew of Vésuve succeeded in refloating her and soon had their ship anchored under the protection of gun batteries at Sallenelles. These defences were augmented by additional batteries set up by 200 soldiers under Captain Muskein, drawn from the barges that had been trapped in the town by the British blockade.James, p. 121. By the time Confiante had been destroyed, the mouth of the Dives had been heavily fortified and even the arrival of the 38-gun frigate under Captain Sir Richard Strachan on 1 June was insufficient to counterbalance French numerical superiority. Eventually Laforey was forced to retire from the blockade of Sallenelles, and while he was absent Vésuve managed to get underway and reach Le Havre without further incident.Gardiner, p. 98 Aftermath French casualties in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, but based on Acklom's report from the boarding party they were believed to be heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much of the blame for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux.James, p. 122. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects for the development of the French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.Gardiner, p. 97.

In the prototypical example, banknotes are destroyed by literally setting them on fire. Burning money decreases the wealth of the owner without directly enriching any particular party. Burn Your Money, an interactive artwork at Center Camp, Burning Man was later burned at the Burn Wall Street artwork on the playa Money is usually burned to communicate a message, either for artistic effect, as a form of protest, or as a signal. In some games, a player can sometimes benefit from the ability to burn money (battle of the sexes). Burning money is illegal in some jurisdictions. Macroeconomic effect For the purposes of macroeconomics, burning money is equivalent to removing the money from circulation, and locking it away forever; the salient feature is that no one may ever use the money again. Burning money shrinks the money supply, and is therefore a special case of contractionary monetary policy that can be implemented by anyone. In the usual case, the central bank withdraws money from circulation by selling government bonds or foreign currency. The difference with money burning is that the central bank does not have to exchange any assets of value for the money burnt. Money burning is thus equivalent to gifting the money back to the central bank (or other money issuing authority). If the economy is at full employment equilibrium, shrinking the money supply causes deflation (or decreases the rate of inflation), increasing the real value of the money left in circulation. Assuming that the burned money is paper money with negligible intrinsic value, no real goods are destroyed, so the overall wealth of the world is unaffected. Instead, all surviving money slightly increases in value; everyone gains wealth in proportion to the amount of money they already hold. Economist Steven Landsburg proposes in The Armchair Economist that burning one's fortune (in paper money) is a form of philanthropy more egalitarian than deeding it to the United States Treasury. In 1920, Thomas Nixon Carver wrote that dumping money into the sea is better for society than spending it wastefully, as the latter wastes the labor that it hires. According to the quantity theory of money, because it reduces the supply of money it increases by the same amount the collective wealth of everyone else who owns said money. =Opposites= Central banks routinely collect and destroy worn-out coins and banknotes in exchange for new ones. This does not affect the money supply, and is done to maintain a healthy population of usable currency. The practice raises an interesting possibility. If an individual can steal the money before it is incinerated, the effect is the opposite of burning money; the thief is enriched at the expense of the rest of society. One such incident at the Bank of England inspired the 2001 TV movie Hot Money and the 2008 film Mad Money.As usual for a heist comedy, Mad Money avoids the moral implications of the act; see the review by Another, more common near-opposite is the creation of counterfeit money. Undetected counterfeit money harms the rest of society by decreasing the value of existing money – one of the reasons why attempting to pass it is illegal in most jurisdictions and is aggressively investigated. Another way to analyze the cost of forgery is to consider the effects of a central bank's monetary policy. Taking the United States as an example, if the Federal Reserve decides that the monetary base should be a given amount, then every $100 bill forged is a bill the Fed cannot print and use to buy Treasury bonds. The interest earnings (after expenses) on those bonds is turned over to the US Treasury, so any lost interest must be made up by U.S. taxpayers, who therefore bear the cost of counterfeiting. Rationales Behaviorally speaking, burning money is usually seen as a purely negative act. The cognitive impact of burning money can even be a useful motivational tool: patients who suffer from nail biting may be trained to burn a dollar bill every time they engage in the habit. One study found this form of suppression training by self-punishment to be effective compared to control groups, although not as effective as substitution training. On the other hand, there are some situations where burning money might not be so unreasonable. It is said that the ancient Greek philosopher Aristippus was once on a ship at sea when he was threatened by pirates; he took out his money, counted it, and dropped it into the sea, commenting, \\"Better for the money to perish because of Aristippus than vice versa.\\" Cicero would later cite this episode as an example of a circumstance that must be considered in its full context: \\"...it is a useless act to throw money into the sea; but not with the design which Aristippus had when he did so.\\" Since around 2015 the UK has experienced a surge of interest in money burning. This has been noted in both the book 'The Mysterium' and in a 'Kindred Spirit' article that is reprinted in International Times. An annual Mass Burn Event - where people are invited to burn money - is held at the Cockpit Theatre in London every autumn.https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/rituelle-performance-in-london- gemeinsames-geldverbrennen.2156.de.html?dram%3Aarticle_id=432399 =Symbolism= alt=Pile of paper items on fire; a hand reaches to add money- like bills Gudrun Schyman sets fire to money Publicly burning money can be an act of protest or a kind of artistic statement. Often the point is to emphasize money's intrinsic worthlessness. In 1984, Serge Gainsbourg burned a 500 French franc note on television to protest against heavy taxation. On 23 August 1994, the K Foundation (an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) burned one million pounds sterling in cash on the Scottish island of Jura. This money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s. The duo have never fully explained their motivations for the burning. In the 1995 film Dead Presidents, the title sequence directed by Kyle Cooper features close shots of burning U.S. bills; it took two days of shooting and experimenting with the paper to get the effect right. In the early 18th century, New York City courts would publicly burn the counterfeit bills they gathered, to show that they were both dangerous and worthless. In traditional Chinese and Vietnamese ancestor veneration, imitation money in the form of joss paper are ceremonially burned, with the aspiration that the dead may use the money to finance a more comfortable afterlife. In 2010, the spokesperson for the Swedish Feminist Initiative, Gudrun Schyman, burned SEK 100,000 during a speech about the inequality in wages for men and women. In 2018, a collective of artists called Distributed Gallery have created a machine named Chaos Machine which burn banknotes and turn them into cryptocurrencies while playing music. =Game theory= In game theory, a threat to burn money can affect the strategies of the players involved; a classic example is the situation described as 'battle of the sexes', where the ability to burn money allows the player to achieve the desired equilibrium without actually having to burn money. =For commodity value= Fiat money can sometimes be destroyed by converting it into commodity form, rather than completely forfeiting the value of the money. Sometimes, currency intended for use as fiat money becomes more valuable as a commodity, usually when inflation causes its face value to fall below its intrinsic value. For example, in India in 2007, Rupee coins disappeared from the market when their face value dropped below the value of the stainless steel from which they were made. Similarly, in 1965, the US government had to switch from silver to copper-nickel clad quarter coins because the silver value of the coins had exceeded their face value and were being melted down by individuals for profit. At the peak of inflation in the Weimar Republic, people burned banknotes for warmth, as their face value had fallen below their value as fuel. The same occurred to 5-franc coins of Switzerland, which up to the year 1969 were minted using a silver alloy. Legality=Australia= Section 16 of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981 prohibits deliberate damage and destruction of Australian money without a relevant legal permit. The law covers both current Australian money and historical coins and notes. Breaking this law can lead to detention or a fine.RBA Banknotes: Deliberate Damage According to this law, even writing words on a banknote can be punished.Defacing bank notes costs $500  Sunshine Coast News  Local News in Sunshine Coast  Sunshine Coast Daily =Brazil = In Brazil, whether it is illegal for a person to burn his or her own money is a controversial topic. It is not mentioned explicitly in Brazilian law. João Sidney Figueiredo Filho,http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4123407P9 the head of the central bank, has affirmed that \\"when money is inside the Central Bank, then it is the property of the National Treasury. When it leaves, it is not.\\" But the chief of police Jéferson Botelho Pereira has concluded that \\"whoever rips money is committing a crime against the property of the Union\\". The production of paper money by the State Bank is under the exclusive authority of the Central Bank, and is issued by the Brazilian Union. By that reasoning, the paper on which the money is printed is the property of the State, and its intrinsic value belongs to the person. Articles 98 and 99 of the New Brazilian Civil Code give \\"money\\" its own definition. This is because a banknote cannot become a common good, if the owner himself decides to keep it in his possession indefinitely. This makes money different from other state assets such as rivers, seas, streets, roads and piazzas, which are all immobile. =Canada = The Currency Act states that \\"no person shall melt down, break up or use otherwise than as currency any coin that is legal tender in Canada.\\" Similarly, Section 456 of The Criminal Code of Canada says: \\"Every one who (a) defaces a current coin, or (b) utters a current coin that has been defaced, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\\" However neither the Currency Act nor Criminal Code mention paper currency. It therefore remains legal to completely destroy paper currency. =Euro Zone= According to the European Commission's Recommendation dated 22 March 2010,EUR- Lex - - IT \\"Member states must not prohibit or punish the complete destruction of small quantities of Euro coins or notes when this happens in private. However they must prohibit the unauthorised destruction of large amounts of Euro coins or notes.\\" Also, \\"Member states must not encourage the mutilation of Euro notes or coins for artistic purposes, but they are required to tolerate it. Mutilated coins or notes should be considered unfit for circulation.\\" The European Union defines \\"falsifying or fraudulently altering money in any way\\" as a crime.EUR-Lex - 32000F0383 - IT Also, according to the EU ruling 1210/2010, \\"all money that is unfit for circulation must be delivered to the relevant national authority\\".

The penalty is a fine of up to NZD 1000.00. =Singapore= Singapore's Currency Act states that any person who mutilate, destroy, deface, or causes any change (to diminish value/utility of) currency note or coin is fined up to $2,000. =Taiwan= Intentionally damaging coins or notes, and rendering them unusable, is fined up to 5 times the nominal value of such coins or notes. =Turkey= In Turkey, defacement or destruction of banknotes can be punished with fines or with prison sentences. =United Kingdom= The Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom relating to banknotes. Among other things, it makes it a criminal offence to deface a banknote (but not to destroy one). Under Section 10 of the Coinage Act 1971 \\"No person shall, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Treasury, melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after 16th May 1969 ceased to be so.\\" As the process of creating elongated coins does not require them to be melted nor broken up, however, Section 10 does not apply and coin elongation is legal within the UK with penny press machines. =United States= A receipt from the Albany, New York Comptroller's Office certifying that $5,000 from the Bank of Whitestown had been legally destroyed by burning on 15 November 1842. In the United States, burning banknotes is prohibited under , which includes \\"any other thing\\" that renders a note \\"unfit to be reissued\\". In an amicus brief for Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, Solicitor General Seth Waxman writes that arresting an individual who removes the corner dollar values \\"may expose a counterfeiting operation\\".http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/2000/3mer/1ami/1999-1408.mer.ami.pdf It is unclear if the statute has ever been applied in response to the complete destruction of a bill. Certainly people have publicly burned small amounts of money for political protests that were picked up by the media — Living Things at South by Southwest, Larry Kudlow on The Call, both in 2009Columbia Journalism Review: CNBC’s Kudlow: On-Air Lawbreaker? March 19, 2009. — without apparent consequence. The question of legality has been compared to the much more politically charged issue of flag desecration. It can be argued that the desecration of the flag is comparable to the desecration of a photograph of Legal Tender (provided it was modified as to not violate counterfeiting laws). In 1989, in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Flag Protection Act, William Barr testified that any regulation protecting something purely for its symbolic value would be struck down as unconstitutional. The Senate report recommending passage of the Act argued that Barr's theory would render 18 U.S.C. § 333 unconstitutional as well. Reprinted in In a dissent in Smith v. Goguen, Justice Rehnquist counted 18 U.S.C. § 333 in a group of statutes in which the Government protects its interest in some private property which is \\"not a traditional property interest\\". On the other hand, the Government's interest in protecting circulating currency might not be purely symbolic; it costs the Bureau of Engraving and Printing approximately 5 cents to replace a note. Legal Tender, a 1996 telerobotic art installment by Ken Goldberg, Eric Paulos, Judith Donath, and Mark Pauline, was an experiment to see if the law could instill a sense of physical risk in online interactions. After participants were advised that 18 U.S.C. § 333 threatened them with up to six months in jail, they were given the option of remotely defacing small portions of a pair of \\"purportedly authentic\\" $100 bills over the web. A crime may be occurring — but \\"only if the bills are real, the web site is authentic, and the experiment actually performed.\\" In fact, one bill was real and the other counterfeit. Almost all of the participants reported that they believed the experiment and the bills to be faked. The destruction of money is also bound by the same laws that govern the destruction of other personal property. In particular, one cannot empower the executor of one's estate to burn one's money after one dies.Restatement of Trusts, Second § 124 p.267, cited in Eyerman v.

The company's headquarters were located in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1958, the company formally changed their name to Asgrow Seed Company. The Upjohn Company acquired Asgrow in 1968 in a stock swap. In 1994, Mexico-based company, Empresas La Moderna SA purchased Asgrow for $300 million. At the time, Asgrow was the fifth-largest seed company with $270 million in sales. Monsanto purchased Asgrow from Empresas in 1996 for $240 million dollars. In 1997, the company moved its headquarters to the Des Moines area from Kalamazoo, Michigan. In 1996, Asgrow released the first Roundup Ready Soybean to the market building upon Monsanto's work to create petunia plants tolerant to small amounts of Roundup developed by Robert Fraley in 1985. The first season of sales saw over 1 million acres using the new seed and quickly over 80% of US soybeans were produced with the seed. In 2012, Asgrow started its National Yield Contest for soybean producers. The contest winner produces the most soybeans and farmers nationwide have opportunity to learn more about the latest seed technologies and production practices. In 2018, Bayer AG acquired Monsanto, and Asgrow became a brand of Bayer Crop Science.  Products  Asgrow seeds feature many Monsanto technologies including RoundUp-Ready 2 Yield.

Deeg was the first capital of the Sinsini Jats established by Badan Singh. Later the capital was moved to Bharatpur. Bharatpur State was a Princely state in the Indian subcontinent. It was ruled by the Sinsinwar clan of the Hindu Jats. Origin The ancestors of the Bharatpur dynasty were Jats of Sinsinwar gotra, who followed a non-Vedic god Shin. A descendant of their leader Sua was Khanchand, whose son Bhajja became Mouza Sinsini's first zamindar. Bhajja's seven sons included Bhao Singh, Churaman, and Rajaram. Badan Singh was one of the three sons of Bhao Singh. A legend of Sinsinwar Jats states that Jats headed by Sua shifted to Usrani village of Bharatpur district as agriculturists during 13th or 14th century. But later on became zamindars after treacherously killing the Chandars, to whom they paid taxes initially. After eliminating Chandars, their Shurseni village was occupied by Jats. And, based on their Sinsinwar gotra, they changed the name of Shursheni to Sinsini. Historian Ram Pande notes that this legend conveys that the Jats rose to zamindar status from their initial position of peasants in this area. According to a legend common to the erstwhile royal courts of Bharatpur and Karauli State, their claimed ancestor was a Yadav Rajput named Balchand. From one of his plundering raids, he brought a captured Jat and his wife to Sinsini. As Balchand's wife was infertile, he had two sons from the imprisoned Jat woman, whom he had made his concubine. His sons became Jats after being rejected as Rajputs, and, based on their village Sinsini, they made Sinsinwar as their gotra. Ram Pande notes that this legend is problematic on multiple fronts: the sons would have become Darogas after being rejected as Rajputs; caste of a child is not normally based on the mother's caste; Sinsini was never a part of Karauli. He suggests that the legend was created \\"to show superiority of Sinsinwar Jats over other Jats\\". History The formation of the state of Bharatpur was a result of revolts by the Jats living in the region around Delhi , Agra and Mathura against the imperial Mughals. Gokla, a local zamindar of Mathura, lead the first of such revolts in 1669. Even though the Jats were defeated and Gokla executed, the movement was not completely crushed and discontent continued to simmer. In 1685 there was a second uprising of the Jats under Raja Ram Jat, that was better organized this time and used guerrilla warfare , combining it with plunder. Now Aurangzeb approached the Kachhwaha ruler Bishan Singh to crush the uprising and appointed him as the faujdar of Mathura , granting him the entire area in zamindari. Conflict between Jats and Rajputs for zamindari rights also complicated the issue , with Jats primarily being landowners, whereas the Rajputs were primarily revenue collectors .The Jats put up a stiff resistance but by 1691 Rajaram Jat and his successor Churaman Jat were compelled to submit to the Imperial Mughals. However unrest among Jats continued and later on in the beginning of the 18th century, Churaman Jat taking advantage of the Mughal civil wars was able to oust the Rajputs from the area and establish an indipendent state where Jat chiefs formed the ruling class . Raja Ram Jat who also exhumed and burned the remains of Akbar is known for setting up a small fort at Sinsini. It was the key foundation of this kingdom.Chiefs and Leading Families in Rajputana, Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta, 1894, 1903 and 1916.Kunj Bihari Lal Gupta.

Maharaja Jaswant Singh provided great support for the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and this aid was greatly acknowledged by the British.

History Ronn Motor Group was founded in 2007 when founder Ronn Maxwell came up with the idea for the company's first car, the Ronn Scorpion. Maxwell was inspired by a business trip to China when he saw the growing demand for vehicles and knew carbon-burning cars would not be sustainable. He wrote up a business plan that November, and started physical development of the production prototype in March 2008. The Ronn Scorpion debuted in Europe at the Top Marques Monaco in 2009. That same year, the prototype was taken to California where it was displayed at the California State Capitol. California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger test drove the vehicle. Production was scheduled to begin in late 2009 and was originally set for 200 cars to be produced annually. In August 2015, RMG partnered with Gray Design to combine its super performance car with superyachts for marketing to clients of Gray Design.The Fairwei superyacht will be matched with the 2017 RMG Bird of Prey. The Bird of Prey, a hybrid car featuring Formula One electric drive technology, was offered exclusively as part of the collaboration. RMG began equity crowdfunding in 2015 through Regulation A+. In August 2015, the company announced production of the Scorpion 2.0. Ronn Scorpion Ronn Scorpion Maxwell designed the body of the Scorpion HX, which runs off a 450-horsepower 3.5 liter Acura twin-turbo V6 engine and uses \\"hydrogen fuel injection\\" to increase fuel mileage and reduce carbon emission. The Scorpion HX runs off a 40:60 ratio of hydrogen and gasoline. An integrated 1.5 liter water tank produces hydrogen through electrolysis, which is then added to the combustion chamber. The hydrogen bonds with carbon molecules which allows them to burn in the cylinder. The Scorpion's hydrogen injection system was built by RMG's COO, Damon Kuhn. The car can reach 200 miles per hour and can go from 0-60 in 3.5 seconds. It averages 40 miles per gallon. The Scorpion has a stainless steel frame and the body is made of carbon fiber. The original body prototype was produced by Metalcrafters, a company based in Fountain Valley, California. It was produced directly from the CAD rendering without using the traditional clay model.

Fourth son of fourth Kubō Ashikaga Mochiuji, he succeeded his father only in 1449, a full decade after his death by seppuku. His childhood name was . His rule was from its onset troubled by hostilities with the central government: he was finally deposed in 1455 by shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa, after which he escaped to Koga in Shimōsa Province, where he became known as Koga kubō. There, he ruled until his death in 1497. Biography When in 1439 shōgun Ashikaga Yoshinori attacked and invaded Kamakura, its ruler Mochiuji committed seppuku near today's Zuisen-ji to escape capture. His eldest son Yoshihisa, 14 years old at the time, was also forced to kill himself at nearby Hōkoku-ji.History of Kamakura (3) – Ashikaga Era, Kamakura Today, accessed on July 25, 2009 His three younger sons however escaped to Nikkō and in 1440 were led by Yūki Ujitomo, head of the Yūki clan, to his castle in Koga, Shimōsa Province, and survived.Papinot (1972:37–38) When later Ujitomo's castle was attacked by the shogunate, they escaped. Two, Haruō-maru and Yasuō-maru, however were caught and executed, while Eijuō-maru survived.Kamakura Citizen's net – A Brief History of Kamakura accessed on August 2, 2009 Kamakura and the Kantō would then be ruled for the shogunate by the Uesugi clan until 1449.Sansom (2000:241) In that year, Eijuō- maru's uncle Ōi Mochimitsu managed to have him appointed to the post of Kantō kubō (shōguns deputy in the Kantō region), the first Ashikaga to hold the post since his father's death ten years earlier. On the occasion, the 11-year-old boy reached manhood and received the character for the adult name he was about to assume from shōgun Yoshimasa himself (who took it from his former name, ) and became Shigeuji.Kokushi Daijiten Vol. 10 (1983:162) Shōgun Yoshimasa, not trusting Shigeuji, nominated his ally Uesugi Noritada kanrei with the task of keeping him informed of what happened in Kamakura. The relationship between the two men, already difficult because of the role the Uesugi had had in Mochiuji's death, was therefore strained from the beginning. Tension culminated with Shigeuji's 1454 killing of Noritada, who was invited at Shigeuji's mansion and there murdered. The killing made the Kantō province fall into chaos because all Uesugi vassals rose against Shigeuji.See also the article Kyōtoku Incident Imagawa Noritada defeated Shigeuji and Kamakura, and in 1455 Shigeuji had to flee to the friendly city of Koga, where in time he became known as the Koga kubō. The Uesugi asked Yoshimasa to send someone to replace Shigeuji, so he sent his younger brother Masatomo with an army to pacify Kantō, but many vassals had remained faithful to Shigeuji, so Masatomo was unable to even enter Kamakura. He had to stop in HorigoeSeveral sources, for example Sansom and Papinot, use the reading Horikoshi. in Izu Province, and was thereafter known as Horigoe Gosho. The Kantō therefore found itself with two rulers, one in Koga and one in Horigoe, neither of whom was able to rule. The Kantō was, for all practical purposes, once again in the hands of the Uesugi. This was the beginning of an era in which the Kantō and Kamakura were devastated by a time of civil wars called the Sengoku period. War continued with on one side Masatomo and the Uesugi, on the other Shigeuji and the Chiba, the Utsunomiya, the Oyama and other clans. In 1471 Uesugi forces arrived in Koga, so Shigeuji had to escape to Chiba. Hostilities ceased only in 1482. Shigeuji was able to return to Koga, where he founded a dynasty and ruled until his death in 1497.

The hour-long program premiered on November 9, 2009, on cable network TBS. Lopez was the first Mexican-American to host a late-night talk show on an English-language network in the United States. The show featured audience interaction using a high-energy format. The program aired Monday through Thursday at midnight Eastern and Pacific, immediately following Conan. On August 10, 2011, TBS announced that Lopez Tonight would be canceled. The final episode aired the following night. History Phillip Kent, the chief executive of TBS, announced in March 2009 that George Lopez had signed a contract to host his own late-night talk show on TBS in November of that year. During interviews, Lopez said that he would bring the change to late-night television and that he wants the show to reach a diverse audience. He also stated that he would become the first Hispanic American to host a late-night talk show. The show debuted on November 9, 2009, with guests Kobe Bryant and Eva Longoria, as well as a special appearance from Ellen DeGeneres and a musical performance from Carlos Santana. =Arrival of Conan O'Brien and cancellation= The 2010 Tonight Show conflict resulted in Conan O'Brien's departure from NBC and The Tonight Show. Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show, abandoning his prime time experiment, The Jay Leno Show. As a part of his severance deal, O'Brien was given a $32-million payout, a $12-million payout for his show's staff, and the ability to pursue options on other channels after September 1, 2010. Hours before O'Brien's Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, O'Brien officially announced he had signed with TBS to create his own late-night talk show at 11:00 pm beginning in November 2010, thus pushing Lopez Tonight back to midnight. O'Brien was hesitant at first, saying he didn't want to do that to Lopez after what NBC had done to him, but Lopez himself called him and persuaded him to take the job. On the April 12 edition of Lopez Tonight, George addressed the situation by saying, \\"I was on Team Coco, now I'm on Team Loco!\\". However, the move caused a steep decline in ratings. On August 10, 2011, TBS canceled Lopez Tonight effective at the end of the week. O'Brien said of the announcement on his show, taping just hours after it was confirmed: Format The show followed the established six-piece format established by the likes of Steve Allen and Johnny Carson. The first segment included a monologue by Lopez, sometimes accompanied by several one-liners, or several brief comedy sketches. Most episodes also included a second segment, immediately after the monologue, with a full comedy sketch. An interview with either one or two guests followed, as well as a musical or comedy performance. Recurring segments Sketches introduced on the show include Bullet Wound or Not a Bullet Wound, a stereotypical game show similar to Jay Leno's \\"Jaywalking\\" where guests must answer seemingly racist questions, Creepy Little White Girl in which a horrific little girl appears on the stage to deliver bad news, The Jersey Shore Presents, a mocking piece where cast members of Jersey Shore star in hit movies, Sweet Tweets where Lopez answers questions submitted from Twitter, WWE Superstars Karoake where many WWE Superstars performed karaoke songs, Justin Bieber's Memories a segment that mocks Justin Bieber and his childhood, and \\"Eric Estrada\\" where colored lights flash and various guests, including Benjamin Bratt and Jon Cryer come out of the double doors in a California Highway Patrol motorcycle uniform.

Production=Studio and set design= The show was taped at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, near The Ellen DeGeneres Show studio. The stage layout followed a street-party theme. The show differed from many other late-night talk shows, most notably for not featuring a desk or background of the city in which the show is taped. =House band= Lopez Tonights house band was Michael Bearden and the Ese Vato's, who are famous for performances with Michael Jackson and Shakira. The band consisted of leader and keyboard player Michael Bearden, guitarist Tommy Organ, bass player Alex Al, percussionist Lenny Castro, trumpeter Bill Churchville, drummer Robin DiMaggio, and saxophonist Sean Holt. As in common talk show format, Michael Bearden and the Ese Vato's would perform the show's opening and closing theme, bumpers into and out of commercial breaks. The show's opening theme was \\"Lowrider\\" by the band War, which was also the theme song for George Lopez. Reception The show has been critically panned. Metacritic scored the show with a 39/100 based on six reviews. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe claims \\"Lopez has a full-throated energy and a weakness for sophomoric guy humor that can be grating, especially since his show will air Monday through Thursday nights.\\" The New York Times says \\"Mr. Lopez said he was 'bringing change to late-night TV,' but the only significant change was a coarsening of the already crass atmosphere.\\" See also * List of Lopez Tonight episodes ReferencesExternal links 2000s American late-night television series 2000s American variety television series 2009 American television series debuts 2010s American late- night television series 2010s American variety television series 2011 American television series endings English-language television shows TBS (American TV channel) original programming Television series by Warner Horizon Television Television shows filmed in California Television series by Telepictures ","title":"Lopez Tonight"},{"id":"23830949","text":"Lea M.

Its 31 articles establish ground rules and expectations of the patroons and inhabitants of the new colonies. It was ratified by the Dutch States-General on June 7, 1629.Spooner, pp. 8 Background The economic situation of the colony of New Netherland in the late 1620s could be considered a fairly good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness. The first settlement was built in 1613, strictly out of necessity, but soon after, forts were built. At the time of the charter, the oldest settlement was only 16 years old. But this slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. The principal objective of this organization was to go after the spoils of war, which promised rich harvests in the captured fleets of the Spanish, with colonization being only a secondary consideration. Noting that the capture of the silver fleet in 1628 left the company proceeds of $115,000,000, and that the next year sundry privateers brought in a bounty of over $18,000,000, it was hardly surprising that so little attention was paid to the settlements in the Hudson River Valley. Those were \\"get rich quick\\" days for large corporations, and the slow and tedious procedure of colonizing and cultivating new countries found little favor in the eyes of the men at the helm. The Charter The realization that greater inducements had to be offered to increase the development of the colony led the West India Company to the creation of the so-called \\"patroon system\\". In 1629, the West India Company issued its charter of \\"Freedoms and Exemptions\\" by which it was declared that any member of the Company who could bring to and settle 50 persons over the age of 15 in New Netherland, should receive a liberal grant of land to hold as patroon, or lord, with the exception, per Article III, of the island of Manhattan. This land could have a frontage of if on one side of a river, or if situated on both sides. The patroon would be chief magistrate on his land, but disputes of more than 50 guilders could be appealed to the Director and his Council in New Amsterdam. The tenants would be free from all taxation for 10 years, but during this period they would not be allowed to change from one estate to another nor to move from the country to the town. At least one quarter of the 50 inhabitants would have to be settled within the first year of the land grant, with the rest being settled within three years following that. The patroons would have full liberty to purchase goods in New Netherland, New England, and New France, with the exception of furs. But the trader would have to pay an export tax of five per cent in New Amsterdam before goods could be shipped to Europe. The fur trade remained a monopoly of the Company, being the most profitable investment at the time. The weaving of cloth was also prohibited in order to supply the looms in Holland with their needed raw supplies.Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America, pp. 26–27 The patroon would be responsible for the expenses in erecting barns and other structures and preparing land for farming in addition to supplying the initial farming tools, vehicles, and livestock. However, each tenant would be due to pay a stipulated rent in addition to a percentage of that which they produced. Additionally, no farmer could sell any good without first offering it to patroon. The patroon also bore responsibility of hiring a minister and schoolmaster, as well as financing the respective structures when they became needed. Once the patroonship became a profitable enterprise, the patroon was expected to share net profits with the tenants. Colton, p. 45 There are some notable aspects of the charter, which, while aiming to make the West India Company wealthy and successful, offered great incentives to the patroons and respect to the indigenous peoples. For example, Article XXVI states that the patroon \\"must satisfy the Indians of that place for the land\\", essentially implying that the land must be bought (or bartered) from the local Indians, and not just taken. Article VI states that the patroon \\"shall forever own and possess and hold from the Company as a perpetual fief of inheritance, all the land lying within the aforesaid limits\\", which made the patroonship a fiefdom. It shall be seen later that one patroonship would last well into the 19th century. Additionally, the Company agreed to protect the patroonships from attack (Article XXV), and even supply the patroonship—for free—\\"with as many blacks as it possibly can ... for [no] longer [a] time than it shall see fit\\" (Article XXX). Resulting patroonships Nautical chart of Zwaanendael, 1639 The earliest venture to explore New Netherland for future colonization by a potential patroon was upon notification to the Directors on January 13, 1629 that Samuel Godyn, Kiliaen van Rensselaer, and Samuel Blommaert had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place before the Charter was ratified, but was done in agreement with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 154 Upon ratification of the charter on June 7, 1629, Michael Pauw informed the Directors of his intention to settle along the \\"Sickenames River\\", a stream east of the Connecticut River.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscript, pp. 154–155 On June 19, Samuel Godyn declared his intention to settle \\"the bay of the South River\\", the current day Delaware Bay, naming the settlement Zwaanendael.Van Rensselaer Bower Manuscripts, pp. 155 After the settlement had been in existence for only a short while, the colonists—32 in number—were murdered by the local Indians.Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America, pp. 27 Godyn sold his holdings back to the West India Company. Patroonships were not limited to the area of the northeastern United States. On October 15, Michael Pauw made his intention known to settle the islands of Fernando de Noronha, located off the Brazilian coast. Likewise on October 22, Albertus Conradus declared himself patroon of the island of Saint Vincent.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 156 On November 1, Conradus also registered as patroon of the east side of South Bay, that which had not been taken by Samuel Godyn on June 19. It was abandoned and no colony was actually established.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 164 On November 16, 1629, Samuel Blommaert declared himself patroon of the Fresh River presumedly adjoining the one to the east on the Sickenames River previously registered by Michael Pauw.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 157 No colony was ever established and the patroonship was eventually abandoned.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscript, pp. 165 On January 10, 1630, Pauw declared himself patroon of an area along the southern end of the North River, including land on the present site of Jersey City, and Staten Island, so called in honor of the \\"Staten\\", or States General. Colton, p. 47 The patroonship was called Pavonia.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 158 The enterprise however, was not a financial success and he finally sold his holdings to the West India Company. The most successful of the settlements started under the patroonship charter was on the upper Hudson River by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, an Amsterdam jeweler and member of the Chamber of Amsterdam.Netherland Chamber of Commerce in America, pp. 27–28 Van Rensselaer declared his intentions of settling a patroonship on November 19, 1629. From the Mahicans he purchased a plot of land now represented by Albany and Rensselaer counties, which he called Rensselaerswyck and to which he brought several families from the town of Nijkerk, the place of his birth. Rensselaerswyck would stay in the van Rensselaer family until its dissolution during the Anti-Rent War in the 1840s, with its last patroon, Stephen van Rensselaer III dying a very rich man.Ellis, pp. 158–161 To this day, he is listed as the tenth richest American in history, having been worth about $10 million (about $88 billion in 2007 dollars).

Since 1998 he has released nine studio albums, and he is the former host of Logo's weekly music video countdown cable television show \\"NewNowNext Music\\". His eighth studio record, Adieu., was released September 23, 2016. Lynn is also one of the lead characters of Last Meal Series, a show by the writers of Search Party on TBS channel. In 2018 Logan Lynn partnered with actor, comedian and podcaster-turned-music producer Jay Mohr on a multi-media project titled “My Movie Star\\", which includes a short film by the same name and a double album of new material. The record premiered on Billboard on October 12, 2018 and features collaborations with The Dandy Warhols, Jarryd James, Rian Lewis, Tiffany and others.http://spillmagazine.com/spill-canadian- premiere-short-film-movie-star-ft-logan-lynn/ Lynn's charitable activism and advocacy includes his work as Chief Impact Officer for Trillium Group, where he founded the \\"Keep Oregon Well\\" campaign to eliminate social stigma surrounding mental health through music and the arts.https://www.kgw.com/mobile/video/entertainment/television/programs/portland- today/taking-the-stigma-out-of-mental-health-issues/283-8115656 He currently works with Portugal. The Man and is signed to Portland’s Banana Stand Records. Early life Lynn was born to William Dennis Lynn, a Christian minister, and Debra Lynn \\"Debby\\" Lynn (née Stockburger). Lynn's paternal grandmother, LaVanda Mae Fielder, was a piano and vocal instructor who worked out of her home. One of her pupils was a young Johnny Cash. Lynn's father was a traveling preacher and proponent of a Christian touring sermon series known as \\"The Strong Family Seminar\\". Lynn's mother enrolled him in dance classes during his childhood. To encourage his interest in the performing arts, his parents converted their garage into a stage; he was involved in local choir and musical theater, and acted in numerous plays in high school. When Lynn was 7 years old he began suffering sexual abuse at the hands of a family friend who came to live with the Lynn family. As a reaction to this abuse, many years later he would become an advocate for sexual assault survivors. Teachings from the church eventually led Lynn to develop a disdain for his fundamentalist Christian upbringing. As a teenager, he began listening to musical acts that were forbidden by his father. Lynn later moved from rural York, Nebraska to Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, and befriended Jim Suptic, Ryan Pope and Rob Pope of The Get Up Kids at Olathe South High School from 1995–96 and spent much of his time in Kansas City. The party outlet led him to begin working as a DJ, and he started to write songs to help him cope with teenage angst and rejection after he moved to Portland, Oregon in 1996. Music career=1998–2007: early career and first hiatus= Two years after moving to Portland from the Midwestern United States, Lynn had become friends with Portland music scene-makers The Dandy Warhols and Elliott Smith and other local bands who were just starting to take off in the mainstream. =2007–2010: signs with major label, drug overdose and rehab= In September 2007, Lynn had a feature showcase at Portland's MusicFest NW festival. Later that month he was contacted by The Dandy Warhols. Lynn's association with DList.com owner Daniel Nardicio landed him a gig playing a party during the 2007 New York City Gay Pride celebration. His performance was seen by a representative from MTV's Logo network. The LGBT-interest channel was interested in building its offering of artists and acts and recruited Lynn. They secured the rights to his music video for \\"Burning Your Glory\\" initially. It first aired on television in April 2007. After spending 2 weeks airing on \\"NewNowNext\\" the video spent 11 consecutive weeks on Logo's viewer-voted weekly music video countdown show \\"The Click List\\", landing at the #3 spot on the countdown in June 2007. In October 2007, Lynn's music video for his single \\"Feed Me to the Wolves\\" was premiered on Logo. The video was commercially successful with the network and online. Logo picked \\"Burning Your Glory\\" as one of the top 10 videos of the year in 2007. The following year, Lynn made his first TV appearance as host of Logo's hour-long NewNowNext countdown, in which he discussed his early life, influences, and career. During this time, Lynn overdosed on a mixture of crack cocaine and alcohol and suffered a TIA pre-stroke attack in 2008. He spent a large portion of the year in drug rehabilitation in St. Helens, Oregon. He was released later that year and has remained clean. In September 2008, he was given his own showcase performance at Portland's MusicFest NW festival for the 2nd year in a row. In 2009 Lynn's new album, From Pillar to Post, was announced. Lynn was given his own industry showcase at the 2009 CMJ Music Marathon festival, where he performed with Portland indie pop outfit Cars & Trains as his backup. Leading up to this show, MTV Iggy wrote \\"Oregonian troubadour Logan Lynn backs his emotive vocals with glitchy techno, resulting in bare synth pop that's somewhere between Moby and Pedro the Lion. He's playing at New York's CMJ fest on Tuesday October 20th at midnight at the Bowery Electric.\\" on their site alongside a post of Lynn's music videos. He also had a showcase at Musicfest Northwest in Portland, Oregon in 2009, his 3rd MFNW showcase in a row. In November 2009 Lynn released a music video for \\"Bottom Your Way to the Top\\", which was produced by Logan Lynn Music. The video featured Illustrations by John Parot from the Bravo TV series Work of Art: The Next Great Artist. =2010–2012: splits with major label, second hiatus, charity work= Under pressure from his label and management, late in 2009 Lynn completely reworked his live show from performing the electropop originals of his songs with Cars & Trains to post-punk versions of the tracks with Portland alternative rock group The Gentry. Lynn debuted this new lineup in a performance at The Dandy Warhols' Odditorium for CBS News, and he announced that he was leaving Beat the World Records in July 2010. He completed a Summer tour of the U.S. with The Gentry, canceled plans for a second leg of the tour and fulfilled his remaining contractual obligations to the label. Following his departure from Beat the World Records, Lynn self-released the album he had been working on for the label, \\"I Killed Tomorrow Yesterday\\", on August 31, 2010 as a benefit for Portland's Q Center. All of the profits of \\"I Killed Tomorrow Yesterday\\" went to benefit the LGBTQ community the 1st year of its release. The record was co- written, produced and mixed by Bryan Cecil. In June 2011, Lynn's \\"Quickly as We Pass\\" video premiered on Logo and MTV to positive reviews in the press. The video was directed by Jeffrey McHale and produced by Logan Lynn Music. Because of the nudity in the video, Logo, MTV and VH1 rejected the first three versions of the video. A black bar-edited, censored version would appear on those outlets instead. In July 2011 David Byrne from Talking Heads was quoted in Chicago newspaper The Windy City Times as saying \\"Imagine forward-thinking Imogen Heap mentoring a DIY artist with the hipster sound stemming from Brooklyn. The end product would be 'Quickly As We Pass'...the song is very catchy.\\" In the fall of 2011 Lynn contributed a song, \\"Movies\\", to Live From Nowhere Near You (Volume 2). He released a new single \\"Turn Me Out\\" on Tuesday, June 5, 2012. The song was co-written by David Appaloosa from Portland band The Hugs, produced by Gino Mari, and recorded at The Country Club recording studios in Portland. In July 2012 Lynn released the \\"Turn Me Out\\" music video, which was directed by photographer Curtis Speer and produced by Logan Lynn Music. In November 2012 Lynn produced and released a compilation record for charity titled \\"Comp 175\\" which featured 36 bands, 45 songs, and was sold for $15. 100% of the proceeds from this record go to benefit Q Center. =2012–2015: return to the stage, mainstream exposure, Keep Oregon Well campaign= Lynn held a public remix contest for his Turn Me Out (single) and released the top 5 mixes on the Turn Me Out (Remix EP) in August 2012. He released a new 10 song album on December 4, 2012 called Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks. The record was named \\"Album of the Year\\" by multiple media outlets. A review in the Willamette Week read \\"Former Dandy Warhols protégé Portland electropopper Logan Lynn is back with 'Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks', a layered confection of shiny beats, blips and synths with more lyrical heft than the average dance-floor soundtrack\\". In January 2013 Lynn released the music video for \\"Hologram\\", directed by Adrian Sotomayor and Aaron Bear. It premiered on Out Magazine's website. In August 2013, he released a music video for his next single from Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks, \\"Everything You Touch Turns to Gold\\". The video again premiered on Out Magazine's website and was picked up by The Huffington Post other media outlets from there. In May 2013, Lynn held another public remix contest and released a second 5-song remix EP called Dance Alone featuring the winners. In June 2013, after taking a three- year hiatus from performing, Lynn headlined the Queer Music Summer Tour Benefit For LGBTQ Mental Health Services & Suicide Prevention alongside Big Dipper, Conquistador, Rica Shay and others. In September 2013, Lynn released a cover of \\"We Can't Stop\\" by Miley Cyrus, produced by Gino Mari. New York Magazine called Lynn's version \\"dreamy, guitar-heavy\\" and The Huffington Post wrote that it was \\"bold\\" and \\"warmer\\" than the original. Cyrus went on to perform Lynn and Mari's arrangement of the song on Saturday Night Live on October 5, 2013. On Halloween of 2013, Lynn released a music video for the album's title track, directed by Kevin Forrest and Ben Starkey and produced by Hippodrome Films. In April 2014, he released a limited edition compact disc version of his 2012 album Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks and played a showcase at Mo-Wave 2014, voted \\"Best Festival\\" by Seattle Weekly. In June, Lynn released the fifth single and music video from Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks, titled \\"Radio Silent\\". Produced by Logan Lynn Music, the video was directed by filmmaker Runn Shayo and featured behind-the-scenes and live performance clips from Lynn's 2013 summer tour of the U.S. In an interview with Australian pop culture blog Tabloid Junk, Lynn confirmed that he was mid-process with a new album, planned for release in 2016. On September 9, 2014 Lynn released the first two songs from his forthcoming 2016 album in the form of a two-song single titled \\"We Will Overcome\\". The single contained the title track as well as a song called \\"Break Me Down\\". \\"Break Me Down\\" spent 6 weeks in the Top 10 on Colombian pop radio, prompting Lynn to do many interviews and radio spots in the country, with Escena Indie en Colombia naming the track #2 in their Top 5 Songs of 2014 Countdown. The release of the \\"We Will Overcome\\" single was the first original music released by Lynn since 2012's Tramp Stamps and Birthmarks. On September 30, 2014 Lynn released the \\"We Will Overcome\\" music video, directed by Andrew Carreon, and featuring vintage super 8 family film clips spliced together with studio clips of Lynn. The exclusive world premiere was hosted by Vortex Music Magazine. In May 2015, Lynn launched the \\"Keep Oregon Well\\" campaign to fight stigma surrounding mental and behavioral health, working with Trillium Family Services and Alpha Media. In its first year, Lynn's \\"Keep Oregon Well\\" concert series had shows with Walk Off The Earth, Of Monsters And Men, David Gray, Priory, Collective Soul, The Dandy Warhols, Charli XCX, Bleachers, Michael Franti, Matt Nathanson, Eric Hutchinson, Borns, Fiona Apple's band Watkins Family Hour, Vintage Trouble and other artists, actors, bands and musicians. Lynn interviewed many of the bands backstage before the shows about their own self care and experiences of mental health on the road, in their band, and in their personal lives. =2016: \\"The One\\", Mental Health Advocacy, Pulse Orlando Charity Single, Adieu.= On January 1, 2016, Lynn and his longtime producer and collaborator Gino Mari released a new single called \\"The One\\". Lynn cited his friends and former labelmates The Dandy Warhols for being the inspiration behind the song's modern garage rock sound. Glide Magazine wrote \\"Logan Lynn has always had a knack for making danceable rock and pop and with 'The One' he shows that he can now confidently rock out with the same gusto\\". The music video for \\"The One\\" features both Lynn and Mari, and was directed by Grammy Award-winning musician and producer Matt Alber. With the release of \\"The One\\", Lynn also announced that his 8th studio album, Adieu. will be released in Summer 2016. In February 2016 MTV's Logo Network announced that Lynn would be taking over their social media to cover the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for the network's blog, NewNowNext. That same month, Paste Magazine released the album art for Adieu. and Vortex Music Magazine released the liner notes, where Lynn writes about his ongoing struggle with depression, surviving suicidal ideation in the face of grief, and how he coped with persistent mental and behavioral health challenges. In June 2016, two days after the mass killing of LGBT people and their allies at Pulse Orlando, Lynn and Mari released a new charity single titled \\"Go There When You Want to Be Loved\\" in support of the families and survivors most impacted by the tragedy. Lynn and Mari donated 100% of the proceeds to recovery efforts with Orlando's gay community. In a feature story and interview with Myspace Music the week of the release, Lynn said \\"I'm a gay man, so I can't donate blood, even to save other gay men who are dying because they are losing their own blood, so it felt very much like I needed to do something other than sit on my hands. I wrote the song about feeling like I didn't have a safe place in the world; This feeling like I'm a man without a country, I'm a man without a place to go.\\" On July 1, 2016 the pre-order for Lynn's eighth studio album Adieu. went live alongside a new single, \\"Can You Get Me Off?\\" Lynn released his 20th music video, \\"Go There When You Want to Be Loved\\", on August 23, 2016. The video was produced by Molly Preston and directed by Kevin Forrest of Portland Film Works, and was premiered on Logo TV's \\"NewNowNext\\", which called the video \\"an experiment in unbridled joy\\". On September 23, 2016, Lynn released his eighth studio album, Adieu. In the September 2016 issue of Spain's Mondo Sonoro Magazine, Adieu. was selected as a \\"red star new release\\" pick alongside Frank Ocean, giving the album 7 out of 10 stars. That same month, New Noise Magazine wrote that \\"Logan Lynn Brings Back 90s College Rock\\" in their review of the record. The September issue of Blurt Magazine gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, and NBC's \\"Live at 7\\" called the record \\"masterful\\" during a segment with Lynn and Mari. Lynn made appearances at the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas, and returned to the Pacific Northwest to perform an album release show with 101.9 KINK FM at Skype Live Studio in Portland. The show was featured in Willamette Week alongside a feature on Lynn and the old Portland music scene he grew up in with Elliott Smith and The Dandy Warhols. The piece was focused on the release of Adieu., which the publication called his \\"most uncomfortable album yet\\". Lynn was the subject of a feature story in the October 2016 issue of Innocent Words Music Magazine, in which they called him \\"a modern day Gene Kelly\\". Later that month Myspace named Lynn one of their \\"15 Artists We Love\\" and included him alongside Colbie Caillat and others in a special Halloween feature. In November, Lynn was featured in a York News-Times cover story called \\"Struggles Lead Logan Lynn from York to Fame\\", about his life growing up in the small Nebraska town. In December, Portland pop punk royalty Hutch Harris of Saddle Creek and Sub Pop band The Thermals published a story called \\"Just Visiting: A Brief History of Logan Lynn\\" in the Portland Mercury. In it, Harris wrote \\"Portland musician Logan Lynn is many things: a respected songwriter, mental health advocate, and LGBTQ icon. Adieu. is a smart mix of alt-country and indie electronica, with lyrics that may be dark, but are ultimately uplifting. It may have taken decades, but he has finally found his true voice, and is far from saying goodbye. With Adieu., Logan Lynn is really saying hello—to the world, to himself, and to the future.\\" On January 1, 2017 Blurt Music Magazine named Adieu. as of the Top 10 Albums of 2016. Later that month, INsite Atlanta Entertainment Magazine picked the record as one of their \\"Top 5 Albums of the Year\\", stating \\"Adieu. is quite possibly Logan Lynn's best album yet, as each song here builds on the next for an impressively cohesive set, ending in the brilliantly wry \\"Oh, Lucifer\\". Despite a mix of up tempo indie pop and more introspective piano tracks they fit together beautifully. Lynn continues to impress eight records into his career.\\" On January 20, 2017 Lynn released a music video for \\"Oh, Lucifer\\". Logo TV premiered the video and said \\"Logan Lynn Is reclaiming hell as a safe space for queers\\" and \\"skewers the religious right in a most devious way\\" about the release. In February 2017, Disarm Magazine named Adieu. one of the 10 \\"Best Albums of 2016\\" and published a long review of the album, stating \\"Logan Lynn's double album is the defiant, insistent & powerful work of a years' long incubating process, a thoughtful self-interrogation that pulls light out of darkness and healing out of grief, addiction and pain with subtlety, nuance, humor, and lively melodies.\\" =2017 to 2019: Working with Jay Mohr, My Movie Star, Collaborating with Styrofoam for Netflix EastSiders= In March 2017, Lynn appeared on an episode of Jay Mohr's Mohr Stories podcast. Lynn and Mohr discussed music, addiction recovery, overcoming childhood trauma, and mental health at length, as well as a forthcoming Lynn album that was inspired by Mohr.https://artistwaves.com/logan-lynn-the-importance-of-pride-month-in- music-community-7400e5f67468 In September 2017, Paste broke the news that Lynn and Mohr had completed a new record, titled My Movie Star, which was co- Produced by Lynn and Mohr and is a collaboration between Lynn and T-Pain muse GLASYS. In February 2018, Lynn and Mohr released the My Movie Star featurette. The short film featured three previously unreleased songs from Lynn's forthcoming album by the same name. Lynn credits Mohr with inspiring the album, on which Mohr is a producer and co-writer. On August 2, 2018, Earbuddy hosted the exclusive premiere of Lynn and Rian Lewis' \\"Underground\\" music video. The short film was produced by Lynn and Jay Mohr and is a stop-motion animation piece created by LAIKA Studios-trained animator Adam Taylor. Lynn and Mohr released two versions of the music video for \\"Nothing's Ever Wrong\\" on September 10, 2018 via Self-Titled Magazine. Starring Mohr, the video was written and directed by Lynn. The NC-17 Director's Cut featured full frontal nudity; the R-rated version featured backside nudity only. This is the first time Mohr had appeared fully nude in a film. In an interview with Self-Titled, Jay is quoted as saying \\"Logan Lynn is a loving artist. He knows he has doors to open that we can't close, so in ‘Nothing's Ever Wrong' he leaves out everything but what's there. The big change to the minor chords when he sings 'cause it's not my life'.... It shook me. I mean driving-and-crying shook me. It's so beautiful. Indescribably beautiful, but it's ominous for me... foreboding. Like if he goes any further it will break your heart; a door that can never be closed if he opens it.\\" On October 12, 2018, Lynn's ninth studio album was released alongside the music video and single for \\"This Time I Lost It All\\". In a review of the record, Billboard said “For nearly 20 years, dance-pop artist Logan Lynn has made a career out of crafting catchy, disorderly songs that almost all include big beats, fun melodies and cheeky lyrics. But on his latest album, My Movie Star, Lynn has traded in his signature sound for a more somber, melancholy tone — a dynamic new album consisting of Lynn’s new piano-driven songs and filled with remixes and covers by other industry greats.” On November 22, 2019 Lynn released a new electropop single titled \\"Name Your Trouble\\", which was written and produced in collaboration with Styrofoam (musician) for the EastSiders season 4 soundtrack on Netflix.

The resulting speculation about the nature of their relationship led to a barrage of online harassment towards both, including a coordinated misinformation campaign by thousands of fans of the Opie and Anthony radio show. During this time, it was reported that Lynn would be canceling the My Movie Star tour which had been announced at the time of the album’s release, and was set to feature Lynn and Mohr, as well as collaborators Glasys, Matt Alber, and others. In March 2019, People magazine published an exclusive piece on Lynn, detailing the months of targeted harassment and homophobic abuse, which stemmed from a since-deleted hate group on Reddit about shock jocks Opie and Anthony. Regarding the widespread bullying, Lynn told People “It’s been my experience that nothing triggers this type of toxic masculinity culture more than a gay man who isn’t afraid, and I can’t think of anything I am less afraid of than a bunch of fragile dudes who can’t deal with my existence.” https://people.com/music/naked-video-jay-mohr- online-bullying-friend-singer-logan-lynn/ Working with Portugal.

He talked to us, and we loved his vibe and loved what he’s doing. Honestly, it’s an issue that we see every day, which is not like a lot of the other issues that we stand for. This is something that we see on the streets, and honestly, something we see very severely in our own group quite often, especially with a lot of musicians. That’s why we wanted to get into it.\\" In an interview on KOIN TV, Carothers said \\"Have you ever met this guy? Logan Lynn is great\\".

On 4 January 1918, she was hit and sunk by a torpedo from the German U-boat . History Rewa was ordered in 1905 by the British India Steam Navigation Company (BI) from William Denny & Bros at Dumbarton at the same time as sister ship SS Rohilla from Harland & Wolff Ltd of Belfast. They differed mainly in their engines: Rewa was triple- screw with steam turbines, while Rohilla had a pair of quadruple expansion steam engines, also made by Harland & Wolff, and twin screws. Rohillas engines totalled , producing on sea trials. Although ordered for the London to Calcutta service, increased competition prompted BI to design the two sisters to be suitable also as troopships. Career Rewa as a hospital ship. Rewa was run aground at the Suez Canal in November 1906, and was refloated The British India Company's transport Rewa was run aground at the Suez Canal on 26 November 1906, blocking the canal, and was refloated by the next day.http://www.shipwreckworld.com/maps/hmhs-rewa In 1913 she entered the Suez Canal from Karachi carrying the 2nd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment homeward bound to England.http://www.worcestershireregiment.com/bat_2_1881_1913.php Sinking The sinking of the British Hospital Ship Rewa On 4 January 1918, Rewa was returning to Britain from Malta with 279 wounded officers aboard. Neutral inspectors from Spain had boarded the ship in Gibraltar to confirm that she had no military function. At 11:15, she was hit by a torpedo off Hartland Point. The ship took around two hours to sink, allowing all wounded and ship's crew to board lifeboats except for the four engine men who died in the initial explosion. Aftermath The sinking of the ship caused outrage in Britain. The German high command denied sinking the ship, instead blaming the explosion on a loose British mine. However, German naval command had declared unrestricted submarine warfare in a desperate effort to win the war. The naval command secretly ordered U-boat captains to sink any Allied ship, including hospital ships, even though it violated Hague Convention X. However, the captain of U-55 Wilhelm Werner—perhaps fearing the consequences of his actions—wrote in the ship's log that he sank a cargo vessel and not a brightly lit and painted hospital ship. After the war, Wilhelm Werner was hunted by Allied command in an effort to charge him for war crimes, but he disappeared, thus avoiding a trial. In 2002, a stone was erected near Hartland Point dedicated to the ship and the people who served and died on her. Wreckage The wreckage lies at 50.55°N 04.49°W, which is located off the west UK coast. It lies in about of water which makes it difficult for all but the most experienced diver to explore. During the Second World War, the wreckage was often mistaken by British sonar for a German U-boat. To confirm that a U-Boat was not just hiding on the sea bed, Allied ships would drop depth charges, called opening the \\"tin can\\". If oil or German bodies floated to the surface then they knew they had destroyed a U-Boat. If nothing floated up then they would move to the next sonar target. This process totally destroyed the wreck of Rewa.

The machine gun was certified for design finalisation in 1980 and entered the PLA service in the mid-1980s, specifically in 1983. The Type 80 was intended as a successor to the Chinese independently developed Type 67, doing well in tests conducted in the Chengdu Military Region before it was dropped and instead, opted to keep the Type 67 GPMG in use. Only a few Type 80s were used in the People's Liberation Army Marine Corps and airborne units, and a modified Type 80, named as Type 86, was then accepted by PLA armor units. History The development of the GPMG started when Chinese firearms engineers studied PKMs that were captured from Vietnamese forces during the Sino-Vietnamese War. Changfeng Machinery was subcontracted to create the CS/LM4 in order to have it chambered to 7.62 NATO caliber. The CS/LM4 has been marketed to countries that have used Soviet/East European/Chinese-made small arms, but have oriented to use NATO-based ammo.  Design  The Type 80 chambers and fires the 7.62×54mmR round. It is a gas- operated, air-cooled, belt-fed, fully automatic firearm. It can fire on both the tripod and the foldable bipod on the gas tube below the barrel. Belts are used from 100-round boxes in the light machine gun configurations, and from 200- or 250-round boxes in tripod-mounted applications. The machine gun uses an open iron sight, but can also be fitted with an optical or night-vision sight.  Variants  * Type 80 - The copy of the PKM GPMG, chambered in 7.62×54mmR. * Type 86 - A machine gun only used for tanks as a secondary weapon. * CF06 - An export-only version of the Type 80, which is chambered for 7.62 NATO ammunition. A study on creating the CF06 started with an evaluation from July to December 2006 with a prototype review on February 2007. Production started from April to May 2007 before the CF06 was officially formalized in January 2008. It's equipped with polymer furniture instead of the wooden furniture used in the original Type 80.

In her early sixties, during the mid-1950s, she had a memorable recurring TV role on The Honeymooners, playing Mrs. Gibson, Ralph Kramden's sharp-tongued, interfering mother-in-law. Early years, marriage and three daughters Born in Chicago, Owen started performing around the time of her fourteenth birthday in 1907. Although she is credited with appearances on a number of vaudeville circuits, her primary venue was the legitimate stage, mostly as a member of regional touring theatre groups. Following marriage, in her early twenties, to a Wisconsin veterinarian, Raymond G. Owens(1892-1926) on June 19, 1919, she had three daughters, and while the eldest, Mary, would move to Texas, upon deciding on a career as a social worker in Fort Worth, the younger girls, Virginia and Armilda Jane, followed their mother into show business as actresses. While raising a family, Ethel Waite continued to maintain her career and adopted Ethel Owen, the shortened version of her married surname, as a new stage name. She continued to perform in summer stock, and Armilda Jane, born in Milwaukee in 1923, began as a child actress in her mother's plays. Well known in summer stock by her tenth birthday, she was even offered a film contract at a time when the success of Shirley Temple's first starring films in 1934 caused studios to conduct searches for other talented performing youngsters, but her mother decided against the move. In succeeding years, she became a teenage performer in musical comedy and, changing her stage name to Pamela Britton, had co-starring roles on Broadway and in a few films, including two classics, the 1945 musical Anchors Aweigh, playing Frank Sinatra's Brooklyn-accented girlfriend, and the 1950 noir, D.O.A., eventually moving to TV sitcoms as the scatterbrained title character in 1957's Blondie and, from 1963 to 1966, as the inquisitive landlady, Mrs. Brown, in My Favorite Martian.\\"Pamela Britton, 'Blondie' Star, Actress in Musicals, Is Dead; Appeared With Sinatra\\". The New York Times (June 19, 1974) The middle daughter, Virginia, proceeded in her mother's footsteps by retaining her own given name and likewise adopting \\"Owen\\" as a stage surname. Put under contract with RKO Pictures, she was mentioned in Louella Parsons' November 26, 1946 column, regarding \\"an interesting announcement\\" soon to be made concerning \\"William Hornstein, a Los Angeles business executive\\",\\"Hollywood---By Louella O Parsons\\" (The Milwaukee Sentinel, November 25, 1946) but no further details were revealed until over three years later, when another story described Virginia's 1950 marriage to University of North Carolina graduate William A. Loock, Jr.\\"Virginia Owen Speaks Vows at Bronxville, N.Y.\\" (The Milwaukee Journal, March 5, 1950) During her brief 1946–48 sojourn into film acting at RKO, the sole on-screen credit she received was for playing dance-hall girl Ginger Kelly, fifth-billed second female lead in Zane Grey-based Thunder Mountain, the first of 29 entries in Tim Holt's 1947–52 B-western series. As a New York actress, on Broadway and radio At the start of the Depression 1930s, the Owens family left Milwaukee to settle in New York City, where Ethel Owen, now in her late thirties and early forties, found steady work in regional theatre, radio plays and even the black operetta, Africana, with a mixed cast, which had its November 26, 1934 opening night at Broadway's newly renamed Venice Theatre disrupted by a man claiming to be the story's uncredited co-author. Saddled with negative reviews (The New York Times called it \\"Whimper of the Jungle\\"),L. N. {Lewis Nichols} \\"Whimper of the Jungle\\". The New York Times (November 27, 1934) the show closed on the 28th. Much and, eventually, most of her work came from radio, the prime home entertainment medium of the 1930s and 40s. The tens of thousands of broadcast hours, especially those featuring dramatic presentations, required a constant supply of voice professionals who were called upon to perform in multiple shows within the course of a single day, thus making the list of credits for a hard working performer such as Ethel Owen run into the thousands. One of her most-consistent regular assignments was on the long-running 1936–57 police series Gang Busters which featured listener participation in apprehending criminals. She also played Abbey Trowbridge in the soap opera Valiant Lady. Following Dr. Raymond Owens' death in 1926, the now-widowed actress continued her non-stop working schedule during the World War II years, while still looking after her grown daughters. In 1943–44 and in 1946, she was in two Broadway shows, the Phoebe and Henry Ephron comedy Three's a Family and the revival of Show Boat. The three-act Family, which Henry Ephron also directed, opened at the Longacre Theatre on May 5, 1943Nichols, Lewis. \\"The Play\\". The New York Times (May 6, 1943) and ran for 497 performances, transferring to the Belasco Theatre on May 28, 1944 and closing there on July 8. Show Boat, with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre on January 5, 1946,Nichols, Lewis. \\"The Play\\". The New York Times (January 7, 1946) eight weeks after Kern's death on November 11, 1945. The production, with 115 cast members, including Ethel Owen in the non-singing role of Parthy Hawks, the mother of Magnolia, played by Jan Clayton, counted 418 performances, closing on January 4, 1947 — the longest-running revival of a stage musical at that point in Broadway history. In her mid-fifties, Owen married insurance executive John Hale Almy (1886-1967) on April 2, 1949. They lived in New York City's affluent suburb of Bronxville. It was there, in March 1950, that the wedding of Virginia Owen to William A. Loock, Jr. was held, with John Hale Almy giving his stepdaughter in marriage. On television Starting in 1947–48, at the dawn of a period referenced as the Golden Age of Television, Edith Owen began appearing in the numerous live drama series emanating from New York. One of her earliest performances was in the title role of \\"Old Lady Robbins\\", the November 3, 1948 episode of NBC's hour-long series Kraft Television Theatre. Also in the presentation, in her first screen appearance, was eighteen-year-old Grace Kelly. Owen's other dramatic roles included roles in shows such as Inner Sanctum, Armstrong Circle Theatre and the two-part December 20–27, 1954 Robert Montgomery Presents Christmastime production of David Copperfield, in which she portrayed Aunt Betsey. The frequent appearances she made between 1952 and 1957 on various incarnations of CBS's very popular Jackie Gleason Show, provided more recognition than any other assignment in the course of her 60-year acting career. Most comments focused on the comic timing she displayed in the show's Honeymooners sketches as Alice Kramden's insult-dispensing mother who specialized in acid-tinged putdowns of her son-in-law Ralph, especially when referring to his \\"fat behind\\". Final years Ethel Owen gradually retired from acting in the mid-1960s, upon reaching her early seventies. She died in Savannah, Georgia, six weeks short of her 104th birthday, outliving by almost 71 years her first husband, Raymond and, by more than two decades, their daughter, Pamela Britton, who died in 1974 at the age of 51. Four days before Owen's death, a story in a local publication reported on a production of Brigadoon at the Contra Costa Musical TheatreOwen's granddaughter, chorus member Kathy Ferber, is described as taking center stage at the final bows as a tribute to her mother, Pamela Britton, who lived in the area for over twenty years, and played Meg Brockie in Brigadoon's original 1947–48 Broadway production, with Ferber also mentioning her 103-year-old grandmother, Owen. She was interred in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island, next to her mother, Katherine Lawlor Wait.

In October 1893, a group of them founded the Bulgarian Macedono-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Committee in Salonica...It engaged in creating a network of secretive committees and armed guerrillas in the two regions as well as in Bulgaria, where an ever-growing and politically influential Macedonian and Thracian diaspora resided. Heavily influenced by the ideas of early socialism and anarchism, the IMARO activists saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and did not pursue the self-determination of Macedonian Slavs as a separate ethnicity. Therefore, Macedonian (and also Adrianopolitan) was an umbrella term covering Bulgarians, Turks, Greeks, Vlachs, Albanians, Serbs, Jews, and so on. While this message was taken aboard by many Vlachs as well as some Patriarchist Slavs, it failed to impress other groups for whom the IMARO remained the Bulgarian Committee.'

(2003) The Past in Question: Modern Macedonia and the Uncertainties of Nation (Princeton: Princeton University Press) led by the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organisation (IMARO or VMARO) against the Ottoman Empire. The leading revolutionary commanders of the local Kruševo Republic were Nikola Karev and Pitu Guli. The battle is an important event that is celebrated in Bulgaria and North Macedonia.  History  Before the battle, Pitu Guli inspected his forces and found out that 70 out of the 300 men part of his unit did not have any weapons so he let them return home. Following the takeover, and subsequent declaration of the Krusevo Republic, the surrounding areas were besieged by the Ottoman forces for an estimated 10 days, with the forces of the Macedonian Bulgarians and Vlach being outnumbered and overrun. Following the battles of Sliva and Meckin Kamen, large parts of the Vlach areas and villages were destroyed while 'the Bulgarian quarter' was mostly spared. Revolutionary Pitu Guli and most of his men were killed at the battle of Mečkin Kamen while Nikola Karev managed to break through the Turkish lines and escaped back to Bulgaria. The Turkish forces entered the town of Kruševo on the 12th August 1903. Legend There is a legend behind the name of the hill. A long time ago in a small suburb besides the orchids lived a number of brothers. They occupied their time with agriculture and livestock. One day the brothers were returning from the hill when they were confronted by a big bear. The brave people of Kruševo were not frightened, instead they attacked the bear. The bear rolled a rock down the hill towards the brothers, but then they killed the bear with a couple of strikes from their axes. The rock which was rolled by the bear was known as Mečkin Kamen (Bear's Rock) by the people.  Legacy  A monument exists today on Mečkin Kamen where Pitu Guli was killed. There is a Second World war memorial by Dimo Todorovski at the same site. ReferencesSources * MI-AN Publishing, Skopje 1998, Macedonia Yesterday And Today.

The city is the second-largest by area in the county (52 km²), and the second most-populous. The city is located near the southwestern end of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, from Buenos Aires along Route 3. Overview The settlement is the oldest one in La Matanza County, and was founded in 1570 as a garrison by a Conquistador, Captain Juan de Garay. The modern settlement originated with the 1869 sale of the land by Germán Carrizo to Dr. Mauricio González Catán, a prominent surgeon and provincial legislator. He set aside the land for recreational purposes, christening it the Finca San Mauricio, in honor of his patron saint. He and his wife, Juana del Carmen Palacios, set aside a parcel for the establishment of the Colegio San Mauricio in 1879, and he died in 1895. Home to a dairy, an orchard and numerous other agricultural businesses, the town was established on April 3, 1910, by Dr. Enrique Simón Pérez, a dentist and brother-in-law of González Catán. Writer Martiniano Leguizamón had La Morita, his home, built nearby at the time, and the opening of a Ferrocarril Compañía General en la Provincia de Buenos Aires station promoted the town's growth. The growth in manufacturing establishments in the county from 140 to over 1,600 between 1935 and 1954 led to an influx of migrants from the hinterland, and González Catán grew to become the second- largest city on the county. It social problems increased as well, however, and the city was the site of Father Mario Pantaleo's chapel and day care center from the 1970s onwards. The Provincial Legislature declared it a city on September 19, 1974.La Matanza: González Catán The city's socioeconomic difficulties were dramatized in a 2004 film, Buena Vida Delivery. CEAMSE operates one of the nation's largest landfills in González Catán. Opened in 1977, this facility receives waste from the City of Buenos Aires and 14 Greater Buenos Aires municipalities, and has become a source of health problems for local residents; the construction of recycling and waste-to- energy plants was approved by the county in 2010. González Catán is also known for the Campanópolis theme park. Begun by local businessman Antonio Campana in 1976, Campanópolis was built on a former dump site in a Gothic style reminiscent of a Tim Burton film set and occupies east of Route 3.

Wellness policy Cumberland Valley School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness Policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education — Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Monroe Elementary School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to low-income children. The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. Cumberland Valley School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health’s extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight.

Describing William Pitt the Younger and his role as Prime Minister of Great Britain, the poem is one of the few in the series that is not about a hero of Coleridge. Instead, Pitt is described as Judas, the betrayer of Christ, because of, among other issues, his treatment of political dissidents. Background During the end of 1794, Coleridge began work on the series Sonnets on Eminent Characters which he dedicated to people he respected. The first, \\"To Erskine\\", was printed on 1 December in the Morning Chronicle, and was followed by 10 further sonnets. \\"To Pitt\\", printed on 23 December, was the sixth in the series and was Coleridge's attempt to write a poem contrary in nature to the earlier poems. It was reprinted with a small revision in his magazine The Watchman on 2 April 1796 and included in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems,Mays 2001 pp. 155, 160–161 under the name \\"Effusion 3, to Mercy\\". This edition was soon reprinted in The Universal Magazine for the October 1796 edition.Mays 2001 II p. 213 In May 1794, Pitt suspended Habeas Corpus in response to allegations that both the London Constitutional Society and the London Corresponding Society were plotting against the government. This crack down on opposition to his Prime Ministry was followed by the 1794 Treason Trials, which charged political dissidents with treason. Coleridge witnessed the trials and was affected to the point that he wrote \\"To Erskine\\", the first of the Sonnets on Eminent Characters, about Thomas Erskine's defense of the accused. Although Coleridge was an opponent of Pitt's at the time of writing the sonnet \\"To Pitt\\", he was to later change his mind about politics and Pitt's government.Ashton 1997 pp. 53, 156, 209 Coleridge changed his mind about the content of \\"To Pitt\\", but still included the poem in his 1803 edition of works under the probable advisement by his friend Charles Lamb. Later, he revised the poem again for an 1828 collection and it kept that form in the two collections that followed in 1829 and 1834.Mays 2001 pp. 160–161 Poem The 1796 collected version of the poem reads:Mays 2001 p. 161 In the original edition, the 8th line to the 13th read: To this, a footnote to the 8th line read explaining that the reference was to the Earl of Chatham and a footnote to the 12th line explaining that the reference was to Justice. Themes \\"To Pitt\\" is one of the few poems in the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series that does not address one of the writer's heroes. It deals with actions of the Prime Minister that resulted in the suspension of Habeas Corpus, as well as the government's response to those opposed to Pitt's actions. As Rosemary Ashton, the 20th-century Coleridge biographer, points out that, \\"Coleridge undoubtedly courted prosecution of this attack, not least because of the emotive allusion to Britain as Christ betrayed by Judas- Pitt.\\"Ashton 1997 p. 61 Fellow biographer Richard Holmes described the poem as Coleridge having \\"daringly attacked\\" Pitt.Holmes 1989 p. 81 However, the political ramifications and effect of the poem were ephemeral. In a 1901 account, H D Traill claimed that Coleridge's sonnets did not fully achieve the effect the poet sought. Even though the thought behind the sonnet is \\"neatly wrapped up in its envelope of words [...] as in the sonnet to Pitt\\" it \\"is too frequently only another word for an ephemeral violence of political feeling which, whether displayed on one side or the other, cannot be expected to reproduce its effect in the minds of comparatively passionless posterity.\\"Traill 1901 p. 34 The poem is related to the earlier \\"To Burke\\", from the same series. In that poem, Coleridge looked at Burke's rhetorical abuse of the concept of \\"freedom\\". This idea is examined again and, as with the earlier poem, the abusive figure is seen as a male dominating a female image. Pitt, as Judas, kisses a female version of Christ while simultaneously seeking to seduce that female character, which represents Britain. Other female characters, justice and mercy, are said to destroy Pitt, but it is uncertain within the poem as how they attain this destruction. The use of symbolic female characters is relied on in many of Coleridge's poems for positive and negative images.Fulford 1999 pp. 66–69 NotesReferences * Ashton, Rosemary.

Created in 2004, its mission is to coordinate, and advise the President on, intelligence. It is attached administratively to the Ministry of the Interior. Its current director is Gonzalo Yuseff Quiroz. The previous director was Gustavo Villalobos, who was also the last director of Directorate of Public Security and Information (Dirección de Seguridad Pública e Informaciones in Spanish). ANI's budget is approximately $4 million USD.Chris Hippner, \\"A Study Into the Size of the World’s Intelligence Industry\\" (Master's Thesis, December 2009), 88, https://www.scribd.com/doc/23958185/A-Study-Into-the-Size-of-the-World-s- Intelligence-Industry.  Background  The history of the Chilean intelligence services originates in the early nineteenth century, when a Military Secret Service was created to conduct special operations. Its most notable work was during the War of the Pacific, when it carried out several successful missions. These were recreated in a very popular military novel in Chile, Adiós al Séptimo de Línea, by Jorge Inostroza Cuevas. The services were restructured when the Chilean Army was professionalised with the support of the Prussian army, creating the Dirección de Inteligencia del Ejército (Army Intelligence Directorate), or DINE. In parallel, the Navy and the Air Force created their own services (Naval Intelligence and the Intelligence Service of the Air Force). During the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (Directorate of National Intelligence), or DINA, was also created, directed especially to combat the leftist parties and movements (Socialist, Communist and MIR). Its first director was Colonel Manuel Contreras. This institution was dissolved in 1977 to create its replacement, the Central Nacional de Informaciones (National Information Centre, or CNI), which performed the same tasks as the DINA. The CNI was dissolved in 1990.  Organization and Duties  The ANI was established by Law No. 19974 of 2004, establishing roles, rules, and the secrecy with which it operates. Its highest authority is the director, responsible for the exclusive trust of the president. The agency, according to 2006 regulations, has a staff of approximately 125 people. It is the legal continuation of the Directorate of Public Security and Information (DISPI, popularly known as The Office or La Oficina in Spanish) and the Intelligence Directorate of the Defense Staff of National Defense (DID), the Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces and the intelligence directorates or Headquarters of the Forces of Order and Public Security, or the Carabineros and the Investigations Police of Chile. Its main task is to carry out work on political intelligence, as part of the intelligence system of the State of Chile, and complementing the work of the Military Intelligence Directorate of the Armed Forces of Chile and the police intelligence units of both the Carabineros de Chile and the Investigations Police of Chile. =Espionage is not part of duties= According to the Chilean Government, the ANI does not engage in espionage.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-31784336 ReferencesExternal links * Budget for ANI, Government of Chile Military intelligence agencies Signals intelligence agencies Chilean intelligence agencies 2004 establishments in Chile Government agencies established in 2004 Government agencies of Chile 2004 in Chilean law ","title":"Agencia Nacional de Inteligencia"},{"id":"23831536","title":"Slippin' Away (Jean Shepard song)"},{"id":"23831537","text":"Antonio Mattei Lluberas (September 7, 1857 – January 15, 1908), was a businessman and politician who in 1897 planned and led the second and last major uprising against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, known as the Intentona de Yauco. Early years Mattei Lluberas was born in the town of Yauco, Puerto Rico to Antonio Mattei Casanova and Mercedes Lluberas Torres de Figueroa. Mattei Lluberas' father's parents, who were of Corsican descent, sent him to France where he received his primary and secondary education.Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte XII He returned to Puerto Rico and became a wealthy businessman after he established a successful coffee plantation. He later married Ana María Rita Emmanuelli Negroni, the (daughter of Louis Henri Emanuelli Ciavaldini b 1824 Corsica and Ana Maria Negroni Rodriguez) and had three children: Rita María, Rita Monserrate and Luis Antonio. Intentona de Yauco Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the \\"Intentona de Yauco\\" revolt Mattei Lluberas was among the many Puerto Ricans at the time who professed liberal ideals and believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation free from Spanish Colonial rule. As such, he became involved with the island's revolutionary movement and became one of their leaders. In 1896, Mattei Lluberas met with Mateo Mercado and a group of \\"Yaucanos\\" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico in Barrio Barinas of Yauco and made plans to overthrow the government. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluberas, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.Historia militar de Puerto Rico, by Hector Andres Negroni (Author); Pages: 305–06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; ; In 1897, Mattei Lluberas visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined José Martí's struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.Noticias de la XVII Brigada Juan Rius Rivera en Cuba In accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 machetes which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a Puerto Rican flag and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of the Dominican Republic), were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.Historia militar de Puerto Rico, by Hector Andres Negroni (Author); Pages: 307; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; ; The Mayor of Yauco Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Marín González the governor of the island. Fidel Velez, a native of Sabana Grande and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of El Grito de Lares. On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil.Sabia Usted? , Sabana Grande, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009The Flag, Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009 and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not succeed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called \\"Quebradas\\" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed. Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of Ponce. Velez fled to St. Thomas where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the \\"Puerto Rican Commission\\".Projecto Salon Hogar Spanish–American War Portorrican Commission members (from left to right) Pedro Juan Besosa, Rafael Marxuach, José Budet, Warren Sutton, Domingo Collazo, Emilio González, Rafael Muñoz, Mateo Fajardo, and Antonio Mattei Lluveras USS St. Louis Mattei Lluberas and the Puerto Rican Commission in New York had been trying to convince President William McKinley to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken during the Spanish–American War, President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left Tampa, Florida and on July 21 another convoy departed from Guantánamo for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico. Major General Nelson A. Miles, Commanding General of the Army, opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, picking Guánica, at the time a part of the municipality of Yauco, as his landing zone. On July 31, 1898, Mattei Lluberas and his group arrived in Ponce aboard the USS St. Louis and were assigned to the headquarters of General Miles.Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte XII On August 13, the Puerto Rican Campaign came to an end. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States. Later years In 1904, Mattei Lluberas was elected Mayor of Yauco as a candidate of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico. Mattei Lluberas died on January 15, 1908.

Calibre supports organizing existing e-books into virtual libraries, displaying, editing, creating and converting e-books, as well as syncing e-books with a variety of e-readers. Editing books is supported for EPUB and AZW3 formats. Books in other formats like MOBI must first be converted to those formats, if they are to be edited. History On 31 October 2006, when Sony introduced its PRS-500 e-reader, Kovid Goyal started developing libprs500, aiming mainly to enable use of the PRS-500 formats on Linux.https://en.softonic.com/articles/interview-kovid-goyal-creator-of- calibre With support from the MobileRead forums, Goyal reverse-engineered the proprietary Broad Band eBook (BBeB) file format. In 2008, the program, for which a graphical user interface was developed, was renamed \\"calibre\\", displayed in all lowercase. Features Calibre supports many file formats and reading devices. Most e-book formats can be edited, for example, by changing the font, font size, margins, and metadata, and by adding an auto- generated table of contents. Conversion and editing are easily applied to appropriately licensed digital books, but commercially purchased e-books may need to have digital rights management (DRM) restrictions removed. Calibre does not natively support DRM removal, but may allow DRM removal after installing plug-ins with such a function. Calibre allows users to sort and group e-books by metadata fields. Metadata can be pulled from many different sources, e.g., ISBNdb.com; online booksellers; and providers of free e-books and periodicals in the US and elsewhere, such as the Internet Archive, Munsey's Magazine, and Project Gutenberg; and social networking sites for readers, such as Goodreads and LibraryThing). It is possible to search the Calibre library by various fields, such as author, title, or keyword; however , full-text search was unimplemented. E-books can be imported into the Calibre library, either by sideloading files manually or by wirelessly syncing an e-book reading device with the cloud storage service in which the Calibre library is backed up, or with the computer on which Calibre resides. Also, online content-sources can be harvested and converted to e-books. This conversion is facilitated by so-called recipes, short programs written in a Python-based domain-specific language. E-books can then be exported to all supported reading devices via USB, Calibre's integrated mail server, or wirelessly. Mailing e-books enables, for example, sending personal documents to the Amazon Kindle family of e-readers and tablet computers. This can be accomplished via a web browser, if the host computer is running and the device and host computer share the same network; in this case, pushing harvested content from content sources is supported on a regular interval (called 'subscription'). Also, if the Calibre library on the host computer is stored in a cloud service, such as Box.net, Google Drive, or Dropbox, then either the cloud service or a third-party app, such as Calibre Cloud or CalibreBox, can be used to remotely access the library. Since version 1.15, released in December 2013, Calibre also contains an application to create and edit e-books directly, similar to the more full-featured Sigil application, but without the latter's WYSIWYG editing mode. Associated apps * Calibre Cloud (free) and Calibre Cloud Pro (paid), apps by Intrepid Logic that let one \\"access your Calibre e-book library from anywhere in the world. Place your calibre library in your Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive folder, and be able to view, search, and download from your library anywhere\\". As Jane Litte at Dear Author and John Jeremy at Teleread observe: This tool can be used to \\"create [one's] own Cloud of eBooks\\" and thereby read and allow downloads and emails from one's Calibre library via the Calibre folder in Box.net, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Because the Calibre-generated local wireless feed (OPDS) can only be accessed on devices sharing the same network as the Calibre library, this feature of the Calibre Cloud apps is particularly useful when away from one's home network, because it allows one to download and read the contents of one's Calibre library via the Calibre folder in Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. * Calibre Companion (paid), an app by MultiPie, Ltd., recommended by calibre's developers, \\"brings complete integration with calibre on your desktop, giving you total control over book management on your device.\\" John Jermey at Teleread notes this app can manage Calibre/device libraries as if one's mobile device were plugged into computer; however, unlike Calibre Cloud, Calibre Companion requires users to be at a computer and use the Calibre-generated local wireless feed (OPDS). * Calibre Library (paid), an app by Tony Maro that allows one to \\"Connect wirelessly to your Calibre e-book library or other Stanza source. Browse and download your e-books on the go.\\" This app's operations and benefits are similar to those offered by Calibre Cloud. * Calibre Sync (free), an app by Seng Jea Lee that \\"seamlessly connects to your Calibre Library and shows up as a connected device on Calibre. If Auto-Connect option is enabled, your device will attempt to connect to the Calibre Library when it is within the home Wi-Fi network. This allows Calibre to automatically update your device with the latest newspaper or magazines you have scheduled for download!\\" As with Calibre Companion, this app requires the device to be on the same network as the Calibre library. * CalibreBox (free and paid), an app by Eric Hoffmann that, like Calibre Cloud, accesses Calibre libraries from cloud storage. Unlike Calibre Cloud, it is limited to Dropbox, but CalibreBox supports more than one library at a time, and flexible sorting and filtering. Custom column support for the book detail view, sorting, and filtering by custom columns, and adding more than two libraries are restricted to paid users. The app is built on the design principles of Google's Material Design and is under active development. * Calibre-go (free), app by Litlcode Studios lets you access your Calibre e-book library from cloud storage and access the library through Calibre-go to browse, sort, search and read books on your mobile. Calibre-go supports multiple libraries across multiple accounts simultaneously. *Calibre Sync (paid), an Android app by BIL Studio that lets you access Calibre libraries from cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, and pCloud), or from SD card.

Warsaw: Wydawnictwo MON, 1974, p. 123 The first prototype, named 'Pionier' (registration SP-1598) was flown on 25 February 1956 by Stanisław Skrzydlewski at Bielsko, leading to modifications to improve the room in the cockpit, re-position the winch launch hook to increase directional stability during winch launching, and to increase the strength of the forward fuselage. Further improvements were made to the second prototype, SZD-15-2 Sroka (registration SP-1667), which flew on 1 February 1957. Production aircraft were designated SZD-15A, and 20 were built in ZSLS in Krosno, in addition to the two prototypes. The flying characteristics of the SZD-15A were a marked improvement on those of the IS-B Komar, including better climb performance in weak thermals. The solo training regime employed by Polish Aero Clubs up to the late 1950s was eventually proven to be inefficient, thus the 'raison d'etre' of the SZD-15 Sroka was removed, and the remaining SZD-15s were used as club single seaters until superseded by higher performance club aircraft in the mid-1970s.

N.Kumaran Asan presided over the meeting and in this meeting a society was formed to spread Guru's principles \\"One Caste, One Religion, One God\\". The name of this society was Sree Narayana Guru Smaraka Samajam. K.S. Krishna Thandan and Thandassery Kunjayyappan were the promoters of the society. After staying a week at Karattuprambil Tharavadu, Guru and his disciple Asan went back to Moothakunnam after visiting other Thiyya Tharavadus like Thandassery (Kizhakkummury), Adipparambil (Valappad), Pokkanchery, Thachappally (Engandiyur) and Vazhoor. After three months, Guru sent his first disciple Shivalinkadas to Peringottukara. According to K.R. Achuthan it happened the following July. Sivalinkadas stayed at Krishna Thandan's residence and started the collection of funds to construct an Ashramam (the holy place were Hindu Saints live). The construction of Sree Narayana Asrama was completed in 1906. During this time Guru visited Peringottukara again and again and helped people to free themselves from castism and untouchability. Ashram After the opening of Sree Narayana Ashrama, Guru appointed scholars of different disciplines as teachers to this Ashrama. Among them were P. Govindanassan, Swamy Shivalingadas and Swamy Bhodhananda Giry. There was a long array of disciples studied at Sree Narayana Ashrama. The important personalities were Sadguru Malayala Swamy (founder of Sri Vyasashram at Yerpedu, Andhra Pradesh) and Swamy Ramananda (founder of Siddhavaidyasramam Kurkkanchery, Thrissur). Holy union of Siva and Parvathy in a Valampirishankh The idea of Swamy Bodhananda to destroy casteism and Brahmin supremacy was quiet different from Sree Narayana Guru. He was against religious beliefs and opposed idol worship. The humanism he practiced was self-purification of thought and action. The First Social Reformer introduced a common dining table, common staying homes, common school rooms and inter-caste marriage system for Dalits in India was Swamy Bodhananda Giri. Later, Sahodaran Ayyappan Accepted these principles as his life mission. Bodhananda Swami organized an armed organization for crushing untouchability castism and Brahmin supremacy. The name of this organization was Dharmabhadasena. It fought three decisive battles against Brahmins. They were Cheloor Kalapam at Thriprayar (1912), Arattupuzha Poooram Kalapam at Peringottukara and Chirakkal(1918) Thanissery Kalapam (1918) at Thanissery near Irinjalakkuda. Bengaly Asan, Thoppiyil Bahuleyan, and Ottappalam Krishnan were leaders and heroes. In the British ruled Cochin state, Peringottukara was the cultural capital of Thiyyas and other backward people. It all started under the leadership of Sree Narayana guru.

She was renamed Glenart Castle in 1914, but was requisitioned for use as a British hospital ship during the First World War. On 26 February 1918, she was hit and sunk by a torpedo fired from the German U-boat . Operational history=Mine damage= During the First World War, Glenart Castle suffered damaged when she struck a mine in the English Channel northwest of the Owers Lightship on 1 March 1917. She was repaired and returned to service. =Sinking= On 26 February 1918, Glenart Castle was leaving Newport, South Wales, heading towards Brest, France. Fishermen in the Bristol Channel saw her clearly lit up as a hospital ship. John Hill — a fisherman on Swansea Castle — remembered \\"I saw the Hospital Ship with green lights all around her – around the saloon. She had her red side lights showing and mast-head light, and also another red light which I suppose was the Red Cross light.\\" At 04:00, Glenart Castle was hit by a torpedo in the No. 3 hold. The blast destroyed most of the lifeboats, while the subsequent pitch of the vessel hindered attempts to launch the remaining boats. In the eight minutes the ship took to sink, only seven lifeboats were launched. Rough seas and inexperienced rowers swamped most of the boats. Only 32 survivors were reported. A total of 162 people were killed, including the Captain — Bernard Burt, eight nurses of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, seven Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) medical officers and 47 medical orderlies. Of the hospital patients being treated on board, a total of 99 died. The matron of Glenart Castle, Miss Kate Beaufoy (1868–1918), was among those killed in the sinking. Beaufoy was a veteran of the South African War and the Gallipoli campaign. Her family kept her diary and her writings describe life on the ship. Evidence was found suggesting that the submarine may have shot at initial survivors of the sinking in an effort to cover up the sinking of Glenart Castle. The body of a junior officer of Glenart Castle was recovered from the water close to the position of the sinking. It was marked with two gunshot wounds, one in the neck and the other in the thigh. The body also had a life vest indicating he was shot while in the water. Memorial stone to Glenart Castle Aftermath After the war, the British Admiralty sought the captains of U-boats who sank hospital ships, in order to charge them with war crimes. Kapitänleutnant Wilhelm Kiesewetter — the commander of UC-56 — was arrested after the war on his voyage back to Germany and interned in the Tower of London. He was released on the grounds that Britain had no right to hold a detainee during the Armistice. Memorial A memorial plaque was dedicated on the 84th anniversary of the sinking, 26 February 2002 near to Hartland Point, with the inscription, \\"In proud and grateful memory of those who gave their lives in the hospital ship Glenart Castle. Please remember, Master Lt. Cmdr. Burt, Matron Katy Beaufoy, the ships officers, crew and medical staff who died when their ship was torpedoed by UC56 in the early hours of 26th Feb 1918. The ship lies 20 miles WNW from this stone. For those in peril on the sea. R.I.P. Dedicated 26.02.2002\\". The Scottish military charity Glen Art was founded in 2013 by Fiona MacDonald in honour of her great aunt nurse Mary McKinnon who died while serving on the ship. In February 2018, Glen Art held a memorial concert in Arisaig Scotland commemorating the centenary of the sinking of HMHS Glenart Castle and nurse McKinnon’s death.

The objective is to \\"besiege\\" Ciudad Juárez to concentrate forces and saturate the area to confront the three cartels already operating in the city. Ciudad Juárez is known to be one of the most dangerous cities in the Americas. In the year 2007 more than 100 police officers were killed in Juárez in attacks blamed on organized crime. As a result of drug cartel violence, President Felipe Calderón has previously launched other Joint Operations in other states. Background=Ciudad Juárez and Violence= In 2008, Ciudad Juárez was designated as “The City of the Future” by the prestigious magazine “Foreign Direct Investment” published by the influential “Financial Times group.”. However, the city is also a site of widespread poverty and violence, including an infamous series of unsolved murders of female factory workers. The violence generated by the war of the drug cartels for control of drug routes translated into some 6,000 killings in 2008. More than 1,600 of them occurred in Juárez, three times more than the most murderous city in the United States. As of July 14, 2009, the body count in Juárez surpassed 1000, which is an acceleration over the year 2008. This mark was not reached in 2008 until over two months later: September 16. =Declaration of War against The Cartels= On December 1, 2006, President Felipe Calderón assumed office and declared war on drug traffickers. Troops and Federal Police forces were ordered to move into hot zones where drug cartels operated—especially in Michoacán, Tamaulipas, and Ciudad Juárez. Calderón also imposed a cap on salaries of high-ranking public servants and ordered a raise on the salaries of the Federal Police and federal armed forces. Since early 2007, 2,500 Mexican troops have been sent to Juárez to combat organized crime. 2008=Earlier events= On February 17, troops from the 20th Motorized Cavalry Regiment carrying out a surveillance mission in Ciudad Juárez raided a safe house belonging to the Juárez Cartel; in the raid 21 suspects were arrested along with the arrest a huge amount of drugs, weapons, ammunition, military and police uniforms and three vehicles were seized. On March 7 in the capital city of Chihuahua, acting on an anonymous tip troops from the 23rd Infantry Battalion confronted a group of gunmen which opened fire and threw grenades at soldiers who also returned fire. six of the gunmen were killed while three were arrested. The army reported that five soldiers were injured and one soldier with the rank of 1st Captain was also killed. =Joint Operation Chihuahua begins= On March 27, Secretary of the Interior Juan Camilo Mouriño announced of Joint Operation Chihuahua as a strategy to combat organize crime in the state. That same day members of SEDENA, SSP, and The Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora met to discuss the operation. The government ordered 2,026 army troops and Federal Police officers equipped with 180 vehicles, to reinforce the army garrisons already placed there sixteen Joint Operation bases were installed that are made up Army and Federal Police forces. On March 29, three Air Force C-130's and one Boeing 727 transporting 392 troops arrived at Ciudad Juárez Abraham González International Airport, and by land 805 troops equipped with 116 vehicles belonging to the army's 3rd Independent Infantry Brigade arrived later on that day. On April 8, in the city of Villa Ahumada, the Army received information of a funeral process that was held for a drug trafficker known as Gerardo Gallegos who belonged to the criminal group of the Juárez Cartel. It is assumed that Gerardo Gallegos died in a gun battle with rival groups in Hidalgo del Parral. The army quickly mobilized two units; the first ground unit composed of 35 soldiers equipped with 4 military vehicles from the 76th Infantry Battalion, the second Air unit composed of 15 personnel from the army's Parachute Rifle Special Forces Brigade equipped with one Mi-17 and an MD 503. The Air Unit was sent to the cemetery area to conduct a recon screen, armed men were found to be in the target area which opened fire on the helicopters, but did not manage any impact. Civilians who panic dispersed either running or driving away from the gun battle; simultaneously the air unit descended upon the area giving chase to the gunmen while in the same moment the ground unit arrived and arrested 8 of the assailants, two AK-47's, one M4 Carbine, and one Ruger rifle. Interesting fact was that one of the suspects was a Municipal Police Officer of Villa Ahumada at the time. On May 17, presumed members of the Sinaloa Cartel attacked Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua, and killed the police chief, two officers, and three civilians, and kidnapped at least 10 additional people. On the same day acting on information from an anymous source, military personnel from the 76th Infantry Battalion and 4th Armored Reconnaissance Regiment were sent to a ranch called \\"El Alto\\" located near the town of Hidalgo del Parral. Upon arriving they were met with gunfire from the interior of the ranch. Soldiers returned fired and continued to proceed with the assault with results of 11 men being arrested and various weapons captured. On November 28, gunmen in Ciudad Juárez killed eight people at a restaurant. On December 8, Six people were killed when gunmen opened fire inside a pool hall. 2009 * On February 10, Assailants kidnapped 9 people in Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua. They were then pursued by the military to a ranch located 12 km south of the Garita de Samalayuca, where at least 21 people were killed. The fatalities includes one soldier, 6 of the 9 prisoners and 14 assailants that were killed by the army. This event shares much with the attack of May 17, 2008, and it is presumed that the attackers were members of the Sinaloa Cartel. * On February 14, In the municipality of Villa Ahumada, 125 kilometers south of Ciudad Juárez, troops on patrol fought a gunbattle with cartel gunmen, leaving three assailants dead. =Resignation of Ciudad Juárez Police Chief= * On February 20, Ciudad Juárez Police Chief Robert Orduna announced his resignation after two police officers were killed. Drug traffickers had threatened to kill a police officer every 48 hours until the chief resigned. The change in command in Juárez's police force comes in the wake of a campaign of intimidation by a drug cartel that had the border city in its grip. Orduna is credited in replacing half of the 1,600-person police force with new recruits in a bid to rid it of corrupt members. =Attack on The Governor= * On February 22, five assailants attacked the convoy of Chihuahua governor, José Reyes Baeza, killing a bodyguard. =Government response to the ongoing violence= As a result of the ongoing violence in Juárez, the federal government ordered an extra 5,000 troops from the 11th Military Region and federal police officers equipped with armed helicopters, transport and armored vehicles to the area to put an end on organize once and for all. The reinforcements will assist the 2,500 soldiers and Federal Police officers that were sent in the early year of 2007. On March 1, out of the 5,000 troops, 1,800 troops arrived in Ciudad Juárez. Army troops arrived onboard 90 vehicles of various types and integrated with the 20th Motorized Cavalry Regiment inside the town. A day later the last 3,200 army troops arrived by air and land. =Disarmament of the Police force= *On March 18, military personnel disarmed 1,600 Ciudad Juárez Municipal police officers. Some Municipal personnel were used to transport soldiers on patrol assignments since they already know the area, others were sent home and were told they were not going to be paid. This new event was approved by the city's Mayor José Reyes Ferriz =Four days of silence and ongoing violence= * On March 19, since the arrival of the Army and Federal Police forces, Juárez was given breathing room from violence. Since 2008 and the week before the arrival of Government forces the city was recognized as the most violent in the country with 12 executions a day. But after four days of silence, violence returned in Chihuahua when two men were reported killed in a vehicle in the colony of Puerta del Sol, also killed was a staff member of the city's secretary of traffic, two other civilians were reported murdered. * On March 25, in the city of Chihuahua, Salais Juan Gutierrez, commander of the area of various crimes of the Attorney General State of Justice department was executed by gunmen. Also reported were another four men involved in organized crime were killed in the city, and one more in Ciudad Juárez. * On April 4, six bodies were found in tortured in rural Chihuahua. **Durango Governor Ismael Hernández Deras demanded that the federal government send \\"fully armed and armored\\" Federal Police forces to the state as a result of increasing violence as cause by the Joint Operations in Chihuahua and in Sinaloa, and 9 men were found murdered in the city of Chihuahua * On August 2, 8 men were found dead in Ciudad Juárez and one more in the city of Chihuahua * Officials will make a decision on whether to withdraw the troops is expected before September 15. The mayor of Ciudad Juárez is asking federal authorities not to pull military units out of the region for at least another six months. * In a strip bar in Ciudad Juárez, gunmen burst in and opened fire killing five people and one U.S. airman Staff Sgt. David Booher. Booher had been assigned to the medical unit of the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman Air Force Base outside Alamogordo, N.M.http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2009/11/airforce_mexico_killing_110509w/ 2010 On January 13, Secretariat of Public Security Genaro García Luna informed that he will send another 2,000 Federal Police forces to Ciudad Juárez. On the same day, an armed group consisting of dozens of gunmen attempted to kidnap three military personnel, but they managed to escape. On January 16, the federal government transferred security operations command from the Army to the Secretary of Public Security, also renaming the security operations to Coordinated Operation Chihuahua. On April 23, in Ciudad Juarez, gunmen ambushed two police vehicles while in a busy intersection, killing six police officers and also killing a 17-year-old girl. A Chihuahua State's spokesman confirmed that five of the officers were federal and one was municipal. Authorities recovered two of the three vehicles used in the attack. On the same day, federal authorities announced 16 federal police officers have been detained and accused of extortion, robbery, abuse of authority and breaking and entering. 2011201220132014201520162017201820192020References Operations against organized crime in Mexico Mexican drug war History of Chihuahua (state) Sinaloa Cartel Juárez Cartel ","title":"Operation Chihuahua"},{"id":"23831945","text":"The Vocalstyle Music Company of Cincinnati, Ohio was one of the foremost manufacturers of piano rolls.

It will be gathering flight data with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver strictly designed for space applications to gather flight data in the space environment. ARD is the capability of two independent spacecraft to rendezvous in orbit and dock without crew intervention. One DRAGONSat was built by the University of Texas and the other one was built by Texas A and M University, the Space Shuttle Payload Launcher (SSPL), These satellite projects will rendezvous and dock with each other in space without the benefit of human intervention. DRAGONSat is planned to be an eight-year program with a launch of the satellites approximately every two years. The first three missions will test individual components and subsystems while the final mission will culminate with the successful docking of two satellites. Each mission builds upon the previous mission culminating in a fully autonomous rendezvous and docking mission. Both universities are required to use GPS receivers designed by NASA in order to determine its functionality. One of the objectives is to demonstrate precision real-time navigation capability as well as precision relative navigation between the two satellites. NASA: DRAGONSat Official Site  Operations  DRAGONSat is a pair of two 5 inches x 5 inches x 5 inches satellites which are launched from the Shuttle orbiter payload bay. Both satellites are built of aluminum with a mass of approximately 7.5 kg. Each picosatellite is covered with photo-voltaic cells and will enable a longer active life in orbit. Each satellite also has a dipole antenna and two antennas for the GPS receiver. The satellites are ejected from the SSPL which is located on the payload bay sidewall. = Protocols = Both DRAGONSat are launched together in the Space Shuttle Payload Launcher (SSPL) from the side walls of the orbiter payload bay. They are ejected as a pair and once they are at a safe distance from the Space Shuttle, they will separate and begin the experiment. Data collection will be downlinked to ground stations for as long as the satellites are able to transmit.

DiMenna is a U.S. hedge fund manager and Managing Director of Zweig- DiMenna Associates. He is the Chief Investment Officer of the Zweig-DiMenna partnerships and funds. He co-founded the first fund with Martin Zweig in 1984, serving as Senior Portfolio Manager. Zweig-DiMenna is one of the longest-lived hedge funds. Education DiMenna received a B.S. in Finance from the Fairfield University Dolan School of Business in 1980. He has served as a member of the Board of Trustees. Early career Joe DiMenna started working as a research assistant for Marty Zweig in 1977 while still a college student. Having studied stocks and markets since his early teens, Joe started reading several market newsletters and found Marty Zweig's top rated \\"The Zweig Forecast\\" to be particularly intriguing and useful. As a Ph.D. in finance, Zweig's approach was unique and ahead of its time with the focus being on in depth economic and quantitative research using hard data. Zweig is credited with inventing numerous market indicators including things such as the Put/Call ratio and other important measures of investor sentiment. Several aphorisms that are still widely used such as \\"Don't fight the Fed,\\" and Don't fight the tape,\\" were originated with Marty. This inspired DiMenna to try to emulate some of Zweig's methods. After a few years of doing his own research, DiMenna sent a letter to Marty suggesting some market ideas and also asking for a recommendation to college. This correspondence resulted in Marty hiring Joe as his research assistant which was all about crunching numbers (mostly by hand) and digging into reams of data, often going back 50 or more years. Professional Upon graduating from college in 1980, DiMenna stayed with Marty and continued doing more and deeper market research, as well as beginning to work on stock selection techniques. At around this time, DiMenna started to edit a newsletter focusing on stock selection, and also formed a business with Marty that used market timing techniques to trade mutual funds. Having extensive experience with markets and stocks, DiMenna proposed to Zweig in 1983 the idea that they use their skills to build a money management platform in the form of a hedge fund. While common now, there were fewer than 10 hedge funds in existence at the time with a total amount of assets of several $100mm under management. That compares to there currently being over 10000 funds managing over $2 Trillion.https://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/29/industry-snapshot-26-trillion- in-11000-funds.html DiMenna with Zweig formed the first Zweig-DiMenna partnership in 1984 and Zweig-DiMenna International Limited, the first offshore fund, in 1987. The funds has had a long/short equity focus with macro risk management included. Joe DiMenna's role was portfolio manager responsible for stocks and other investments. Zweig was responsible for assessing changing market conditions. Together they formulated appropriate strategies that DiMenna managed. In 1999, BusinessWeek profiled DiMenna as \\"one of the best stock-pickers no one has ever heard of,\\" recognizing Zweig-DiMenna's 15-year annualized return, after fees, of 25%, vs. the 18.6% annualized total return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.The Stock Whiz You Never Heard Of In 2002, DiMenna was named \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, an organization that promotes the teaching of business principles to students. In 2007, Zweig-DiMenna International hedge fund was Absolute Return Magazine's \\"U.S. Equity Fund of the Year\\" in recognition of its 82.25% annual return which far outpaced its industry peers. The award is based on 3 year returns compared to volatility with high Sharpe ratio.

He played as a tackle at the University of Michigan from 1900 to 1901. Shorts served as the head football coach at the Nevada State University—now known as the University of Nevada, Reno—in 1904 and at the University of Oregon in 1905. Biography=Athlete= Shorts attended high school at Mount Pleasant, Michigan before enrolling at the University of Michigan. Shorts played for Fielding H. Yost's first Michigan Wolverines football team. The 1901 team compiled a record of 11–0 and outscored its opponents 550–0. He was regarded as one of the best tackles in the Western Conference. He was six feet one inch tall and weighed close to 190 pounds while playing at Michigan. He played in 1901 despite being sick. Coach Yost later recalled Shorts' efforts in playing through sickness as follows: > Well do I remember how dangerously near Bruce Shorts, star right tackle, > came to being lost to the 1901 Michigan football team. He was very sick all > season with an attack of appendicitis. His enforced withdrawal from the team > would have greatly weakened it. In an evenly matched game one can visualize > what his absence from the lineup would have meant. Shorts played through the > season, but this nearly cost him his life, for he was a short time later so > sick that it was reported he had died. However, he pulled through. Prior to the 1902 Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Times wrote a profile about the stars of the Michigan football team. About Shorts, the Times wrote: \\"Bruce Shorts, who is the newly chosen team captain of 1902 is 6 feet in height and weighs 190 pounds. For his two years he has played right tackle and his weight makes him one of the strongest men on the team. He is the best ground gainer of the line men.\\" In addition to football, Shorts also competed in the \\"weight\\" events for the Michigan track and field team. He won the Western intercollegiate championship in the hammer throw and was \\"also recognized as a very good shot-putter.\\" =Coach and lawyer= Shorts graduated from the University of Michigan Law School. After practicing law for several months, Shorts was hired in September 1904 as the head football coach at the University of Nevada, Reno. He replaced another former Michigan football player, Allen Steckle, as Nevada's coach. A Reno newspaper reported on Shorts' hiring as follows: > Bruce Shorts, captain of the famous Michigan football team of 1901, arrived > in Reno yesterday to enter upon his duties as coach of the University of > Nevada team. Mr. Shorts is undoubtedly one of the best posted as well as one > of the best football players in the country. ... He is looked upon as the > best coach west of the Mississippi River, and his work this year will > undoubtedly result in maintaining, if not surpassing, the record made by > Coach Steckle last year. The Nevada Sagebrush compiled a 3–3 record in Shorts' one year as head coach. In 1905, Shorts was hired by the University of Oregon.McCann, Michael C. (1995).

Quine, and subscribes to Cartesian dualism, broadly rejecting scientism and materialism. Stevenson's reincarnation research work on children who claimed to remember past lives convinced Almeder that minds are irreducible to brain states. He has argued in several papers and in his Beyond Death: The Evidence for Life After Death (1992) that Stevenson's critics, most notably the philosopher Paul Edwards, have misunderstood the nature of Stevenson's work.Bache, Christopher.

Somesville is the earliest village of the town of Mount Desert on Mount Desert Island in southeastern Maine. It is located on the north end of Somes Sound.Acadia magic.com The village was established by Abraham Somes who was the first settler on the island.Hartford, G.A. (n.d.) \\"Somesville, Maine\\" It attracted many people because of its mills and quarries.Shettleworth, E.J., & Vandenbergh, L.B. (2001) Images of America: Mount Desert Island – Somesville, Southwest Harbor, and Northeast Harbor. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing. The entire village is part of the Somesville Historic District.  History  The history of Somesville dates back to Native Americans. The first Native Americans to visit the island were not permanent residents but they visited the island as far back as 4000 B.C.\\"Mount Desert Island Heritage\\" After the Native Americans, the first families that settled on the island were Abraham and Hannah Somes as well as James and Rachel Richardson in the year of 1761. Somes was requested by the Massachusetts governor, Francis Bernard, to settle there and establish mills. They named their village Somesville and the inlet it was on, Somes Sound, after Abraham and his family. Somesville's history still attracts many new inhabitants today.  Industry  An important aspect of Somesville is its industry. After enough settlers traveled to the island the industry became prosperous. One could find a job in logging, fishing, shipbuilding, coastal trading, or quarry working. The island contained many job opportunities with several logging mills, a shoe factory, and a woolen mill. These industries made the Somes family the wealthiest on the island by 1840 along with the Whiting family, who also owned many warehouses and businesses. The lumber, grist, and wool mills of Somesville were supported by multiple dams.Painter, K. (2006) \\"Gulf of Maine coastal program partners to restore alewives, American eel and sea lamprey in Somesville on Mount Desert Island\\", Fish and Wildlife Journal The granite quarries were also a very large part of the industry. In 1886 the annual shipment of cut stone was estimated to be over 3,500 tons.Varney, G.J. (1886) \\"History of Mount Desert, Maine.\\" A Gazetteer of the State of Maine The booming industry quickly attracted settlers, and by 1950 the population had tripled.  Geology  The Mount Desert Island we see today was largely formed around 380 million years ago by the collision of the continent and an arc of islands, which created the granites and other igneous rocks that comprise most of the island and its mountains. This is how the mountainous landscape came into being.\\"The Geology of Mount Desert Island\\" (Jan. 8, 2008) As recently as one million years ago, a mile-thick glacier moved a few yards each year and eventually reached the Mount Desert Range. During this glacial event, Somes Sound was carved out of the island, giving it a curved \\"U\\"-shaped valley characteristic of glaciation.\\"The Story of Glaciers\\" Today, many types of rock are on the island, including granites and volcanic rocks which resulted from the collision. These granites and volcanic rocks were emplaced adjacent to ~400 million year old siltstones and sandstones that sit on the inland side of the island on which the village of Bar Harbor lies. The mountains of Acadia represent a collisional tectonic event which was soon followed by a related series of continental collisions which led to a major phase in the mountain-building of the Northern Appalachians known as the Acadian Orogeny.  Historic district  In 1975, the central village of Somesville and the harbor area were listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. The district extends along Main Street from Denning Brook to Maine State Route 3, and encompasses the entire shoreline of the harbor as far south as Mason and Squantum Points. It includes the 1828 Isaac Somes House, the oldest in the village, and the 1852 Union Church.

Based on her novel of the same name, the film was Lian's directorial debut. The film was a critical and commercial success. It won the Amanda Award in 1999 in the category Best film, and has received more awards internationally than any other Norwegian film. It was the Norwegian submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Synopsis The film introduces 11-year-old Maria in her little brother Pilten's funeral. Following her son's death, Maria's mother becomes engulfed in her own sorrow, and distances herself from Maria. While spending the summer holiday with her grandparents in Bergen, Maria meets Jakob, a boy around her age. The two become friends, and spend time together exploring the city, and having discussions about life and death. Through her friendship with Jakob, Maria comes to terms with her mother and their loss. Cast * Thea Sofie Rusten as Maria * Jan Tore Kristoffersen as Jakob * Anneke von der Lippe as Maria's mother * Jørgen Langhelle as Maria's father Release Only Clouds Move the Stars had its theatrical release on 24 August 1998. The film was seen by 10,000 people during its opening weekend. It went on to become the second most viewed Norwegian film of 1998, beaten only by Gurin with the Foxtail, which was also produced by John M. Jacobsen. Norwegian critics were almost unanimously positive about the film. Jon Selås of Verdens Gang praised the film for its \\"magical moments\\", and Rusten and Kristoffersen for their interplay and \\"fantastic\\" depictions of the main characters. He lauded Lian for \\"making the fundamentally important observation that children aren't half adults or unfinished individuals; they are children, they are human.\\" Dagbladet's reviewer was equally positive about the two leads, who she felt \\"carried the lion's share of the film\\". She rated the film 5/6, and urged moviegoers to \\"bring a handkerchief.\\" The film also received favourable notices from American publications. Variety's Gunnar Rehlin found the film to be \\"realistically told\\", and characterized it as \\"funny, sad and bittersweet by turns, with a conclusion that's optimistic but feels right.\\" The Hollywood Reporter also commented positively on the film, acclaiming Lian for creating a \\"truly magical family film, in large part a result of her work with the two young players.\\" The reviewer found Rusten to \\"embod[y] the fragile vulnerability of a young girl who feels that she has been deserted by everyone,\\" and characterized Kristoffersen as a \\"delight as the irrepressible Jacob.\\" Only Clouds Move the Stars received awards at several international film festivals. The film was awarded a Crystal Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival's Kinderfilmfest. At the Lübeck Nordic Film Days, the film won the Nordic Film Institute's Award for Best Film, Children and Young People, and the Grand Prize for Best Feature. Other awards included the Audience Award and Best Actress Award at the Rouen Nordic Film Festival. Domestically, the film was nominated for four Amanda Awards, and won in the category Best Film.

In the visions of Christ reported by Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in the 17th century, several promises were made to those people who practiced the First Fridays Devotions, one of which included final perseverance.Peter Stravinskas, 1998, OSV's Catholic Encyclopedia, OSV Press page 428 Description According to the words of Christ through His apparitions to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, there are several promises to those who practice the First Friday Devotions: > \\"In the excess of the mercy of my Heart, I promise you that my all powerful > love will grant to all those who will receive Communion on the First > Fridays, for nine consecutive months, the grace of final repentance: they > will not die in my displeasure, nor without receiving the sacraments; and my > Heart will be their secure refuge in that last hour.\\"First Friday Devotion , > Aquinas and More. Retrieved on 2 August 2009. The devotion consists of several practices that are performed on the first Fridays of nine consecutive months. On these days, a person is to attend Mass and receive Communion.Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today by James F. White 2003 page 35 If the need arises, in order to receive Communion in a state of grace, a person should also make use of the Sacrament of Penance before attending Mass. In many Catholic communities the practice of the Holy Hour of meditation during the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament during the First Fridays is encouraged.Meditations on the Sacred Heart by Joseph McDonnell 2008 page 118 Promises For Devotion to the Sacred Heart # I will give them all of the graces necessary for their state of life. # I will establish peace in their houses. # I will comfort them in all their afflictions. # I will be their strength during life and above all during death. # I will bestow a large blessing upon all their undertakings. # Sinners shall find in My Heart the source and the infinite ocean of mercy. # Tepid souls shall grow fervent. # Fervent souls shall quickly mount to high perfection. # I will bless every place where a picture of my heart shall be set up and honored. # I will give to priests the gift of touching the most hardened hearts. # Those who shall promote this devotion shall have their names written in My Heart, never to be blotted out. # I promise you in the excessive mercy of My Heart that My all- powerful love will grant to all those who shall receive communion on the First Friday in nine consecutive months the grace of final penitence; they shall not die in My disgrace nor without receiving their sacraments; My Divine Heart shall be their safe refuge in this last moment.Holy Hour of Reparation by Angelus Press 2009 page 41-43 Liturgical praxis Sister Mary of the Divine Heart was a nun from the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.. In 1889, Pope Leo XIII permitted priests and bishops worldwide to offer one morning votive Mass of the Sacred Heart on the first Friday of each month in churches or oratories where special devotions to the Sacred Heart were held, provided no feast of the Lord, double of the first class, or privileged feria, vigil, or octave occurred on that day. This permission was retained in the 1962 Missal, which remains the authorized liturgical text for the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite under the terms of Pope Benedict XVI's Summorum Pontificum, though the rubrics were altered to restrict the use of this permission to first Fridays on liturgical days of the third and fourth class; additionally, the 1962 rubrics allow two such votive Masses to be said on first Fridays, with no requirement for these Masses to be said in the morning (evening Masses having been permitted by Pope Pius XII by his 1953 apostolic constitution Christus Dominus). No specific permission for use of the votive Mass of the Sacred Heart on first Fridays exists in the rubrics of the Mass of Paul VI, though votive Masses of any kind are permitted on most weekdays in Ordinary Time on which no obligatory memorial, feast, or solemnity occurs.

Background The intensive marketing efforts of the Winchester company's agent in Spain during the 1870s and 1880s may have led to the Tigre's popularity in Spain. These efforts included a visit by Oliver Winchester to Spain and other countries. After exhaustive testing and many design changes, 230 Winchester Model 1873 carbines (with 22 inch barrels, metre sights, full length cleaning rod and full stock) were sold to the Spanish Military for use by the Cavalry and Royal Bodyguard in the 1870s. These are considered to be evolutionary predecessors of the Winchester 1876 carbines, most famously supplied to the North-West Mounted Police. More than 2,500 were later made under license by the Spanish arsenal at Oviedo in the 1890s to keep staff working while awaiting the arrival of modern machinery required for the production of the Mauser Model 1893. These utilised some improvements made in the Winchester 1876, but were chambered in .44-40 thus allowing a slimmer action. Carbine variants were made for the Cavalry, and the 14th regiment of the Guardia Civil. Musket variants were made for some other users, such as Military academies and sentries.Winchesters a la Paella After 1893 a further unknown number of carbines were sourced from Eibar based firms, but these, according to Madis, were of lower quality than the Oviedo made models. Genesis and production history The first models were produced by Gárate y Anitua in 1915, but production was presumably interrupted by the war. Having spent most of World War I supplying the Allies with large-framed revolvers based on Smith & Wesson designs and the 7.65mm Browning calibre self-loading Ruby pistols, the company began to market the first El Tigre rifles in 1923. The El Tigre rifles were again chambered for the Winchester .44-40 cartridge (known in Spain as the .44 Largo) and had a 22-inch round profiled barrel (like the previous 1873/1876 carbines) marked with the makers name, calibre, and the trademark image of a Tiger. The stock was of Spanish walnut with a 12\\" Length of Pull and a crescent shaped metal butt plate with a trapdoor fitted for storage of a jointed cleaning rod in the butt. A drift-adjusted blade front sight was fitted, usually attached to the front barrel band in accordance with old Spanish practice. A military tangent leaf rear sight was fitted which was similar to those on the Mauser 1893 rifle and sighted to 1000 metres. The El Tigre was made for both Civilian and Police use, but apart from its emergency use during the Spanish Civil War it was never issued as a military weapon. Over one million were eventually produced for private sale (mainly hunters), forest rangers, and for police, prison or private security guards who needed a compact but long-ranged weapon for use in confined spaces (e.g. the Railway division of the Guardia Civil). Certainly the .44-40 cartridge was adequate for hunting most Spanish game animals. Many were also exported to Latin American police agencies or prisons, leading to the widespread misconception that the El Tigre was made in Mexico or some other Latin American country.Carabina Tigre The El Tigre was replaced in service starting in the 1940s by bolt action carbines such as the Destroyer carbine and Submachine guns which were chambered for the 9mm Largo service cartridge. Large numbers were exported as surplus to the US in the 1950s and 1960s, corresponding with the growth of interest in Western history and arms collecting. El Tigre rifles often appear in photographs of the Spanish Civil War, usually in the hands of Militia, Police or rear echelon forces.

(May 17, 1791 – February 21, 1860) was the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Nashville (1838–1860). Biography Miles was born in Prince George's County, Maryland, and moved to Kentucky with his parents at age 5. After joining the Dominican Order in October 1806, he was ordained a priest on September 21, 1816. He then worked as a missionary in Ohio and Kentucky for 22 years, also founding a community of Dominican nuns and a school under the Sisters of Charity. He served as pastor at Somerset, Kentucky and Zanesville, Ohio.Clarke, Richard Henry. \\"Right Rev. Richard Pius Miles, D.D.\\", Lives of the Deceased Bishops of the Catholic Church in the United States, Volume 2, P. O'Shea, 1872, pp. 147 et seq. On July 28, 1837, Miles was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on September 16, 1838 from Bishop Joseph Rosati, C.M., with Bishops Simon Bruté and Guy Ignatius Chabrat, P.S.S., serving as co-consecrators. Arriving alone in Nashville, Miles took up residence in a boarding house and almost immediately fell seriously ill with a fever. A priest who happened to be travelling through Nashville arrived, and with his assistance Miles recovered. His parishioners consisted of approximately 100 families scattered throughout the state. Bishop Miles traveled on horseback to meet with them. He took part in laying the cornerstone of St. Vincent de Paul Church (Baltimore, Maryland) and in November 1845, assisted at the consecration of Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral (Cincinnati). During his tenure, he ordained the first priest in Tennessee, and established a seminary and a hospital, run by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth from Bardstown, Kentucky, and an orphanage run by the sisters of St. Dominic. He dedicated the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin of the Seven Sorrows in 1848, to replace the Cathedral of the Holy Rosary. He died at the age of 68. At the time of his death, the diocese comprised 12,000 Catholics, 13 priests, 14 churches, 6 chapels, and 13 missions.

She was the first African-American woman ordained in the United Presbyterian Church (USA), which occurred in 1974.  Early life  Born on January 3, 1950, Cannon spent her childhood in Kannapolis, North Carolina, a racially segregated community where she could not use local facilities such as the YMCA, swimming pool or library. She was the daughter of the late Esau Cannon and Corine L. Cannon, the first woman to work at the Cannon Mills in Kannapolis. Both her parents were elders in the Presbyterian Church. She had six brothers and sisters.  Education and career  Cannon graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Barber–Scotia College, followed by a Master of Divinity from Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary, and master's and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Union Theological Seminary in New York. Cannon was ordained on April 24, 1974, in Shelby, North Carolina, by the Catawba Presbytery, in the Synod of Catawba, becoming the first African-American woman to be ordained in the United Presbyterian Church (USA). Cannon began teaching at Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond in 2001. She held the position of the Annie Scales Rogers Professor of Christian Social Ethics. She was the Lilly Distinguished Visiting Professor of Religion at Davidson College and the Sterling Brown Visiting Professor in Religion and African American Studies at Williams College. In 2012, Cannon began serving as executive director of the Squaring the Womanist Circle Project at Union Presbyterian Seminary. Following from the research results produced by the project, Cannon worked with the administration of Union Presbyterian Seminary and several foundations to establish The Center For Womanist Leadership at Union Presbyterian Seminary. The center is the first of its kind at any theological academic institution in the United States. From 2004 to 2008, she served as president of the Society for the Study of Black Religion. Cannon received the distinguished professor award from Spelman College, the Lucy Craft Laney Award at the Black Presbyterian Bicentennial Celebration, and was a professor-scholar honoree at the National Black Church Summit at Emory University. She received the Beautiful Are The Feet Award from the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference. The American Academy of Religion honored Cannon with its 2011 Excellence in Teaching Award. In 2018, Cannon was honored at the Presbyterian Church (USA)'s General Assembly, receiving the Excellence in Theological Education Award. Cannon died on August 8, 2018.

In October of the same year, the band requested fans via their MySpace page to record audio clips of themselves shouting the word \\"Yeah!\\" to be used in a track on the album. On 27 April, Does It Offend You, Yeah? told fans via a MySpace blog that they were to release a track called \\"The News at 10\\" for a limited time to celebrate reaching ten million plays on the social networking site. After the initial release, the song was modified and became the new song \\"Yeah!\\" that appears on the album. The song \\"All the Same\\" is featured on the soundtrack to the 2010 video game Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit and was speculated to be included in the album, but does not appear in it. They first hoped to release the album by March 2010. However, in mid-2010 the band revealed that they had been working for over a year and set up a mailing list for fans to keep track of their progress via their official website. A track called \\"We Are The Dead\\" was given away as a free download from the band's official website on 25 August 2010, along with links to the song's \\"remix parts.\\" The first single from the album is titled \\"The Monkeys Are Coming\\". The song features a vocal sample from an internet meme featuring an American man ranting to a group of skateboarders.

Development Although design of the SZD-16 Gil was started in 1955, the prototype was not completed until 1958, when interest in gliders with metal structures increased. The SZD-16 was a simple single-seat training glider originally intended to form part of the LPŻ (Soldier's Friends League) aero clubs training regime. The main designer was Zbigniew Badura. The fuselage was of metal and the wings were of wood. The single-seat training methods were abandoned at around the time of the SZD-16's first flight, but the prototype was used for research into metal structures in gliders as well as new forms of air brakes. The SZD-16 was a cantilever shoulder-winged aircraft with the tail supported on a narrow tubular aluminium alloy boom extending from aft of the wooden wings, which attached to the pod-like welded steel tube fuselage housing the cockpit. Flight trials commenced with Adam Zientek piloting SP-1880 on the first flight on 20 October 1958. After the initial flight trials the fuselage was modified to accept wings from an SZD-22 Mucha Standard, to produce the SZD-16 Gil Z, which was used to test a new form of air brake. Further testing and the need for single seater aircraft with reasonable performance for club flying, prompted development of the SZD-16Z Gil Z fitted with a wing derived from that of the SZD-22 Mucha Standard. Improved structure, new wing and other improvements resulted in the SZD-25A Lis production aircraft, of which 30 were built.  Variants  *SZD-16 Gil - prototype of the Gil with tubular rear fuselage and low-performance wing. *SZD-16Z Gil Z - prototype SZD-16 fitted with wings adapted from the SZD-22 Mucha Standard. *SZD-25 Nov - production prototype version of the SZD-16Z Gil Z for use as club single-seat aircraft with improved performance over the SZD-16 trainer, 1 built. *SZD-25A Lis - production aircraft, 30 built, of which 13 were exported.

The second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the season, Abby developed on July 10 from a tropical wave in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles. Abby rapidly intensified into a hurricane after being a tropical storm for less than six hours. It briefly peaked as a category 2 hurricane before weakening back. Abby rapidly weakened to a minimal tropical storm a few days thereafter. The storm re-strengthened into a hurricane as it began to parallel the coast of Honduras. Hurricane Abby made landfall in British Honduras (present-day Belize) on July 15. Abby dissipated over Mexico later the next day. The remnants of Abby ultimately became Hurricane Celeste in the Pacific Ocean. Despite passing through or near several countries, Hurricane Abby had a relatively light impact on land, resulting in just $640,500 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage and six fatalities. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Abby were possibly from a tropical wave that moved in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles in early July 1960. Ships and a few weather stations on July 9 reported the existence of a tropical cyclone. On July 9, it had operationally been classified as a tropical storm upon formation, though a later analysis revealed that it was only a tropical depression. The depression passed near Barbados early on July 10 before rapidly intensifying into a hurricane. Hurricane Abby accelerated toward the west and made landfall in St. Lucia as a minimal category 1 hurricane. Abby emerged into the Caribbean Sea a few hours later. As it headed generally westward, it also gradually strengthened. By July 11, Hurricane Abby had attained peak intensity as an 80 mph (129 km/h) category 1 hurricane. The intensity of Abby began to gradually level off, though it re-intensified slightly in the Caribbean, before eventually weakening further. Abby was downgraded to a tropical storm on the morning of July 13; it was center roughly 222 mi (357 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica at the time. Just six hours thereafter, Abby had maximum sustained winds of only 45 mph (75 km/h). Abby re-intensified at a relatively quick pace, as it was near hurricane status again when it passed just to the north of Honduras on July 14. Late on July 14, Abby had re-intensified into a hurricane. A few hours later, Abby passed over the island of Roatán at about midnight (EDT) on July 15. It made a third and final landfall on July 15 when it moved inland over British Honduras (presently known as Belize) as a minimal hurricane. Abby quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm only a few hours later over land. While Abby approached the border of Guatemala and Mexico, it had weakened further to a tropical depression. Abby dissipated while situated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on July 16. The remnants crossed over Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and regenerated into Hurricane Celeste on July 20. Hurricane Celeste lasted for two days in the Pacific before it dissipated on July 22. Preparations and impact=Lesser Antilles= There were many watches and warning issued during the passage of Hurricane Abby throughout the Caribbean. Some gale warnings were issued from the Grenadines to Guadeloupe starting on July 10. Around 1600 UTC later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Several hours later, the watch was extended to include Dominican Republic and Haiti. All warnings were discontinued later, after the storm passed by. Hurricane Abby bypassed Barbados a tropical depression, which resulted in minimal effects. Maximum sustained winds on Barbados were reported at 23 mph (57 km/h), while gusts were recorded up to 37 mph (60 km/h). There are no other effects known on Barbados. St. Lucia had borne the brunt of the storm when Hurricane Abby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. Rainfall on the island totaled at 6.80 in (172.7 mm). Tropical storm force winds were recorded on the island for the passage of Hurricane Abby on July 10, though there were no hurricane force winds reported. In addition, a roof collapsed in on a house, killing six of the residents living there. The passage of Hurricane Abby also resulted in $435,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) of damage on St. Lucia. Martinique was near the path of Hurricane Abby, which resulted in some effects. The Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Fort-de-France recorded rainfall at nearly three inches (76.2 mm), while rain in another village was measured at nearly four inches (101.2 mm). Winds on Martinique were also at least tropical storm force during the passage of Hurricane Abby. However, wind gusts on Martinique were around 75 mph (120 km/h), greater than that which was observed on St. Lucia. There were also damaged roads and bridges, mainly due to landslides. The island nation of Dominica was also affected by Hurricane Abby. Hurricane Abby produced nearly six in (152.4 mm) of rain on the island. Winds were also similar to those that were measured on Barbados. Hurricane Abby left about $65,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage to Dominica. =Greater Antilles and Central America= It was initially believed that Abby would affect Jamaica with gale force winds and heavy rainfall, and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that \\"interests\\" on the island should monitor the progress of the storm. However, Abby remained far south of the island, and the impact it had on the island, if any, is unknown. Citizens of the Cayman Islands, Central America, and the Yucatan Peninsula were also to remain on alert during the passage of Abby. The U.S. Weather Bureau later warned citizens in British Honduras and Honduras to \\"take all precautions for the protection of life and property against dangerous winds and abnormally high seas\\". Hurricane Abby also produced 1.62 in (41.14 mm) of rain on Swan Island. On the islands north of Honduras, reports were received until winds reached 52 mph (83.7 km/h), and then communications were lost. In Belize City, which was 75 mi (120.7 km) north of where Abby made landfall, wind gusts were reported to 35 mph (55 km/h). Minor property damage was reported in British Honduras, totaling to BZ$6,000 (approximately $3,000 1960 USD; $ USD). In addition, agricultural losses reached BZ$75,000 (about $37,500 1960 USD; $ USD). Although Abby nearly made landfall in Honduras and eventually entered Mexico, no effects were reported, but the U.S. Weather Bureau believed that flooding and there were seas of at least 5 ft (1.5 m) above normal. Throughout its path, Abby caused only about $600,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage and six fatalities.

Forming as a tropical depression out of a trough south of Louisiana on August 5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August 7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system and it became a tropical storm just 60 mi (95 km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00 UTC (1:00 p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August 8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas. Prior to Abby's landfall in Texas, gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on Matagorda Island were evacuated. Overall, the storm's impacts were limited due to its small size. Only two structures sustained damage in Matagorda, one being destroyed by a possible tornado, and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in Jackson and Victoria Counties. Total damage from the storm was estimated at $750,000 with the majority stemming from crops. Meteorological history On August 5, 1964, a weak trough emerged from Florida over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. According to the Atlantic hurricane database (referred to as HURDAT), the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC (1:00 p.m. CDT) that day, with its center located roughly 160 mi (260 km) south-southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving generally west, the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the Texas coastline. However, on August 7, radar images from Brownsville, Galveston, Lake Charles, and Victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization. During the afternoon hours, banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system. Forecasters initially mistook the eye as a hook echo-type feature at the end of a squall line. It is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC (7:00 a.m. CDT), roughly 60 mi (95 km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Operationally, the system was not even monitored as a depression this time, with the classification and naming of Tropical Storm Abby occurring at 16:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. CDT) on August 7. Abby was an unusually small storm, with its entire circulation being far less than 100 mi (160 km) in diameter. Around 16:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. CDT) on August 7, reconnaissance measured a central barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53 inHg) within Abby, the lowest in relation to the system. They also reported peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) in squalls, which would rank as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. These winds were seen to be an overestimate by forecasters and discarded, however. The system attained its maximum winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) by 18:00 UTC (1:00 p.m. CDT) and subsequently made landfall just northeast of Matagorda, Texas at 22:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. CDT). Irvin Velbrecht, a forecaster at the Weather Bureau (now known as the National Weather Service) in Galveston, described the storm as a \\"perfectly miniature hurricane.\\" Despite moving onshore, Abby's core continued to organize and it developed a closed eyewall roughly three hours later. Thereafter the storm began to gradually weaken, passing over Edna around 02:00 UTC on August 8 (9:00 p.m. CDT on August 7). Weakening to a depression hours later, Abby ultimately degenerated into an area of showers and dissipated southwest of San Antonio by 12:00 UTC (7:00 a.m. CDT). Preparations and impact Rainfall from Tropical Storm Abby across Louisiana and Texas from August 4–8 Owing to the abrupt nature of Abby's development on August 7, residents had little time to prepare for the storm. According to Irvin Velbrecht, \\"in the absence of aircraft reconnaissance and radar information, two reasonably new tools in storm detection, Abby could well have formed and approached the shore before knowledge of a tropical storm was gained.\\" Gale warnings were raised from Galveston to San Antonio immediately following the storm's formation and were kept in place through the morning of August 8. Evacuation orders were issued for Matagorda Island and most complied, with some deciding to remain at their homes. Personnel at Matagorda Island Air Force Base were evacuated to Victoria. Red Cross facilities were readied and public shelters were opened in the area. At the mouth of the Colorado River, seagoing vessels were tied down with extra rope. Within the Weather Bureau, members of the Galveston office were the first to notice the system and relayed to the other offices in the area to attune their radars to follow the system. Abby's small size resulted in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track. Sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) with gusts to 65 mph (100 km/h) were measured by the Army Corps of Engineers in Matagorda. Near the town, a possible tornado unroofed a barn and tossed the structure ; this building previously had withstood the effects of Hurricane Carla in 1961. Winds estimated at tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in Matagorda itself. Along the coast, tides ranged from above normal from Matagorda to Freeport. Four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the Colorado River. Heavy rains accompanied the system across Texas. Most areas along the immediate track received at least of rain, with a peak value of recorded at the Victoria International Airport. The hardest hit areas were in Jackson and Victoria counties where the heaviest rains fell. In these areas, flooding and strong winds damaged the cotton and rice crops; however, effects of the rice crop were more limited due to losses from earlier storms as well as ongoing harvesting. Some flooding also took place across the Atascosa River watershed, but no damage resulted. Overall, property damage was estimated at $150,000 while agricultural losses reached $600,000.

It was serialized in Akita Shoten's shōjo magazine (aimed at teenage girls) Princess Comics. The individual chapters were released in 7 tankōbon volumes between June 1999 and December 24, 2001. The series is licensed in North America by CMX, which released the manga's 7 tankōbon volumes between April 1, 2006 and October 10, 2007. The story follows violinist, Reiji Saioin, as he strives to win the next Japanese National Music Contest with the help of his personal teacher, Mitsuko Hane, and his friends, Nachi Meiya and Aoi Kenzaki. Impeding his goal is Bartholomew Asakura, who ruined Hane's arm in the past, and his growing feelings for his teacher. Plot Reiji Saioin, the top violinist in Hakuto Junior High School, is to be kicked out of the school if he does not win the next Japan National Music Contest due to his history of trouble. His private teacher and alum of Hakuto, Mitsuko Hane, is willing to help Reiji overcome his flaws to win the music contest. She wants Reiji to play the violin because she cannot due to her left arm being rendered useless after being burnt. Reiji has his own wishes to keep his sister, Miruka, who is abused by their father, happy. Along the way to win the music contest, Reiji becomes friends with Nachi Meiya, the best female violinist in Hakuto, and Aoi Kenzaki, a pianist- turned-violinist. He also has to deal with Bartholomew Asakura, the man who ruined Hane's arm, as well as his growing feelings for his teacher. Characters *Reiji Saioin is the protagonist of the series. He is the best male violinist of Hakuto Junior High School. However, he has a reputation for being Hakuto's \\"trouble student\\". He is notorious for treating women like trash and changing girlfriends frequently. After Aoi comes under Hane's student, Reiji covers for Aoi's health problems until Hane reveals Aoi's doctor order for him to retire from the violin. He later realises his growing feelings for his teacher, Hane, and declines Nachi's confession to him. *Mitsuko Hane is Reiji's and later, Aoi's, private teacher. She is an alum of Hakuto Junior High School and has won the Japan National Music Contest twice consecutively. However, after her mother's death, she got emotionally involved with fellow violinist Bartholomew. The pressure for her to win the contest a third time and her unrequited love for Bartholomew, resulted in a fire accident, burning her left arm, effectively disabling her from playing the violin. She spent the next four years in hospital. Afterwards, she became a music teacher. She later was chosen to be Reiji's teacher. She still has affections for Bartholomew after what he did to her. *Nachi Meiya is the best female violinist at Hakuto Junior High School. She has won the Japan National Music Contest once. She has an outgoing and carefree attitude. Later, Reiji discovers that the attitude she has is a facade to hide the pain she feels from her stepbrother sexually assaulting her. After Reiji stops her brother by punching him she confesses her love to Reiji, who declines her confession. However, she comes back for the next Japan National Music Contest and is supportive of Reiji and her love of him despite knowing that he loves Hane. *Marco Primavera (aka. \\"Maestro\\" or \\"the Grim Reaper\\") is the chief conductor of Hakuto's Philharmonic Orchestra. He has known Hane since she was three and regards her as his daughter. He scouted Bartholomew Asakura to be his successor but soon changed his mind after Bartholomew caused Hane's arm to be burnt. Even the principal of the school dares not to challenge him. He is known as the Grim Reaper for crushing the careers of thousands of musicians. *Miruka Saioin is Reiji's half-sister. She was the victim of her father's alcoholic rage when Reiji left for boarding school. When her father becomes imprisoned, she is willing to go to America with her adopted parents to not cause her brother any more trouble. *Aoi Kenzaki was a world-class pianist from a family of pianists. However, he changed to violin and was chosen to be taught by Hane. Due to his heart condition, he cannot play the violin for extended periods of time and has to take his medication periodically. He ignores warnings about his health from his doctor as well as his family to strive to become acknowledged as a violinist. After losing a contest to play all three movements of Beethoven's Kreutzer against Reiji, he renounces the violin and returns to his manor in Kyoto, where he takes up gardening. *Bartholomew Asakura was a young conductor that Hakuto's conductor had scouted. When Hane's mother died, she turned to him for comfort. He uses her love for him to teach her violin techniques. However, after the fire accident, he disappeared from Hane's life. He is known for his genius in teaching his students but they usually commit suicide or their lives ruined after Bartholomew is done with them. After he becomes the conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, he attempts to make Reiji join him. When Reiji is revealed to be his son, he refuses to acknowledge it because he does not want a child. Production and releases VS is written and illustrated by Keiko Yamada.

Manga artist Yamada comments that \\"there was so much love in Go Go Heaven (her previous series) that I got sick of it\\" and created Versus as a \\"stoic story of self-denial\\". She also comments that she focuses more on the hand and the backs of male characters when she draws them because they \\"can tell more about the character's feelings than the faces, so when I want to show that they are full of sadness or passion, I use that\\". Yamada comments that she uses the \\"playmate version of model dolls\\" (drawing models based on Playboy models) to draw Mitsuko Hane due to her \\"big chest\\". Reception Mania.com's Eduardo M. Chavez comments that Keiko Yamada's art is \\"classic shōjo. Characters are big headed, big eyed and practically everyone has feminine qualities. About that, until I actually the first chapter I did not realize that the main character was male.\\" Chavez compares the manga to the television series, 24, where \\"every hour of every day must be utilized to its fullest\\". He also compares VS to Nodame Cantabile, saying, \\"Nodame uses comedy to bring life to music than can be considered dry to younger readers. VS uses angst to do much of same.\\" Mania.com's Jarred Pine criticises the manga for the \\"SFX [which] are translated with overlays, only sometimes the underlying Japanese text is not removed. I've seen this with quite a few CMX titles and it makes for a very ugly looking job.\\" Pine also criticises the characters, saying \\"The biggest strike against VS is the complete lack of any interesting, likeable, or memorable characters. The lead, Reiji, is a complete smug and arrogant fool right from the beginning. While creator Keiko Yamada does try to humanize him a bit with a back story of familial abuse, it's quickly shooed aside and has little effect on the reader.\\" Manga Life's Dan Polley comments that \\"Reiji’s character — like most shōjo manga — is the focus, and deservedly so. The character is hot-tempered, yet is able to retain a bit of aloofness, especially in [volume six]. Those types of personality traits are generally excellently fleshed out in shōjos, and particularly in this volume.\\" > \\"VS continues to be a bit of a struggle, mostly because the whole angst- > driven character drama just isn't working for me because it's falls to much > on two characters that just aren't that interesting.

Its development was confirmed on August 12 by the Hurricane Hunters, which is a group that intentionally flies into a hurricane for observations. Hurricane Able initially threatened to strike the Bahamas, but instead turned to the northwest and later to the northeast. As it neared the Outer Banks, Able reached peak winds of , equivalent to a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. After brushing those islands and Cape Cod, Able moved ashore on Nova Scotia as a minimal hurricane. It later crossed Newfoundland and dissipated on August 24\\\\. The hurricane prompted standard precautions in the Bahamas and Florida, although it did not affect the region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced winds up to 55 mph (90 km/h) and high waves, and across New England there were nine traffic fatalities. The hurricane killed 2 people in Canada and caused over $1 million in damage. Meteorological history The beginning of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season was considered \\"remarkably quiet\\" by the U.S. Weather Bureau, with no noteworthy activity until early August. A Hurricane Hunters flight into an easterly wave on August 12 indicated a developing tropical storm east of the Lesser Antilles; it was later given the name \\"Able\\", which is the first name in the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. It moved steadily northwestward and reached hurricane status on August 14, as it passed to the north of the Leeward Islands. The next day, Hurricane Able turned to the west and west-southwest, due to a high pressure system to its north. On August 17 it attained major hurricane status, and by early on August 18 reconnaissance aircraft measured winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), though Atlantic hurricane reanalysis later determined that those winds were unrepresentative of the intensity. At the time, the storm was 350 miles (565 km) in diameter. Able was expected to continue to the west toward the Bahamas and Florida. It was the strongest hurricane to threaten the Bahamanian capital, Nassau, since a hurricane in 1929. The hurricane turned to the northwest, however, sparing the Bahamas from the strongest winds. On August 19, Able turned to the north, and attained its peak intensity of while doing so; shortly before peak intensity, aircraft measured a central pressure of , the lowest in the life of the storm. The next day Able accelerated to the northeast, after passing just offshore Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Having maintained peak winds for 12 hours, Hurricane Able began to weaken on August 20, and early the next day it moved quickly by Cape Cod. It produced winds of hurricane force in Nova Scotia before it moved ashore on August 21 near Goodwood with winds of . Subsequently, it deteriorated into an extratropical cyclone, and Able crossed Newfoundland before dissipating early on August 24 in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. Impact and records Storm total rainfall related to Able in the United States When Hurricane Able was expected to move through the Bahamas, people executed standard preparations such as securing windows and bringing ships to harbor. One cruise liner diverted its route from the Bahamas toward New York. In Florida, the U.S. Air Force made preliminary plans to move planes. Ultimately, the hurricane spared the region. Further north, the United States Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Morehead City, North Carolina to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. There, the hurricane ended up bringing light winds and rough waves. Moderate precipitation occurred along the North Carolina coast. In southern New England, Able dropped 3 - 5 inches (75 - 125 mm) of rainfall, with a peak of 6.89 inches (175 mm) in Beechwood, Massachusetts. Flooding was reported in portions of New York City. The resulting slick roads from the rains caused nine traffic fatalities across New England. The storm produced 55 mph (90 km/h) gusts in Nantucket and Cape Cod, along with high tides and waves. Offshore, the waves damaged a freighter headed for Florida. In Nova Scotia, Able produced hurricane-force winds, the only land along its path to receive such winds; a gust of 99 mph (160 km/h) was reported in Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92 inches (125 mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August 22, the third was still missing over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team to search for the boat. Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1 million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries. From 1950 through 1952, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were first used for storms in the North Atlantic. Able is the first name in the alphabet, and as such, Hurricane Able in 1950 was the first name officially to be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was also the first of eight major hurricanes in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season, which as of 2010 was thought to be the record for the most major hurricanes in a season. However, as of 2014, it was found that several storms in 1950 were weaker than thought, and it was found that only six major hurricanes formed, so the record is now held by 1961 and 2005.

The founder of the Irish National Association of Australasia (INA) and the Australian League for an Undivided Ireland, Dryer was a noted campaigner on behalf of the Irish community in Australia and the republican cause. Early life and education Born in the Sydney suburb of Balmain, Albert Thomas Dryer was the son of an Irish mother, Mary Ann Cusick, and a German–Irish father, Albert James Dryer. His father died when he was young, and his mother remarried. He began his education in Singleton, New South Wales, in the Hunter Valley, where he lived with his maternal grandmother, and later in Sydney in 1896-1904, then at night schools. When he finished school he found work in Melbourne as a clerk with the Department of Trade and Customs. In 1909, Dryer was transferred to Sydney, and entered the University of Sydney to study English literature. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1914, and it was about this time that Dryer's interest in Irish culture, history, and politics was awakened. Activism On 21 July 1915, at a meeting of 18 Irish people in Sydney, Dryer proposed the establishment of the Irish National Association of Australasia, to preserve the notion of Irish sovereignty in Australia.Whitaker, Anne-Maree. (1985.) The Irish National Association of Australasia: 70th Anniversary Historical Reference. On Monday, 17 June 1918, Albert Dryer and six other INA office- bearers were arrested under emergency war-time regulations, and imprisoned without trial. The seven were accused of membership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and were held in Sydney’s Darlinghurst Prison for several months. Six were released on 19 December 1918, but Albert Dryer was held until 11 February 1919.Patrick O'Farrell. (2001.) The Irish in Australia, 3 ed., UNSW Press. For his entire life, Dryer remained the central figure of the Irish National Association of Australasia, helping secure the land for its premises in Devonshire St, Surry Hills. He was instrumental in organising Éamon de Valera's controversial visit to Australia in 1948. Medical career After failing in such ventures as book-keeping, coaching and shopkeeping, including his own Academic Coaching College, he attended Sydney Technical College, graduating with an associate degree in science and biology in 1926; and, in 1929, he passed first-year medicine at the university without attending lectures. In 1932, he borrowed money to enter medical school full-time and graduated with an M.B., B.S. in 1938. Death and legacy Dryer died of cancer in Lewisham Hospital, Sydney, on 11 April 1963, survived by his wife and son. A devout Roman Catholic, he was buried in Sedgfield Cemetery at Singleton. The INA's library at its premises in Devonshire St, Sydney is named in his memory. Personal life Dryer had married Elizabeth Ellen Haynes, on 29 April 1933 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. They had been engaged since 1915, but not married until then because of the insecurity of his employment. Their only child, Albert Benjamin, was born in 1934. Dryer set up his own practice at Fairfield, New South Wales in 1940, and then moved his family and practice to Singleton after the Second World War. According to his biographer and friend Professor Patrick O'Farrell: > Dryer never visited Ireland, but his devotion to the cause of Irish > independence, and particularly the party of de Valera was constant, selfless > and total. With great ability and remarkable strength of character and > purpose, he was essentially a romantic idealist to whom Ireland represented > all that was noble in human affairs. His high intelligence and gentlemanly > disposition stopped him well short of any fanaticism, but the realities of > indifference and in-fighting which afflicted the Irish cause in Australia > were a source of deep disappointment and frustration to him.

It sits in the construction of his mortuary complex that included a cenotaph to his grandmother Queen Tetisheri, Senakhtenre's Great Royal Wife and grandmother of both Ahmose and his Principal Wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. The stele was excavated in Ahmose's cult center at Abydos, found in 1902, in two pieces. A twin scene in the upper lunette shows king Ahmose presenting offering tables to seated Tetisheri (whose name is within some of the cartouches).Breasted, 1906.

Both the left and right scenes have variations of the offering tables, Tetisheri's arm poses, as well as Ahmose's. Besides Tetisheri's representation and nomen depictions in the lunette, her name appears in the hieroglyphs text below along with that of Nefertari who is referred as talking with Ahmose about making offerings and buildings to Tetisheri. The multicolumned text in the lunette is the same for both left and right.Kamrin, 2004. Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Practical Guide, section, Stela of Tetisheri, p. 128-129.

It was a different approach by McDonald to release a folk music and country album in the style of Woody Guthrie. Prior to this solo release, he was known to make albums in a psychedelic style with his band. The album was a tribute to the work of Woody Guthrie, a country and folk musician who died two years earlier. All of the tracks on the album were either composed or performed by Guthrie. McDonald was heavily influenced by Guthrie since he was a child. McDonald could recall his interest of Guthrie came first when his parents played Guthrie's first album, Dust Bowl Ballads. Even though McDonald has issued several albums in his career, he looks to this album as the piece he is most proud of. Background  McDonald had signed to Vanguard Records as a solo performer and went to Nashville with Sam Charters to record his first solo album in a small studio known as Bradley's Barn. McDonald and his band were still together, but the relationship was faltering, and they would break up soon after CJ Fish was released. McDonald was backed by well- regarded country musicians like Grady Martin in recording sessions for the album. Songs included were Guthrie favorites like \\"Tom Joad\\" and \\"This Land is Your Land\\". Although the studio musicians did not know the compositions McDonald wanted, they learned incredibly fast. Recording for the ten tracks took only a day to complete. With the spare recording time, more country standards were completed for McDonald's next album, Tonight I'm Singing Just For You. The tracks were meant to retain the spirit of Guthrie's recordings so the songs were only adjusted to complement McDonald's own style.  Reception and legacy  Reviewing the album for Rolling Stone in 1970, Gary Von Tersch said, \\"Admittedly, this is a low-key, non-fiery record, but it has a certain honesty. And it also lets you hear what a truly fine vocalist Joe is — he handles such diverse songs as 'Tom Joad,' 'Talkin' Dust Bowl' and 'Roll On Columbia' with ease and just the proper amount of fervor.\\" Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Village Voice: \\"It's the concept of this album that I don't like. Musically, it's not bad—a nice selection of Woody's tunes rendered agreeably by Joe and some Nashville sidemen. As an educational project I suppose it could be called, er, worthwhile. But anyone who has read this far may consider himself educated; the real thing is easy to swallow and can be purchased at better record shops.\\" In 1975, McDonald was present at the Hollywood Bowl with other contemporaries to partake in a celebration of Guthrie's career, thanks in part to the album. In homage to his inspiration, McDonald performed \\"Woman At Home\\", a Guthrie track that was previously unreleased at the time. Country Joe McDonald continues to create tributes for Guthrie, all starting from this album, and Billy Bragg is noted as saying, \\"Like no one of his generation, Country Joe McDonald carries on the mission of Woody Guthrie.\\" The original compact disc release of the album was on May 13, 1989. It was distributed by Vanguard Records.

Alice Nadine Morrison (1892-1978), birth name Alice Nadine Lanterman, was an American songwriter and musician. With her husband Howell Oakdeane \\"Morrie\\" Morrison (1888-1984) she was involved in numerous music-related business ventures, including Morrison Records.Peter Blecha, Morrison, \\"Morrie\\" and Alice -- Northwest Music Industry Pioneers, HistoryLink, November 20, 2005. Accessed online 2009-08-02. Life Born in Anacortes, Washington, while still in her teens she accompanied silent films in local theaters. She married Alabama-born dance instructor and drummer \\"Morrie\\" Morrison in 1912. The couple had a son, Lew, in 1913, and moved to Bellingham, Washington in 1914. In 1919, she wrote the waltz \\"My Love Is All For You.\\" The Morrisons started the Morrison Music Company to publish the sheet music; it was successful enough that Chicago-based Forster Publishing licensed the song, issuing it as \\"Say You'll Be Mine (My Love Is All For You).\\" The song became a national hit in 1920; a reported half a million copies of the sheet music sold; a player piano roll was issued in Los Angeles by Film Music Company and the Green Brothers Novelty Band released a recording on New York's Emerson Phonograph Co. label. She and her sister-in-law Nellie Morrison co-wrote a second hit in 1920, \\"Love's Ship.\\" With Forster's involvement, the sheet music sold a reported million copies. It was included in the score for the 1920 silent film Shore Acres. Tenor Joseph O'Hara recorded the song for Brunswick Records; the Club De Vingt Orchestra released a medley of \\"My Love Is All For You\\" and \\"Love's Ship\\" on Edison Records. A third song, \\"Sweet Anabel,\\" (1922) sold a reported 100,000 sheet copies, published by Seattle's Capitol Music. She and her husband formed the Morrison's Marimba Xylophone Orchestra and briefly opened Morrison's Dancing Academy in Bellingham, but soon relocated to San Francisco, where they took a suite 502 in that city's Pantages Theatre Building. Her husband pursued various ventures, including another dancehall/school, while she worked as a song-plugger at Woolworth's and Kress. She also performed in the Fox Follies at the Fox-Oakland Theater and played marimba solos live on KPO radio. However, in San Francisco the Morrisons' star soon faded. Their orchestra became a touring group \\"performing,\\" Peter Blecha writes, \\"in upended barns, grange halls, open fields, anywhere and everywhere.\\" Home was successively Sacramento, California, Weed, Roseville, Dunsmuir, and finally, with somewhat rising fortunes, back to Seattle in 1931. Over the next decade, the Morrisons (now including son Lew) would tour around Washington State, and slowly expand an empire of dance halls that would become the G.T.M. Corporation. By 1940, the G.T.M. Corporation had 128 other dancehalls in the Western United States, six of them in Seattle. Her songwriting career revived in the 1940s. The Ink Spots recorded \\"Goodbye, Little Girl, Goodbye\\" (1944) and The Andrews Sisters picked up \\"Please Don’t Sing That Song Again\\" (1946). In this same period, her husband started Morrison Records. A major part of their business was an offer to \\"Get Your Poem Set To Music.\\" Alice, husband Morrie, or son Lew would write a tune, the Morrison Recording Orchestra would record it, and one of them, or often the customer, would sing. They also picked up some more major performers (such as Paul Tutmarc and Bonnie Guitar and scored a national distribution deal with Vega Records. An inheritance around 1954 allowed the Morrisons to purchase a mansion at 1025 1st Avenue W on Queen Anne Hill, the pre-World War II residence of the Japanese Consul in Seattle. With the mansion as a headquarters they continued various ventures in music (and even film), but with changing styles in music they never again reached the level of success they had in the 1920s and '40s. Morrison died in 1978, her husband in 1984. Their son Lew played professionally until about 1994, son Ken (professionally a freelance television producer) remained a locally active musician as of 2005.

Wright and starring Gene Autry, Kay Hughes, and Smiley Burnette. Written by Dorrell and Stuart E. McGowan, the film is about a singing cowboy who confuses two girls by being himself and his own stunt double at the Texas Centennial in Dallas. Roy Rogers appears in the film as one of the Sons of the Pioneers. Plot Western movie star Tom Ford (Gene Autry) is scheduled to make a guest appearance at the Texas Centennial celebration in Dallas. When Ford leaves on vacation intending to miss the celebration, his publicity manager Lee Wilson (William Newell) convinces singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) to appear in Tom's place. While driving to Dallas from Hollywood, Gene meets Marion Hill (Kay Hughes) when his trailer collides with her wagon. Marion is also on her way to the centennial, intending to enter her show steer in the Texas Centennial Exposition. Watching Gene skillfully retrieve her cattle, Marion is impressed to see a movie star perform like a true cowboy. At the Texas Centennial in Dallas, Gene (pretending to be movie star Tom Ford) sings on the radio and becomes a national hit. Studio head Swartz (Charles Judels), hoping to capitalize on the publicity, decides to launch a series of Western musicals starring Tom Ford, even though the real Ford cannot sing a note. When the engagement of Gene (as Tom Ford) and Marion is announced in the newspapers, Ford's real fiancée is infuriated. Meanwhile, gambler Tony Rico (Harry Worth) and his henchmen arrive in Dallas to collect the $10,000 that Tom owes. Wilson is forced to pay the debt, plus $25,000 to keep Rico from revealing Gene's identity. Tom Ford finally shows up and reports to Swartz, but the studio head would rather appease the blackmailers than replace Gene with the talentless Ford. At the \\"Cavalcade of Texas\\" Gene and Marion perform as part of the centennial. When Tom Ford's fiancée shows up, Marion is forced to leave. In order to save his romance with Marion, Gene takes a risk and confesses his true identity over the radio. To his surprise, the audience prefers him to the real Tom Ford. Gene's confession ruins Rico's blackmail attempt, and he and his henchmen escape with the blackmail money by dressing as cowboys and joining the cavalcade act. Gene chases after the outlaws in true western style, eventually arresting them. During the chase, the money is lost in a lagoon by Gene's sidekick, Frog (Smiley Burnette). Sometime later back in Hollywood, Tom Ford is now working as Gene's double. Gene sings to Marion on the set of his new movie, and she and Gene kiss.

The Iosefa Enari Memorial Award, presented annually by Creative New Zealand, recognises Enari's pioneering contribution to Pacific Islands opera. Enari was the Artistic Director of Classical Polynesia, the first New Zealand opera combining traditional Samoan words and music with classical opera. Classical Polynesia premiered at the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts 1998 in Wellington, and featured Jonathan Lemalu.  Background  Enari was born in Samoa and moved to Auckland at the age of 16 with his seven brothers and sisters. Although Enari had been singing since Sunday school and in a school rock band, his career as a professional did not start until he won the Herald Aria Competition in 1987.The Press, Christchurch, NZ October 26, 2000 Article He later performed in New Zealand opera productions alongside notable opera singers such as Dame Malvina Major. In 1993, Enari was the recipient of a New Zealand Fulbright cultural grant which allowed him to study opera in the United States. In 1996, Creative New Zealand awarded him the Senior Pacific Artist Award. Creative New Zealand later created the Iosefa Enari Memorial Award in his honour. In 2000, Enari died in New Caledonia while he was attending the Festival of Pacific Arts with a delegation of New Zealand artists. He was given a moving farewell by Maori, Pacific Islands and Kanak artists.  Iosefa Enari Memorial Award  The Iosefa Enari Memorial Award is given annually by Creative New Zealand to support the career development of individual Pacific singers across all classical vocal genres and career stages.  Classical Polynesia  Enari was the Artistic Director and creator of Classical Polynesia, an operatic work of Samoan songs and music rearranged to opera by Samoan-born New Zealand composer Igelese Ete. In 1998, Classical Polynesia premiered at the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts at the Illot Concert Chamber, Wellington Town Hall. A second performance, aimed at the Pacific Islands community, was held in Cannons Creek, Porirua with an introduction by Oscar Kightley. The choreographer was Cook Islander Teokotai Paitai and the producer Makerita Urale. Classical Polynesia featured emerging Pacific voices in opera and classical music, at the time, including Jonathan Lemalu (bass), Ben Makisi (tenor), Daphne Collins (soprano), Aivale Cole (soprano), violinist Sam Konise and a chorus made up of Pacific youth. The narrative of the work was based on 'One day in the life of a Samoan village.' The music for the work was inspired by the 1960s recordings of Samoan songs made by the Samoan Teachers College and the Samoan composer Tuala Falenaoti Tiresa Malietoa. In 1999, Classical Polynesia was restaged at the Auckland Town Hall. The Auckland season was produced by Enari's nephew Iosefa Enari, who shares the same name as his uncle.  Theatre  Enari was also an actor. In 1996, he played the lead role of the father in A Frigate Bird Sings, a Samoan play about fa'afafine which was commissioned for Tu Fa'atasi, the Pacific arts component of the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts 1996. A Frigate Bird Sings premiered at Downstage Theatre in Wellington. The play was directed by Nathaniel Lees, co-written by Oscar Kightley and Dave Fane, dramaturg by Maori playwright Hone Kouka, producer Makerita Urale, set designers Kate Peters and artist Michel Tuffery and lighting design by Ivan Morandi. The all-male cast included Iaheto Ah Hi, Mario Gaoa, Ole Maiava and Stan Wolfgramm.

He primarily plays as a lock, but has also played in the back row. Gannon currently plays with Rugby United New York (RUNY) in Major League Rugby (MLR). Gannon started his career with his native province of Leinster, and spent the bulk of his career with Connacht across two spells with the side. He also spent a season with Southland Stags in New Zealand and two seasons with English side Exeter Chiefs. Early life Born in Dublin, Gannon went to school in Blackrock College, graduating in 2001. At Blackrock, Gannon played for the school's rugby sides. He won the Leinster Junior Cup in 1998 and the Senior Seconds Cup in 1999. In 2001, he was part of the Blackrock squad that finished as runners-up in Leinster Senior Cup, losing to Terenure College in the final. Gannon later studied at University College Dublin and played for the university rugby team. Gannon is a cousin of international player AJ MacGinty, who also played for Connacht. Club career Gannon was part of Leinster's under-age system, but struggled to break through to the first team. He made a single appearance for the province, coming on as a replacement against Border Reivers in the 2004–05 Celtic League. In 2005, he signed for rival province Connacht. In his first season, he made 12 league appearances and scored one try. He also featured from the bench against Catania in the group stage of the European Challenge Cup and started in the quarter-final defeat to Newcastle Falcons. In the following season, Gannon became a fixture in the starting team. He featured in 18 of the side's 20 games in the 2006–07 Celtic League and four of their six 2006–07 Challenge Cup games, starting on every occasion that he played. In the 2007–08 season, he played 16 times in the Celtic League and 4 times in the Challenge Cup. Gannon's final season in this spell with Connacht saw him feature less regularly. He played nine times in the league, starting just once, and played three times in the Challenge Cup. Gannon left Connacht in 2009, having played 67 times for the side in three seasons. After leaving Connacht, Gannon went six months without a club before signing with National Provincial Championship side Southland in New Zealand. He was signed as backup to first choice locks Josh Bekhuis and Joe Tuineau. During his time there, the team won the country's most prestigious rugby trophy, the Ranfurly Shield, for the first time in 50 years. After a successful season with Southland, he joined Exeter Chiefs in the English Championship in December 2009. The Chiefs were promoted in his first season there, and he played one season with the side in the Premiership before leaving in 2011. Gannon made a total of 34 appearances over his time with the Chiefs, starting in just seven of these. Gannon rejoined Connacht on a one- year deal in September 2011, as injury cover for Dave Nolan. In his return season, he played nine times in the league, starting on five occasions. The 2011–12 season saw Connacht qualify for the Heineken Cup for the first time, and Gannon started three of their six games. He signed a further one-year contract extension in March 2012. However, the 2012–13 season saw Connacht play less frequently for Connacht than ever, featuring seven times in the Pro12 and once from the bench in the Heineken Cup. The lack of gametime saw him released to play with Blackrock in the All-Ireland League, where he played alongside his cousin AJ MacGinty for a brief period. At the end of the season, Gannon was released by Connacht, having made 20 appearances in his second spell with the team and earned 87 caps overall. As he had done the first time he left Connacht, Gannon travelled overseas, this time joining MacGinty in the United States. He moved to Atlanta in early 2014, studying coaching and playing at Life University where MacGinty had been based since 2012. In 2018, Gannon was announced as part of the playing squad for Rugby United New York, the first ever professional rugby side in New York. International career Gannon represented Ireland internationally at under-age level. In 2004, he captained the Ireland under-21 team in the World Championship. The side made the final before losing to the New Zealand team 47–19. Gannon also played for Ireland's second tier side Ireland A, now known as the Ireland Wolfhounds. He played for the team three times, first facing New Zealand Māori in 2007, before playing against Canada A and the England Saxons in the same year. He scored one try for the side, with that coming in his debut.

(December 8, 1823 – February 18, 1878) was the second Roman Catholic Bishop of Nashville (1860–1864). Biography Whelan was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, and moved with his parents to the United States at age 10 or 12, settling in New York. He joined the Dominican Order in 1839 at the novitiate in Springfield, Kentucky, and made his profession in 1842. After studying philosophy and theology at the Dominican convent at Somerset, Ohio, he was ordained a priest by Bishop John Baptist Purcell on August 2, 1846. He then worked as a missionary before serving as president of St. Joseph's College in Somerset from 1852-54, when he became provincial superior of St. Joseph's Province (which included all the United States except the Pacific Coast). On April 15, 1859, Whelan was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee, and Titular Bishop of Marcopolis by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 8 from Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick, with Bishops John Baptiste Miège, S.J., and Henry Damian Juncker serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Louis. He succeeded Richard Pius Miles, O.P., as Bishop of Nashville upon the latter's death on February 21, 1860. He enlarged the cathedral and established an academy, boarding school, and orphanage. As a border state, Tennessee was the scene of some of the most severe battles during the Civil War (1861–1865). While passing through the lines after a visit with Bishop Martin John Spalding at Louisville, Whelan was accused of making remarks within Union lines which the Confederates thought had influenced the movements of the Union Army. These reproaches, combined with the sufferings, struggles, and sorrows of war, proved too much for Whelan, who resigned as Bishop on February 12, 1864; he was immediately named Titular Bishop of Diocletianopolis in Palaestina. Whelan briefly retired to St. Joseph's Convent before taking up residence at St. Thomas Church in Zanesville. He devoted his time to theological, historical, and chemical studies, and published a defense of papal infallibility in 1871. He died on February 18, 1878, aged 54, in Zanesville, Ohio.

There are several widely used drugs which can cause a boost in appetite, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, natural or synthetic cannabinoids, first-generation antihistamines, most antipsychotics and many steroid hormones. In the United States, no hormone or drug has currently been approved by the FDA specifically as an orexigenic, with the exception of Dronabinol, which received approval for HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia only.

He was arrested by the Soviets in 1947 and spent five years in prison and labor camps in Arkhangelsk where he worked as a lumberman. While in the camp, he continued his priestly duties and occasionally managed to celebrate Divine Liturgy with a few crumbs of bread and drops of wine. After his release, he returned to his hometown where he worked various jobs including park gatekeeper, bookkeeper, janitor and nurse while secretly continuing his priestly ministry. He taught catechism, said Mass, and heard confessions in his spare time in his room or in the woods.

During this time he wrote liturgical and theology texts, and ordained five to six priests a year. In 1983, he became archbishop and the representative in Lviv for Myroslav Lubachivsky, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church who was at the time residing in Rome. On August 19, 1990, he celebrated the first divine liturgy offered by a Greek-Catholic priest in the St. George's Cathedral since the Soviet liquidation of the Church.

The Vancouver CBA operated the Chinese Benevolent Association Building in Chinatown; it was built in 1907. Additional association buildings opened in the 1910s and 1920s. As the British Columbia Chinese population shifted to Vancouver, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in Victoria moved to Vancouver in the 1930s.Tan, Hugh, p. 11. In 1962 the association gave places in its ruling committee to representatives of every other Chinese association in the Vancouver Chinatown. This was done due to changing sociopolitical conditions;Willmott, W. E. \\"Approaches to the Study of the Chinese in British Columbia \\" (). BC Studies. No. 4. Spring 1970. p. 38-52. CITED: 51.

In 1964 Willmott wrote that \\"many Chinese\\", especially more assimilated Chinese, \\"do not recognize its right to speak for them\\". According to Aitken, the organization \\"lost most of its influence\\" in the 1970s, and the Chinese Benevolent Association of Canada split from it in 1979. Aitken stated that the CBA regained influence by 2014. In 1991 the president of the CBA estimated that the organization had 10,000 members; the per person membership fee was $1 and there were multiple paths to membership, so Hugh Xiaobin Tan, author of \\"Chinese-Canadian Associations in Vancouver,\\" concluded that the exact membership was \\"difficult to determine\\". Activities As of 1964 it operated a Cantonese language school, provided legal counseling services, facilitated Chinese involvement in events for the public, established welfare programs, and issued public statements intended to represent the views of the Chinese community as a whole. By 1964 Chinese Canadians were receiving proper services in the Canadian court system; in previous eras when Chinese were not well-served by the Canadian courts, the CBA served as a court of appeal for the Chinese. In response to the 2014 Hong Kong protests and the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, the CBA took out local newspaper ads that were sympathetic to the stance of the Chinese Communist Party and critical of the protesters. The nature and verbiage of the ads raised questions of involvement by the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department and its affiliated groups. In September 2019, the CBA held a gala in celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In July 2020, the CBA issued a statement in support of the widely criticized Hong Kong national security law. Representation The organizations represented by the CBA include the Chinese Cultural Centre (CCC), the Chinese Freemasons, the Chinatown Merchants Association, and S.U.C.C.E.S.S.

Overview The caves, discovered in 1938 by the speleologist Franco Anelli, Historical info on copuglia.it are situated south of Castellana and are served by the (Grotte di Castellana railway station)Different from town's station on the FSE line Bari-Putignano-Martina-Taranto. The entrance is represented by an enormous vertical tunnel long. The main cave is named \\"La Grave\\" (as abyss),Infos on the official site and others are named Black Cavern (Caverna Nera), White Cave (Grotta Bianca) and Precipice Cavern (Caverna del Precipizio). =Description= The Caves of Castellana open in south-eastern Murge, a limestone plateau dating back to the upper Cretaceous (ninety- one hundred million years ago) and rising 330 metres above sea level. The area of Castellana is characterized by limestone, a sedimentary rock composed largely of calcium carbonate, known as Limestone of Altamura. The cave system is 3348 metres in length and the point of maximum depth reaches 122 metres. The temperature within the caves is about 18 °C. The caves are open all year round except for Christmas Day and the New Year’s day. The visit develops along two itineraries: the first is 1 km long and lasts about 50 minutes while the second is 3 km long and lasts about two hours. The tour timetable changes depending on the season. In addition, during the summer there are also guided night tours. The Grave is the first and the biggest cave of this wonderful speleological complex and it is the only one communicating with the outside. It measures 100 m in length, 50 m in width and 60 m in depth. Going beyond the Grave stalactites, stalagmites, curtains and precious crystals continues to embellish everywhere the caves. The name of the environment are the result through the imagination of the early explorers: the She-Wolf, the Monuments, the Owl, the Little Virgin Mary, the Altar, the Precipice, the Desert Corridor, the Reverse Column, the Red Corridor, the Dome up to the last and the most dazzling one, the White Cave. =Peculiarity= Castellana’s speleological complex is unique among other cave systems thanks to its three peculiarities: the Grave, the White Cave and the concretions. =The Grave= The Grave of Castellana is a huge natural pantheon thanks to its natural skylight surrounded by a circle of holm-oaks through which a ribbon of clear sky is visible. From the ceiling a big sunbeams filters down into the darkness and it moves differently according to the time of the day and the season. Within the Grave, the sunlight creates magical effects, firstly draws a huge white screen on the descending walls, secondly it gives life to a far stalagmite group, called the Cyclopes because they look like sea giants rising out from the chaos of a stormy sea. Finally it reaches the irregular and dark bottom of the chasm. The southern walls, the big broken curtains and the green moss-grown columns stay always in the darkness. Beyond these columns there is the majestic architectural structures that the nature build up in the darkness by the passing of time. The Grave is the first huge cave of the cave karst system and the only one communicating with the outside. Its history dates back to ninety-one hundred million years ago in the upper Cretaceous. At that time Apulia was submerged by an old sea where lived large colonies of molluscs and sea vegetables. For millions of years generations of these life forms-plants and marine molluscs succeeded each other and died, so their empty shells and their carcasses were piled up on the seabed, forming a giant deposit of mud and sand, that with a continuous growth was compressed forming limestone layers for a total thickness of several kilometres. Starting since 66 million years ago, the gradual raising of the land brought the region to its current aspect. However, the new emerged land was too rigid and for this reason it was cut in a multitude of fractures. The eluvial water of large rainfall infiltrated into the subsurface soil and rock and created massive groundwater aquifer. The physical and chemical effect of water running underground, dissolved gradually the limestone and enlarged the fractures. Over geological eras cracks expanded to till become galleries and then cavern which became bigger and bigger. In certain cases a large number of cracks intersected and so there were several frequent collapses, while the thickness of the rock, that separated the cave from the outside, was so reduced that the vault fell down. This happened in the Grave of Castellana and thus the first sunbeam could come in the darkness of the cave. =The White Cave= At the end of the underground itinerary and about 1500 metres far from the Grave there is a small portal dig in an imposing alabaster wall. This is the entrance of the last and the most beautiful caves of Castellana, the White Cave. Suddenly all the wonders of the previous halls disappear compared with the majesty of this corner of heaven. Going on slowly, almost in reverent silence in this underground temple, the astonished visitor is surrounded by the whiteness of alabaster, this is because the cave has been indicated as the most shining cave in the world. A small but spectacular basin, once full of drip water, is now adorned with crystals, which embellish its bottom and walls. Every corner of the cave is adorned with very white and translucent stalagmites. In front of the visitor takes place the final scene: two high and huge columns seem to support the vault of the last hall, embellished everywhere by white stalactites and coral concretions. This is the end and the most enchanting moment of the underground tour that remind the visitor of the power and of the gracefulness of the nature. =Concretions and eccentric stalactites= The most fascinating feature of the Caves of Castellana are the concretions. This term is used to indicate the mineral deposits that covered the naked walls of a cave by crystallisation of the calcite carried in solution by infiltrating rain water, that had penetrated all the overhanging layers of the rock by a very slow seepage. When the water drips through the roof of an empty cavern, the calcite dissolved in it deposits on the roof and going downwards takes the shape of a stalactite. When the drop of water falls on the floor, the calcite takes the shape of a stalagmite. As time went by, the downwards extension of a stalactite and the progressive growth of the below stalagmite led to the formation of a column. Besides this elementary forms, there is a great number of other concretions such as calcite flowstones, curtains, (which are due to the flowing of water), corals, calcite crystals, (which formed underwater), cave pearls, formed of concentric layers as calcite crystallizes on a nucleus such as a microscopic grain of rock, and the eccentric concretions, which defy gravity. As regards eccentric stalactites, they normally have a small size and break the force of gravity. Unlike other stalactites, they grow multidirectionally in capricious ways, i.e. horizontally to the floor, developing weird curved patterns and even upwardly. They still have no clear origin and even the cave scientists are at variance with the formation of the eccentric stalactites. According to speleology, there are several hypothesis about their origin, but undoubtedly there are several factors for their multidirectional forms. The first factor is the possible presence of draughts in the caves that would drive horizontally the direction of the drops and therefore the growth of the concretion. The second factor has to do with the particular form in which calcite crystallizes. Calcite is a mineral that crystallizes in the trigonal system and has perfect rhombohedral cleavage. The cannula of a stalactite is formed by a series of very small rhombohedra which interpenetrate each other. If, as consequence of several causes, the cannula is perforated on the side, water will come out through that opening and will create an aggregate of other rhombohedra on the side. The third one is the presence of any impurities in the water. They can hinder the growth of a calcite rhombohedron in a direction and thus it can form an aggregate on the side that will follow a different direction. There are also eccentric stalactites whose central cannula is very thin (the diameter is less than one millimetre) and so the water flows very slowly. At the end of this stalactite there is always a droplet whose calcite crystals can align randomly so the formation follows a new direction. Discovery In 1938 the Provincial Tourist Board of Bari asked the Italian Institute of Speleology of Postojna for a speleologist to make an inspection in some caves of the area that have been already explored to turn them into a tourist attraction. But none of them, because of their limited extension, was in this way useful. The 23 January 1938, finally, Anelli climbed down into the Grave, whose bottom was full of a large amount of waste material, accumulated there by the passing of time. He descended to the floor, and then he ventured out to a corridor that disappeared into the darkness and then he found himself in a passage half hidden by stalactites and stalagmites and finally in a huge cave, later called \\"Cave of the Monuments\\". This cavern was so huge that his acetylene lamp could not light the vault and the walls and so he decided to come back two days later to continue his exploration. This time Anelli was helped by a bold worker from Castellana, Vito Matarrese. Together they descended into the cave and continued the exploration for more than 300 metres. But they had to stop at the end of a short descending gallery in front of a deep abyss, today known as the Snake Corridor. Two months later, in March 1938, Anelli came back to Castellana and, again with Matarrese, continued the exploration. But, once more, he had to stop by reaching a new chasm more than 600 metres far from the first cave. Professor Anelli spent several days in Castellana and started the first ever survey on the caves, which was completed in September 1938, during his third stay in Castellana. When Anelli left Castellana, it was Vito Matarrese who was responsible for the exploration of the caves. He climbed over the precipice of the Desert Corridor and discovered the last cave, the White Cave, in 1940. Fauna Many animals live in the caves of Castellana and some of them are new endemic species. They are: *Isopods Murgeoniscus anellii and Castellanethes sanfilippoi *Pseudoscorpion Hadoblothrus gigas *Beetles Tychobythinus anelli and Italodytes stammeri There are also a large number of Troglophilus andreinii cave crickets. The most typical animal of the cave is the bat, the only mammals capable of true flight. In the caves of Castellana there are five species of small bats. They are: Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus mehelyi, Rhinolophus euryale and Myotis capaccinii.  Legends  The entrance of the Grave, that is to say the deep chasm, had always struck terror into the people going along the nearby country street, above all at twilight. It could happened that the superstitious wayfarers saw, together with the bats flying out of the cave chasm to eat insects in the fields of the area, strange vapours that they thought were the souls of the suicides who had threw themselves down the Grave, and were trying to go to heaven in vain. Vincenzo Longo (1737–1825), humanist and expert on law from Castellana, probably was the first man who descended in the Grave together with a big group of young people. The memories of the courageous achievement, enriched by new several details, was preserved by its witnesses and then it was handed down to posterity. In the 19th century the Chorographical-Universal Dictionary of Italy vouched for the truth of the achievement: A little more than a mile far from Castellana there is a natural sight, a chasm called the Grave by common people. Its entrance is an hole about 180 spans in circumference and about 300 spans in depth. In the previous century some brave inhabitants of Castellana descend into the Grave early in the morning. They used ropes and hawsers and went along dark corridors for several miles. After 24 hours, while their relatives and friends were very worrying about the long wait, they came back to surface. Speleological museum \\"Franco Anelli\\" The speleological museum of the Caves of Castellana, \\"Franco Anelli\\", was inaugurated on 23 January 2000, on the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the discovery of the caves. It is dedicated to Professor Franco Anelli (1899–1977), born in Lodi, who was speleologist, discover, populariser as well as passionate director of the Caves of Castellana. The museum is managed by Gruppo Puglia Grotte, the speleological association of Castellana founded in 1971, on behalf of Grotte di Castellana Company. According to Anelli the visit at the Speleological Museum would have been an \\"easy delightful excursion over the pages of a fascinating book, the book of the caves: few orderly chapters to provide a commentary for a ponderous volume, that of the Science of caves\\". This is the aim of the museum. The museum is located in the a building planned in 1952 by the architect Pietro Favia (1895–1972). It allow the tourist to delve into science and speleology and also represent a reference point for the speleological research in Apulia. It houses the Centre of Speleological Documentation of the Apulian Speleological Federation \\"Franco Orofino\\" that includes a speleological library, a newspaper and periodical library and an archive of photographs. =Educational workshops= Since several years the speleological museum \\"Franco Anelli\\" is the destination of an increasing didactic tourism thanks to guided tours, educational workshops, and speleological tours in the secondary forks of the caves for pupils and students. It represent one of the most important innovation of Castellana’s speleological complex. The educational workshops cover astronomy, science of caves, speleology, bio-speleology, geology and ecology. They share Professor Anelli’s idea to spread among school students \\"the knowledge about the underground world and the scientific studies related to it through lively visual illustration of the subsurface and the physical, biological and anthropic phenomena which take place in the underground or which took place thousands of years ago at the time of the geological history of Italy\\". Moreover, in the museum are offered cultural activities, with the aim to promote education and learning by means of interactive workshops and specific lessons holding directly inside the caves. One of these cultural activities is speleojunior that gives students the opportunity to feel the emotion of the darkness and to learn the most secret features of the caves. Historical events Among the most famous visitors of the caves in the period of their launching as tourist attraction there were Luigi Einaudi (1874–1961), Aldo Moro (1916–1978), Enrico Mattei (1906–1962), Gina Lollobrigida, Silvana Pampanini, Margareth aus England (1930–2002) and Tito Schipa (1888–1965). Similarly, several film producers were fascinated by the caves and eight films were shot in the caves. They are: The Age of the Love (1953) by Michael Hamilton (but he is Lionello De Felice), Hercules in the Haunted World (1961) by Mario Bava and Franco Prosperi, Maciste in Hell (1962) by Riccardo Freda; Casanova 70 (1965) by Mario Monicelli, The King of Criminals (1968) by Paul Maxwell (but he is Paolo Bianchini); Stellar Clashes beyond the Third Dimension (1978) by Lewis Coates (but he is Luigi Cozzi); Alien 2: On Earth (1980) by Sam Cromwell (but he is Ciro Ippolito) and Biagio Proietti and an episode of the TV series Holiday Profession (1986) by Vittorio De Sisti. Additionally, two films by Antonio Leonviola shot here: TAUR IL RE DELLA FORZA BRUTA (1963), and its sequel LE GLADIATRICI (1963). The English version of the former (TOR, MIGHTY WARRIOR) carries an end credit which says \\"The producers wish to express their gratitude to the Yugoslave (sic) authorities for granting permission to shoot some scenes in the grottoes of Postumia\\". The underworld scenes of ARRIVANO I TITANI by Duccio Tessari also seem to have been filmed here. Bibliography *Anelli Franco, Castellana – Arcano mondo sotterraneo in Terra di Bari.

It currently has 80 mission sites nationwide (including 40 local congregations, 30 church plants and 10 parachurch organizations) with a total of 11,422 baptized members.LWF Statistics - Taiwan The Lutheran World Federation The current bishop of the Taiwan Lutheran Church is the Rt Rev Chen Chih-Hung, first elected in 2008.Taiwan Lutheran Church: Successive Bishops History Like the Southern Baptist Convention, the Lutheran Church also established itself in Taiwan during the 1950s. Both American and Scandinavian Lutherans had been active in China since the final decade of the 19th century.Latourette, A History of Christian Missions in China The Norwegian Lutheran Mission Association of the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America had sent its first representatives to China in 1890. The missionaries established themselves in Hubei and, later, Henan provinces. Some five years later, in 1896, the Danish Lutherans began their own mission station in Manchuria. The years following the Boxer Rebellion saw a dramatic expansion of Lutheran efforts. The Norwegian American Lutherans sent ten additional missionaries to China. Belgian Lutherans from The Hague worked closely with their American co- religionists and considerable progress was made during the years from 1902 to 1914. Other Lutheran societies from the United States and from the Scandinavian nations sent their personnel to various parts of China. Most of these bodies - the American Lutheran Brethren Mission is one example - settled in with the earlier arrivals in Hubei and Henan. Other missionaries, auch as those serving the newly revived Norwegian Missionary Society, moved into cities in Hunan. By 1914, the Lutherans had been able to establish new mission stations and plant new churches. They had also been gaining new converts. Their total membership reached 24,422 in 1914. Finally, because they stressed self-government, they had been able to set up a seminary in Shekou, in Hubei, where they could train Chinese Lutheran clergy and church workers. The coming of World War One hurt German Lutheran efforts, but missionaries from other nations helped out their brethren. The war did have its positive side for the Lutherans in China: It was during these years that preliminary steps were taken to unite their various groups, representing six different nations, into a Lutheran mission union. A preliminary constitution for this union was drawn up and this proposal was accepted by the different Lutheran bodies in 1917. The 1920s and 1930s saw the steady evolution of a Lutheran presence in the face of the anti-missionary campaign and the anti-imperialist movement. Only the Communist victory brought to an end the almost sixty years of Lutheran development. The Taiwan Lutheran Church was the fruit of the work of several mission societies which had worked before in mainland China and the Lutheran Church of China. Work began in Kaohsiung and Taipei, then gradually expanded to Taichung, Miaoli, Chiayi and Tainan. =The beginnings= In April 1950, Chin Chung-An, a medical doctor from Xian, started conducting family worship services in his residence in Kaoshiung. By 3 June 1951, the Kaohsiung congregation was established and 59 people were baptised. This congregation became the first congregation of the Taiwan Lutheran Church and is today known as the Chien-Chen Lutheran Church.Taiwan Lutheran Church 40th Anniversary Bulletin, 1954-1994, pp. 45-46 At around the same time, two Norwegian women missionaries, Helga Waabeno and Gertrude Fitje, who had worked at the Mackay Memorial Hospital as nurses, started a Bible study class at their residence in Taipei. The class was taken over a year later by an American missionary with Norwegian ancestors, Lenorah Erickson, and by 1952 had been organized as the first TLC congregation in Taipei. =Establishment of a national church= On 1 November 1954, the TLC was officially established in a meeting held at the Taipei Salvation Lutheran Church. This meeting brought together 32 delegates from congregations and outreach centres set up by mission societies which had previously been active in mainland China and had set up seven of the 16 synods of the Lutheran Church of China (LCC). The seven former LCC synods who took part in the church union under the banner of the TLC were:Hsiao, Andrew: A Brief History of the Chinese Lutheran Church, Hong Kong: Taosheng Publishing House, 1999, * Yuzhong Synod (豫中區會) : Formerly the Augustana Synod Mission in central Henan * Yu'e Synod (豫鄂區會) : Formerly the United Lutheran Mission in Henan and Hubei * Yudong Synod (豫東區會) : Formerly the Lutheran Free Church Mission in eastern Henan * Yuxi Synod (豫西區會) : Formerly the American Lutheran Brethren Mission in western Henan * Yu’eshaan Synod (豫鄂陕區會) : Formerly the Norwegian Lutheran China Mission in Hubei, Henan and Shaanxi * Xiangzhong Synod (湘中區會) : Formerly the Norwegian Mission in central Hunan * Dongbei Synod (東北區會) : Formerly the Danish Mission in Manchuria and Northeast China Missionaries formerly attached to the Shaannan Synod (陕南區會) in Southern Shaanxi and the Xiangxi Synod (湘西區會) in western Hunan also attached their work in Taiwan under the umbrella of the TLC in 1954 and 1956 respectively. =Secession of churches within the TLC= In 1956, five congregations associated with the former Yuxi and Yu’eshaan synods withdrew from the TLC to form the Chinese Lutheran Brethren Church (1958) and the Lutheran Church of the Republic of China (1960) respectively. This was followed by the congregations associated with the former Shaannan synod which withdrew in 1961 and formed the China Lutheran Gospel Church in 1973.Taiwan Lutheran Church: Lutheran Churches in Taiwan Congregations associated with the former Xiangxi synod withdrew in 1974 and formed the Lutheran Church of Taiwan in 1977.Kaariainen, Taimo, A Brief Introduction of the Finnish Missionary Society Work in Taiwan between 1956-1977 Beliefs and practices The TLC is a member church of the Lutheran World Federation, a communion of Lutheran Churches throughout the world. As a church in the Lutheran tradition, it accepts the teachings found in the unaltered Augsburg Confession, Luther's Small Catechism and other confessional articles and symbols of the Book of Concord. The TLC accepts the ordination of women as co-workers and pastors in the denomination with the first woman ordained on January 31, 1999.

Some of the authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions may view these negatively. This can range from quiet discouragement, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices or sex/gender reassignment among adherents, actively opposing social acceptance of LGBT identities, to execution of people engaging in homosexual acts while tolerating sex/gender reassignment in specific cases. Liberal and progressive voices within these religions tend to view LGBT people more positively, and some liberal religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages, as well as accepting and marrying people who are transgender. Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalized, or revered same-sex love and sexuality; such mythologies and traditions can be found around the world; elements of religious and cultural incorporation of non-heterosexual practice can still be identified in traditions that have survived into the modern era, such as the Berdache, Hijra, and Xanith. Religious views of LGBT people According to a 2006 Australian survey, LGBT Australians, compared to the general Australian population, were much more likely to have no religious affiliation, much less likely to be affiliated with a Christian denomination, and more likely to be affiliated with a non- Christian religion. The distribution of religions that LGBT Australians were raised in, however, was similar to that of the general population. Men, particularly bisexual men, were more likely to be Christian and more likely to have stayed in the same religion. Lesbians were more likely to have left the religion they were raised in and be currently unaffiliated. A 2004 survey of LGB New Zealanders found that 73% had no religion, 14.8% were Christian and 2.2% were Buddhist. In contrast, in 2001 census the general New Zealand population reported 59.8% Christian and 29.2% no religion. When looking at change since 1966, LGB people are disaffiliating with Christianity at a rate 2.37 times the rate of the general population in New Zealand. In the survey 59.8% reported a belief in a spiritual force, god or gods; this differed significantly by gender, with 64.9% of women and 55.5% of men reporting such a belief. The Radical Faeries are a worldwide queer spiritual movement, founded in 1979 in the United States. Radical Faerie communities are generally inspired by aboriginal, native or traditional spiritualities, especially those that incorporate queer sensibilities. Religious groups and public policy Opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights is often associated with conservative religious views. The American Family Association and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community. On the other hand, the Unitarian Universalist Association supports the freedom to marry and compares resistance to it to the resistance to abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and the end of anti-miscegenation laws.UUSM - Services & Sermons Lesbians and gay men face particular problems in conservative Islamic nations where laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behavior; where interpretation of Sharia Law on male homosexuality carries the death penalty this is quite a big problem for gay men, and this form of discrimination is seen as a breach of human rights by international human rights experts and human rights organisations such as Amnesty International; with the signature of the USA in 2009, the proposed UN declaration on LGBT rights has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as others from South America and other countries around the world; 67 members of the UN have signed to date; there was an opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations, and this has been signed by 57 member states, the majority being in Africa and Asia. 68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement. Homosexuality and religionTransgender people and religionViews of specific religions=Abrahamic religions=JudaismChristianity Christian denominations have a variety of beliefs about LGBT people, and the moral status of same-sex sexual practices and gender variance. LGBT people may be barred from membership, accepted as laity, or ordained as clergy, depending on the denomination. The Roman Catholic Church welcomes people attracted to the same sex, while maintaining its teaching that homosexual relationships and acts are sinful.Catechism of the Catholic Church, § 2357,Criteria for the Discernment of Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies The Roman Curia considers transgender individuals to be their biological sex and admits no distinction between \\"sex\\" and \\"gender\\". The Orthodox Church holds similar stances on same-sex attraction and conjugal relations.On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life Protestant denominations have a wide range of views. Some denominations espouse similar views to Catholicism and Orthodoxy, and teach that all sexual relations outside of traditional marriage between a man and a woman are sinful, such as the Reformed Church in America, Southern Baptist Convention,Position Statements/Sexuality The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsSame-Gender Attraction - LDS Newsroom and Jehovah's Witnesses. Other Christian churches, such as the Church of England, United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Lutheran Church of Denmark, the Lutheran Church in Norway, the Lutheran Church of Iceland, the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, the United Protestant Church in Belgium, the United Protestant Church of France, the German Lutheran, Reformed and United Churches in Evangelical Church in Germany, the Old Catholic Church, the Anglican Church in Canada, the Episcopal Church in United States or the Scottish Episcopal Church do not consider same-sex relations immoral, and will ordain LGBT clergy and do blessings of same-sex marriages. Liberal Quakers, those in membership of Britain Yearly Meeting and Friends General Conference in the US approve of same-sex marriage and union and conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies in the United Kingdom.> Islam Islamic views on homosexuality are influenced by the rulings prescribed by the Qur'an and the teachings of the prophet Muhammed. The mainstream interpretation of Qur'anic verses and hadith condemn sexual acts between members of the same sex (along with most forms of extramarital relations). In contrast, transgender individuals are often more accepted, provided they conform to traditional gender norms post-transition; for example, the Iranian government not only allows and recognises sex reassignment surgery, but also subsidises the procedure for transgender citizens.BBC News: Iran's 'diagnosed transsexuals' Bahá'í Faith The Bahá'í Faith teaches that the only acceptable form of sexual expression is within marriage, and Bahá'í marriage is defined in the religion's texts as exclusively between one man and one woman.\\"Bahá'í law restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married.\\" :(Letter from the Universal House of Justice to an individual; Lights of Guidance, pp. 365, #1225) Bahá'ís stress the importance of absolute chastity for any unmarried person,\\"...according to the Bahá'í Teachings no sexual act can be considered lawful unless performed between lawfully married persons. Outside of marital life there can be no lawful or healthy use of the sex impulse.\\" :(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual; Lights of Guidance, pp. 364, #1220) and focus on personal restraint. The Universal House of Justice, the elected governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, has stated that \\"the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a 'natural' or permanent phenomenon.\\"\\"…the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a \\"natural\\" or permanent phenomenon. Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be. To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge. As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, i.e. abstaining from homosexual acts. \\"Your plea for understanding and of justice extended to homosexuals is well taken in many respects, and the House of Justice assures you of its concern for the large number of persons so afflicted. Your work with the homosexual community is praiseworthy, and it permits you personally to exercise the support which is necessary for these often harassed persons, support which you call for in your essay. Moreover, your interest cannot but be therapeutic, at least for the more superficial elements of the problem; however, definitive therapy of the underlying predisposition, which you consider to be innate but the Teachings do not, may have to await additional investigations. As for the responsibility of Assemblies and of individual Bahá’ís, certainly all are called upon to be understanding, supportive and helpful to any individual who carries the burden of homosexuality.\\" :(Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual, 22 March 1987) The Universal House of Justice has approved of and encouraged Shoghi Effendi's idea of possible medical treatment.(Letter of The Universal House of Justice, 5 June 1993, Homosexuality, p. 7) However, membership in the Bahá'í community is open to lesbian and gay adherents,\\"They (homosexuals) should be treated just like any other people seeking admittance to the Faith, and be accepted on the same basis. Our teachings, as outlined in “The Advent of Divine Justice” on the subject of living a chaste life, should be emphasized to them just as to every other applicant, but certainly no ruling whatsoever should be laid down in this matter. The Bahá'ís have certainly not yet reached that stage of moral perfection where they are in a position to too harshly scrutinize the private lives of other souls, and each individual should be accepted on the basis of his faith, and sincere willingness to try to live up to the Divine standards\\" :(Compiled by the Universal House of Justice Research Department, Homosexuality, p. 3) who are to be \\"advised and sympathized with\\".\\"Amongst the many other evils afflicting society in this spiritual low water mark in history is the question of immorality, and over-emphasis of sex. Homosexuality, according to the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, is spiritually condemned. This does not mean that people so afflicted must not be helped and advised and sympathized with.\\" :(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual, 21 May 1954; Lights of Guidance, p. 365, #1221) \\"As for the responsibility of Assemblies and of individual Bahá’ís, certainly all are called upon to be understanding, supportive and helpful to any individual who carries the burden of homosexuality.\\" :(Compiled by Universal House of Justice Research Department, Homosexuality, p. 7) \\"When an individual becomes a Bahá'í, he or she accepts the claim of Bahá'u'lláh to be the Manifestation of God bringing a divinely-inspired message from God for the benefit of mankind. Implicit in the acceptance of this claim is the commitment of the believer to embark on the lifelong process of endeavouring to implement the teachings on personal conduct. Through sincere and sustained effort, energized by faith in the validity of the Divine Message, and combined with patience with oneself and the loving support of the Bahá'í community, individuals are able to effect a change in their behaviour; as a consequence of this effort they partake of spiritual benefits which liberate them and which bestow a true happiness beyond description. As you know, Bahá'u'lláh has clearly forbidden the expression of sexual love between individuals of the same sex. However, the doors are open for all of humanity to enter the Cause of God, irrespective of their present circumstance; this invitation applies to homosexuals as well as to any others who are engaged in practices contrary to the Bahá'í teachings. Associated with this invitation is the expectation that all believers will make a sincere and persistent effort to eradicate those aspects of their conduct which are not in conformity with Divine Law. :(Compiled by Universal House of Justice Research Department, Homosexuality, p. 11) =Vedic religions= Ardhanarisvara, the hermaphrodite form of Siva. Tiruvenkadu. Chola, 11th century AD. Hinduism Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. Referring to the nature of Samsara, the Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if not an approval of homosexuality.'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by Ashok Row Kavi Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society, and LGBT issues are largely a taboo subject — especially among the strongly religious. A \\"third gender\\" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since Vedic times. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu SmritiManu Smriti, 3.49 and Sushruta Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. They worked as hairdressers, flower-sellers, servants, masseurs and prostitutes. Today, many people of a \\"third gender\\" (hijras) live throughout India, mostly on the margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood as beggars. Several Hindu religious laws contain injunctions against homosexual activity, while some Hindu mythologies speaks favorably of lesbian relations and some third-gendered individuals were highly regarded by Hindu legends. Hindu groups are historically not unifyed regarding the issue of homosexuality, each one having a distinct doctrinal view.Lariviere. Naradasmriti, (Part One). Philadelphia, 1989.Mahabharata, book 5, Chapter 191-5. The Indian Kama Sutra, written in the 4th century AD, contains passages describing eunuchs or \\"third-sex\\" males performing oral sex on men.Kama Sutra, Chapter 9, \\"Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress\\". Text online . However, the author was \\"not a fan of homosexual activities\\" and treated such individuals with disdain, according to historian Devdutt Pattanaik.Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). Homosexuality in Ancient India, Debonair 2000 or 2001. Essay available online from GayBombay.org. Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict both male homosexuality and lesbianism within their carvings, such as the temple walls at Khajuraho. Some infer from these images that Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present. Khajoraho scene of three women and one man. In some Hindu sects(specially among the hijras), many divinities are androgynous. There are Hindu deities who are intersex (both male and female); who manifest in all three genders; who switch from male to female or from female to male; male deities with female moods and female deities with male moods; deities born from two males or from two females; deities born from a single male or single female; deities who avoid the opposite sex; deities with principal companions of the same sex, and so on. However, this is not accepted by the majority of Hindus, and is often considered heretical in nature. Those who do accept it justify with the belief that both God and nature are unlimitedly diverse and God is difficult to comprehend. Several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender. It is often regarded that Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality. Buddhism According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is no any saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,優婆塞經 (Upāsaka Sutra from Madhyam āgama):復次，舍梨子！白衣聖弟子離邪婬、斷邪婬，彼或有父所護，或母所護，或父母所護，或兄弟所護，或姉妹所護，或婦父母所護，或親親所護，或同姓所護，或為他婦女，有鞭罰恐怖，及有名雇債至華鬘親，不犯如是女。彼於邪淫淨除其心，白衣聖弟子善護行，此第三法 and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their parents or guardians), someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy. There are four factors of the third precept (kamesu micchacara) #agamaniya vatthu — that which should not be visited (the 20 groups of women). #asmim sevana-cittam — the intention to have intercourse with anyone included in the above-mentioned groups. #sevanap-payogo — the effort at sexual intercourse. #maggena maggappatipatti — sexual contact through that adhivasanam effort. * In 1997 the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso said, \\"From a Buddhist point of view, men- to-men and women-to-women is generally considered sexual misconduct.\\" However the view is not based on what Buddha's said, but from some later Abhidharma texts. Sikhism The Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention homosexuality. The Guru Granth Sahib is seen as the spiritual authority on all Sikh matters. Some modern Sikh leaders have condemned homosexuality. Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti of the temporal Sikh authority (Akal Takht), has condemned homosexuality while reminding visiting Sikh-Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) of their religious duty to oppose same-sex marriage.World Sikh group against gay marriage bill, CBC News, Tuesday, 29 March 2005. The Sikh religious body, the Akal Takht, has issued an edict condemning gay marriage.Martin Regg Cohn, Reject gay bill, Sikh MPs told; Warning from top religious authority says marriage backers will be shunned, Toronto Star, Toronto, March 28, 2005, p. A.1. Other Sikhs point out that Sikhism does not condemn homosexuality or gay marriage reminding them that the Guru Granth Sahib, leaves this as a matter of personal conscience. =East and Southeast Asian religions=ConfucianismShintoTaoism Tu'er Shen or the Rabbit God is a Chinese deity who manages love and sex between gay people. In 2006, Lu Wei-ming founded a temple for Tu'er Shen in Taiwan,. See: which has been called the world's only religious shrine for gay people. Roughly 9,000 gay pilgrims visit the temple each year praying to find a suitable partner, and the temple performs love ceremonies for gay couples. =Other=Religious Science Religious Science is a teaching based on the text book \\"The Science of Mind\\" by Dr. Ernest Holmes first published in 1926 and revised in 1938. This 'new thought' tradition is related to the thoughts of Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalists as well as drawing on the main teachings of all the great world religions at the mystical level. The churches or centers are under an umbrella of \\"Centers for Sprititual Living\\". From its beginning Religious Science has advanced the social progressive edge by including all those regardless of sexual orientation fully into ministry, and blessing the marriages of same gender couples.

In the film Glennie, who won a Grammy Award in 1989, collaborates with English experimental musician Fred Frith and others, and explains how she perceives sound. The film appeared at over 20 film festivals across the world, and won several awards, including \\"Best Documentary\\" at the 2004 BAFTA Awards, Scotland. A soundtrack of Touch the Sound featuring Glennie and Frith, plus additional music and sounds from the film, was released in 2004. An album based on Glennie and Frith's performances in the film entitled The Sugar Factory was released in 2007. Background German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer's previous film Rivers and Tides (2001) received several awards, including Best Documentary awards by the German Film Critics Association, the San Diego Film Critics Society and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle. The soundtrack of the film was composed and performed by English experimental musician Fred Frith. In 2003 Riedelsheimer asked Frith to perform with Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie in Touch the Sound. The venue was an abandoned sugar factory in Dormagen, Germany, and their performance was filmed under the pretext of \\"making a record\\". Frith and Glennie had never worked together before and their entire performance was improvised. For the purpose of the documentary the musicians performed apart in the huge empty factory, which Frith said \\"was great visually, but limited in other ways\\". In addition to appearing on the soundtrack of Touch the Sound, music from Frith and Glennie's performance in the sugar factory was later reworked and released by the pair on a CD in 2007 entitled The Sugar Factory. Riedelsheimer explained why he chose to create a film about Glennie: \\"I was so struck by her. What was amazing was not so much the music itself but the way she is in it. That finally became the subject – not music, but sound and the ability to feel the sounds around us.\\" He said that the \\"biggest challenge\\" of the project was to \\"transfer acoustics or sound ideas into images\\" and \\"to find images that are metaphors for these sounds\\". Riedelsheimer did not want to make a film about a deaf person who succeeds as a musician, he wanted a film about the physical nature of sound, something that can be felt, and Glennie was ideal to demonstrate it. The film took three years to make, one year to raise money, one year filming at 16 locations around the world, and another year editing the results in post- production. It was shot on 16 mm film with one microphone and one camera, and later blown up to 35 mm during editing. Synopsis Touch the Sound explores Evelyn Glennie's career as a musician and how, despite being profoundly deaf, she is able to perceive sounds other than with her ears. Glennie explains how a neurological disorder struck her as a child, and by the age of eight, soon after she had started to play the piano, she began to lose her hearing. When she was 13 an audiologist said it was no longer possible for her to play music and suggested she be moved to a school for the deaf. But Glennie remained at her school, and switched from piano to percussion, the vibrations of which, she discovered, she could sense with her sense of touch. Glennie developed this ability to feel sound and later went on to become \\"one of the world's foremost solo percussionists\\". In the film Glennie performs and is interviewed at several locations around the world. She visits the farm in Aberdeenshire, Scotland where she grew up, and reminisces on her childhood and how she overcame her hearing loss. She collaborates with English experimental musician Fred Frith in an abandoned sugar factory in Dormagen, Germany, as they record a CD together. She also plays snare drums in Grand Central Station in Manhattan, performs with Cuban percussionist Horacio \\"El Negro\\" Hernandez on a New York City rooftop, and performs with Ondekoza, a taiko drum troupe in Japan. Reception Touch the Sound was generally well received by critics, with Allmovie giving it four stars out of five, and scoring 75 at Metacritic.com. Boston Globe film critic Ty Burr called Touch the Sound \\"a documentary of immense and mysterious power\\" that enables us to hear what Glennie hears. Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan said the film is a \\"potent and imaginative creative biography\\" of Glennie that successfully conveys her perception of the world to audiences. He described the sugar factory improvisations as a \\"mesmerizing interplay of sounds\\", and called it the film's \\"central event\\". Film critic Stephen Holden writing in a review in The New York Times, called the film an \\"impressionistic documentary\\" and a \\"mystical exploration of the sensory world\\" of Glennie. Holden said the film is \\"a duet within a duet\\": Glennie's collaboration with Fred Frith, and her collaboration with filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer. Music critic Tim Page said in The Washington Post that Touch the Sound is \\"at its best\\" when Glennie is making music, but criticised the film for its \\"vacuous\\" interviews with her, who he felt, \\"seems positively incapable of saying anything substantial\\". Page also complained about the amount of filler in the film, and that \\"most of the music [is not] very good\\", although he did like Glennie's final collaboration with Frith where, after the \\"usual 'free jazz' shtick\\", they \\"suddenly [...] find a point of agreement\\". But Page did feel that Glennie's achievements are \\"little short of miraculous, and that human victory is ultimately the best news one takes away from Touch the Sound.\\" Awards Touch the Sound has won five awards. *2004 – \\"Best Documentary\\", BAFTA Awards, Scotland *2004 – \\"Golden Dove for Long Footage\\", Leipzig DOK Festival *2004 – \\"Critics Week Award\\", Locarno International Film Festival *2005 – \\"Special Mention for Best Documentary\\", Bangkok International Film Festival *2005 – \\"Film Award in Gold for Best Sound\\", German Film Awards Soundtrack A soundtrack of Touch the Sound by Evelyn Glennie was released on CD in 2004.

In September 1998 a new jingle package composed by David Arnold was introduced and the 'FM' suffix was dropped from the station name. Shortly afterwards separate breakfast and drivetime programmes for Oxfordshire and Berkshire were introduced. The merged station was not popular with listeners, and in August 1999, as part of the BBC South East Review, it was announced that BBC Radio Oxford and BBC Radio Berkshire would regain their own identities. The two stations relaunched on 14 February 2000, although their programme schedules remained unchanged, most output continuing to be shared. However, by 2004 the two stations' schedules had become fully separated.

It was the last BBC Local Radio station to launch which covered a previously unserved area. It operated as an opt-out station from BBC Radio Devon for around 23 hours a week. History BBC Dorset FM emerged after plans for a full-time station for Dorset were cancelled in 1990, as part of a series of measures designed to save £3 million. Dorset FM opened on 26 April 1993, broadcasting to west and central Dorset on 103.8 FM from its transmitter on Bincombe Hill. The station produced three-and-a-half hours of its own programming each weekday - Good Morning Dorset from 0630-0900, and Dorset Newshour from 1200-1300. In addition there were three hours of programmes on Saturday and two hours on Sunday. The remainder of the station's output was relayed from BBC Radio Devon. In early 1996 BBC Dorset FM closed, and was replaced on 103.8 FM by a relay of BBC Radio Solent, albeit with a news and information service tailored to rural Dorset. The Dorchester studio became a district office of Radio Solent. Planned relaunch By 2004 the BBC were proposing a series of new BBC local radio stations, including one for Dorset. However, as a part of a series of cutbacks announced in October 2007, plans for the station were abandoned. The Dorset Broadcasting Action Group continues to campaign for the introduction of a separate station for Dorset. Thanks to continued pressure on the BBC by the Dorset Broadcasting Action Group (DorBAG), the BBC finally launched a new dedicated Dorset Breakfast programme on 8 July 2013. This is now an opt-out from BBC Radio Solent on 103.8FM using the transmitter at Bincombe Hill and, more recently on several DAB transmitters but neither FM nor DAB reach most of West Dorset. It transmits from 0630 to 0900 weekdays. However, it is also available online and on Freeview chan 734. The reporting/editorial team based in the Dorchester studio create and run the programme. The remainder of the broadcasts each day are Radio Solent material that covers the whole BBC Radio Solent region. It is worth emphasising however, that the major limiting factor is the coverage of the Bincombe Hill/DAB transmitters which effectively only reach mid/south Dorset, leaving much of the county still uncovered. The BBC has agreed with DorBAG that the ultimate aim is to extend the programme to cover the whole county. This may require additional transmitters which is under discussion between the BBC and DorBAG.

Their motives for helping Blake to escape were their belief that his 42-year sentence was \\"inhuman\\" and a personal liking of Blake. Life He was born in Limerick into a large family. Actor Richard Harris was his second cousin and poet Desmond O'Grady was his first cousin. As a boy of 12, Bourke was sentenced to three years in Daingean reformatory in October 1947 for stealing bananas from a lorry.Michael Byrne, Daingean Reformatory , Offaly Historical and Archaeological Society, 9 January 2007 Subsequently, he trained as a bricklayer, but was frequently in trouble with the law, in part due to his alcoholism. Having moved to Britain, in 1961 he was convicted of sending an explosive device through the post to a Detective Constable Michael Sheldon, against whom he bore a grudge. The bomb exploded, but caused no injury.Michael Mok, \\"The Irish 'Who' in a British Whodunnit\\", Life, 24 Jan 1969, pp.59–60 He was sentenced to seven years in prison.Rosamund M. Thomas, Espionage and Secrecy: The Official Secrets Acts 1911–1989 of the United Kingdom, Taylor & Francis, 1991 p.221. While in Wormwood Scrubs prison in London, he founded and edited the prison magazine, New Horizon. In this role he met George Blake, who wrote contributions for the magazine. Bourke also met anti-nuclear campaigners Randle and Pottle in the prison.Simon Gray, Cell Mates, 1995. =Escape= After his release, Bourke set about organising Blake's escape. The escape was masterminded by Bourke, who originally approached Michael Randle only for financial help. Randle, however, became more involved and suggested they bring Pottle in on the plan as well, as he had suggested springing Blake to Randle in 1962 when they were both still in prison. Bourke had smuggled a walkie- talkie to Blake to communicate with him whilst in jail. It was decided that Blake would break a window at the end of the corridor where his cell was located. Then between 6 and 7 pm, whilst most of the other inmates and guards were at the weekly film showing, Blake could climb through the window, slide down a porch and get to the perimeter wall, where Bourke would throw a rope ladder made of knitting needles over the wall so that Blake could climb over and they would then drive off to the safe house. Blake fell from the wall during his escape and broke his wrist. After a period lying low, Bourke and the others got Blake out of the country hidden in a van. He was taken to East Germany. Shortly afterwards, Bourke joined Blake in Moscow, where he lived for a year and a half on a special 'pension' provided by the Russians. However, he disliked Russia and so returned to Ireland, where he was interviewed on television. This segment appears to intercut a 1968 interview with a British documentary and with a later RTÉ interview in which the interviewer appear to be Mike Murphy. The British documentary includes a recording which Burke made of a two-way radio conversation he had with Blake inside the prison, on 18 October 1966, four days before the escape. Britain sought his extradition, but this was denied by the Irish courts on the grounds that arranging the escape was a political act.Extradition (Irish Republic), Hansard, 30 July 1982 An attempt to get him extradited on the separate charge of threatening the life of Detective Sheldon (in an abusive letter he had sent to the policemen) also failed. =Later life= After returning to Ireland, Bourke wrote The Springing of George Blake, an account of the escape.Sean Bourke, The Springing of George Blake, , 1970 He also wrote a number of articles, including a harrowing account of his time in Daingean reformatory, published in Old Limerick Journal in 1982. The United Kingdom tried to have him extradited, but the Supreme Court rejected this request in 1973, ruling that Bourke's aid of Blake's escape fell within the political offence exception to Ireland's extradition laws. He rapidly spent the money he had been given by the Soviet Union and his supporters. Some of it was squandered on alcohol, but some was given away. He also gave financial support to local politician Jim Kemmy of the Democratic Socialist Party.Raymond Smith, Garret, the enigma: Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, Aherlow, 1985, p.58. He ended up almost penniless, living in a caravan in Kilkee, suffering increasingly from alcohol-related health problems. He collapsed and died while walking down the road. The coroners gave his cause of death as \\"acute pneumenory odema, Coronary thrombosis\\". Former KGB officer Oleg Kalugin alleges otherwise, however, claiming that Bourke's death was the eventual result of a poisoning ordered by Aleksandr Sakharovsky.Oleg Kalugin, The First Directorate, St. Martin's Press, 1994, p.139-40. The drug administered so as to mimic the effects of a stroke and produce brain damage, mainly erase recent memory, to prevent Bourke revealing any intelligence material on return from Moscow to GB.http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/140977/My_32_years_in_intelligence.pdf In culture Sean Bourke appears as a character in Simon Gray's play Cell Mates, which tells the story of Blake's escape from Wormwood Scrubs and Bourke's subsequent visit to Moscow. In the original production Bourke was played by Rik Mayall. In the BBC Radio play \\"After the Break\\" by Ian Curteis his relationship with George Blake after the escape from Wormwood Scrubs is examined.

Life and work Blanes was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1830. He was raised by his mother, with whom he relocated to the countryside in his early teens. Blanes took an interest in drawing at this point, and shortly afterwards, was hired as an illustrator for a Montevideo newsdaily, El Defensor de la Independencia Americana. Earning extra income with watercolors, he returned to his mother and, in 1854, established his first atelier.Museo Blanes: Biografía He married María Linari, and in 1855, the couple settled in Salto, where he worked as a portrait painter. They relocated to Concepción del Uruguay (across the Uruguay River, in Argentina) in 1857, and Blanes was commissioned by Argentine President Justo José de Urquiza to complete a number of portraits, allegories and landscapes to grace his nearby estancia, the Palacio San José. Returning to Montevideo in 1861, the talented painter obtained a scholarship from the Uruguayan government, and with it, traveled with his family to Florence, Italy, where he studied under Antonio Ciseri until 1864. Oath of the Thirty- Three Orientales (1878) The experience became a valuable calling card for Blanes, who became one of Uruguay's most sought-after portraiteurs. The 1871 outbreak of a yellow fever epidemic in Buenos Aires inspired his first renowned work, which he exhibited to acclaim in the recovering city. His 1872 portrait of the Argentine War of Independence hero, General José de San Martín (The Review in Rancagua), was also a success in Buenos Aires, and Blanes was invited to Chile to display the historic depiction. =Works of Uruguayan national importance= Returning to Uruguay, Blanes undertook a portrait of the \\"Thirty-three Easterners,\\" members of a revolutionary vanguard whose insurrection against Brazilian authorities resulted in Uruguayan Independence, in 1828. The portrait's 1877 display was followed by Blanes' second stay in Florence, where he completed The Battle of Sarandí, a depiction of another milestone in Uruguay's nationhood. These works, and his bucolic portraits of life in his homeland did not garner the interest he expected in Italy, however, and the Blaneses returned to Montevideo in the early 1880s. Blanes resumed his portrait work, which remained popular among the local gentry. Among the most notable was a portrait of President Máximo Santos, commissioned by friends of the ruler as a gift. The most well known from this later period, however, was Artigas en la Ciudadela, an homage to one of Uruguay's most respected early patriots, José Gervasio Artigas. =Later life and legacy= This success was followed by the 1889 death of Blanes' wife, however, and he and his younger son, Nicanor, spent the next two years in Rome, where his elder son, Juan Luis, had settled. He returned to Uruguay alone, and continued to create historic and landscape art. A few years later, Juan Luis lost his life in an accident and in 1899, Nicanor disappeared in Pisa. Blanes hurried to the Tuscan city in hopes of locating his son, and a friend from a previous visit made him a guest in her house. Searching for nearly two years, the 70-year-old Blanes died in Ms. Manetti's Vía di Mezzo residence. The city of Montevideo established the Municipal Museum of Fine Arts, and named it in his honor, in 1930; many of his best-known works are also displayed in the National Museum of Visual Arts. Washington D.C.'s General José Gervasio Artigas statue, based on Blanes' portrait, was cast in bronze in Uruguay during World War II as a gift to the United States.

It is based on the Marvel Super Hero Squad action figure line from Hasbro, which portray the Avengers, the X-Men, and various other characters of the Marvel Universe in a cartoonish super-deformed style. The show is also a self-aware parody of the Marvel characters, with influences taken from on the comedic Mini Marvels series of parody comic books, in that the heroes tend to find themselves in comedic situations, and have cartoonish bents in comparison to their usually serious personalities (such as The Incredible Hulk being jovial and good-natured but with \\"major anger issues\\"), and is an overall comedic take on the Avengers. The series was produced by Film Roman and Marvel Animation. Plot=Season 1= Prior to the beginning of the series, the villainous Doctor Doom attempts to acquire the limitless reality-bending power of the \\"Infinity Sword\\" in pursuit of world domination. Iron Man foils his plan, but the sword is shattered in the process, creating numerous \\"fractals\\" that rain down on Super Hero City. Doctor Doom has since forged alliances with various supervillains, forming his Lethal Legion in order to hunt down the scattered fractals. Doom’s forces, including his two primary henchmen MODOK and Abomination, dwell in Villainville, which is separated from Super Hero City by a giant wall. Opposing Doom’s evil plan is Iron Man, now leading the elite team known as the Super Hero Squad, consisting of himself, Falcon, Hulk, Silver Surfer, Thor, and Wolverine. Marvel initially intended to put Spider- Man in at least one episode of the show, but Sony Pictures Entertainment ( who owned Spider-Man's television rights at the time) appears to have chosen not to allow it. However, Spider-Man appeared in Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Official Game Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game) games and other tie-ins. The Super Hero Squad is headquartered in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, and are frequently aided in their defense of Super Hero City by their boss Captain America, S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Ms. Marvel, rookie \\"Squaddie\\" and Wolverine's apprentice Reptil, and many more of their superhero friends. By the end of the first season, the Infinity Sword is reforged when the supersized giant Galactus arrives to devour the Earth. It is later revealed that the Infinity Sword can be wielded only by someone who wields The Infinity Gauntlet. Silver Surfer rejoins Galactus as his Herald and leaves the team with the Infinity Sword in his possession. As of the aftermath of the battle, Villainville is destroyed, and his henchmen are arrested, except for Doom, who flees. A video game called Marvel Super Hero Squad is made although Josh Keaton who plays Moon-Boy in the series, now played as Spider-Man. It included other people with the same voices as well. This video game is made by Blue Tongue Entertainment, Mass Media and Halfbrick Studios. =Season 2= A second season focuses on traveling to different parts of the Marvel Universe, the galaxy, different dimensions, and through time. Thanos becomes the main antagonist for the first half of the season, seeking the six Infinity Gems to prove his superiority to Nebula and gain supremacy over the universe. He eventually gains all six Infinity Gems. The squad's roster was changed in the season, due to Silver Surfer leaving the cast to once again become a herald of Galactus. Scarlet Witch replaces Surfer, with original squad members Iron Man, Hulk, Falcon, Wolverine and Thor returning. Thor receives his \\"chain armor\\" as a gift from his father Odin in the episode \\"Support your Local Sky-Father\\". In the second half of Season Two, the Silver Surfer, who was corrupted by the Infinity Sword steals the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos, takes over the universe, and transforms into the Dark Surfer, replacing Thanos as the main antagonist of the season. In the series finale, the Dark Surfer is defeated, the Infinity Stones and Infinity Sword are destroyed, and everything goes back to normal, though Silver Surfer has to pay his debt for what he did as Dark Surfer. The second season premiered in the United States on October 23, 2010, on Cartoon Network to coincide with the release of its video game follow-up, Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet. Episodes During the first season in the opening sequence of the show, there is a running sight gag similar to The Simpsons and The Fairly OddParents where the Hulk picks up an Infinity Fractal and is transformed by its power into something different every episode, such as the classic grey-colored Hulk, a toddler Hulk, a disco Hulk parodying John Travolta, a Hulked-out Wolverine, Bruce Banner, and a Hulk similar to Homer Simpson. This feature was removed in the second season. Additionally, each episode's title card is a homage to a classic comic book cover as are some of the episode titles.

It is sometimes known as \\"The Tale of the Buffoon\\", or simply \\"The Buffoon\\". There also exists a symphonic suite from the ballet, Op. 21 bis, which is much more often performed than the full ballet score. The original Russian-language full title was Сказка про шута, семерых шутов перешутившего (Skazka pro shuta, semerykh shutov pereshutivshevo), meaning \\"The Tale of the Buffoon who Outwits Seven Other Buffoons\\". The spelling \\"Chout\\" is a French romanization of the Russian word шут meaning \\"buffoon\\".  Background  Chout was Prokofiev's first completed ballet score for Sergei Diaghilev. Diaghilev had first commissioned Ala and Lolli but rejected the score submitted by Prokofiev. Although the composer recast some of the music as the Scythian Suite, the projected ballet never saw the light of day. Instead, Diaghilev asked Prokofiev to write a ballet based on a folk tale recorded by Alexander Afanasyev. The story had been previously suggested to Diaghilev by Igor Stravinsky as a possible subject for a ballet, and Diaghilev and his choreographer Léonide Massine helped Prokofiev to shape this into a ballet scenario. The story involves seven buffoons who all murder their wives after being told by an eighth buffoon that he has killed his own wife and brought her back to life with a magic whip and promises to do the same for them. When he fails to deliver on his promise, the other buffoons seek revenge. The principal buffoon is forced to disguise himself as a woman and is chosen for marriage by a wealthy merchant. He escapes after swindling the merchant out of 300 roubles.Classical Archives Prokofiev wrote the score in 1915. Although Diaghilev was again not happy with the music, this time he was prepared to work with the composer to recast it into six scenes and retain the best parts of the music already written. He also wanted new entr'actes to make the music play continuously. This Prokofiev did, but not until 1920. In the meantime, the ballet was not produced. He revised the score while staying at Mantes-sur-Seine near Paris. He wrote the piano reduction while travelling by ship to the United States and finished the full score in early 1921 after his return to France. He played through the score for Stravinsky in Paris, who liked it. Shortly afterwards, Diaghilev also approved the changes. Over 40 per cent of the original score was either deleted or rewritten, and the required additional entr'actes were composed.Stephen D. Press, Prokofiev’s Ballets for Diaghilev The first performance of the ballet was given by the Ballets Russes on 17 May 1921, at the Théâtre Municipal de la Gaîté, Paris, with choreography by Fyodor Slavinsky and supervision by Mikhail Larionov. The orchestra was conducted by the composer.The Prokofiev Page It was fairly well received, however the London premiere on 9 June was bitterly attacked by audiences and critics alike.  Structure  The structure of the ballet is: * Scene 1: The Buffoon's Kitchen * Entr'acte 1 * Scene 2: The Seven Clowns * Entr'acte 2 * Scene 3: The Buffoon's Courtyard * Entr'acte 3 * Scene 4: The Buffoon's Sitting Room * Entr'acte 4 * Scene 5: The Buffoon's Bedroom * Entr'acte 5 * Scene 6: In the Merchant's Garden  Suite  Although he initially thought that a symphonic suite of 12 movements would be too long, in 1922-23 Prokofiev arranged such a suite from the ballet, which was premiered in Brussels on 15 January 1924 under Frans Rühlmann. The suite consists of: # The Buffoon and His Wife # Dance of the Wives # Fugue. The Buffoons Kill Their Wives # The Buffoon as a Young Woman # Third Entr'acte # Dance of the Buffoons' Daughters # Entry of the Merchant and His Welcome # In the Merchant's Bedroom # The Young Woman Becomes a Goat # Fifth Entr'acte and the Goat's Burial # The Buffoon and the Merchant Quarrel # Final Dance. The 12 movements take 35–40 minutes to play (as compared to an hour for the full ballet). While neither the ballet nor the suite can be said to have found a large following, the suite is performed more often than the ballet. The ballet was only presented once in the Soviet Union, in January 1928 under the Ukrainian title Blazen at the Kiev Theatre of Opera and Ballet under A. S. Orlov. The music had to be reconstructed from the symphonic suite, minus the entr'actes, resulting in prolonged pauses. Other attempts to stage it in the Soviet Union failed – Prokofiev refused to allow any changes.Israel V. Nestyev, Prokofiev The suite has been recorded a number of times and has often been performed in concert, but it was not until the mid-1980s that Gennady Rozhdestvensky made the first recording of the entire music for the ballet.Answers.com ReferencesExternal links * Answers.com Ballets by Sergei Prokofiev 1921 ballet premieres 1915 compositions 1921 compositions Suites by Sergei Prokofiev ","title":"Chout"},{"id":"23833755","text":"Lada is a Slavic female given name.

History The metropolitan area was established on December 30, 1999 by the Complementary State Law number 27, and is the largest of Central-Western Brazil. It was the first metropolitan area of that region, since the Cuiabá metropolitan area was only established almost ten years later, on May 28, 2009. It is formed by the following municipalities: * Abadia de Goiás * Aparecida de Goiânia * Aragoiânia * Bela Vista de Goiás * Goiânia * Goianápolis * Goianira * Guapó * Hidrolândia * Nerópolis * Santo Antônio de Goiás * Senador Canedo * Trindade Demography Encompassing thirteen municipalities, Greater Goiânia has an area of 5,787 km2 (or 2,234 square miles). It is by far the most expressive region of the state of Goiás, containing around 35% of its total population, a third of its voters, about 80% of its college students, and 36,5% of its GDP. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, over two million people live on this metropolitan area, \\"Tabela 793 – População residente, em 1º de abril de 2007: Publicação Completa\\".

Rádio Paranaíba. October 24, 2008. Its Gini index is 65, while the goal for UN-Habitat is 40. If Goiânia was a country, it would be the second most unequal in the world, second only to Namibia. Goiânia follows a state trend, since Goiás reached its highest economic inequality index for the past decade in 2005. Both the state and its capital, however, do not follow the national trend, once Brazil has reached an all-time low inequality index in the past five years. According to Cecília Martinez, director of UN- Habitat's regional office for Latin America and the Caribbean, this happens because \\"public policies prioritize the richest areas in the city\\". According to her, there is a lack of \\"orderly planning\\" and \\"clear policies\\" to foster the development of poorer areas. For the 2010–2011 report, Goiânia remained as the most economically unequal city of Latin America, with a Gini index above 60.

Among all cities in the world analyzed by the UN-Habitat, Goiânia is behind only Buffalo City, Johannesburg, and Ekurhuleni, all three of them located in South Africa. =Human development= According to 2000 data by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the Greater Goiânia has a Human Development Index of 0.812, making it the 14th metropolitan area of Brazil in human development. With the dissolution of six metropolitan areas in 2007, however, it rose to the 9th position. The HDI of Greater Goiãnia is a little bit higher than the Brazilian average of 0.800. =Religion= The Greater Goiânia area has the least Roman Catholic population in all the state of Goiás.

Mansooruddin collected more than 5000 folksongs from different parts of Bengal. He compiled them in a series of volumes and the titled them after the name of a regular section of monthly literary magazine Probashi that was earmarked for publishing folk songs collected from rural areas. Haramoni literally means Lost Jewels. History of publication The first volume of Haramoni essentially an anthology of Baul songs, was published in 1931. Mansooruddin himself published this volume which was printed by Karim Box Brothers. Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote the preface of the book when its first volume was published. In 1942, the second volume was published by the Calcutta University. In 1948, Mansooruddin took initiative to publish the third volume of Haramoni. The University of Dhaka published the fourth volume in 1959. The manuscript contained 400 songs and as many as 300 of them got lost. The fourth volume contained many songs of Pagla Kanai. The fifth volume was edited by Professor Muhammad Abdul Hye and published by the Department of Bengali, Dhaka University, in 1961. It contained many songs of Lalon Fakir and Pagla Kanai. Again it is Mansooruddin who at his own initiative published the sixth volume of Haramoni in 1967. However, by then Bangla Academy had published the seventh volume in 1964. The sixth volume contained nearly two hundred songs of Lalon Fakir. The seventh contained about seven hundred songs many of which were collected from Sylhet area. Also there was some of Panjeri Shah or Panju Shah. Mansooruddin added an 84 pages long introduction to this volume that focused on the life of Hason Raja, Panju Shah, Shitalansha Shah, Arkum Shah, Monomhon, Radharaman, Dwija Das, Sheikh Bhanu, Qurban, Abdul Jabber, Madan Ganbi, Shah Mohammad Yasin, Ram Gopal, Kala Chand Pagla, Ananta Goshai and Abdul Wahed, among others. The eighth volume contained more than eight hundred songs collected from Kushtia, Faridpur, Pabna and Dhaka. It was published in 1976. It is the Bangla Academy that published the ninth volume in 1988. However, the tenth volume was already published in 1984. The 13th volume was published in 1984 by the Bangladesh Folklore Parishad. As many as eight more volumes remain to be published by the Bangla Academy, Dhaka. Contents Apart from Baul songs, Haramoni contains a huge number of rural songs of different categories like Meyeli gaan, Baro maishya and Deha Tatwa. One of the songs of Lalon Fakir, as sung by Premdasa Bairagi, appears in Haramoni as follows: মন আমার কি ছার গৌরব করছো ভবে! দেখ না রে সব হাওয়ার খেলা, হাওয়া বন্ধ হতে দেরী কি হবে? থাকতে হাওয়ার হাওয়াখানা মওলা বলে ডাক রসনা মহাকাল বসেছে রানায় কখন যেন কু ঘটাবে। বন্ধ হলে এ হাওয়াটী, মাটীর দেহ হবে মাটী দেখে শুনে হওনা খাঁটী মন! কে তোরে কত বুঝাবে।। ভবে আসার আগে যখন, বলেছিলে কর্ম সাধন লালন বলে সে কথা মন, ভুলেছো এই ভবের লোভে।।মুহম্মদ মনসুরউদ্দীন,‘শাহ লালন ফকিরের গান’, প্রবাসী, ফাল্গুন ১৩৩৩; References Bengali music ","title":"Haramoni"},{"id":"23833892","text":"The Niall Smullen Cup was a Gaelic football organised by Kildare Gaelic Athletic Association in Ireland.

The Irish surname derives from the Irish toponym Oirmhumhain 'East Munster' and was a hereditary title within the Irish aristocracy. See Earl of Ormonde (Irish). However, the Scottish Ormonds originate from the county of Angus, where the Douglas family held the title of Earl of Ormond, deriving from their ownership of Ormond Castle in Avoch, on the Black Isle in the Scottish Highlands. The Ormond surname is rumoured to have been taken up by an illegitimate son of the Earl in the 15th or 16th century. The earliest Ormond in Angus to feature on the parish records is Elspit Ormond, born 1617 in Monikie, the daughter of James Ormond. There is also an Ormond family in Pembrokeshire, Wales, which is of great antiquity. It is likely that they branched off from the aforementioned Irish Ormonds, rather than having a separate origin. The National Archives hold the Will of William Ormond of Pembrokeshire, which was written in 1610. The name can vary in spelling in old texts (as is typical of the English language generally). However the spelling Ormond is specific to the earldom, while Ormonde with an e is specific to the dukedom.

The polynomial ring is therefore the homogeneous coordinate ring of the projective space itself, and the variables are the homogeneous coordinates, for a given choice of basis (in the vector space underlying the projective space). The choice of basis means this definition is not intrinsic, but it can be made so by using the symmetric algebra. Formulation Since V is assumed to be a variety, and so an irreducible algebraic set, the ideal I can be chosen to be a prime ideal, and so R is an integral domain. The same definition can be used for general homogeneous ideals, but the resulting coordinate rings may then contain non-zero nilpotent elements and other divisors of zero. From the point of view of scheme theory these cases may be dealt with on the same footing by means of the Proj construction. The irrelevant ideal J generated by all the Xi corresponds to the empty set, since not all homogeneous coordinates can vanish at a point of projective space. The projective Nullstellensatz gives a bijective correspondence between projective varieties and homogeneous ideals I not containing J. Resolutions and syzygies In application of homological algebra techniques to algebraic geometry, it has been traditional since David Hilbert (though modern terminology is different) to apply free resolutions of R, considered as a graded module over the polynomial ring. This yields information about syzygies, namely relations between generators of the ideal I. In a classical perspective, such generators are simply the equations one writes down to define V. If V is a hypersurface there need only be one equation, and for complete intersections the number of equations can be taken as the codimension; but the general projective variety has no defining set of equations that is so transparent. Detailed studies, for example of canonical curves and the equations defining abelian varieties, show the geometric interest of systematic techniques to handle these cases. The subject also grew out of elimination theory in its classical form, in which reduction modulo I is supposed to become an algorithmic process (now handled by Gröbner bases in practice). There are for general reasons free resolutions of R as graded module over K[X0, X1, X2, ..., XN]. A resolution is defined as minimal if the image in each module morphism of free modules :φ:Fi → Fi − 1 in the resolution lies in JFi − 1, where J is the irrelevant ideal. As a consequence of Nakayama's lemma, φ then takes a given basis in Fi to a minimal set of generators in Fi − 1. The concept of minimal free resolution is well-defined in a strong sense: unique up to isomorphism of chain complexes and occurring as a direct summand in any free resolution. Since this complex is intrinsic to R, one may define the graded Betti numbers βi, j as the number of grade-j images coming from Fi (more precisely, by thinking of φ as a matrix of homogeneous polynomials, the count of entries of that homogeneous degree incremented by the gradings acquired inductively from the right). In other words, weights in all the free modules may be inferred from the resolution, and the graded Betti numbers count the number of generators of a given weight in a given module of the resolution. The properties of these invariants of V in a given projective embedding poses active research questions, even in the case of curves.David Eisenbud, The Geometry of Syzygies, (2005, ), pp. 5–8. There are examples where the minimal free resolution is known explicitly. For a rational normal curve it is an Eagon–Northcott complex. For elliptic curves in projective space the resolution may be constructed as a mapping cone of Eagon–Northcott complexes.Eisenbud, Ch. 6. Regularity The Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity may be read off the minimum resolution of the ideal I defining the projective variety. In terms of the imputed \\"shifts\\" ai, j in the i-th module Fi, it is the maximum over i of the ai, j − i; it is therefore small when the shifts increase only by increments of 1 as we move to the left in the resolution (linear syzygies only).Eisenbud, Ch. 4. Projective normality The variety V in its projective embedding is projectively normal if R is integrally closed. This condition implies that V is a normal variety, but not conversely: the property of projective normality is not independent of the projective embedding, as is shown by the example of a rational quartic curve in three dimensions.Robin Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry (1977), p. 23. Another equivalent condition is in terms of the linear system of divisors on V cut out by the dual of the tautological line bundle on projective space, and its d-th powers for d = 1, 2, 3, ... ; when V is non- singular, it is projectively normal if and only if each such linear system is a complete linear system.Hartshorne, p. 159. Alternatively one can think of the dual of the tautological line bundle as the Serre twist sheaf O(1) on projective space, and use it to twist the structure sheaf OV any number of times, say k times, obtaining a sheaf OV(k). Then V is called k-normal if the global sections of O(k) map surjectively to those of OV(k), for a given k, and if V is 1-normal it is called linearly normal. A non-singular variety is projectively normal if and only if it is k-normal for all k ≥ 1. Linear normality may also be expressed geometrically: V as projective variety cannot be obtained by an isomorphic linear projection from a projective space of higher dimension, except in the trivial way of lying in a proper linear subspace. Projective normality may similarly be translated, by using enough Veronese mappings to reduce it to conditions of linear normality. Looking at the issue from the point of view of a given very ample line bundle giving rise to the projective embedding of V, such a line bundle (invertible sheaf) is said to be normally generated if V as embedded is projectively normal. Projective normality is the first condition N0 of a sequence of conditions defined by Green and Lazarsfeld. For this :\\\\bigoplus_{d=0}^\\\\infty H^0(V, L^d) is considered as graded module over the homogeneous coordinate ring of the projective space, and a minimal free resolution taken. Condition Np applied to the first p graded Betti numbers, requiring they vanish when j > i + 1.See e.g. Elena Rubei, On Syzygies of Abelian Varieties, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 352, No. 6 (Jun., 2000), pp. 2569–2579. For curves Green showed that condition Np is satisfied when deg(L) ≥ 2g + 1 + p, which for p = 0 was a classical result of Guido Castelnuovo.Giuseppe Pareschi, Syzygies of Abelian Varieties, Journal of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Jul., 2000), pp. 651–664.

Pope Leo XIII himself called the solemn consecration \\"the greatest act of my pontificate\\".  Biography = Birth = Erbdrostenhof Palace (in Münster, Germany), the birthplace of Maria Droste. Maria Anna Johanna Franziska Theresia Antonia Huberta Droste zu Vischering was born with her twin brother Max (Maximilian Droste zu Vischering) on September 8, 1863, the solemnity feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the Erbdrostenhof Palace, in Münster, the capital city of Westphalia, Germany, as daughter of one of the wealthiest and noblest German families, which distinguished itself by its fidelity to the Catholic Church during the persecution of the Kulturkampf. Her parents were Klemens Heidenreich Franz Hubertus Eusebius Maria, the count Droste zu Vischering, and Helene Clementine Maria Anna Sybille Huberta Antonia, the countess of Galen. Because of the fragility of her health, Vischering was baptized immediately at birth. = Early years = Maria Droste zu Vischering spent her childhood with her family in the Castle of Darfeld, in Rosendahl near Münster, and was a child full of life. Her mother stated, \\"She doesn't mind her dress. She is running into the mud, jumping into the wet grass and the bushes until she is so dirty that she has to change every stitch\\".\\"Maria Droste Zu Vischering\\", Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd Castle of Darfeld, where Maria Droste zu Vischering spent her childhood. Vischering was taught at home by governesses. On April 25, 1875, Vischering and her brother Max received their First Communion. In April 1879, Vischering continued her education at the boarding school of the Sacré-Coeur Sisters in Riedenburg, in Bavaria. While there, she heard a homily on Psalm 45: \\"Listen, my daughter,... forget your father's house..., the king will fall in love with your beauty\\". Vischering decided that she should become a religious. During the spring of 1879, while she was listening to a particular devotion of one of the sisters to the Heart of Christ, Maria Droste zu Vischering reached an important conclusion: \\"I began to understand that without the spirit of sacrifice the love of the Heart of Jesus is merely an illusion\\". While at school, she contracted pneumonia and, shortly before her 18th birthday, returned home to recover. In 1883, at the chapel of the Castle of Darfeld, Vischering is said to have had an interior locution of Jesus Christ who told her: \\"Thou shalt be the wife of My Heart\\". On 5 August of that same year, on the Silver Jubilee of her parents' marriage, Vischering told them of her desire to become a religious. = Religious life = Sisters of the Good Shepherd in Porto, Portugal (1896). In 1888, she visited with her mother the Hospital of Darfeld and there found a girl who had given scandal. Maria Droste zu Vischering reached out to the unfortunate. That episode can be considered her first contact with the charism of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. In the parish church, a short time later, she heard again the voice of Jesus, who told her: \\"You must enter in the Convent of the Good Shepherd\\". On 21 November 1888, at the age of 25, Maria Droste zu Vischering joined the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd. After she received the white religious habit of the religious congregation, Vischering also received the name that became for her a program of life: Sister Mary of the Divine Heart. For Maria Droste zu Vischering, the devotion to the Heart of Christ always merged with the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament: \\"I could never separate the devotion to the Heart of Jesus from the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, and I will never be able to explain how and how much the Sacred Heart of Jesus deigned to favor me in the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist\\". In 1891, she devoted herself to the girls sent to the Good Shepherd Sisters in Münster for rehabilitation and care. With an ardent love for youth ministry, she maintained that \\"the most needy, the most miserable, the most forsaken are the children I love best\\". Vischering spent only five years in Münster because she was called by obedience to a special mission. In 1894, at the age of 31, she was transferred to Portugal, where she was initially sent as assistant of the Mother Superior of the Convent of the Good Shepherd Sisters in Lisbon. From February to May 1894, she remained in the Portuguese capital but then was appointed to the position of Mother Superior of the Convent of the Good Shepherd Sisters in Porto. In Porto, Vischering reported several messages from Jesus Christ in which she was asked to contact the Pope to request the consecration of the world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. = World Consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus = Painting representing the vision received by Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering. Jesus had revealed her, \\"By the brightness of this light, peoples and nations will be illumined, and they will be warmed by its ardour\\". On June 10, 1898, her confessor at the Good Shepherd monastery wrote to Pope Leo XIII to state that Vischering had received a message from Christ requesting the Pope to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart. The Pope initially did not believe her and took no action. However, on January 6, 1899, she wrote another letter asking that in addition to the consecration, the first Fridays of the month be observed in honour of the Sacred Heart. In the letter, she also referred to the recent illness of the Pope and stated that Christ had assured her that Pope Leo XIII would live until he had performed the consecration to the Sacred Heart. The theologian Laurent Volken states that this had an emotional impact on Leo XIII, despite the theological issues concerning the consecration of non- Christians.Laurent Volken, 1963, Visions, Revelations and the Church P.J. Kenedy PublishersNiels Christian Hvidt, 2007, Christian Prophecy: The Post- Biblical Tradition, OUP Press p. 242 Pope Leo XIII commissioned an inquiry on the basis of her revelation and church tradition. In his 1899 encyclical letter Annum sacrum, he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on June 11, 1899. In the encyclical, he referred to the illness about which Vischering had written: \\"There is one further reason that urges us to realize our design: We do not want it to pass by unnoticed. It is personal in nature but just as important: God the author of all Good has saved us by healing us recently from a dangerous disease\\".Annum sacrum in Vatican official website. Pope Leo XIII also composed the Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart and included it in the encyclical. Pope Pius X later decreed for the consecration of the human race, performed by Pope Leo XIII, to be renewed each year.EWTN Convent of the Good Shepherd in Porto. = Death and incorruptibility = Death of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering in the Convent of the Good Shepherd in Porto, Portugal (1899). Vischering died on June 8, 1899, the feast of the Sacred Heart (properly, the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus), three days before the world consecration, which had been deferred to the following Sunday. Vischering's incorrupt body is exposed for public veneration in the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Ermesinde, in northern Portugal. The church is adjacent to the Convent of the Good Shepherd Sisters.Civil Parish of Ermesinde - The Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus There is also a relic of her body exposed for public veneration at the Sanctuary of Christ the King in Almada, near Lisbon, Portugal. = Veneration = In 1964, Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, the countess of Droste zu Vischering, officially received the title of venerable by the Catholic Church. On November 1, 1975, she was declared blessed by Pope Paul VI. Doctor Waldery Hilgeman is the postulator of the cause of canonisation.  Promises of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  In His revelations to Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus is said to have revealed to her two promises: = Promise of obtaining graces through the intercession of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart = Tomb-reliquary of Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart inside the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Ermesinde). \\"Know this, My daughter, that by the charity of My Heart I desire to pour out floods of graces through your heart over the hearts of others. This is why people will get close to you with confidence. ...No one, even the most hardened sinner, will leave your presence without having received, in one way or another, consolation, relief, or a special grace.\\"Letter from Sister Mary of the Divine Heart dated June 23, 1897, in Autobiography of Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart, Religious of the Good Shepherd. Lisbon: Edition of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, 1993. = Promise of obtaining graces in the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Ermesinde = The Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Ermesinde, Portugal. \\"For a long time, as you know, I have wanted to build a church on the Good Shepherd property. Uncertain as to whom this church should be dedicated, I have prayed and consulted many people without reaching a decision. On the First Friday of this month, I asked Our Lord to enlighten me. After the Holy Communion, He said to me: I desire that the church be consecrated to My Heart. You must erect here a place of reparation; from My part I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house [the Convent], those who live here now, those who will live here after, and even to the people of their relations. Then He told me that He wished this church, above all, to be a place of reparation for sacrileges and to obtain graces for the clergy.\\"Letter from Sister Mary of the Divine Heart dated August 13, 1897, in Autobiography of Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart, Religious of the Good Shepherd.

Wartime career A police officer in the Hungarian gendarmerie, by 1942 Képíró was serving in the Hungarian-occupied region of Bačka, in Yugoslavia, which had been transferred to Hungary as a result of the Axis invasion and partition of Yugoslavia. In January 1942 raids were conducted in several parts in the region, including Novi Sad, and an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 civilians, mostly Serbs and Jews, were rounded up and killed. Képíró took part in this rounding up and later admitted playing that part in the affair. In 1944 he was put on trial, with fourteen other Hungarian army and police officers, accused of taking part in the raids. The court found that he had been implicated in the round-up, but he was not severely punished.Most Wanted Nazis Later events In 1948, the post-war Communist authorities in Hungary took Képíró's case back to court in his absence, relying on the evidence of a man called János Nagy, who claimed to have been a member of Képíró's platoon in 1942. Képíró later claimed that he had never heard of Nagy, but was found guilty and sentenced in his absence to fourteen years' imprisonment. It was later found that the testimony of Nagy had been obtained under torture by the communist secret service. Képíró stayed away from Budapest until 1996, when after the fall of the communist government he quietly returned home and was not identified with the man convicted in 1948. Final allegations and trial Képíró at his criminal trial, Budapest. In September 2006, Efraim Zuroff of the Wiesenthal Center identified Képíró and publicly accused him of war crimes, relying on the court verdicts from the 1940s. Responding to the accusations, Képíró said that he had been a junior police officer at the time and that he had been involved in the round up of civilians, but had taken no active part in the executions, which were carried out by soldiers. Képíró also said he had been unwilling to take part in anything unlawful. He commented \\"I was the only one who asked for a written command. At the time of the massacre I was reluctant. Prove that I was a war criminal.\\" The 1944 verdict provided by the Wiesenthal Center, however, stated that despite Képíró's request for written orders, he had participated in the massacre, even though no written orders were given. Hungarian military prosecutors stated that the verdicts were no longer valid and that a new investigation would need to be reopened, which might take years. On 14 September 2009, Képíró was taken in for questioning by the Hungarian police. However, the charges made against him were later abandoned, due to lack of evidence. In 2007 Képíró accused Efraim Zuroff of libel and initiated criminal proceedings against him in a Budapest court. The trial opened in October 2010, but was dismissed two months later on the basis of the verdict of the wartime court in 1944.Hungary Nazi Trial at BBC.co.uk and because of Képíró's failure to appear in court.Hungary: Court rejects libel suit against Efraim Zuroff On 14 February 2011, Hungarian prosecutors formally charged Képíró with war crimes. The case came to trial on 18 July 2011, when he was found not guilty by a Budapest court.Hungary Nazi war crimes suspect Sandor Kepiro acquitted After the not guilty verdict, László Karsai, the leading Hungarian Holocaust historian and son of a Holocaust survivor, said: \\"Honestly, I wish Zuroff would stop doing what he's doing. I mean: with this kind of methods he uses, with so little evidence, he tries to drag people through the mire. This can't be done to anyone, can't be done even to a former gendarmerie officer either.” Karsai accused Zuroff of being a hysterical, narcissistic Nazi-hunter, working only to earn a good living, and claimed that the Wiesenthal Center made such a publicity to the case in order to justify its own existence before the sponsors.Magyar Hírlap - Megbukott a nácivadászIndex.hu - Felmentették Képíró Sándort Képíró died in a hospital in Budapest at the age of 97. His death was reported by his family, and his lawyer, who said he believed the trial in the summer had contributed to his client's poor health.Hungary Nazi war crimes suspect Sandor Kepiro dead Zuroff said on his Facebook page, \\"our only consolation is that the trial has negatively affected Képíró's health.\\" Until 2011, Képíró was on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals.

On 26 January 1871, they sent representation to a meeting of twenty-one London and suburban football clubs that followed Rugby School rules (Wasps were invited by failed to attend) assembled at the Pall Mall Restaurant in Cockspur Street. E.C. Holmes, captain of the Richmond Club assumed the presidency. It was resolved unanimously that the formation of a Rugby Football Society was desirable and thus the Rugby Football Union was formed. A president, a secretary and treasurer, and a committee of thirteen were elected, to whom was entrusted the drawing-up of the laws of the game upon the basis of the code in use at Rugby School. Although Mohicans was considered prominent enough to have been invited, they did not gain any of the thirteen places on the original committee.Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p68, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) The club played its football at the Battenham Road, Lower Edmonton.
