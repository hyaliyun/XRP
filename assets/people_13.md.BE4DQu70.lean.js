History First called GIL (Initiative and Liberty Groups), it was established in March 1981 and became the Initiative and Liberty Movement on November 17, 1981. It was chaired by Jacques Rougeot, who was close to the Rally for the Republic (RPR) and president of the National Inter-University Union (UNI). General Alain de Boissieu, Pierre Messmer and Jacques Foccart also participated in its establishment. The MIL was born before the victory of the left in 1981. It tried \\"to prevent that, after having seized political power, the socialist-communists definitely put their hands on and minds on the structures of France\\", according to its terms. As Pierre Debizet said on TF1 on July 25, 1985, the MIL does not consider itself officially as a \\"resurgence\\" of the Service d'Action Civique (SAC). From 1986 on, its new cause was to liberate France from the \\"socialist stagnation\\". Pierre Debizet compared, in 1985, socialism to AIDS. However, the MIL struggled to take off, though it had several thousand members, including Alain Peyrefitte and the former Chief of Staff of the Army, General Jean Delaunay. Yet one thing was certain: despite low name recognition, everybody on the right knew the MIL. About the ideas of MIL in the 1980s, the historian François Audigier said: \\"The MIL is a kind of ideological laboratory, which crossed the diverse influences of the liberal right, a reactionary Catholicism and a rigid Gaullism. It used an anti-immigration, pro-life, defense of private schools and the rejection of left-wing values, a package that had nothing to envy to the National Front's program\\".Histoire du S.A.C. La part d'ombre du gaullisme, éd. Stock, 2003, p. 488 Today The MIL, now chaired by Christian Labrousse, who claims to be on the \\"civic right\\" a Gaullist and a patriot. Its emblem is the Cross of Lorraine. This movement is associated to the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). It is part of the UMP's right-wing and is a \\"Gaullist loyalist\\" organization as opposed to neo-Gaullism, which integrates neoliberalism and moderate centre-right ideas. The MIL is a \\"movement of thought\\" out of defending the common civic values (primacy of individual freedom, responsibility, duty and cohesion of society). Gaullism is for the MIL an inspiration. He considers that communitarianism, immigration and Islamism threaten the national identity of France, and that resistance is a civic duty.

Early life Payne was born in 1815 in Westmoreland County, Virginia.Batterson, 161 He was the son of John Payne and Francis (Morris) Payne, both of Virginia. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1833 and from the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1836. Following his graduation, Payne was ordained deacon on July 17, 1836 at Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. He married Anna Matilda Barroll in 1837, and they both spent the next five years as missionaries in Africa, primarily serving the colony of African-American ex-slaves living around Cape Palmas.Moran, 39 Payne returned in 1841 to be ordained priest. Missionary bishop On July 11, 1851, Payne was consecrated Bishop of Cape Palmas and Parts Adjacent in West Africa. He was the 52nd bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated by Bishops William Meade, Alfred Lee, and John Johns. He spent the next twenty years in Liberia, before returning to the United States in ill health in 1871.Batterson, 162 During Payne's tenure, the Episcopal Church built five churches, two asylums, and a hospital, and ordained twenty priests.Burrowes, 77 As an outgrowth of Payne's suggestion that a theology school be built in Liberia, the Liberian legislature incorporated Liberia College in 1851.Starr, 170 During his time as bishop, Payne's wife died and he remarried, in 1858, to Martha Jane Williford of Georgia, another missionary. He returned to the United States in ill health for the 1871 General Convention, and the House of Bishops accepted his resignation. His successor, John Gottlieb Auer, was duly consecrated and traveled to Cape Palmas, but the same record of the 1874 General Convention that memorialized Bishop Payne's death in 1874 also marked Bishop Auer's consecration in 1873 and death in Cape Palmas the following February. Death and legacy Bishop Payne had the home he constructed after his first wife Anna's death, \\"Cavalla,\\" dismantled, shipped to, and rebuilt in his native Westmoreland County, where he died. His grave was moved to the Virginia Theological Seminary (VTS) graveyard when it was constructed shortly thereafter, after the death of bishop John Johns, another distinguished alumnus. In 1878, a divinity school was established in Petersburg, Virginia to train African Americans as Episcopalian clerics, and upon its chartering by the Commonwealth in 1884, named after the late bishop. The school was ultimately merged with VTS, with which it had always maintained an affiliation. Its buildings in Petersburg closed in 1949, although now commemorated with a state historical marker. The VTS library is also now named in Bishop Payne's honor, and a section of its archives specializes in the history of African Americans in the Episcopal Church.

Wings of Defeat, broadcast on the PBS Independent Lens series in May 2009, was awarded the 2009 Erik Barnouw Award by the Organization of American Historians. In Japan, World War II Kamikaze are still revered as self- sacrificing heroes. Internationally, they remain a potent symbol of fanaticism. In astonishingly candid interviews, four former Kamikaze reveal that they were neither suicidal nor fanatical. The film reveals they were young men sentenced to death by a military that could not admit defeat. In heartbreaking testimony corroborated with rare archival footage, they tell us about their dramatic survival and their survivors’ guilt. This riveting, seamlessly edited film is an emotionally charged and timely exposé, probing the responsibilities that a government at war has to its people and its soldiers. Wings of Defeat features interviews with four trained kamikaze pilots, including three who took off to attack the U.S. fleet off the coast of Okinawa in the spring of 1945 as well as exclusive interviews with surviving American Navy veterans of the USS Drexler, a destroyer sunk by two kamikaze pilots. The American veterans illustrate the enduring trauma of the suicide attacks. The film features commentary by John W.

History The congregation was founded in 1861, when the more traditional Jews of Detroit withdrew from Temple Beth El. Shaarey Zedek was a founding member of the Conservative United Synagogue of America in 1913. The congregation worshipped in a building at the intersection of Congress and St. Antoine streets in Detroit from its founding until 1877, when on the same site, it erected an elaborate Moorish Revival edifice with tall, twin towers topped with Onion domes. It was the first purpose-built synagogue in the Detroit area and the first of no fewer than five synagogue buildings that the congregation would build within the space of a century. In 1903, the members having moved to a more fashionable neighborhood northeast of downtown, the congregation erected a new structure topped with an octagonal dome at the intersection of Winder and Brush streets. In 1913, Shaarey Zedek again followed its increasingly prosperous congregants north and moved into a spacious, new, domed Neo-classical synagogue building at Willis and Brush street where it would remain until 1930, when it moved to rented quarters. In 1932, the congregation again followed the movement of the congregants to a more suburban location on the city's northwest side, completed yet another new building. It was a Romanesque Revival sanctuary at 2900 West Chicago Boulevard at Lawton Street, designed by the noted architect Albert Kahn. The building is now the home of the Clinton Street Greater Bethlehem Temple Church. The congregation moved to its present building on Bell Road in suburban Southfield in 1962. The congregation's present, Southfield building was designed by Percival Goodman. Henry Stoltzman writes that it \\"embod(ies) Goodman's work at the peak of his career.\\" The San Francisco Examiner named the building one of the \\"top 10 breathtaking places of worship\\" in the United States.

The technique has been used for the purpose of evaluating neuromuscular diseases both for their diagnosis and for their ongoing assessment of progression or with therapeutic intervention. Muscle composition and microscopic structure change with disease, and EIM measures alterations in impedance that occur as a result of disease pathology. EIM has been specifically recognized for its potential as an ALS biomarker (also known as a biological correlate or surrogate endpoint) by Prize4Life, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the discovery of treatments and cures for ALS. The $1M ALS Biomarker Challenge focused on identifying a biomarker precise and reliable enough to cut Phase II drug trials in half. The prize was awarded to Dr. Seward Rutkove, chief, Division of Neuromuscular Disease, in the Department of Neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, for his work in developing the technique of EIM and its specific application to ALS. It is hoped that EIM as a biomarker will result in the more rapid and efficient identification of new treatments for ALS. EIM has shown sensitivity to disease status in a variety of neuromuscular conditions, including radiculopathy, inflammatory myopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy. In addition to the assessment of neuromuscular disease, EIM also has the prospect of serving as a convenient and sensitive measure of muscle condition. Work in aging populations and individuals with orthopedic injuries indicates that EIM is very sensitive to muscle atrophy and disuse and is conversely likely sensitive to muscle conditioning and hypertrophy. Work on mouse and rats models, including a study of mice on board the final Space Shuttle mission (STS-135), has helped to confirm this potential value.  Underlying concepts  Interest in electrical impedance dates back to the turn of the 20th century, when physiologist Louis Lapicque postulated an elementary circuit to model membranes of nerve cells. Scientists experimented with variations on this model until 1940, when Kenneth Cole developed a circuit model that accounted for the impedance properties of both cell membranes and intracellular fluid. Like all impedance-based methods, EIM hinges on a simplified model of muscle tissue as an RC circuit. This model attributes the resistive component of the circuit to the resistance of extracellular and intracellular fluids, and the reactive component to the capacitive effects of cell membranes. The integrity of individual cell membranes has a significant effect on the tissue's impedance; hence, a muscle's impedance can be used to measure the tissue's degradation in disease progression. In neuromuscular disease, a variety of factors can influence the compositional and micro structural aspects of muscle, including most notably muscle fiber atrophy and disorganization, the deposition of fat and connective tissues, as occurs in muscular dystrophy, and the presence of inflammation, among many other pathologies. EIM captures these changes in the tissue as a whole by measuring its impedance characteristics across multiple frequencies and at multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. In EIM, impedance is separated into resistance and reactance, its real and imaginary components. From this, one can compute the muscle's phase, which represents the time-shift that a sinusoid undergoes when passing through the muscle. For a given resistance (R) and reactance (X), phase (θ) can be calculated. In current work, all three parameters appear to play important roles depending exactly on which diseases are being studied and how the technology is being applied. EIM can also be impacted by the thickness of the skin and subcutaneous fat overlying a region of muscle. However, electrode designs can be created that can circumvent the effect to a large extent and thus still provide primary muscle data. Moreover, the use of multifrequency measurements can also assist with this process of disentangling the effects of fat from those of muscle. From this information, it also becomes possible to infer/calculate the approximate amount of fat overlying a muscle in a given region.  Multifrequency measurements  Both resistance and reactance depend on the input frequency of the signal. Because changes in frequency shift the relative contributions of resistance (fluid) and reactance (membrane) to impedance, multifrequency EIM may allow a more comprehensive assessment of disease. Resistance, reactance, or phase can be plotted as a function of frequency to demonstrate the differences in frequency dependence between healthy and diseased groups. Diseased muscle exhibits an increase in reactance and phase with increasing frequency, while reactance and phase values of healthy muscle increase with frequency until 50–100 kHz, at which point they begin to decrease as a function of frequency. Frequencies ranging from 500 Hz to 2 MHz are used to determine the frequency spectrum for a given muscle.  Muscle anisotropy  Electrical impedance of muscle tissue is anisotropic; current flowing parallel to muscle fibers flows differently from current flowing orthogonally across the fibers. Current flowing orthogonally across a muscle encounters more cell membranes, thus increasing resistance, reactance, and phase values. By taking measurements at different angles with respect to muscle fibers, EIM can be used to determine the anisotropy of a given muscle. Anisotropy tends to be shown either as a graph plotting resistance, reactance, or phase as a function of angle with respect to the direction of muscle fibers or as a ratio of transverse (perpendicular to fibers) measurement to longitudinal measurement (parallel to muscle fibers) of a given impedance factor. Muscle anisotropy also changes with neuromuscular disease. EIM has shown a difference between anisotropy profiles of neuromuscular disease patients and healthy controls. In addition, EIM can use anisotropy to discriminate between myopathic and neurogenic disease. Different forms of neuromuscular disease have unique anisotropies. Myopathic disease is characterized by decreased anisotropy. Neurogenic disease produces a less predictable anisotropy. The angle of lowest phase may be shifted from the parallel position, and the anisotropy as a whole is often greater than that of a healthy control.  Measurement approaches  In general, to apply the technique, a minimum of four surface electrodes are placed over the muscle of interest. A minute alternating current is applied across the outer two electrodes, and voltage signals are recorded by the inner electrodes. The frequency of the applied current and the relationship of the electrode array to the major muscle fiber direction is varied so that a full multifrequency and multidirectional assessment of the muscle can be achieved. EIM has been performed with a number of different impedance analysis devices. Commercially available systems used for bioimpedance analysis, can be calibrated to measure impedance of individual muscles. A suitable impedance analyzer can also be custom built using a lock-in amplifier to produce the signal and a low- capacitance probe, such as the Tektronix P6243, to record voltages from the surface electrodes. Such methods, however, are slow and clumsy to apply given the need for careful electrode positioning over a muscle of interest and the potential for misalignment of electrodes and inaccuracy. Accordingly, an initial hand-held system was constructed using multiple components with an electrode head that could be placed directly on the patient. The device featured an array of electrode plates, which could be selectively activated to perform impedance measurements in arbitrary orientations. The oscilloscopes were programmed to produce a compound sinusoid signal, which could be used to measure the impedance at multiple frequencies simultaneously via a Fast Fourier transform. Since that initial system was created, other handheld commercial systems are being developed, such as Skulpt, for use in both neuromuscular disease assessment and for fitness monitoring, including the calculation of a muscle quality (or MQ) value. This latter value aims to provide an approximate assessment of the relative force-generating capacity of muscle for a given cross-sectional area of tissue. Muscle quality, for example, is a measure used in the assessment of sarcopenia.  Comparison with standard bioelectrical impedance analysis  Standard bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), like EIM, also employs a weak, high frequency electric current to measure characteristics of the human body. In standard BIA, unlike EIM, electric current is passed between electrodes placed on the hands and feet, and the impedance characteristics of the entire current path are measured. Thus, the measured impedance characteristics are relatively nonspecific since they encompass much of the body including the entire length of the extremities, the chest, abdomen and pelvis; accordingly, only summary whole- body measures of lean body mass and % fat can be offered. Moreover, in BIA, current travels the path of least resistance, and thus any factors that alter the current path will cause variability in the data. For example, the expansion of large vessels (e.g., veins) with increasing hydration will offer a low-resistance path, and thus distorting the resulting data. In addition, changes in abdominal contents will similarly alter the data. Body position can also have substantial effects, with joint position contributing to variations in the data. EIM, in contrast, measures only the superficial aspects of individual muscles and is relatively unaffected by body or limb position or hydration status. The differences between EIM and standard BIA were exemplified in one study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which showed that EIM was effectively able to track progression in 60 ALS patients whereas BIA was not.

Such rules \\"insist that a particular result can be achieved only if the text (and not legislative history) says so in no uncertain terms.\\" Popkin, Statutes in Court 201 (1999). Such rules are commonly applied in areas implicating the structural constitution, such as federalism - sovereign immunity or preemption, for example - where there is a strong interest against implicit abridgment of traditional understandings. For example, while Congress can abrogate the states' sovereign immunity in some situations, see Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996); Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), it cannot do so implicitly: it must \\"mak[e] its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\\" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985). Preemption is another area susceptible to clear statement rules. Congress may preempt a field of regulation, \\"occup[ying] a field[ and] leaving no room for any claim under state law,\\" Pollit v. Health Care Service Corp., 558 F.3d 615 (7th Cir. 2009), but it doesn't have to. When a law is construed to preempt, the result is a broad and indiscriminate extinguishment of substantive and remedial state law, and sensitive to this problem, \\"the Court has on occasion\\"--Wyeth v. Levine, for example—expressed support for a clear statement rule: it will find preemption only when Congress expresses preemptive intent clearly in the statute.\\" Kendall, Redefining Federalism 49 (2005). Some argue that Chief Justice John Marshall imposed such a rule: \\"where fundamental values were at stake, statutes would not be interpreted to impair such values, absent a clear statement in the legislation,\\" Popkin, at 73, and the court more recently applied a similar approach in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006).https://ssrn.com/abstract=922406http://works.bepress.com/johnyoo/35/ Similarly, a clear statement rule governs exceptions to the rule that legislation must be considered as addressed to the future, not to the past.\\" Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149, 160 (1964). Because \\"statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored,\\" and is in many instances forbidden by the ex post facto clause of the Constitution, see Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994), \\"[a]bsent a clear statement from Congress that an amendment should apply retroactively, we presume that it applies only prospectively to future conduct, at least to the extent that it affects substantive rights, liabilities, or duties.\\" United States v. Seale, 542 F.3d 1033 (5th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, \\"a requirement that Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.\\" Such rules do, therefore, have some life in the area of substantive rights as well as enforcement of constitutional structure. The court does not apply clear statement rules in all areas, however. In many cases, the court has found \\"implied\\" prohibitions and causes of action in statutes, a result that would be precluded (or at least hampered) by clear statement rules. For example, Title IX prohibits gender discrimination by recipients of federal education funding. Does that bare prohibition also provide an implied cause of action to an individual so discriminated against? Yes, the court held in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). Does the prohibition on discrimination also imply a prohibition on, and cause of action for, retaliation against someone who complains of such discrimination? Yes, the court held in Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, 544 U.S. 167 (2005). Similarly, ADEA prohibits age discrimination. Does that also imply a prohibition on retaliation against someone who complains of such discrimination? Yes, the court held in Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 128 S. Ct. 29 (2008).

The complaint stated Delphi Corp. misrepresented their finances, which subsequently inflated the value of their stock. Investors stated Delphi's auditor, Deloitte & Touche, did not fully disclose the company's financial state. During the class period from 1999 to 2005, Delphi executives were also accused of financial fraud. Deloitte & Touche contributed $38 million to the settlement, while Delphi Corp. paid $204 million and Delphi's directors paid $80 million, for a total of $325 million. *General Motors Corporation Securities and Derivative Litigation: Grant & Eisenhofer represented Deka Investment GmbH and Deka International SA in a securities class action against General Motors and its auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP. The lawsuit alleged financial reports from 2002 to 2006 were misleading to shareholders. The financial statements \\"misstated and mischaracterized its revenue, earnings, and cash flow\\", which in turn exaggerated the price of GM stock. G&E; represented two investment groups as lead plaintiffs alongside Labaton Sucharow. A settlement was reached in 2008 under which GM paid $277 million and Deloitte & Touche paid $26 million. *In re News Corporation Shareholder Derivative Litigation: Grant & Eisenhofer reached a $139 million cash settlement—the largest settlement of derivative shareholder litigation in the history of Delaware Chancery Court and the largest cash recovery in a settlement of any derivative suit ever—in a shareholder lawsuit News Corp's Board of Directors alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by historically putting the personal and political interests of Rupert Murdoch, founder and CEO of News Corp, above those of the Company's public stockholders. The complaint focused on, among other things, the Company overpaying for its acquisition of the Shine Group Ltd. (a company owned by Murdoch's daughter) and the board's very public failure to adequately investigate and remedy a years-long cover-up by News International, a News Corp subsidiary, of illegal activity associated with phone-hacking and other privacy violations. It is believed that no prior derivative case settlement involved a more valuable or broad-based set of corporate governance enhancements. *Carmody v. Toll Brothers: In this landmark and often cited case, Grant & Eisenhofer successfully invalidated an onerous and controversial form of a poison pill referred to as a \\"dead-hand\\" poison pill. The dead-hand poison pill was a defensive mechanism that allowed the pill to be redeemed or withdrawn only by those directors who were on the board at the time the poison pill was adopted, referred to as the \\"continuing directors,\\" or their hand- picked successors. The pill had the effect of entrenching existing board members. The oppressive nature of the pill drew wide attention and criticism from institutional investors and corporate governance commentators. While a federal court in Georgia had previously upheld dead-hand poison pills, G&E; challenged the pill in the Delaware Chancery Court and won. After Toll Brothers, G&E; successfully challenged the dead-hand pills in actions against companies across the country that failed to remove them. Today as a result of Toll Brothers, dead-hand poison pills are nearly extinct. *In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Shareholder Derivative Litigation: Grant & Eisenhofer represented the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, and Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds as lead plaintiffs in a derivative and class action suit challenging $1.2 billion in back-dated options granted to William McGuire, then-CEO of health care provider UnitedHealth Group (\\"UHG\\"). G&E;'s case against UHG produced a settlement of $922 million, the largest settlement in the history of derivative litigation in any jurisdiction in one of the earliest, and most egregious backdating cases. *American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees Pension Plan v. American International Group, Inc.: Grant & Eisenhofer represented the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (\\"AFSCME\\") in litigation against insurance giant AIG. AFSCME was seeking to compel AIG to include a proxy access proposal in the company's proxy statement pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8. Long considered a primary goal of corporate governance reform, proxy access would require corporations to publish the names of director candidates nominated by shareholders in the corporation's proxy statement. The Second Circuit's decision in favor of AFSCME in this case reversed several years of No Action Letters from the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance that had effectively prevented shareholders from installing proxy access regimes at their corporations. This decision renewed the debate on the merits of proxy access that had stagnated following the Securities and Exchange Commission's failure to adopt a mandatory rule in 2004 and confirmed that shareholders have an existing right under the federal securities laws to propose bylaw amendments to require their companies to publish the names of shareholder- nominated candidates. *In re El Paso Corporation Shareholder Litigation: Grant & Eisenhofer represented Pompano Beach Police & Firefighters' Retirement System and was appointed co-lead counsel in a class action against natural gas company El Paso Corporation's Board of Directors, Goldman Sachs, and Kinder Morgan, Inc. alleging that the Board, aided and abetted by Goldman Sachs and Kinder Morgan, breached its fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell El Paso to Kinder Morgan for a less-than-value-maximizing price. Plaintiffs alleged that the merger was tainted by significant conflicts of interest, including (i) Goldman's serving as financial advisor to El Paso's Board despite Goldman's $4 billion buy-side interest in the deal stemming from its 19% ownership stake in Kinder Morgan, and (ii) the undisclosed interests of El Paso's sole negotiator for the deal—CEO and Chairman, Douglas Foshee—in acquiring El Paso's exploration and production assets for himself in a management buyout. The case settled for $110 million. * U.S. ex rel. McCoyd v.

Mr. Justice Akenhead at the High Court of Justice, London, on 29 July 2009 in the case of Corby Group Litigation v. Corby Borough Council [2009] EWHC 1944 (TCC). The judge found Corby Borough Council liable in negligence, public nuisance and a breach of statutory duty for its reclamation of a Corby Steelworks in the town of Corby, Northamptonshire, between 1985 and 1997. The landmark decision was historically significant as the first in the world to establish a link between atmospheric toxic waste and birth defects - all previous cases have involved water pollution - and held implications for other council reclamation programs and the methods of conducting reclamation in England and Wales. The case has been described as \\"the British Erin Brockovich\\". Background Corby became a steelmaking centre through the establishment of the Stewarts & Lloyds production site in the 1930s, and by 1960 had grown to become one of the most heavily industrialised areas in the Midlands. In 1981 however the plant had become unprofitable and owners British Steel Corporation closed the site. By then it was one of the largest steelmaking operations in Western Europe, covering , with four blast furnaces, two coke oven complexes and associated facilities. During its operation a huge quantity of industrial waste, including toxic waste, had been deposited there. Between 1984 and 1999 Corby Borough Council undertook the demolition, excavation and redevelopment of the site as part of a program of urban regeneration. This involved transporting the waste through populated areas to a quarry north of the site, utilising up to 200 vehicle movements daily. The toxic waste was carried in open lorries, spilling sludge over the roads and releasing huge amounts of dust into the air. Subsequently, in the late 1980s and 1990s, the rates of upper-limb defects in babies born in Corby were found to be almost three times higher than those of children born in the surrounding area and ten times higher than a town with a population of 60,000 should expect. In all cases initially referred to the court there were no previous family histories of limb defect. Action against Corby Borough Council In November 2005 expert evidence was submitted to the High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations and who sought to bring a legal action to try to prove a link between the mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children. The evidence presented included reports detailing the higher rate of birth defects, and alleging that exposure to the toxic waste was the likely cause of the children's deformities. They also presented a report written by Roger Braithwaite, an environmental expert instructed by the families, which concluded that the negligent handling of the waste by Corby Borough Council demonstrated \\"naivety, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and a possible serious conflict of interest... At this early stage it would seem to me that these... badly polluted lands have never been effectively or comprehensively assessed, properly permitted, regulated, monitored or adequate records maintained... This is environmental negligence on a grand scale.\\" After reviewing the evidence presented by all parties to the case, an order approved by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, set out the terms of the litigation in relation to the council's management and execution of the \\"land reclamation contracts\\" between 1985 and 1999 and any duty they had to the families, and permission was given for the parents to pursue the claim against Corby Borough Council as a class action involving children born between 1985 and 1999. Claimants The case to be heard at the High Court in 2009 represented 18 young people who alleged that toxic waste dumped by Corby Borough Council between 1984 and 1999 was the cause of their deformities. All had serious disabilities, including missing or underdeveloped fingers and deformities of their feet. They alleged that their mothers ingested or inhaled the toxic substances that affected the development of their limbs while they were still in the womb. All of their mothers either lived in or regularly visited Corby between 1984 and 1999 when the work was carried out across the town. The case had taken ten years to reach this point largely because of the difficulties encountered in obtaining disclosure of information from Corby Borough Council. 2009 hearing When the case reached the High Court on 16 February 2009, involving 18 families and the culmination of a ten-year legal process, evidence was put forward describing how, between 1985 and 1997, there existed a possibility that expectant mothers could have been affected by toxic waste which could either have travelled by air as a consequence of dust, or could have been ingested after landing on vegetables or other items. The area was constantly coated with a thick, red dust, including an open air market selling vegetables and other produce. The vehicles were uncovered, and there was no adherence to procedures such as the wheel washing of the vehicles. David Wilby, QC, leading counsel for the claimants, stated in court that one expert, in trying to convey the appearance of the minute particles hanging over the town at that time, had described it as an \\"atmospheric soup of toxic materials\\". Some of the open-backed lorries transported so-called 'wet waste', containing dioxins and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and chromium. With regard to the allegations that the council demonstrated a conflict of interest, Wilby stated: \\"Their motive - to a very considerable degree - was money. They looked to the Government and to the redevelopment organisations for the funds to redevelop the sites. They used that money to pay local contractors and the reality was that many of the contracts were awarded to friends or former work colleagues of members of the council.\\" In 1997 police investigated allegations of corruption in the awarding of the contracts but the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The presence and locations of the toxic waste was known before work began, having been stored in purpose-built \\"pits\\" around the site by British Steel, \\"in a form which was of no danger to anyone unless they fell in. But the effect of the works undertaken was to remove the majority of these materials and move them a long distance to other areas of Corby, and this involved vast numbers of vehicle movements.\\" Professor Louise Parker PhD, Professor of Pediatrics and Community Health and Epidemiology at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, testified that between 1989 and 1998 children in Corby were 2.5 times more likely to be born with upper limb defects than in the rest of the Kettering Health Authority area, which was statististically \\"quite significant\\". An internal report prepared by Corby Borough Council was uncovered which had raised the prospect of residents being exposed to high levels of zinc, arsenic, boron and nickel as a result of the reclamation works, and a separate report, from the council’s auditor, complained of incompetence and negligence by the council and said there was a \\"cavalier approach\\" to the operation. The families' counsel submitted that whether Corby Borough Council knew or should have known that the substances being transported around the town could have been hazardous to health was \\"hardly rocket science\\". Further, Wilby submitted that the Council committed a criminal act when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste. Inspectors were not told the true nature of the substances involved and so took only sporadic samples from the site. Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: \\"They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, we have got to get it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'\\" Records demonstrated that in one test which took place in 1983 only five soil samples were collected to represent a area. Ruling In his ruling, Mr Justice Akenhead said it was clear that the council had permitted toxic waste to disperse into the atmosphere. He also said that there was a \\"statistically significant\\" cluster of birth defects between 1989 and 1999, and that, \\"toxicologically, there were present on and from the Corby Borough Council sites, over the whole period from 1985 (and possibly before) until 1997, the types of contaminants which could cause the birth defects complained of.\\" \\"There was an extended period between 1983 and August 1997 in which Corby Borough Council was extensively negligent in its control and management of the sites which they acquired from British Steel and otherwise used. That negligence and, as from April 1, 1992, breach of statutory duty on the part of CBC permitted and led to the extensive dispersal of contaminated mud and dust over public areas of Corby and into and over private homes, with the result that the contaminants could realistically have caused the types of birth defects of which complaint has been made by the claimants (save in limited respects)... Corby Borough Council is liable in public nuisance, negligence and breach of statutory duty, obviously subject to it being established in later proceedings by individual claimants that their particular conditions were actually caused by the defaults identified in this judgment.\\" Mr Justice Akenhead said that while the parents had been \\"wholly honest\\", the council's motive was to develop and sell the land quickly without thought for the consequences of those nearby, and without appreciating \\"the enormity, ramifications and difficulty\\" of its task in moving the material. The two youngest claimants, nine-year-old India Harrison and ten-year-old Ashleigh Jane Custance, were unable at that time to proceed with their cases, however, because of the ruling that there were no breaches of duty after August 1997. Their parents indicated that they would appeal this cut-off date. Reactions The families' lawyer, Des Collins, said: \\"Prior to the trial, the council maintained that a thorough investigation had led it to the conclusion that there was no link between the reclamation work and the children's birth defects. It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial. Today that link has been established and the evidence provided. The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pre-trial promises without delay.\\" Collins said of the legal battle: \\"I've been made out to be a shyster and an ambulance-chaser. The council has stonewalled, obstructed and prevaricated all the way through this. They didn't need to. If they'd ever said to us, 'Look, we're not admitting liability, but we'll co-operate with you to find out what really happened', I wouldn't have minded. Instead, they tried to shut us out and paint us as the baddies... They've tried at every turn to stop us getting at the truth. Now they claim they can't afford to pay. I'm not impressed.\\" Corby Borough Council's Chief Executive Chris Mallender said: \\"We are obviously very disappointed and very surprised at the outcome of this trial. Our position has always been that there was no link between the reclamation work that was carried out in Corby in past decades and these children's birth defects. That is still our position.\\" He also said they were \\"prepared to apologise for mistakes that had been made but could not apologise until a causal link was proved between the works and the defects... We are not yet at the point of saying sorry because nobody yet is responsible.\\" The council's legal representatives said they were asked to advise on an appeal but had over 400 pages of judgment to review and also their client had to consider its position. The firm said it would be a few weeks before it has instructions. The statement added: \\"There are however some clear points to note at this stage. The case involves reclamation work going back to the 1980s. The judge concluded that this contamination affected pregnant women. A child, so affected, has 21 years from birth to make a claim and thus any work since the late 1980s which has not met the standard of care indicated in this judgment could be challenged in this way. For both local authorities and developers alike this is a significant concern because the standard of care has been drawn very highly, and could cause a rethink of the way that reclamation is carried out in the UK even though the facts of the case are historic.\\" Kelvin Glendenning, leader of Corby Borough Council between 1984 and 1995, said \\"I don't think that Corby Council has anything to regret... If there was toxic waste - and I am sure there wasn't any toxic waste at all that was floating about in the air - they shouldn't be blaming us.\\" Appeal On 1 August 2009 it was announced that the decision by Corby Borough Council regarding whether or not to appeal the ruling would be taken on 18 August 2009, the day before the deadline for appeal decisions to be submitted to Mr Justice Akenhead. Unusually, the authority decided that openness and public opinion were required at the extraordinary full council sitting after which councillors will vote on whether to appeal or instead pay the compensation to 16 children who were born with birth defects. Chief Executive Chris Mallender stated: \\"The council is doing the right thing by reaching the decision in public. We will be starting the meeting at 6pm so we can give the opportunity for [the public] to speak,\\" a move he said would make sure councillors' decisions reflected public opinion. The council, which has an annual budget of £12m, has already spent £1.9m fighting the case and has now received a bill for £4.7m from the families' solicitor. Compensation payments could total in excess of a further £8m. At the meeting the council voted to appeal against the ruling but said that they would follow a \\"twin track\\" approach, preferring to attend independent mediation sessions to come to an out-of-court settlement with the families. They also stated that any mediation would include the cases of the two youngest claimants despite these not being covered by the ruling. The chief executive gave a statement that if a causal link between the toxins and the limb deformities was ever proven he would \\"offer an unreserved apology\\", however he believed \\"that the judgement is unsound and will be found wanting on appeal.\\" Settlement The settlement was mediated by retired judge Sir Henry Brooke. Before settlement had been reached, Chris Mallender explained: \\"We have reached a view that there are going to be no outright winners in this. In the circumstances we feel that it's better that we try and find a middle ground, we settle in a way that's fair to the families, but is also fair in terms of the residual burden on the council tax payer.\\" On 16 April 2010 the council released a joint statement with the families' solicitors announcing it was dropping its appeal and had agreed a financial settlement with 19 families. Chris Mallender said: \\"The council recognises that it made mistakes in its clean-up of the former British Steel site years ago and extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families. Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities and for all that they have suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology coupled with today's agreement will mean that they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty.\\" The financial terms of the settlement remained confidential, and the agreement forbids disclosure of the financial arrangements. On the subject of cost, Mallender said: \\"Every £1m of cost involves a payment £5 per household in Corby on average, per year, for the next 20 years. So, simple maths: if the overall bill is £5m, it's £25 per household for 20 years.\\" The settlement also encompassed three children not covered by the original ruling, including India Harrison and Ashleigh Custance. Implications for industry Paula Jefferson, head of Beachcroft LLP's Disease Group, said: \\"Any organisation involved in any activity in the future, where there is the potential for release of harmful substances in to the atmosphere, should ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to identify the potential contamination and to then ensure that they either employ, or have themselves the necessary skills, to deal with that contamination. The principles in the judgment apply not just when there is demolition in progress, but to any activity where there is potential for exposure in to the atmosphere. Where there is any known potential for such exposure, then regard should be had to not just the onsite workforce but also to those living and working in the surrounding area. In the Corby case the area of risk was 4km from the demolition site. The area for potential exposure will clearly vary depending on the circumstances of each case. In essence, the message remains the same - proper risk assessment is key and must include identifying the appropriate people to do the job and not cutting corners, which, as has been proved for Corby Borough Council, is likely to be false economy.\\" See also *Ravenscraig *Spodden Valley asbestos controversy *Camelford water pollution incident *Love Canal *Sydney Tar Ponds ReferencesExternal links *Text of judgment from Bailii Soil contamination Waste disposal incidents Environmental controversies Environmental disasters in the United Kingdom 2009 in case law 2009 in British law Pollution in the United Kingdom 2009 in the environment ","title":"Corby toxic waste case"},{"id":"23802233","text":"The Glenlivet Estate is located in Glenlivet, Scotland in the Cairngorms National Park.

Early life=Father= Arenberg was born on 30 August 1753 at Brussels, where his father resided. The duke, who had served with great distinction during the Seven Years' War, and was a field-marshal in the Austrian army, originally intended Prince Auguste for the same service, in which he began his career at the age of fifteen; but family circumstances altered his career.The Dublin University magazine: a literary and political journal, Volume 39, W. Curry, jun., and co., 1852. p. 153 =Uncle= Louis Engelbert, Count of La Marck, the last of his name, and the father-in-law of Charles, 5th Duke of Arenberg, was the officer of a regiment of German infantry in the service of France, and, having no son, proposed that Prince Auguste should enter the French service, offering, if he did so, to give him his regiment. The proposition was accepted, and it was further arranged that on the death of his maternal grandfather, the young prince should take the title of Comte de La Marck, by which he subsequently became known.Honoré-Gabriel de Riquetti Mirabeau (comte de), Auguste Marie Raymond Arenberg (prince d', comte de La Marck), Adolphe Fourier de Bacourt. Correspondance entre le comte de Mirabeau et le comte de La Marck: pendant les années 1789, 1790 et 1791 volume 1, V. Le Normant, 1851 p. 280 (French =Move to France= The House of Arenberg had long borne arms in the Austrian army, but was a sovereign house, its members free to take service wherever they pleased; the Duke of Arenberg, however, who stood high in the estimation of the Empress-Queen, Maria Theresa, judged it advisable to obtain her consent to this change in the career of his son. The request was made at the very moment when the marriage was decided on between the Archduchess Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin of France; and the empress, in acceding to it, strongly recommended the Prince of Arenberg to her daughter. He was accordingly presented in due form to Louis XV, assisted at all the fêtes which were given on the occasion of the marriage, was warmly welcomed by the dauphine, and honored by a kindness and confidence never afterwards withdrawn. Consequently, La Marck was a zealous defender of Marie Antoinette, whom he endeavored to represent as much less disposed towards political interference—until the gravity of events compelled her to interfere—than she has often described during his later life. Military career=Title= After being thus presented, Prince Auguste joined his regiment in the South of France, remained with it for a year to learn his duty, and then, at the age of 20, returned to court, where, having succeeded to his grandfather's title, and being invested with the rank of Grandee of Spain, he enjoyed every facility for establishing a political and social connection of the highest kind. =Duel= La Marck distinguishing himself in India fighting under Count de Bussy, and from whence he returned severely wounded. On his return he was involved in a duel in Paris with a former young Swedish officer of his regiment, called M. Peyron. La Marck and Peyron had exchanged words before La Marck's regiment had embarked for India when Peyron had resigned his commission. They fought with swords, and after a few passes M. Peyron fell dead, having received a sword thrust through an eye. The Count perceived at the same moment that he also was wounded, by a torrent of blood which gushed from his mouth. M. Peyron's sword had in fact pierced his lungs just below the armpit, leaving a slight mark on his back. La Marck recovered from his wounds and directed his martial qualities towards his military career. He bestowed considerable pains on the discipline of his regiment, which became a model for the rest of the service, was appointed inspector-general of infantry, and finally vice-president of the committee for regulating the tactics of the troops of the line, in which latter capacity he acquired considerable reputation. =Court life= These duties were La Marck's chief occupation till 1789, apart from them, having married in 1776, La Marck led an agreeable life, alternately at Raismes, his country residence near Valenciennes, and at Versailles, where his rank and position gave him the means of observing all that was passing, which he appears to have noted with care and tolerable impartiality. As he had no personal interests to serve, sought no employment, needed no title, had ample wealth, and, the ties of friendship excepted, stood aloof from all who sought the monarch's levée or the minister's ante-chamber. Political career=Friendship with Mirabeau= In 1789 La Marck met with Count de Mirabeau at a dinner given by the Prince de Poix, the Governor of Versailles, to which Mirabeau was taken by M. de Meilhan, a friend of La Marck. Though La Marck and Mirabeau met each other several times after this on terms of growing intimacy, it was not till the convocation of States-General, in 1789, that their friendship became closely cemented. La Marck, who was friend of both the queen and Mirabeau, became a communicator between them. After the march on Versailles, La Marck consulted Mirabeau as to what measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau drew up a state paper, which was presented to the king by Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII. However, as events unfolded these negotiations came to nothing.Eliakim, pp. 222–227 =Revolution= During this period La Marck was first a member of the States- general, and afterwards of the National Assembly. However he was deprived of command of his regiment by the National Assembly and when the royal cause became hopeless he left France, and entered the Austrian army with the rank of major-general. He was employed as a diplomat on various occasions, but never on any military service. On his brother's establishment at Paris, he was anxious to re-enter the service of France; this however Napoleon would not allow him to do, and he remained at Vienna till 1814, when he came to Brussels, and was made lieutenant-general by the new king of the Netherlands. He left the Dutch army after the revolution of 1830, and died in 1833.Hugh James Rose (editor 1848), A new general biographical dictionary, projected, Fellowes, 1848. p. 106 Art collection After his retirement in 1830 he began collecting art for his residences. His collection passed on his death in 1833 to Prosper Louis, 7th Duke of Arenberg.

Lapin (2003) \\"Avangard\\", Tartu Ülikooli Kirjastus, Tartu, lk 23  Personal life  Leonhard Lapin is Sofia Lapin's (Sõrmus) and Rudolf Mõttus's son. More relatives: half-brother, Doctor of Philosophy Voldemar Lapin, half-brother Anatoli Mettus and half-sister Valentina Olli (Lapin). In the father's side of the family men worked as tailors. Mother worked as the director of sewing manufactury. That is why Lapin was thinking to study fashion at Estonian Academy of Arts, but his eldest brother told him to study architecture. The family name Lapin comes from mother's first husband, who was Latvian, Rūdolfs Lapiņs (Latvian: little leaf). After family name's Russification it became Lapin. He became close with Oriental Association and Buddhist mahamudra teachings, that became base for his future composition teaching method. 1969–1982 was married to Sirje Runge. Later was married to architect Kristel Jaanus. 1991 daughter Anna Maria was born and in 1996 son Aleksander. Creativity= Art and Literature = Leonhard Lapin began active work during 1960. and raised rapidly to leading avant-garde artist position, but also organizer and theorist. Was a member of avant-garde artists movement SOUP´69. His graphics brought him international attention, especially series where he addressed blending of human being and a machine. As an artist has created ink drawings, graphics in silk screen printing, gravure printing and lithography techniques, paintings in watercolor, gouache and oil, architectons, sculptures and installations. He also did artworks in pop art in the late 1960s, influenced by Andy Warhol\\"Calendar of Events: Exhibition: POPkunst Forever!\\", Eesti Kunstimuuseum Wrote articles and poetry that criticized Soviet art ideologies, that were spread as manuscripts. Later the poems have been published as collections underpseudonym Albert Trapeež. Lapin made his first architecton in 1976 and it was named \\"Monument to Tallinn\\". It was Lapin who brought the word \\"architecton\\" to Estonian and Finnish languages. The notion comes from 20th century Russian avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, for whom \\"architecton\\" meant the home of future human being. Lapin also created a notion of \\"own space\\" (\\"omaruum\\" in Estonian) that he deals with in his composition teachings.L. Lapin (2003) \\"Avangard\\", Tartu Ülikooli Kirjastus, Tartu, lk 22 Lapin has conducted first happenings in Estonia, also has staged performances in theatre. He has been invited to very many exhibitions in other countries, his worcs are in national and private collections all over the world. Lapin's concept of space and void has been source of expression of his ideas. He has written many books on this topic. Leo has an individual emotional writing style, too subjectively for academic writing, which does not mean that his texts have no historiographic value.E. Lankots (2014) \\"Moodsa arhitektuuri kriitiline historiograafia. Modernsuse käsitlused Leo Gensi ja Leonhard Lapini arhitektuuriajaloolistes tekstides 1960.—1980. aastail\\", doktoritöö, lk 106, 108\\"Eesti kunsti ja arhitektuuri biograafiline leksikon\\" (1996) lk 249 =Architecture= Lapin belonged to the generation of \\"young angry architects\\" together with other young architects who graduated from Estonian Academy of Arts during the 1970s. At that time L. Lapin was a persona non grata among architects but in the arts sphere he was recognized as an enfant terrible. Other group members were Vilen Künnapu, Tiit Kaljundi, Avo-Himm Looveer, Ain Padrik, Jüri Okas, Jaan Ollik and Ignar Fjuk, joined by a bit older architects Veljo Kaasik and Toomas Rein. They called themselves \\"The Tallinn Ten\\" but they can be put under wider term \\"Tallinn School\\"M. Komonen (ed), Nine Architects from Tallinn, Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki, 1984. because it covered wider circles of architects, artists, designers and engineers of that generation. During the Soviet time acting as a group was more effective because they could accomplish more than while standing alone. The main message of the group was that architecture is a form of art. The greater goal was to change architecture, environment, people's attitude towards them and to give sense to contemporary society and culture.E. Lankots (2014) \\"Moodsa arhitektuuri kriitiline historiograafia. Modernsuse käsitlused Leo Gensi ja Leonhard Lapini arhitektuuriajaloolistes tekstides 1960.—1980. aastail\\", doktorate dissertation \\"Tallinn's School\\" experimental architects and artists, but mostly Leonhard Lapin dealt with the history of architecture, mainly by writing but also in other art forms. During his education, future architect got acquainted with the functionalism of the 1930s, that had strong dissaproval from the Soviet regimen. But Lapin also ardoured early Soviet avant-garde art and Russian constructivism, so he could not be accused of treason by the government. New term neofunctualism was grew out of Lapin's plastic architecture with maschine aesthetics. Tallinn School's architects could express themselves mainly through private house projects since other types of constructions were strictly regulated. Although in the course of creating an outstanding and individual exterior, the suitability into the surroundings and the comfortable usage of the interior spaces were often neglected. During the 1976–77 Lapin developed his houses according to his graphics series \\"Maschines\\". A good example is Villa Valeri I, located in Laagri, Estonia, that is an equivalent to his work \\"Maschine-architecture III or Villa Valeri I\\" (1976).M. Kalm (2002) \\"Eesti XX sajandi arhitektuur\\", lk 389, 394 The paradox of Lapin is that although he executed contemporary avant- garde, in his writings he dealt with historical styles and notions. Through creation of a linkage between earlier history of architecture and art and also by dealing with terminological problems Leonhard wanted to raise the awareness of the Estonia's society. \\"In 1978 we presented 'pure ideas', as our aim was to show architecture as an independent form of art, a manifestation of the spiritual, but also as an independent and influential feature that played a part in social processes.\\"Andres Kurg, \\"The turning point in 1978 – Architects of the Tallinn School and their late Socialist public\\", in Ines Weizman (ed.), Architecture and the Paradox of Dissidence, Routledge, London, 2013.L.

Founded in 1908, it is located on Redhead Beach, in the suburb of Redhead about south of Newcastle. It is affiliated with Surf Life Saving Australia, and its club colours are yellow and blue. History The Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club was on Saturday, 12 December 1908. Residents of Redhead and Dudley met at Matchett's Hall and Billiard Room on Ocean Street in Dudley, New South Wales. F. Matchett chaired a meeting to elect the first club officers, which were G.H. Thomas, President, E.J. Doyle, Secretary, W. Pullbrook, treasurer and Tom Conlon, Captain. The new club members decided to seek affiliation with the NSW Amateur Swimming Association, and a report in the Newcastle Morning Herald and Miner's Advocate stated that \\"The club members are erecting dressing sheds on the beach and hope to have them finished before the holidays. They also have a life line and reel there in case of emergency\\". The \\"reel\\" was merely a long line wound onto a drum. The club's first proper surf reel and line was obtained three years later and commissioned on December 2, 1911. Club records list 31 foundation members for the 1908-09 season. At a club meeting held on March 16, 1909, correspondence was received and read from the NSW Surf Bather's Association. The meeting then moved to affiliate with the Surf Bather's Association and to pay the affiliation fee of one guinea. On April 12, 1915 a special meeting was held to discuss ways and means of providing a clubhouse. However, it was not until 1929 that the first permanent clubhouse was built from donated timber and bricks. Membership declined after the First World War and went into recess for three seasons between 1919 and 1922. The beach did however continue to be patrolled, gear maintained, and the occasional meeting held. Redhead SLSC was resumed for the 1922-1923 season but recessed again from 1924 to 1926. After reopening for the 1927 season, ten members were the club's first to pass examinations for the Surf Bronze Medallion. Membership Membership is open to anyone from the age of 5.

Pissarro spent time in Rouen in 1896 seeking to paint the industrial modernity of the area. He had earlier made a trip in 1883, and did one series of images of the city then. On this his first 1896 trip he stayed at the Hôtel de Paris in Rouen from January to April 1896, during which time this painting was made. His room overlooked the Seine, and it is from this vantage point that it is painted.Lorenz Eitner. 19th century European painting: David to Cézanne. Westview Press, 2002 pg. 427 The subject is the Pont Boieldieu, an iron bridge completed a few years before in 1885. Across the river is the Gare d'Orléans train station and the Place Carnot square. The painting shows Pissarro's interest in moving beyond traditional landscape paintings of verdant rural scenes. His Rouen series instead focuses on the bustle of the modern city. The Rouen pictures would be followed by a series of paintings of urban Paris. Style-wise, Pont Boieldieu in Rouen, Rainy Weather is a return to Impressionism after a decade of experimenting with Post-Impressionism and Pointillism. Pissarro deliberately sought out a view of the busy industrial section of the town, and produced a number of paintings of the view from the hotel in different light conditions and different weather. He did another picture of the Pont Boieldieu from the same angle, but in a foggy sunset that is today at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen. In a letter written that year, Pissarro himself describes the painting: \\"The theme is the bridge near the Place de la Bourse with the effects of rain, crowds of people coming and going, smoke from the boats, quays with cranes, workers in the foreground, and all this in grey colors glistening in the rain.\\"Ronald R. Bernier. Monument, moment, and memory: Monet's cathedral in fin de siècle France Bucknell University Press, 2007. pg. 36 He further wrote, \\"what particularly interests me is the motif off the iron bridge in wet weather with all the vehicles, pedestrians, workers on the embankment, boats, smoke, haze in the distance; it's so spirited, so alive.Art Gallery of Ontario: Selected Works. Art Gallery of Ontario, 1990 pg. 143 The painting was donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario by Reuben Wells Leonard upon his death in 1937. It is one of six Pissarros on public display in Canada, with two others at the AGO, and the others being at the National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. Pissarro returned to the city later in the year, staying from September to November at a different hotel, from a balcony of which he executed a painting of the bridge from another angle.

Clients of Marlin Wire include Toyota, Roche, Alcoa and Beretta and the aerospace, food, fashion and biotech industries. History In 1998, Drew Greenblatt took money he made from selling a small home security business and sought a company he thought had the potential for more growth. He found a 30-year-old Brooklyn, N.Y. company that made wire baskets and racks for retailers and the food service business and bought it for $285,000 in cash. Greenblatt moved the business to Baltimore, Maryland where he lived, hoping to capitalize on lower costs, lower taxes and greater efficiencies through modernization. In 2000, large retailers, such as Target, started importing inexpensive wire products from China, undercutting Marlin's business. Wire-shaping robot at Marlin Greenblatt reorganized the company's business model to focus on custom-made, high-quality, short turnaround wire products for other manufacturers. In 2002, such jobs made up less than 1 percent of Marlin sales. By 2007, they made up more than two- thirds of Marlin's business, and the average wage for a Marlin employee had more than doubled. Robotics played a significant role in Marlin's growth. As the company shifted from retails to clients in industries such as aviation, defense and biotechnology, the tolerances and dimensions of its baskets had to become ever more exacting to protect parts and to meld with precise manufacturing processes.\\"The Road to Resilience: How Unscientific Innovations Saved Marlin Steel\\", Fast Company, July–August 2013 In 2010–2011, after 40 years of concentrating solely on steel wire products, Marlin Steel added sheet metal capability with a sheet metal CNC punch, press brake and laser.\\"The Road to Resilience: How Unscientific Innovations Saved Marlin Steel,\\" Fast Company, July–August 2013 In 2012, Marlin Steel was ranked as the 4112th fastest growing private company in the U.S. on the Inc. 5000 list.

He received a bachelor's degree in 1958 from the University of Michigan, where he also obtained a master's degree in journalism in 1960. A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1987, and 1999, Kaul retired in 2000 after writing columns, mainly for The Des Moines Register, for more than 35 years. His satirical style and liberal views made him a household name in Iowa. In 2001 he resumed his column for OtherWords, a non-profit editorial service featuring progressive commentators. His last column appeared in 2017. Besides his legacy of columns, which combined bite with crisp insights, Kaul co-founded The Des Moines Register’s annual, weeklong bike ride across Iowa, RAGBRAI. It began in 1973 with a column by Kaul, who launched the ride with John Karras, another Register writer. In about 1963 Kaul began spelling Harlan Miller in writing The Register’s “Over the Coffee” column, and he took it over full-time in the spring of 1965. In 1970 the paper moved Kaul to its bureau in Washington, D.C. In 1983 he fell from grace with the paper’s editor, James Gannon, and was fired. Kaul was picked up by the Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette, and his columns also were syndicated nationally. When Geneva Overholser became The Register’s editor, one of her first changes was to bring Kaul back in 1989. \\"Kaul belongs in The Register,” she said then. “There aren't many world-class columnists around, and we've got one who's really our own.\\" Emily Schwartz Greco, his editor at OtherWords, wrote in 2012, “Don’s versatility is stunning. After half a century of penning columns, he writes with equal ease about football, economics, racism, and military spending.” And the way Kaul penned those columns, the way he turned a phrase, was unforgettable for many of his readers. Richard Nixon “is to shifty what Larry Bird is to basketball,” he wrote in a 1986 column for The Register. Kaul unrelentingly and affectionately teased Iowa girls’ basketball for its slow pace, calling for it to be timed with an “hour glass” and saying it drove crowds “delirious with apathy.” Describing riders of RAGBRAI as “my kind of people,” he explained: “They come for a little fun and to see whether it’s true what they say about coronaries. They’re not into finishing first, they’re into finishing.” A Washingtonian magazine poll of the nation’s 200 largest newspapers voted Kaul “the most underrated syndicated columnist.” In 1984 he was keynote speaker at Drake University Law School’s Supreme Court Celebration Banquet, an invitation usually extended to governors, members of Congress and Supreme Court justices. For a time in the 1980s he was a commentator on National Public Radio. Register editors could count on Kaul to generate letters from readers, pro and con, and other Iowa columnists followed his work. One called him “the George Will or Rush Limbaugh of the left.” Kaul has always worn his liberalism on his forehead. Noting the political benefits of military contracts scattered by design among many congressional districts, he wrote, “Congress has its faults – it is for the most part cowardly, venal and self-aggrandizing – but give it this: it is absolutely ingenious in its efforts to protect the military budget from the scourge of peace.” But liberalism had little to do with the fun he had claiming credit for terms defining girls’ basketball: “standing jump shot, the slow-break offense, the near-dribble.” Or, in a years-long harangue against The Sound of Music, he said the film is so syrupy that it stands alone “on the condemned list of the Association for the Prevention of Diabetes.” He suffered a heart attack on the Fourth of July, 2012, after detouring from his semi-vegan ways to eat a hotdog. He still met a deadline, filing a column three days later, but observed, “Life is full of little ironies, some of which will kill you.” He took a break from writing, then decided to resume, just before the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre. It spurred his “madder-than-hell” call for ending gun violence. “Repeal the Second Amendment, the part about guns anyway,” he wrote, urging that the NRA be declared a terrorist organization and that owning an unlicensed assault rifle be made a felony. “If some people refused to give up their guns, that ‘prying the guns from their cold, dead hands’ thing works for me,” he went on. “Then I would tie Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, our esteemed Republican leaders, to the back of a Chevy pickup and drag them around a parking lot until they saw the light on gun control.” Protests followed, led by anti-gun control activists who flooded his email and phone with nasty, sometimes threatening, messages. Kaul explained he was writing satirically about the GOP leaders, but to little avail. “Perhaps my column jumped the shark a bit,” he said. “I was angry. But worse would have been to watch those little bodies being carried out of the Newtown school, shrug, and say ‘Gee, that’s terrible. We’re going to have to do something about that someday, if the NRA approves.’ That would have been immoral.” Many of Kaul’s columns are reprinted in three books – How to Light a Water Heater and Other War Stories a Random Collection of Random Essays; THE END OF THE WORLD AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENTS; and They’re All in It Together: When Good Things Happen to Bad People, edited by his son Christopher Kaul to provide additional context. On January 11, 2018, Kaul revealed that the cancer in his prostate has spread to his skeleton and that he will no longer take treatments. He was in the end stages of his battle with cancer and didn't expect to live beyond the year.

The notation was introduced by V. I. Arnold. Let f : Rn → R be a smooth function. We denote by Ω(Rn,R) the infinite-dimensional space of all such functions. Let diff(Rn) denote the infinite-dimensional Lie group of diffeomorphisms Rn → Rn, and diff(R) the infinite-dimensional Lie group of diffeomorphisms R → R. The product group diff(Rn) × diff(R) acts on Ω(Rn,R) in the following way: let φ : Rn → Rn and ψ : R → R be diffeomorphisms and f : Rn → R any smooth function. We define the group action as follows: : (\\\\varphi,\\\\psi)\\\\cdot f := \\\\psi \\\\circ f \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1} The orbit of f, denoted orb(f), of this group action is given by : \\\\mbox{orb}(f) = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi \\\\circ f \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1} : \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\mbox{diff}({\\\\mathbf R}^n), \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\mbox{diff}({\\\\mathbf R}) \\\\\\\\} \\\\ . The members of a given orbit of this action have the following fact in common: we can find a diffeomorphic change of coordinate in Rn and a diffeomorphic change of coordinate in R such that one member of the orbit is carried to any other. A function f is said to have a type Ak-singularity if it lies in the orbit of : f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = 1 + \\\\varepsilon_1x_1^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\varepsilon_{n-1}x^2_{n-1} \\\\pm x_n^{k+1} where \\\\varepsilon_i = \\\\pm 1 and k ≥ 0 is an integer. By a normal form we mean a particularly simple representative of any given orbit. The above expressions for f give normal forms for the type Ak-singularities. The type Ak-singularities are special because they are amongst the simple singularities, this means that there are only a finite number of other orbits in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the orbit of f. This idea extends over the complex numbers where the normal forms are much simpler; for example: there is no need to distinguish εi = +1 from εi = −1.

After the 2004 election, the subject seemed more and more important and our company had grown and had more resources, so it seemed like the time had come… And there's no better place to do this project than Colorado Springs because of New Life, Ted and his relationship to politics, his presidency of the NAE during the Bush Presidency … Three of us came out in June and went to New Life and I think the first time we really sort of got it, like \\"Oh! this really seems to be the center of America right now. I mean, you're in the middle of this church with 7,000 people and the minister is talking about his relationship to George Bush and Ariel Sharon and other world leaders.

Evidence for a number of ditches over the centuries and medieval settlement has been found on the northeast side of the street. Corn Exchange Street has been a street since at least the 16th century when it was known as Slaughter Lane. The street straddles the line of the medieval King's Ditch. By 1574, the ditch was filled in at this location. On the far side of the ditch from the town centre, to the east of Slaughterhouse Lane was the Beast Market and a slaughteryard. To the west was a White Friars monastic house, straddling the ditch. The Corn Exchange was built in the 19th century and the northeast side consisted of small shops and inns.

Napoléon-Joseph Perché (1805–1883) served as the third Archbishop of New Orleans from 1870 to 1883. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans is the second-oldest diocese in the present-day United States. Biography Born 10 January 1805, Perché was a native of Angers, in the Department of Maine-et-Loire in France. He was ordained a priest at Beaupreau on 19 September 1829, after which he served in the local diocese until 1837, when he departed for the United States.Catholic Hierarchy Arriving in his new home, Perché served the Diocese of Bardstown (now Louisville) until 1842. He then moved to New Orleans, where he served as the chaplain to the Ursuline Convent of that city. He immediately founded the first diocesan newspaper, Le Propagateur Catholique, published in French. In 1870 Perché was chosen by the Holy See as Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, being named titular bishop of Abdera, for which position he was consecrated on 1 May of that same year. He succeeded Archbishop Jean-Marie Odin, C.M., as Archbishop of New Orleans only twenty-four days later. Perché had to contend with the uncertain and financially troubled situation of the post-Civil War years. He forged ahead with an extensive program of expansion of the parishes and schools of the Archdiocese. Four new parishes were established within the city and another 23 in the surrounding towns. Additionally, he was a strong advocate of Catholic education, who viewed public school education as both inadequate and ungodly. Catholic schools, particularly in rural areas, were often more stable, better supported, and better attended than the public schools. By 1888, more than 11,000 students were being educated in schools of the Archdiocese.A History of the Archdiocese of New Orleans: Reconstruction and its Aftermath 1865-1888 To support this expansion, Perché recruited several religious congregations of teaching Brothers and Religious Sisters from France. He also authorized the founding of a native congregation in 1871, the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, established in Labadieville by the Rev. Cyprien Venissat. He additionally established three monasteries of enclosed religious orders in the Archdiocese. The archdiocesan paper founded by Perché had been temporarily suspended by federal authorities during the Civil War. Although it was resumed, it did not address the Archdiocese's growing population of English-speakers. In 1868, a new archdiocesan newspaper was launched, The Morning Star. This publication became the main one for the Archdiocese for more than sixty years. The Reverend Abram Joseph Ryan, the priest-poet of the Confederacy, was its editor from 1871 to 1875. Perché borrowed heavily to finance parish and school expansion, as well as his own personal charity to all the poor who knocked at his door. As a result, by the mid-1870s the Archdiocese had amassed a huge debt. In 1879 the Holy See appointed Bishop Francis Xavier Leray of Natchitoches as Coadjutor Archbishop and Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese, giving him full control over it. Upon his arrival in New Orleans, Leray found an archdiocesan debt of $590,925 (nearly one billion dollars as of 2012), a debt which would restrict its development for the next quarter century. Perché died in New Orleans on 27 December 1883.The Catholic Encyclopedia; A History of the Archdiocese of New Orleans; Notre Dame Archives; Catholic Hierarchy.

A state can waive its sovereign immunity, and in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Supreme Court had emphasized that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to powers granted it by the Civil War Amendments.

Today, it is displayed at the German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven as one of the main features. Three nearly identical replicas of this cog have been built: Ubena von Bremen, Hansekogge, and Roland von Bremen.  The discovery  On 8 October 1962, wooden fragments of a ship were found in the Weser River during dredging operations. They turned out to be remnants of a cog that seems to have sunk during a storm flood after drifting away from a shipyard before completion. Until then, cogs had only been known from medieval documents and seals. Based on the dendrochronological analysis of the oak timber from which the cog was built, the ship was dated to about 1380 AD.  Salvage and reconstruction  The large parts were measured, registered, and stored in water basins in a pier shed in Bremen to prevent the wood from drying and shrinking. A further search with the aid of a diving bell ship in 1965 retrieved more than 2000 additional parts, which also were stored. It was decided to exhibit it in the planned German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven. In 1972, the Koggehalle had been completed and the parts were reassembled under constant sprinkling. Almost the complete starboard side and a third of the port side could be reconstructed. The construction then was encased in a tank to be impregnated in polyethylene glycol for 18 years. Finally, it was cleared from the remnants and has been on display since 2000, 25 years after the opening of the museum. The Bremer cog had one mast and was square-rigged, with a carvel-built bottom and clinch- built sides. The rib timber was built in after the hull had been made.Exhibition notes, Hanseatic Museum in Bergen (2014) The cog was 24 m long, 8 m in the beam, and just over 4 m high on the sides.

The son of Dr. Aloysious (Lajos) von Wayditch von Verbovac (Verbovác), a nobleman and inventor who had taught physics at the University of Pécs, and Helena von Dönhoff, a Prussian baroness, Gabriel (Wayditch Gabor) was born in Budapest. He studied piano, conducting, and composition at the National Hungarian Academy of Music (now the Franz Liszt Academy of Music) where his teachers included Franz Liszt's pupil Emil von Sauer and Hans von Koessler, who was also the teacher of composers Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Ernő Dohnányi, and Emmerich Kálmán. Life and career In 1910, Gabriel von Wayditch began composing his first opera, Ópium Álmok (), for which he also wrote his own Hungarian libretto. But after his parents separated, he emigrated to the United States with his father before completing it, arriving in New York harbor in 1911. In New York City, Wayditch worked as a theater conductor while completing Ópium Álmok, which lasts 4 hours and requires an orchestra of some 110 players. Upon its completion, there was no performance of it. Wayditch subsequently derived two orchestral suites and his sole piano composition, Reminscences from Opium Dreams, from the thematic material in that opera. But none of these works received public performances either. During the remainder of the decade he composed two additional operas, both somewhat shorter though requiring the same massive orchestration: Suh és Sah (The Caliph's Magician) (1917) and Jézus Heròdes elött (Jesus Before Herod) (1918). Although both of these works were performed after his death, he heard neither during his lifetime. During the 1920s and 1930s, he composed six additional operas, most lasting nearly five hours and all featuring his own librettos, in Hungarian, and a very large orchestra, all without any impetus of an impending production, working in almost complete isolation in an apartment in the Bronx.Walter Ivan Von Wayditch, son of Gabriel Von Wayditch (1888–1969) (2001). \\"How to preserve the legacy of important American composers after they die\\", NewMusicBox.org. In addition to requiring a very large orchestra and being written in Hungarian, a language spoken by few Americans (although Wayditch also provided an alternate English text), many of Wayditch's operas contain other impracticalities. Most last nearly five hours, many call for frequent scene changes, and all have plots involving intricate historical myths that take place in exotic lands, in ancient times, or on other planets. Though the early operas were post-Romantic in style, the later works are much more modern and are heavily dissonant. For each opera, Wayditch notated by hand a full orchestral score and a piano reduction, though he produced no separate parts for individual players. The only opera staged in his lifetime was the ancient Egyptian-themed Horus, which was presented by the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia on January 5, 1939 with Fritz Mahler conducting. The performance received a negative review in the Philadelphia Inquirer from Henry Pleasants,Oteri, Frank J. (2009). \\"Enter the World of Gabriel von Wayditch \\", ExtremelyHungary.org.

In the 1940s, Wayditch composed another four large scale operas, still with no promise of eventual performance. In the 1950s, he served as the pianist for the Morningside Trio, which concertized throughout New York City and also taught music lessons at a studio near his apartment. Despite his abilities as a pianist, Wayditch never composed any additional compositions for the piano and apart from two songs for voice and piano and a quintet arrangement, Lullaby, derived from his 1925 opera Mária Testvér, he composed no chamber music. For the next 20 years, the only other composition he worked on for the remainder of his life was a massive eight-hour-long opera, Eretnekek (The Heretics), for which he completed a piano-vocal score. Wayditch died while writing out the 2,850th page of the orchestral score for that work. Still, The Heretics is cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest opera ever written.\\"Longest Opera\\", GuinnessWorldRecords.com. Accessed: May 31, 2014.Oteri, Frank J.. \\"Finding a Home for the Longest Opera Ever Written\\", NewMusicBox.org. Though Wayditch's prodigious output was practically unknown during his lifetime, there has been some interest in his music over the past decades. Two of his early operas – The Caliph's Magician (1917) and Jesus Before Herod (1918) – were released on LP recordings by Musical Heritage Society in the 1970s. The former featured the orchestra, chorus and soloists of the Budapest Opera conducted by Andras Korodi, and was sung using Wayditch's original Hungarian text. The latter was sung in an English translation in a production featuring the San Diego Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Peter Eros. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang Wayditch's Prayer from Maria Testver on a nationally televised broadcast. In 1984, on the fifteenth anniversary of his death, all of the commercially released recordings of Wayditch's music along with private recordings of excerpts and extracts from other works were featured in the Gabriel Von Wayditch Memorial Broadcast aired on WKCR-FM, the radio station of Columbia University. In the 1990s, the three MHS LPs were re-issued in a 2 CD package by VAI.\\"CDs: The Caliph's Magician & Jesus Before Herod (Von Wayditch)\\", VaiMusic.com.

Given the long gap in time, however, Gao et al. (2005) cautioned that these remains could constitute a different, as-yet undetermined genus. In their description of new material of Khurendukhosaurus, Matsumoto et al. (2009) agreed that the putative Cretaceous occurrence of Cteniogenys did not belong to that genus and represents an indeterminate choristoderan.Matsumoto, R, Suzuki, S, Tsogtbaatar, K, Evans, SE, 2009. New material of the enigmatic reptile Khurendukhosaurus (Diapsida: Choristodera) from Mongolia. Naturwissenschaften 96:233–242. Systematics The genus was named in 1928 by Charles W. Gilmore on the basis of a lower jaw collected during the late 19th century by Othniel Charles Marsh's workers at Como Bluff. He tentatively described the genus as a lizard, noting that it could instead be a frog. New material of Cteniogenys from Europe prompted Susan E. Evans to reclassify it as an early choristodere in 1989. To date it is only known from fragmentary specimens. Description Cteniogenys was long, and probably weighed less than . The skull of this genus was long and slender, and the jaws had numerous conical teeth. Cteniogenys in the Morrison probably fed on insects and small fish. It is mostly known from freshwater sites (rivers and ponds), and is a rare find in the formation (only 60 specimens out of over 2,800 total vertebrate specimens known from the formation), mostly known from northern outcrops (particularly Wyoming); this may reflect a preservation bias against small animals in terrestrial settings, rather than an accurate reflection of Cteniogenys populations in the Morrison.

At vertical depth, it stands joint sixth with Poulnagree in County Clare in the deepest caves on the island of Ireland. The cave is recorded at in length (making it the sixth-longest on the island of Ireland), but exploration is ongoing and further passage is expected to be found.  Description  The cave consists in the main of a large mainstream passage running to a terminal sump. The water flowing in the cave has been dye traced to Shannon Pot, two kilometres to the west of the terminal sump, which is the traditional source of the River Shannon. Inlets to the main passage are numerous. Some, such as the large \\"Mistake Passage\\" have been pushed only a short distance. Since the cave is undergoing active exploration, there remain many issues to be sorted out and the sinks for many of these inlets remains unclear. The stream passage itself is of considerable proportions in parts, but also contains many higher level fossil passages which have been deserted by the stream. The cave contains numerous calcite formations, with large amounts of helictites in places. Boulder chokes are frequent with several parts of the cave being quite unstable, especially the JCP passage.  Location  While the location of the entrance to the cave is in County Fermanagh, the majority of the cave lies under County Cavan. The original entrance to the cave was in Cavan; however, this is now inaccessible. The current entrance of Polltullyard is located north of the Marlbank area of Fermanagh, high in the moors.  Exploration history = 1980s: Discovery and initial exploration = The cave was discovered in August 1980 by members of the Reyfad Group, the cavers' collective responsible for exploring the Reyfad system. The entrance was made in a shakehole adjacent to the sink point of the Hune (pronounced \\"honey\\") stream, and close the border in County Cavan. This entrance became known as \\"Pollahune\\". The initial route was dug through a highly unstable area of glacial fill, making it extremely treacherous. Once in the cave the cavers encountered a \\"main\\" streamway into which the Hune flowed, with the upstream section leading to \\"JCP Passage\\" and the downstream section passing another significant inlet, \\"Mistake Passage\\". By the end of August, the team had progressed past several boulder chokes and explored cave passages some in length. Downstream, the team reached a terminus at a prominent boulder choke, through which they attempted to dig. In October 1980 a section of the choke collapsed on Rev. George Pitt while he attempted to force a passage at river level. He became trapped for 10 hours, but was freed after a major rescue effort. By 1990 the explorers had passed the newly named George's Choke. The end of the cave was reached, downstream, at the terminal sump (sump 3) beneath another large boulder choke, and the extension to this point was named \\"The Mayfly Extension\\". While discoveries were being made in Shannon Cave in 1980, attention was also being paid to a large doline less than a kilometre away in County Fermanagh. Members of the Reyfad Group (including the aforementioned Rev. Pitt) and the Irish Caving Club worked together to dig their way into passage leading to a underground shaft, with boulder chokes and crawls at its base. They named this cave Co-operation Pot in honour of their collaboration, but later the name Polltullyard, after the local townland, was adopted. = 1990s–2000s: Pollahune collapse and new entrance = The Pollahune entrance to Shannon was always dangerous, often dumping rocks on passing cavers and finally in 1995 it collapsed, making the cave inaccessible. During subsequent years attention was turned to Polltullyard, the downstream end of which lay within of upstream JCP Passage, according to the surveys. Various groups of cavers attempted to dig through the terminal boulder choke, but none were successful in stabilising the passage. In 2004 cavers from the Shannon Group began in earnest to attempt to re-enter the system, and initiated a new dig in the direction of Shannon Cave. By 2005 Shannon Cave had been re-entered via a very tight section of passage named the \\"Rebirth Canal\\". The cavers had regained JCP Passage, and access to the rest of the cave as far as George's Choke, which had collapsed again as reported by cavers on the last trip into Shannon Cave. In 2007, after two years' work digging and stabilising, George's Choke was passed. The explorers reached the terminal sump, the first people to do so in twelve years. = 2008: Saint Patrick's Extension = A new dig began on a balcony above the terminal sump, attempting to push a route through the boulder choke, but progress was slow and the choke proved unstable. In early 2008 a team of British cave divers were invited over to dive the sump, now named \\"Young, Free and Desperate\\". After the divers emerged at the far side of the choke and made a voice connection with the dry cavers on the other side. After exploring downstream for one kilometre they returned to help dig from the other side of the choke. A connection was made a week later, after a further dive. of cave was surveyed beyond the choke. This began with a short stretch of passage leading to sump 4, which was then bypassed from above, leading to of unbroken canyon passage. The extension eventually terminated at a new terminal sump. The new section was named \\"St. Patrick's Extension\\", and the canyon passage named \\"Paddy's Parade\\". The sump, number 5 in the system, was named \\"Long Way From Home\\". > \\"Downstream of sump 4 the streamway comprises c. 450 m of fine canyon > passage. ... [It] is perhaps one of the grandest sections of canyon passage > in Ireland but on a striking scale. The passage is about 1–2 metres wide and > ranges from 8 to 14 metres in height. There is also evidence of old high- > level passage with a few rift/high level passage leads.\\" = 2009: Easter Extension = Methodical exploration of high-level leads in St. Patrick's Extension in 2009 led to the discovery of a tight cross-rift intercepting a section of \\"Paddy's Parade\\" at right-angles. The dry, tightly meandering rift, the \\"Snake Escape\\", was followed for to a upward pitch, from the top of which led of crawling passage to a number of deep pitch heads. The last of these pitches was found to take a small stream, which was followed at the base of the pitch to a sump. Although it has not been traced, it is likely that this stream joins the main Shannon Cave watercourse further downstream of the Snake Escape. Upstream, beyond the pitches, a further of active stream passage was followed upstream to a sump. The total surveyed length of all branches in the extension came to .

It shares most skull features with modern snakes, but notably does not have the lateral notches in the lower jaw found in modern snakes. Its vertebrae share all diagnostic features of later snakes. Analysis of Parviraptor fossils supports the hypothesis that snake ancestors evolved snakelike heads earlier than snakelike bodies.

Development The SZD-12 Mucha (Fly) 100 was derived from the IS-2 Mucha-ter for use by aero clubs throughout Poland.http://www.piotrp.de/SZYBOWCE/pszd12.htm Two hundred and ninety were built with 73 exported to several countries and an unknown number were licence-built in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Constructed from wood/plywood throughout, the Mucha 100 was much improved from the IS-2 Mucha, with smoother surfaces, better aerodynamics and comprehensive instruments and equipment including a KF-18 oxygen system, lighting and instruments for cloud flying. Pilot comfort was improved by slightly reclining the seat back and increasing legroom, and visibility was increased through a larger one-piece cockpit canopy. Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes replaced the DFS style airbrakes of the IS-2, external mass balances fitted to the ailerons cured the tendency to flutter. The wing incidence was reduced to 2° to better align the fuselage with the airflow at higher speeds, reducing drag. Main designer was Władysław Okarmus, constructors were Jan Dyrek and Zbigniew Badura. Babiejczuk, Janusz and Grzegorzewski, Jerzy.

Flight trials commenced on 14 November 1953 in Krosno (first flight by Adam Zientek); a tendency to control surface flutter was resolved by mass balancing. After this and other improvements, the Mucha 100 was cleared for production as the SZD-12 Mucha 100. from 1954. 256 were built in ZSLS in Krosno, 14 in Gdańsk and 20 in Wrocław. Further improvements were incorporated into the SZD-12A Mucha 100A, which had the external mass balances replaced by weights in the leading edges of the ailerons, forward of the hinges. Another modification which was also applied retrospectively to earlier units was a re-located mainwheel, moved rearwards to reduce the weight on the tailwheel during ground handling. 70 Mucha 100's were exported, mostly to the USSR, DDR, Italy, Switzerland and China in multiple orders; single examples were also exported to Austria, France, Finland and India.

Their ability and motivation to mate are primarily independent of day-length (photoperiod) and instead rely on cues from short-term changes in local conditions like rainfall, food abundance and temperature. Another factor is the presence of suitable breeding sites, which may only form with heavy rain or other environmental changes.WE Duellman, L Trueb. Biology of amphibians. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 20 Thus, they are distinct from seasonal breeders that rely on changes in day length to induce entry into estrus and to cue mating, and continuous breeders like humans that can mate year-round. Other categories of breeders that perhaps can be subdivided under the heading \\"opportunistic\\" have been used to describe many species, such as many that are anurans like frogs. These include sporadic wet and sporadic dry, describing animals that breed sporadically not always under favorable conditions of rain or lack thereof. Many opportunistic breeders are non-mammals. Those that are mammals tend to be small rodents.Malpoux B. The Neuroendocrine Control of Seasonal Rhythms. In: Conn PM, Freeman ME, ed., Neuroendocrinology in physiology and medicine. Humana Press, 1999, p. 437 Since changes in season can coincide with favorable changes in environment, the distinction between seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always perceptible and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.Martin R, Johnson P. Bennett's Tree-kangaroo. In: R. Straham, ed., Mammals of Australia, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995, pp. 307-8, Additionally, opportunists can have qualities of seasonal breeders. The red crossbill exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, in order to breed. Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development. Physiology Opportunistic breeders are typically capable of breeding at any time or becoming fertile within a short period of time. An example is the golden spiny mouse where changes in dietary salt in its desert habitat due to rainfall appear to cue reproductive function. Increased levels of salinity in drying vegetation cause females to experience a reproductive hiatus. While reproduction is generally independent of photoperiod, animals can still experience reduced fertility with changes in day-length.

Life in Russian Empire  Jazep Sažyč was born in Haradziečna (now in Navahrudak district, Hrodna Voblast). He graduated from a Polish gymnasium in Navahrudak. In 1938 he was mobilized into the Polish army where he underwent an officer training course. During the German invasion of Poland Sažyč was commander of a minor military unit. He got wounded and taken by the Germans as a POW. He was later transferred to a hospital in Łódź from where he managed to get to Białystok and later to Navahrudak. He worked as an accountant in a village store and became enlisted as student to the University of Lviv. However, with Germany attacking the USSR Sažyč was mobilized into the Red Army. He soon deserted and returned to Lviv, where he worked at a shop and supported the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. He then went back to Navahrudak where he joined Belarusian collaborators organizing Belarusian military units. Sažyč served in the local pro-German police. In 1942 he was appointed commandant of the Under Officer School of the Belarusian Self Help. In February 1943 he was given the task to organize a Belarusian railway guard unit in Lida. From July 1943 he taught at an officer school in Minsk. In early 1944 Jazep Sažyč joined the Biełaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona and, at the same time, the Belarusian Independence Party.  In emigration  In July 1944 Sažyč left Belarus to the Western Front in Saarbrücken. The Belarusian undercover government gave him the task to establish contacts with the French Resistance. However, as the Germans got to know about that, Sažyč was immediately transferred to Berlin. In Berlin he was participating in training the Čorny Kot partisan troupe and was commandant of the officer school of the 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Belarussian). After the war ended he landed in Thuringia, later moved to Hessen. After that he studied Medicine at the University of Marburg. Upon graduation, in 1950 he left for the United States, where he worked as anesthesiologist and became actively involved in the life of the Belarusian diaspora in the USA. Jazep Sažyč was one of the founders of the Belarusian-American Association in Michigan. From 1953 he was member of the Belarusian People's Republic government in exile; between 1982–1997 he was the government's president. He died in Detroit, Michigan in 2007.

Early life  Sidney was the youngest son of the German clockmaker Gustav Horstmann, who moved to England about 1850. Gustav designed the world's first micrometer with an accuracy greater than 1/10000 of an inch. Sidney was born in Bath.  Horstmann Gear  In 1904, Horstmann and his brothers founded Horstmann Gear to produce a variable speed gearbox he had invented for cars and motorcycles. The firm later became a general engineering company and came to specialise in gas street lighting controls, time switches, gauges, and latterly central heating controls. They also worked with William Friese-Greene in the development of the first cameras for moving celluloid film. In 1915 a large factory, Newbridge Works, was opened in a former dance hall at Newbridge, Bath, and subsequently Newbridge was used as a trade mark. In 1994 the Horstmann family sold their remaining shares in Horstmann Gear and Horstmann Group became part of Clayhithe plc, which in 1998 was acquired by Roxspur plc. The factory was moved from Newbridge to Bristol in 2000. In 2001 the company became Horstmann Controls.  Horstmann Cars  In 1913, Horstmann founded an automotive company, Horstmann Cars, which was later renamed to Horstman Cars. Car production ceased in 1929, by which time 1,500 or 3,000 cars had been made. He was responsible for developing a tracked coil spring suspension system known as the Horstmann bogie, which is used on many Western (particularly British) tanks, including the Centurion and Chieftain. He patented this system in 1922, some nine years prior to Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's similar system which was featured in many German tanks in the Second World War. The suspension company eventually became Horstman Defence Systems which () retains a site in Bath.  Hadrill and Horstmann  After the Second World War Horstmann formed a new electrical engineering company with G. C. T Hadrill, named Hadrill and Horstmann Ltd. They were most famous for the Counterpoise Lamps they produced, which are now collectors items. The company was acquired in 1955 by Simms Group, which also acquired Horstman Ltd.  Awards  Horstmann was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours, in his role as managing director of Horstmann Cars Limited.

He was the first commanding officer of Marine aircraft squadron VMF(N)-533, then known as \\"Black Mac's Killers\\" , and led that squadron during the Battle of the Marshall Islands and Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Biography=Early years and beginning of military career= Magruder was born to William Marion Magruder and Augusta Tong Magruder of 456 Rose Lane, Lexington, Kentucky. He was the third of four children; his siblings were Aliene, Eldon and Jane Magruder. He graduated with Honors from the University of Kentucky on May 22, 1936, with a B.A. in psychology. He was the undefeated Golden Gloves Welter Weight Boxing Champion of the University of Kentucky, a member of the Sword and Scabbard Military Fraternity and a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. The governor of Kentucky commissioned him a Kentucky colonel, and the mayor of Lexington presented him with the \\"Key to the City of Lexington\\". After graduating from the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at the University of Kentucky, Magruder accepted an officer's commission in the United States Marine Corps on July 1, 1936, becoming a second lieutenant. On July 5, 1938, Magruder reported for Flight School at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. After graduating as Naval Aviator #6008, he was promoted to first lieutenant. Magruder was assigned to squadron VMF-1 at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia. He was promoted to captain in 1940. In the spring of 1941 he became assistant material officer, Division of Aviation, Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. In August 1942 Magruder was promoted to major. =World War II= On February 6, 1943, Major Magruder was deployed to England for a 3-month stint to learn as much as possible about Radar Intercept Night Fighting from the Royal Air Force (RAF). The United States Navy critically needed to establish effective night fighting capabilities for the Pacific Campaign. Magruder was assigned to develop the U.S. Naval Radar Intercept Doctrine that entailed extensive modification of the British system into an almost totally different operational syllabus. Admiral John S. McCain Sr., then Director Aircraft Pacific, required a single- pilot, single-engine aircraft that was capable of operating from a carrier while the British utilized a two-seat fighter that employed an onboard radar operator. Magruder reconfigured the system to include a remote ground control intercept (GCI) radar operator to coordinate exclusively with his designated pilot, to give him a vector close enough to the target for the pilot's own shorter-range radar to locate the target. In June 1943 Magruder was assigned as Night Fighter Training Officer at the newly formed Marine Aircraft Group 53 (MAG-53) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. On October 1, 1943, Magruder became the commanding officer of the newly formed VMF(N)-533, which eventually took the nickname \\"Black Mac's Killers\\". VMF(N)-533 was the first Marine Corps squadron to receive the F6F-3(N) Hellcat night fighter. In November 1943 Magruder was promoted to lieutenant colonel. After a difficult radar intercept training program, the squadron deployed to Enewetak Atoll on May 6, 1944, to take over the night defense of the area. On July 6, 1944, Magruder's squadron also set up a rotating contingent on Roi Island and Kwajalein Atoll for their night defense. On November 30, 1944, \\"Black Mac's Killers\\" moved its base of operations from Enewetak to Engebi. On May 7, 1945, VMF(N)-533, with three days notice, was ordered to deploy to Yontan Airfield on Okinawa to shore up sagging night defenses during the Battle of Okinawa. With just a skeleton crew of fifteen pilots flying their fifteen Hellcats, and an extra thirteen officers (8 extra pilots, a flight surgeon, flight director and three key department heads), along with 57 enlisted men flying in 5 transport aircraft provided squadron VMR-252 with whatever spare parts and gear that could be squeezed on board; they departed on the longest over-water flight of single-engine fighters in World War II. The remainder of the squadron personnel and equipment followed by sea on LSTs and would not link up again with this skeleton crew for more than a month. Arriving on May 14, 1945, at Yontan Field, the squadron was operational in 36 hours. Magruder's squadron scored its first night intercepts on May 18, 1945 when two of his pilots conducted five radar assisted night kils. On June 15, 1945, the squadron moved operations from Yontan Air Field to Charlie Air Strip, Ie Shima where they joined the rest of the squadron personnel and served out the remainder of the war. In spite of the fact that VMF(N)-533 arrived 40 days after the campaign for Okinawa began, with terrible weather throughout, \\"Black Mac's Killers\\" registered 35 enemy aircraft victories and 1 probable all Radar Intercepts, which was almost as many aircraft destroyed as all three other night fighter squadrons on Okinawa, combined. VMF(N)-533 was the top scoring Night Fighter Squadron of the Pacific Theater in World War II. VMF(N)-533 had the best safety record and the highest combat ready rate for any operational squadron in the Pacific. In 15 months of overseas deployments, the 'Killers' logged over 11,000 flight hours. For this action, the squadron were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. On July 8, 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Magruder transferred command of VMF(N)-533 to his executive officer and returned to the United States for a War Bond Tour. Shortly after V-J Day, September 1945, Magruder became the commanding officer of Marine Aircraft Group 53 (a fully integrated Night Fighter Command) at Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas. The group consisted of seven tactical squadrons, one service and support squadron, one headquarters squadron, one ground control radar squadron and one ground control approach radar unit. This totalled nearly 2400 officers and men with 146 aircraft. At the time this was the largest aircraft group in Marine Aviation. In February 1946, MAG-53 moved operations back to MCAS Cherry Point. In August 1946 Magruder assumed command of Marine Aircraft Group 31. =Education and joint billets= From July 1947 to July 1948, Lieutenant Colonel Magruder attended and graduated from the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He co-wrote the thesis \\"The Impact and Role of Missiles In a War During the Foreseeable Future 5–10 Years.\\" From August 1948 to May 1950, Magruder was assigned as instructor to Senior Course, Aviation Section Marine Corps Schools, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. In June 1950, Magruder was assigned to the chief of staff of Commander-in-Chief Europe, Heidelberg, Germany. Magruder was the only Marine officer assigned to this theater command. For this assignment Admiral Forrest Sherman, Chief of Naval Operations, after interviewing numerous senior Marine officers, personally selected Magruder for this special duty. Magruder became assistant head of the Plans Branch of the Operations, Plans, Organization and Training Division of the European Unified Combatant Command. Responsibilities included: Preparation and presentation of many U.S. \\"Eyes Only\\" plans to be placed into operation in the event of emergency and/or war, including \\"Operation Blast Proof\\". As a member of the senior U.S. Command in Europe, Magruder was responsible for coordinating complete plans with all other major commands in Europe as well as many high level civil authorities in Germany, France and England. On January 1, 1951, Magruder was promoted to colonel. In July 1952, Colonel Magruder was assigned as Assistant Head of Plans and Operations Branch, Division of Aviation, Headquarters, Marine Corps. Responsibilities required preparation and presentation of many plans and staff studies for the training and operations of all Marine Corps Aviation, and determining operational requirements for aircraft and new aircraft characteristics in presentations to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and Chief of Naval Operations. Magruder participated in the planning, preparation and coordination of the Aviation portion of the Marine Corps overall budgets. From July 1954 to June 1955, Magruder attended and graduated from the National War College. His thesis, \\"Nuclear Weapons – An Instrument of National Policy\\" was classified and, because of its strategic implications, was not released for publication. =Back to the Fleet= From July 1955 through June 1956, Colonel Magruder commanded Marine Aircraft Group 11 at Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan. This was the largest Marine Aircraft Group in the Far East and consisted of five fighter attack squadrons, one GCI radar station, one air base squadron for the maintenance and operation of group facilities and heavy group-level aircraft maintenance, along with one headquarters squadron. The group consisted of 1,860 officers and men and 126 aircraft. MAG-11 conducted continuous round- the-clock air operations providing for the airborne defense of Japan, and maintained readiness for immediate movement of all aircraft, to include all classes of materiel and supplies to sustain the group for 90 days of combat to any area of the Far East. Duties included maintaining the on-site storing and employing of tactical nuclear weapons and conventional weapons in coordination with the commanding general, U.S. Air Forces, Japan. Magruder's MAG-11 also provided secure basing facilities for the Central Intelligence Agency's U-2 program. From August 1956 to June 1958, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff G-4 (logistics), Fleet Marine Force, Pacific located at Camp H. M. Smith, Hawaii. This encompassed the largest single command in the Marine Corps – 2 Marine Divisions, 1 brigade, and 2 aircraft wings consisting of a total of 65,000 officers and men and 800 aircraft, with units located on the West Coast, Hawaii, Japan and Okinawa. Soon thereafter Magruder became head of the General Staff Section, G-4. Magruder coordinated and supervised the continuous flow of all classes of material for the training and operations of all elements of the command. His next assignment was from June 1958 through June 1960, as commanding officer of Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The Air Station encompassed the greater part of the Kaneohe Peninsula— of industrial and barracks buildings to include 5 large aircraft hangars, extensive bomb and ordnance storage, including tactical nuclear weapons and air-sea rescue facilities. On June 12, 1960, Magruder prepared for and was host of President Eisenhower and his staff of 62 VIPs. (The President originally planned a three-day visit to MCAS Kaneohe Bay; however it was extended to five days when riots in Japan forced the cancellation of that State visit.) In August 1960, Magruder was assigned as director, 12th Marine Corps Reserve, Recruitment District headquartered in San Francisco, California. This posting included responsibility for training, operational readiness, logistical support, preparation and justification of budgets and operation of district offices and branch offices, 42 reserve units of company and battalion size, 5 recruiting stations and 81 substations located throughout the district encompassing 9 Western States—400 officers and 10,000 men. This command ranked 6th out of 7 districts when Magruder assumed command. Within 8 months this district placed first among all U.S. Districts in recruiting and retention of Marine Corps personnel and force readiness. On August 31, 1961, Colonel Magruder retired from active duty after 26 years of service in the U.S. Marine Corps. Later life On January 1, 1962, Magruder began his civilian career, becoming the assistant to the president of Stanley Aviation in Aurora, Colorado. On August 1, 1963, Magruder became executive vice president of Peoples Bank and Trust in Aurora, and on April 29, 1964, he became president of his own corporation, The M's Inc., with the purchase of his first McDonald's franchise in Grand Junction, Colorado. Within 15 years, Magruder placed all five of his sons in McDonald's franchises in Colorado, Arizona and California. Magruder continued to be involved in national affairs with communications and associations with military and civil authorities on the highest levels. Magruder served on a number of 'national policy boards' and organizations, and was a lifelong Rotarian. Magruder died on his 86th birthday, June 27, 1997 in Paradise Valley, Arizona.

It is the successor to the X1. Features include a 3.2-inch touchscreen, a sliding arc keyboard, 8.1 MP camera, Wi-Fi, GPS and 3G, among others. It runs Windows Mobile 6.5 and the home screen can be customised to the normal Windows 6.5 home screen, Xperia panels or an isometric pixel art city. Some mobile telephony news sites have suggested that the Xperia X2 may be the last Sony Ericsson phone to use the Windows Mobile operating system, as Sony Ericsson concentrates its efforts on Google's Android platform. The successor to the Xperia X2 is the Xperia X10, which runs on Android. Vodafone cancelled plans to exclusively offer the phone. In April 2010, Sony Ericsson launched its first upgrade (MR1). It upgraded Windows Mobile from 6.5.1 to 6.5.2 (which improved both the stability and usability of the device), it brought in the use of video telephony, an FM radio and it introduced fast GPS to get a quicker fix. As well as all this, MR1 upgraded many of the applications in the phone to improve speed and usability and fix any bugs. The second update MR2 went live in May and Windows Mobile was updated to the 6.5.3. This was a significant upgrade in terms of usability, performance, power management and the browser experience. Despite that MR2 was undoubtedly a move in the right direction, most of users who send their feedback on official Sony Ericsson product blog, developer forums and Sony Ericsson fan sites continue to complain that even after MR2 device is still unstable and lacks some key features such as support for Bluetooth remote SIM access (rSAP) profile which make X2 unable to pair with any modern premium car kits which are built into Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Skoda etc. – an essential feature for business users and executives who were intended to be the main target customers for the handset. After the MR2 upgrade, Sony Ericsson ceased development for the phone. This decision from the Sony Ericsson management was an unfortunate move, because the phone still contained multiple bugs that made life difficult for its users. The phone still contains a serious bug that corrupts the SD-card's content, and makes it an unreliable tool for business-users. Many users confirmed this bug, and one user on the Xda-forum figured out the cause to this bug. Due to the dropped support from Sony Ericsson, a fix to the data-loss bug was introduced on the forum.

The official record of 130.0 meters was achieved by Fredrik Bjerkeengen of Norway on February 10, 2008. Competitions Snowflake has hosted numerous FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup and United States Ski and Snowboard Association tournaments. After hosting SuperTour events in 2009 and 2010, the ski jumping hill hosted the fourth competition of the newly formed five-hill US Cup in February 2011. In addition to U.S. and international events, Snowflake is also host to annual junior ski jumping events on the smaller hills adjacent to the large hill. The four smaller hills have K-spots of 10, 20, 40, and 65 meters. Snowflake Ski and Golf Club Formed in 1922 as the Westby Ski Club, the all-volunteer club held the first ski jumping tournament southeast of Westby, near Bloomingdale, Wisconsin in 1923. Following several successful tournaments, the club was renamed the Snowflake Ski Club in 1925. After hosting tournaments on three different hills, the larger and more modern jump, which is used today, was constructed in 1960. The first tournament held on the current hill was in late January 1961. A nine- hole golf course was built to aid in funding the annual ski jumping tournament.

Sherry is traditionally served in one of two measures: a clipper, the smaller measure, or a schooner, the larger measure, both named after the sort of ships that brought sherry over from Spain. The schooner name was more particular to Bristol, to where most sherry was imported, stored and bottled. It is usually served on its own.

Biography Gabriel Kahane is the son of a psychologist mother and the concert pianist and conductor Jeffrey Kahane. He attended the New England Conservatory before transferring to Brown University, where he wrote his first musical and graduated with a bachelor's degree in music. Kahane currently lives in Brooklyn and performs his original songs in venues across the United States. Songwriter Gabriel Kahane’s style is eclectic, most often mixing his classical background with modern folk-pop influences. He is often compared to Sufjan Stevens and Rufus Wainwright and has collaborated with both of these artists. Kahane released a self-titled album, Gabriel Kahane, on Family Records in 2008, receiving positive reviews. In September 2011, Kahane released his second singer-songwriter album, Where Are The Arms, on StorySound Records. It was recorded with many of his regular collaborators, including Rob Moose on violin and guitar, Matt Johnson on drums, and Casey Foubert, who also helped mix and produce it, on various instruments. These three musicians would also collaborate with him on his next album, The Ambassador. For his 2014 album, The Ambassador, he used ten addresses in L.A. to write songs from the perspectives of characters both real and imaginary. The album was featured in Rolling Stone, Vogue, and Paste, and Kahane also wrote a piece about exploring L.A. through music for The New Yorker. The album was staged by Tony-award winner John Tiffany with set design by Tony-award winner Christine Jones at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Carolina Performing Arts in the fall of 2014 and at University of California, Los Angeles in the spring of 2015. The song \\"Empire Liquor Mart (9127 S. Figueroa St.)\\" from The Ambassador was selected by NPR as one of their NPR Music's Favorite Songs Of 2014. After the 2016 election, he embarked on a cross-country train trip that yielded the 2018 album Book of Travelers that inextricably links America’s abstract political reality with the human lives it has shaped. Composer and performer Kahane’s best-known work, the song cycle Craigslistlieder, which was his first concert work and was re-released by indie record label Family Records in 2008, sets real Craigslist ads to music. Other artists have covered this voice-and- piano piece, and Audra McDonald has included Craigslistlieder in her standard repertoire. In the spring of 2010, Gabriel Kahane performed as part of the American Songbook at Lincoln Center, garnering praise from the New York Times. During the 2010-11 season, he performed with cellist Alisa Weilerstein in a duo recital featuring music composed by Kahane, including Little Sleep's Head Sprouting Hair in the Moonlight. After writing a piano concerto for Natasha Paremski, he was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet to write The Red Book, a string quartet based on Anne Carson's Autobiography of Red, and by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for a large chamber work. Crane Palimpsest, a work about the Brooklyn Bridge, was conducted by Kahane's father, Jeffrey Kahane, conducting the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Gabriel Kahane backstage at Carnegie Hall As part of his 2012-2013 residency with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Kahane wrote Gabriel's Guide to the 48 States inspired by the American Guide Series, commissioned by the government during the Great Depression. The piece received its New York Premiere at Carnegie Hall in April, 2013 with Orpheus playing and Kahane singing. Other notable compositions include Come On All You Ghosts, a three-part song cycle setting Matthew Zapruder's poetry for a baritone and string quartet, and he frequently performs and records with such artists as Timo Andres, Brooklyn Rider, Rob Moose, and Chris Thile. In August 2019 he was appointed Creative Chair of the Oregon Symphony in Portland, Oregon. Musical theater Gabriel Kahane began to work in theater in New York City after winning a Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival Award for Straight Man, which he wrote in college. He worked with New York theater company Les Freres Corbusier, music directing A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant and the LA production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson for Michael Friedman and Alex Timbers. His musical February House, commissioned by The Public Theater, told the story of a Brooklyn World War II-era commune, where W.H. Auden, Gypsy Rose Lee, Benjamin Britten, Carson McCullers, Jane Bowles, and Paul Bowles all lived together. His album The Ambassador was staged in 2014-15 by Tony-award winner John Tiffany with set design by Tony-award winner Christine Jones.

Life He was born in Lancashire and was educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a sizar in 1585. He graduated B.A. in 1589, becoming a fellow in 1590. He graduated M.A. in 1592; he later proceeded B.D. in 1602 and D.D. in 1613. From 1598 he was preacher to the readers at Gray's Inn, and held the post till his death. In 1601 he was made rector of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, and in 1603 of the neighbouring St. Benet's Sherehog. He resigned the latter in 1606, on his appointment to the vicarage of Chigwell, Essex. In 1609 he succeeded Lancelot Andrewes in the prebend of St. Pancras in St. Paul's, which made him rector and patron, as well as vicar, of Chigwell. Fenton was one of the Second Westminster Company of translators of the King James Bible, dealing with the Epistles of the New Testament. He died 16 January 1615, and was buried under the communion-table. Works Fenton's first work, An Answer to William Alablaster his Motives, was published in 1599, noting that William Alabaster was then a prisoner in the Tower of London. In 1611 Fenton published A Treatise of Usurie, in three books; there was a second edition in 1612. In 1652 there appeared a tract by Robert FilmerQuaestio quodlibetica, or, A discourse, whether it may bee lawfull to take use for money,' with sub-title, An Examination of Dr. Fenton's Treatise of Usury. The author states in his preface that George Downame, Fenton and Andrewes are the noted opponents of usury, in England, but (he continues) 'I have made choice of Dr. Fenton's treatise to examine because it is latest, and I find little of any moment but is in him.' A note by Roger Twysden in Filmer's book suggests it was written three decades before publication. A manuscript in the Cambridge University Library (MS Ff. 5. 25, fos. 17r–22r) contains a contemporary copy of a brief treatise by Fenton, entitled 'De Æquivocatione' (On Equivocation). It is dedicated to Sir Francis Bacon in his capacity as Solicitor-General, and must therefore date from between 1607 and 1613. Like the English treatise Of Usurie this Latin document consists of the resolution of three disputed questions on the subject of the work. Fenton was a popular preacher of the day; one of his sermons, 'Of Simonie and Sacriledge,' was published in 1604, from which it appears that he was at that date chaplain to Sir Thomas Egerton, the lord chancellor. Another was published in 1615, 'Upon Oathes,' preached before the Grocers' Company; and a small volume containing four more appeared in 1616. In 1617, Fenton's successor at Chigwell, Emmanuel Utie, published a posthumous work by Fenton entitled A Treatise against the Necessary Dependence upon that One Head and the present Reconciliation to the Church of Rome. Together with certaine sermons preached in publike assemblies. Utie prefixes a dedication of his own to Sir Francis Bacon, in which he calls the treatise 'the Posthumus [image] of Doctor Fenton', but says that it lacked final revision. In his dedication he alludes to Fenton's earlier dedication of his treatise on usury to Bacon's predecessor as Lord Keeper, Sir Thomas Egerton. The sermons in this volume are six in number, with three of them having been preached before King James.

She ran as a Democrat in the sixth congressional district of Minnesota in 2010. Early life Reed was born to a family that lost their farm in the Great Depression, and she grew up in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, a small rural town in south-western Minnesota. Her father worked for the local Ford dealership. She married Jim Hart, and they have lived in Grant, Minnesota since 1981. Career Reed graduated with a B.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1975 and from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1979.

Her case became a cause célèbre, with organisations such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information and Amnesty International issuing statements in support. Journalist Al-Hussein is a journalist who, at the time of her 2009 arrest, worked for the media department of the United Nations Mission in Sudan. She was known for her public criticism of the government of Sudan's treatment of women. Trousers case=Background= In 2009, the legal system of the country was based on Islamic law (sharia), and permitted judicial corporal punishment such as flagellation. The criminal law of the time prohibited dressing indecently in public, a charge which carried a punishment of 40 lashes and a fine. According to the director of police, in 2008 in Khartoum State alone, over 40 000 women were arrested for clothing offences; it is not known how many were convicted or flogged. Article 152 The full text of Article 152 in the Memorandum to the 1991 Penal Code is: :152 Obscene and Indecent Acts :(1) Whoever does in a public place an indecent act or an act contrary to public morals or wears an obscene outfit or contrary to public morals or causing an annoyance to public feelings shall be punished with flogging which may not exceed forty lashes or with fine or with both. :(2) The act shall be contrary to public morals if it is regarded as such according to the standard of the person's religion or the custom of the country where the act takes place. =Arrest= On 3 July 2009, the Public Order Police entered the Kawkab Elsharq Hall, looking for any women and girls wearing trousers. Al-Hussein — who had come to book a cousin's wedding party and was watching an Egyptian singer and sipped a coke while she waited — was arrested with twelve other women. Ten of them pleaded guilty immediately, were given ten lashes each, and released. Hussein and two other women refused this offer and insisted on a trial. Between the arrest and the trial, Hussein began to publicize the case by printing 500 invitation cards and sending emails with the subject line \\"Sudanese journalist Lubna invites you again to her flogging tomorrow\\". Hussein has used her legal battle as a public platform for attacking article 152, on the grounds that the way it is applied in the Sudan is neither constitutionally, nor dogmatically allowed by Shariah law. Her efforts have led to a public show of solidarity by women in the region, but also violence by Islamic extremists. =Appearances in court= When the case came to trial, the judge offered to dismiss it, pointing out that she enjoyed immunity from prosecution thanks to her United Nations job. Al-Hussein stated that she wished to resign her job, and test the law. If found guilty, she declared her intent to appeal her case to the upper court and even the constitutional court, in an effort to change the law. In Al-Hussein's second appearance in court, on 4 August, the judge again postponed her case, this time for a month, saying he wanted to get advice about whether she was immune from prosecution or not. Outside the courtroom, police fired tear gas at trouser-clad protesters. Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General, stated his concern about the punishment she faces. On 7 September she was found guilty and fined 500 Sudanese pounds, but not sentenced to flogging. She stated that she intended not to pay, and was prepared to face a month in jail instead. This third appearance again featured diplomats and human rights workers observing the case in court, and protesters outside. Journalists counted about 150 of the latter, who were heckled by a smaller number of counter-protesters and beaten by riot police.Sudanese woman found guilty of indecency for wearing trousers vows to fight ruling. The Guardian. 7 Sept 2009 At least 40 protesters were arrested and released on bail. =International media= When Hussein tried to fly to Lebanon in early August 2009 for an interview about her case, the Sudanese authorities prevented her from leaving the country. Outside Sudan, support for her case developed slowly, despite her intimate knowledge of how the media works and her international contacts. The BBC radio programme Woman's Hour discussed the extent to which the case had been ignored by British feminists. =Opposition to the law= Hussein's case became a test case for women's rights in Sudan. Hussein, who considers herself to be a good Muslim and was wearing loose- fitting pants covered by a long blouse,Lubna Al-Hussein, Sudanese Journalist Sentenced to Lashing for Wearing Pants: There Were Dozens of Thousands of Women Like Me excerpts from an interview ... aired on Al-Mihwar TV on December 17, 2009 contends that the case \\"is not about religion, it is about men treating women badly.\\" She stated that she wanted to change the law on behalf of all the women of Sudan. She argued that Article 152, which allows the flogging or fining of anyone who \\"violates public morality or wears indecent clothing\\" without defining \\"indecent clothing\\", itself violates both the 2005 Interim Constitution of Sudan and Sharia. On the eve of Hussein's third appearance in court, Amnesty International (AI) released a statement asking the Sudanese government to repeal Article 152 and drop the charges against her. AI stated that the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights \\"ordered Sudan to amend Article 152 on the grounds that flogging amounted to state-sanctioned torture\\" in 2003. According to an article in Foreign Policy, this case encouraged disparate activists, from NGOs to opposition politicians, to cooperate with one another in their efforts to change the law.Foreign Policy Pants Pants Revolution 5 September 2009 No to Oppression against Women Initiative Hussein and her two colleagues' insistence on going to trial in the trousers case inspired the creation of the No to Oppression against Women Initiative, which a decade later was one of the signatories to the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) declaration on 1 January 2019. The No to Oppression against Women Initiative directly and indirectly, via the FFC, contributed to the 2018–2019 Sudanese Revolution. During the 39-month transition phase to democracy, Ihsan Fagiri, on behalf of the No to Oppression against Women Initiative, protested against the men-only nature of the Khartoum massacre investigation commission created in October 2019. She stated that, as many women had been killed or thrown dead into the Nile, 70 women and men had been raped, and three women rape victims had committed suicide after the massacre, women should be represented as commission members.

It tells the story of Johannes 'Panic' Themba Mzolo (Mogotlane), a small-time thief, set against the backdrop of Apartheid. The film's use of flashbacks between Panic's time at the hands of his apartheid jailor 'Stander' (Marcel Van Heerden) and happenings in the Johannesburg township of Soweto display the injustices black South Africans suffered during apartheid and their struggle for suffrage. The film makes extensive use of political rallies, police brutality, and racial difference to example the effects of apartheid on black South Africans. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. The film was selected as the South African entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Title According to a short quote before the film, Amapanstula is a term used for \\"South African street gangs identified by their style of clothing and music.\\" It goes on to note that, \\"In their harsh surroundings there are no rules and survival of the fittest is the order of the day.\\" Plot Mapantsula begins with cut-scenes between a heated protest and several police vehicles transporting apprehended black South Africans. There is a voice in the background saying that they have violated the Internal Security Act by gathering without permission and inciting a riot. Here we first see Panic who is herded with the rest of the prisoners, including women and children. He is put in a cell with eight other men. There is a cut-scene to a busy Johannesburg street where Panic and his partner in crime, Dingaan (Darlington Michaels), rob a white South African of his wallet, threatening him with a knife when he attempts to get his money back. After, Panic and Dingaan meet up at a local corner store and recount the event. Laughing, Dingaan says, \\"Eh man, we should stop this.\\" Panic replies, \\"You're crazy.\\" Panic then makes his way home to the Soweto township where he rents a small, one-room house from a landlady he refers to as Ma Mobise (Dolly Rathebe). As he dresses up for a night out, she warns him that she wants him to stay out of trouble, commenting he dresses like a tsotsi, or gangster. Back at the prison, Panic is standing separate of the other prisoners. He demands one of them move out of his way and confronts another when asked why he is there. Panic replies, \\"The same reason as you.\\" The others do not believe him. We flashback to Panic at a disco club with his girlfriend Pat and Dingaan. After being hit on by the owner Lucky, she leaves, prompting Panic to go after her. They return to Panic's place. There is another cut to Stander's office where he and Panic are first introduced. Stander asks Panic if he speaks Afrikaans, Panic says he does not. Flashback to Panic's house the morning after they go partying, Panic and Pat part after bickering over him not having a job. Pat leaves and Panic is approached by Ma Mobise about paying his rent. She then lectures him about rising rent prices and how nothing is ever done in Soweto. Her son Sam (Eugene Majola) listens on. Pat in the meantime arrives for work. She is a housemaid to a white South African woman, Joyce (Margaret Michaels). Panic arrives, asking Pat for money. Joyce sends him away. Back in prison, all of the cells are full. Panic is being interrogated by Stander, who is outlining his extensive criminal history. On the last page, he leans back and notes, \\"I see you've been working for us.\\" In another flashback, Panic is trailing an obviously rich woman on the street, eyeing her handbag. But before he has a chance, another man grabs it from her. Panic runs after him. He meets up with Dingaan and Pat in a bar, and recounts that he tripped up the thief and the woman rewarded him. The thief is in fact at the bar and confronts Panic. He is angry about Panic getting out of jail on an earlier occasion, accusing him of selling out to the authorities. Panic breaks a bottle and threatens to kill him. The other man runs. A white officers comes into Panic's cell and accuses all the men there of being terrorists. Panic is then taken to Stander's office, where Stander demands, \\"What do these communists want?\\" Back in Soweto, Panic steals a suit and dons it. He goes to Joyce's house to see Pat. Pat sends him away in anger. He refuses to leave. Joyce arrives and demands him to leave. He refuses. Joyce gets her dog and threatens Panic. He backs away from the house. Leaving, he picks up a brick and throws it through Joyce's window. In Stander's office, the police officer offers Panic coffee and food. He demands information from him about a man named Duma (Peter Sephima). Panic says he does not know him. Upon returning to his cell, he is accused by a fellow inmate of selling out to the authorities. Through another flashback, we find out that Pat has been fired. Sam takes Pat to a local gathering of the National African Congress, where the locals demand for the mayor (Steven Moloi) to keep from raising rents. Duma first appears, speaking out against the mayor and the current order. The next morning, Ma Mobise wakes up a hung over Panic and demands he pay rent. He begrudgingly obliges. Ma Mobise then runs into her son, Sam, on the street. After telling him to stay out of trouble, Sam runs from an approaching police van. Pat, meanwhile, meets with Duma, who urges her to return to Joyce and demand payment for benefits she was denied and the last week's wages. Pat goes to Joyce's, but is rebuffed by her former employer. Panic and Dingaan are in a mall. They spot a rich target and try to once again pull the trick they did earlier in the film. The man resists, grabbing the both of them. Panic stabs him and the two escape to a movie theater. Dingaan tells Panic he wants nothing more to do with him and leaves him. Panic in vain tries to get Pat back by going to her aunt's house. But he is sent away once again. Back in Stander's office, Panic is standing nearly naked in front of the inspector. Stander and another officer nearly throw him out the window as an intimidation tactic. In another cut scene, we see Panic at a local healer's, she tells him that, \\"…the past and future are for dreaming about. The present is for living in.\\" We see Pat meet up with Duma. They go to his office, but the police are searching it. They escape. There is a funeral in Soweto which the police attempt to stop. We see them take away Sam before running from the riotous crowd. Panic comes home and discusses this with Ma Mobise, she says he isn't at the police station. He then goes out looking for Sam. He ends up finding out that Sam has been hanging out with Duma, who is in hiding. Knowing Lucky is his brother, Panic goes to Lucky's. He gets nowhere, even after threatening him. Panic leaves, and we see that two detectives are staking out Lucky's house. Back at the police station, Panic is being humiliated by Stander, crouching naked in a locker room after insisting he does not know Duma. In another flashback, Panic is at Lucky's at night. He finds out Duma is there. Duma runs but Panic catches up with him and demands he leave Pat alone. The detectives staking out Lucky's place chase them but do not catch them. In his office, Stander places something in front of Panic and demands he sign it. Panic refuses. Stander shows him a recording of a riot. Through a quick series of flashbacks we realize that this is a riot protesting Sam's death. Ma Mobise runs in front of the crowd and screams for justice. She is shot and the riot turns into a brawl. Panic and Duma flee but are caught by soldiers. Panic fights them and Duma escapes. In the final scene we see that the papers Stander demands Panic sign are actually a confession that Panic was aiding Duma in terrorist activities. Panic looks into the camera and refuses to sign the confession.

From Boys to Men: Social Constructions of Masculinity in Contemporary Society. Lansdowne South Africa: UCT, 2007. 160-76. Print. Aside from the music heard in Lucky's disco club, the majority of the rest of the music is chanting in Zulu. Most of these songs are sung by the prisoners in the cells with Panic or during the riots. Themes Mapantsula heavily criticizes apartheid, showing how many different black South Africans, some law-abiding citizens, others criminals, are unjustly affected by the institutionalized policy of racism. Panic both exploits the system and is still caught in it. The inevitability of the conflict around him forces Panic to make a decision between personal gain (by confessing Duma is a terrorist to the police and being released) and helping the larger social movement by staying silent about Duma's whereabouts.Aufderheide, Patricia. \\"Mapantusla.\\" American University Library. N.p., 17 September 1996. Web. 18 October 2013. <>. Even though Panic inadvertently helps the police, the very force he's always fought against, he refuses to continue being selfish after Sam's death and Ma Mobisa's murder right in front of him. The film's depiction of criminal life in the global post-colony is one of self-determination. There is no system of justice in Mapantsula, the authorities are instead more interested in the status-quo that true order in a democratic nation. The mayor of Sowato is not elected by the people he supposedly represents and is accused of pocketing the money he gets from raising the rents. This is an example of private indirect government.Comaroff, Jean, and John L. Comaroff. \\"Law and Order in the Postcolony: An Introduction.\\"Law and Disorder in the Postcolony. Chicago: University of Chicago, 2006. 1-56. Print. The crime depicted in Mapantsula is common in South Africa, especially pre-apartheid. The pickpocketing Panic commits is common in South Africa and difficult for the police to investigate. His musings on robbing Joyce also represent the fact that the majority of thefts in South Africa occur out of opportunity and not vengeance or racial discrimination.Altbeker, Antony.

Its last assignment was at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, where it trained combat-ready aircrews and maintained a rapid-reaction capability to execute fighter attacks against enemy forces and facilities world-wide in time of crisis. During its operational lifetime, the 474th was engaged in combat operations during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The 474th Wing was inactivated on 30 September 1989.

On 10 July 1952, the wing was activated at Misawa Air Base, Japan, taking over the personnel and F-84G Thunderjets of the 116th Fighter- Bomber Wing. The number '474' recalled the World War II history of the 474th Fighter Group which included the 428th, 429th, and 430th Fighter Squadrons. It was assigned to TAC, but attached to 5th Air Force until 1 April 1953 for duty in the Korean War. On 10 July 1952, in what was one of the largest air deployments of its kind, the 474th moved to Kunsan Air Base, Korea on the western side of the Korean peninsula, while the 474th Maintenance Squadron moved to Itazuke Air Base, Japan and integrated into the rear-echelon maintenance combined operations for Thunderjet fighters.

Fighter-bomber operations included night interdiction missions and targeted supply, transportation, and troop concentrations. Specific accomplishments included devastating strikes against troop concentrations near Pyongyang, disruption of a MiG attack, and major strikes against a munitions factory and destruction of a political/military instruction center. Missions included night interdiction missions against supplies and lines of communications, escorting Douglas B-26 Invaders on bombing operations in MiG Alley; air defense suppression; armed reconnaissance; and strafing and bombing troops in trenches, bunkers, and shelters, and heavy weapons positions. In January 1953 targeting shifted to communications, training complexes, and rebuilt North Korean assets, including: the Sinanju rail facilities, the Kyomipo industrial area, the Pyongyang Tank and Infantry School, the munitions processing plant near Sunchon, and enemy troop concentrations near Wonsan. On 1 April 1953, the 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing was attached to the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing. As part of the move, the 474th Fighter Bomber Group was detached from the 474th FBW and assumed the personnel and equipment of the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group at Taegu. It was attached to the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing as a reinforced wing, and the 474th Fighter Bomber Wing was reduced to paper status. The 474th FBW was subsequently inactivated on 8 November 1954. This made the 58th the largest fighter-bomber wing in Korea. Only the 430th Squadron actually moved to Taegu. With the coming of spring the 474th contributed significantly to Operation Spring Thaw, a Fifth Air Force program to disrupt communist efforts to move supplies to the front in bad weather. The 474th FBG knocked out supply lines and inhibited their repair. During peak efforts, the 474th FBG pilots often flew four or five missions per day. The 474th Fighter Bomber Group participated in a total of 2207 close support strike. The 474th FBG participated in the destruction of North Korean airfields to prevent a last minute influx of enemy planes and material. \\"On 22 July 1953, in one mission led by Lt. Col. Douglas Montgomery, who was then executive officer of the 474th FBG, 30 out of a total of 40 bombs were placed along the entire length of a runway at the Sunchon Airfield.\\" On the 27 July, just prior to the signing of the truce, the 474th attacked Chunggangjin Airfield in what was one of the last and one of the deepest penetrations of the War. When hostilities stopped, the Armed Forces Assistance to Korea program was launched and the men of the 474th FBG volunteered their off-duty time to work with local villagers in constructing and replenishing a new school building.

It maintained proficiency in tactical fighter operations, deploying components, aircraft, and crews on a global basis in support of NATO, Pacific Air Forces, Alaskan Air Command, and other organizations while flying the North American F-100D Super Sabre. The 474th deployed three squadrons (44 aircraft) to Homestead Air Force Base Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis on 24 October 1962 as part of the Air Division, Provisional, 1st under Brig. Gen. Gordon M. Graham. The entire wing, except for a deployed squadron in Southeast Asia, reverted to paper status on 15 September 1965, and the detached squadron was reduced to paper status upon its return to the United States. The 429th Squadron had been deployed with the F-100D to Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam with the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing on 13 July 1965. The Squadron flew 1627 missions before its return to the U.S. It returned to the U.S. to be inactivated on 16 December 1965. =F-111A operations= 429th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-111A with 16 CBU-52Aircraft is General Dynamics F-111A serial 67065 over Southeast Asia The 474th (Roadrunners) became the first USAF operational wing equipped with the General Dynamics F-111.Thornborough, On 20 January 1968 the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada replacing MAJCON 4480th Tactical Fighter Wing, which had been activated on 15 July 1967,Mueller, giving the base an operational tactical fighter wing assigned to Twelfth Air Force. With the wing, the 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code NA - blue stripe) replaced the 4481st Tactical Fighter Squadron and the existing 429th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code NB - yellow stripe) was assigned. In January 1968 the 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Detachment 1 received the first 6 of 9 \\"Harvest Reaper\\" aircraft [66016, 66017, 66018, 66019, 66020, 66021, 66022, 66024, 66025]: F-111As with the unique camouflage paint job and upgraded avionics (including the ballistics computer unit and fittings for external noise jammers) in preparation for combat evaluation. With the move to Nellis, the 474th Combat Support Group became the base operating host unit. The 428th Squadron reached an initial operational capability in the spring of 1968. In December 1968, Tactical Air Command activated the 4527th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Tail Code ND - green stripe) as a dedicated F-111 pilot training squadron at Nellis. The squadron performed lead-in training for experienced pilots in the F-111. It was replaced in October 1969, transferring its personnel and equipment to the newly activated 442nd Tactical Fighter Training Squadron. On 15 September 1968 the 430th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code NC - red stripe) became part of the Wing. In early 1968, the Air Force decided to send a small detachment of F-111As to Southeast Asia under the Combat Lancer program using the six 428th Squadron Harvest Reaper F-111As that were allocated to Combat Lancer as Detachment 1 under the command of Colonel Ivan H. Dethman, and they departed Nellis for Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base on 15 March 1968. The six F-111s, accompanied by Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker tankers, departed for Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The over 13 hour trip was flown using the F-111's inertial navigation system and with topoff refueling from the tankers, arriving at Andersen on the 16th. The Detachment departed Andersen and arrived at Takhli on 17 March. The detachment was attached to the Republic F-105 Thunderchief-flying 355th Tactical Fighter Wing in what was seen as the first stage in replacement of the 355th Wing's F-105s with the F-111A. F-111 combat operations began on 25 March using the aircraft's unique terrain following radar capability to conduct surprise night deep air interdiction strikes. By the end of the deployment, 55 night low- level missions had been flown against targets in North Vietnam, but three aircraft had been lost. Aircraft 66022, call sign Omaha 77, had been lost on 28 March with the loss of the crew, Colonel Hank McCann and Captain Dennis Graham. On 30 March, the crew of Major Sandy Marquardt and Captain Joe Hodges in aircraft 66017, Hotrod 73, successfully ejected and was recovered uninjured in Thailand. Replacement aircraft had left Nellis, but a third loss halted F-111A combat operations. On 22 April, Tailbone 78, aircraft 66024, crewed by Lieutenant Commander Spade Cooley and by Lieutenant Colonel Ed Palmgren, was lost. After the 3rd loss, the Detachment remained poised for combat, but they saw no combat action before their return to the U.S. on 22 November. The causes of first and third losses continues to be unknown as the wreckage have not been recovered, but there was very little evidence the losses were due to enemy action. The loss on 30 March was not due to enemy action, but was traced to a failure of a hydraulic control-valve rod for the horizontal stabilizer which caused the aircraft to pitch up uncontrollably. Further inspection of the remaining fleet of F-111As revealed 42 aircraft with the same potential failures. It is speculated that this failure could also have contributed to the two other losses had the failure caused a pitch down while at low altitude. These losses caused a storm of controversy in the United States, with Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire denouncing the F-111A as an unsafe and defective plane. However, the Air Force and General Dynamics continued to work hard trying to fix the problems with the F-111A. Modifications to the F-111 took longer than expected, and the wing was not fully operational until July 1971. In September 1971 the Wing started receiving \\"new\\" pilot weapon systems operators directly from graduating pilot training classes, providing a basis for future F-111 experienced aircraft commanders throughout the F-111 fleets worldwide. The Combat Lancer deployment had included right seat pilot weapon system operators, but these were previously fully-qualified F-4 pilots who were \\"unhappily conscripted\\" for the position. After July 1971, the 474th gradually assumed additional operational responsibilities and the various squadrons \\"certified\\" crews on a variety of world-wide targets in support of potential wartime scenarios, including targets in Cuba and the Eastern Bloc. During this period, training became very safety oriented and the wing restricted TFR night flight to visual flight rules conditions at a minimum altitude of 1000 feet above ground level, typically flown at 480 knots true airspeed. Multiple low-level routes had been established throughout the western U.S., and these became the primary routes for training and practice bombing on the Nellis Range, Holbrook, Arizona Radar Bomb Site, and other bombing and electronic warfare ranges in the west. These training practices would later prove to be inadequate in the high-threat environment and varied and sometimes extreme terrain and intense rain conditions of North Vietnam and Laos. On 14 August 1972 the Air Force issued a deployment \\"frag order\\" for the 474th. The 474th returned to Takhli in September 1972 with the Constant Guard V deployment of the 429th and 430th Squadron with 48 F-111As under the command of Wing Commander Colonel William R. Nelson. The deployment included 1,487 support personnel and 40 transport aircraft loads of cargo. The enhanced strike capabilities of the two F-111 squadrons (48 aircraft) allowed them to replace the four F-4D squadrons (72 aircraft) of the 49 TFW, which returned to the U.S. This move also resulted in a reduction of total U.S. forces stationed in Thailand. The two F-111A squadrons arrived to support the last month of Operation Linebacker and all of the Operation Linebacker II bombing offensive against North Vietnam, conducted combat operations in Laos including support of Operation Phou Phiang II and Operation Phou Phiang III using the F-111A's beacon bombing capability in the defense of Long Tieng, and conducted combat operations in Cambodia, again using the F-111's beacon bombing capability. An integral part of the concept of operations for the Constant Guard V deployment was to demonstrate a minimal time (less than 24 hours) from the deployment of the F-111 until the first F-111 combat operations. Twelve 429th F-111s departed Nellis on 27 September, arriving at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam on 28 September. After a 3-hour fueling stop, they departed Andersen on 28 September, using prepositioned fresh crews, and arrived at Takhli that day. Lieutenant Colonel Mat Mathiasen, commander of the 429th TFS flew the first F-111A (67086) into Takhli. Flight crews had been prepositioned by C-141 Starlifter at Takhli. The crews included 429th and 430th Squadron personnel who had already mission planned to fly the first strikes against North Vietnam. An additional 12 429th F-111s departed Nellis on 27 September arriving at Hickam Air Force Base Hawaii the same day. They departed on 28 September arriving at Clark Air Base Philippines on 29 September. They departed Clark on 30 September arriving at Takhli on the same Day. On 29 September, 24 F-111s of the 430th, led by the squadron commander Gene Martin, left Nellis for Hickam. They departed Hickam on 30 September, arriving at Clark on 1 October. Because of complications for movement of units and supplies due to tropical storm Kathy, the 430th was unable to depart Clark for Takhli until 4 October, arriving at Takhli the same day. Unlike the phased approach used by the other combat aircraft where the first 10 missions were to be flown in the lower threat areas of North Vietnam (Route Packages 1-4), The first F-111s were immediately assigned missions in Route Package 5. The initial sorties against North Vietnam were launched the same day (within 3–4 hours) of the arrival on 28 September (Thailand time) of the first aircraft from Nellis. The mission for the F-111 was unique in that the crew was given a weapons load, intended target, and time on target. Everything else in terms of mission planning was left to the flight crew, including ingress, target area, and egress tactics, route, and deconfliction with other F-111s which may fly similar routes or hit nearby targets. The missions were planned without RB-66E electronic countermeasures escort aircraft, air defense suppression aircraft, MiG Cap, or Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. Tactics were all night low-level using TFR and intended for deep strikes to support Operation Linebacker. Airspeed was generally no less than 480 knots, with many crews using 510 or 540 KTAS in the high-threat environment prior to weapons delivery. The development of high-drag weapons had not kept up with the development of the F-111 as a platform to deliver those weapons. As a result, the F-111 was forced to decrease its speed to 500 KTAS for the release of high-drag bombs at low altitude to preclude ripping the fins off the bombs. TFR altitude was generally tied to the threat level, starting at 1000 feet AGL and descending to as low as 200 feet in the high-threat environment. Altitude was typically inversely related to the Radar Homing and Warning System indications from SAM sites - the more threatening the signal the lower the TFR altitude. Egress speeds were generally limited to high sub-sonic speeds at TFR altitudes to avoid the use of afterburner which could light up the aircraft and provide a visual target for ground gunners. Restricting the F-111 to military power, however, did not prevent low altitude egress speeds from occasionally exceeding 660 KTAS. On climb out, once clear of the high-threat area, crews often accelerated to 1.3 mach - the limiting speed on the external ALQ-87 jammer pods - once it was confirmed that there were no hung bombs (bombs that failed to release). Initially, bomb loads for low-altitude deliveries included 12 Mk-82 High Drag (HD) 500 pound bombs for level delivery or 4 Mk-84 2000 pound slick bombs using a stabilized climb. After the first 2 aircraft losses, low-altitude bomb deliveries were generally restricted to 12 Mk-82 HDs. The first loss occurred on the first night, Ranger 23, aircraft 67078, flown by Major Bill Coltman (a Combat Lancer veteran) and 1st Lieutenant Lefty Brett of the 430th TFS. The wreckage was discovered in Laos and remains were identified on 12/19/2001. Following the loss, F-111 combat operations were paused to allow for a maintenance shakedown of all of the aircraft and to allow for a local area orientation and review of tactics for the crews. Immediately following the loss, a Search and Rescue (SAR) effort was initated covering approximately 8400 square miles of Laos and North Vietnam, to no avail. It was terminated on 10 October. F-111 combat operations were reinitiated on 5 October against Linebacker targets (lines of communication, rail yards, marshalling and supply areas, and other targets) using the modified low-level tactics. Crews were given one mission in the RP1-4 regions and one mission in the RP-5 region prior to missions in RP-6 to build confidence and experience. The second aircraft loss occurred on 16 October - Coach 33, flown by Captain Jim Hockridge and 1st Lieutenant Al Graham of the 429th TFS, in aircraft 67060. The North Vietnamese claimed the shootdown and presented the aircrew's ID cards. The weapons load was 4 Mk-84 2000 pound bombs. A thorough SAR effort was conducted following the loss, again to no avail. The aircraft wreckage and remains were identified on 25 October 1977. Following the loss, another reevaluation of tactics occurred and the use of \\"slick\\" bombs in low-altitude deliveries was terminated except for in extraordinary situations. F-111 night low-level strikes continued against North Vietnam until President Nixon ordered the cessation of strikes north of the 20th parallel on 23 October. These F-111 strikes to date demonstrated that the North Vietnamese surface-to- air missiles (SAMs) and MiGs were ineffective in countering the low-level F-111A, and the North Vietnamese focused more on the use of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) against the F-111. Following the 23 October bombing halt and until the initiation of Linebacker II operations on 18 December, F-111 operations focused on the southern portions of North Vietnam in Route Pac 1 (RP1) again using low-level night tactics, and on Laos. The operations in RP1 were against lines of communications, storage areas, air defenses, and other targets. There were 402 sorties flow in RP1 in November. The third loss occurred on 7 November. Major Bob Brown and Major Bob Morrisey of the 430th TFS, Whaler 57, flying 67063, were lost on a night low-level mission. The wreckage was later found on 3 July 1992. On 8 November 1972, the F-111s flew 20 strikes over North Vietnam in weather that grounded other aircraft. The fourth loss occurred on 20 November. Aircraft 67092 was flown by Captain Bob Stafford and Captain Chuck Caffarelli of the 430th TFS, Burger 54, again flying a night low-level mission and using a \\"feet wet\\" egress over the South China Sea. Wreckage of this aircraft washed onshore in South Vietnam, indicating aircraft impact with the sea with wings swept to 72 degrees and no indication of crew ejection. On 21 October 1972 Col. Bill Nelson, wing commander, received a request from the Ambassador of Laos to send an F-111A crew to Vientiane Laos to meet with the Ambassador's air attache. The crew, Colonel Bob Anderson and Major Harry Richard, was briefed on the upcoming North Vietnam Army (NVA) offensive against Skyline Ridge which overlooks Long Tieng and inquired if the F-111 had the capability to support the ongoing Operation Phou Phiang II to counter the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). The answer to the question added a new dimension to F-111 operations with the use of the AN/PPN-18 Radar Beacon for offset bombing in support of friendly forces. This represented a major departure from the initial concept of employment for the aircraft. Radar beacons were deployed under Operation Sentinel Lock at key mountain top locations and used as offset aiming points for medium altitude delivery of 24 MK-82 500 pound bombs or 16 CBU-52 or CBU-58. This technique enabled the F-111 to strike targets developed by Raven FACs, Forward Air Guides, or ground commanders, regardless of day/night or weather conditions, occasionally within 200 meters of friendly forces. Beacons allowed a flexibility to strike preplanned fixed targets or, unique to the F-111, be diverted to real-time high-priority targets in support of troops in contact. Additionally, when weather hindered other aircraft from striking their targets, the F-111 would be used as a pathfinder to guide accompanying F-4 and A-7 aircraft to area targets and provide the bomb release signal. The first successful F-111 beacon bombing mission was flown on 11 November 1972. In an excerpt from a letter by General Vang Pao, Commanding General of Military Region II to the Commander, 474th TFW, “Prior to your arrival in MR II, the enemy had plans and high hopes for offensives against Long Tieng. The F-111, WHISPERING DEATH as it is called, has changed all of that…..your bombs, falling in inclement weather and at all hours of the night have had telling effect on the moral of the North Vietnamese 316th Division. Where once he was making plans to attack, he is now feverishly trying to avoid destruction from the sky.” In December alone, the F-111 flew 522 sorties in Laos, the most of any U.S. aircraft type. The successful beacon bombing program was greatly expanded to include beacons compatible with B-52s being placed alongside those being used by the F-111. The F-111s continued beacon bombing strikes supporting Operation Phou Phiang III, 18 January - March 1973. By the end of the Laos conflict on April 17, 1973, 2392 F-111 sorties had been flown using 7 beacon locations with 91% effectiveness. The last sorties against Laos were flown on 15–17 April, 40 by B-52s and 24 by the F-111s. During Linebacker II, 18 December 1972 - 29 December 1972, the F-111 flew 154 low-level night missions against critical targets in the high-threat air defense environment of Route Pac 6 with two aircraft losses. The Linebacker II operations were flown while the F-111 continued to conduct beacon bombing operations in Laos. The Linebacker II targets included SAM sites, airfields, rail yards, storage areas, lines of communications, and other targets. The next loss occurred on the first night of Linebacker II, on 18 December. Snub 40, aircraft 67099, was flown by Lieutenant Colonel Ron Ward and Lieutenant Colonel Jim McElvain of the 430th TFS. The crew had called off target and had planned to go \\"feet wet\\" over the Tonkin Gulf. The aircraft disappeared soon after going feet wet and wreckage and remains have never been recovered. The 6th and final F-111A combat loss occurred on 22 December. Jackal 33, aircraft 67068, flown by Captain Bob Sponeybarger and 1st Lieutenant Bill Wilson of the 429th TFS, ejected successfully after being hit by ground fire near Hanoi. Captain Sponeybarger was captured after 3 days and Lieutenant Wilson spent a week in escape and evasion (E&E;) before being captured. Both were repatriated on 29 March 1973 after serving time as POWs. The Paris Peace Talks, on 23 January 1973, resulted in an agreement to terminate all U.S. combat operations against North Vietnam effective 28 January 1973 Saigon time. On 15 January the USAF restricted all air strikes on North Vietnam to south of the 20th parallel. The last U.S. air strikes on North Vietnam occurred on 27 January. The 429th and 430th TFS flew slightly more than 4000 combat missions between late September 1972 and mid-March 1973 with excellent success rates in hitting targets even when visibility was near zero. A total of six aircraft were lost in action. The loss rate was assessed to be \\"remarkably similar\\" to that of the Navy A-6 and Air Force F-105 when flying night terrain-following operations. The 474th was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \\"V\\" Device 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973 and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm 28 Sep 1972-22 Feb 1973. The 429th and 430th and, later, the 428th (which replaced the 430th TFS on 22 March 1973) also flew bombing missions against targets in Laos and Cambodia in the midst of the monsoon season. In March 1973 the USAF started inserting 10 beacons in Cambodia. The F-111s again demonstrated they could bomb through an overcast as close as 200 meters from friendly forces. This capability saved Neak Luong from being overrun by enemy forces. On 20 March 1973, Lieutenant Colonel Gene Martin, 430th TFS Commander, and Major Bill young flew the last combat sortie by the 430th. The 428th and 429th continued to conduct beacon bombing and Pathfinder operations in Cambodia as part of the 474th until 30 July 1973. On 7 June 1973 Captain Chris Russo and 1st Lieutenant Chuck Foster of the 429th TFS were the first F-111 crew to fly 100 combat missions in the F-111. 474th F-111A Plaque at USAF Academy Southeast Asia Memorial Pavilion On 23 June 2017 a bronze plaque was dedicated to the 474th TFW organization and the F-111A crews at the Southeast Asia Memorial Pavilion at the United States Air Force Academy. The plaque hangs in honor of the bravery and dedication of all who supported and participated in the 474th TFW F-111A combat operations in Southeast Asia in 1968 and 1972-1973. The 430th returned to the 474th Wing at Nellis on 22 March 1973 assuming a replacement training unit mission, while the 428th and 429th were assigned to the newly transferred 347th Tactical Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho on 30 July 1973 (deployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base). The 347th's F-111s continued to support combat operations in Cambodia until all U.S. air strikes terminated on 15 August 1973. With the end of hostilities in Southeast Asia and the 474th's return to Nellis, its mission was again to train combat-ready forces of aircrews and maintain a rapid- reaction capability to execute fighter attacks against enemy forces and facilities in time of crisis. On 19 July 1975 the Constant Guard V deployment was completed and the 428th and 429th were reassigned to the 474th TFW, Nellis AFB. The last operational F-111As left Nellis for Mountain Home Air Force Base on 2 August 1977 and Colonel Mo Seaver relinquished control of the 474th to Colonel Reginald Davis on 5 August as the F-111 aircraft and crews were transferred to the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing as part of Operation Ready Switch. The F-111A wing left behind at Nellis 3 \\"hanger queens\\" that needed maintenance and Functional Check Flights (FCFs), tail numbers 67056, 67038, and 67102. These were accomplished and the last 474th TFW F-111A to leave Nellis AFB was 67102, flown on 9 August 1977 to McClellan AFB for overhaul by F-111A FCF Pilot Captain Roger (Pete) Peterson and an Australian Air Force exchange Weapon System Operator. =F-4D and F-16A/B operations= 429th TFS F-4D Phantom about 1979 The 474th Wing absorbed the McDonnell F-4 Phantom II aircraft, crews, and resources of the inactivating 4474th Tactical Fighter Wing, which had been activated on 1 March 1977 at Nellis on 5 August 1977, as part of Operation Ready Switch. The 48th Tactical Fighter Wing F-4D Phantoms had been rotated from Lakenheath Air Base in Europe in order for the F-111Fs, previously stationed at Mt. Home AFB, to be stationed at Lakenheath Air Base to give USAF assets in Europe a greater range, weapons carriage, and all- weather capable strike capability. With the transfer of the F-4D from Lakenheath to Nellis, Chesley Burnett Sullenberger III (Sully) was then assigned to the 428th TFS where he attained the rank of captain and served as a flight lead, training officer, and Operation Red Flag Blue Force Mission Commander. The F-4D had a relatively short life, being replaced with new General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcons. The 474th was the third USAF wing to receive Fighting Falcons. It received its first Block 1/5 F-16A/Bs in November 1980, later operated Block 10 F-16A/Bs.Martin, 430 TFS F-16A Block 10C 80-0492 flying over the Grand Canyon in 1986 The wing conducted routine Tactical Air Command training and deployments from Nellis with the F-16s, retaining the Block 10/15 models until September 1989, when the wing was inactivated, the F-16As no longer being considered as front-line aircraft. Instead of re-equipping the wing, the F-16As were transferred to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve squadrons, and the three squadrons resurfacing as General Dynamics-Grumman EF-111A Raven Electronic Warfare Squadrons with the 27th Operations Group (27th Tactical Fighter Wing) at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico.

It was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1982. Involving some of the characters from the preceding Livia, the novel also introduces new ones. It is set before and during World War II, in France, Egypt, Poland and Switzerland. Plot summary The novel is set in the period from the outbreak of World War II in 1939 with the Nazi invasion of Poland, to the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Its settings include Avignon, France; Geneva, Switzerland; Poland, and Egypt. The first chapter continues in Avignon, where the previous novel, Livia (1979), was set. It details Constance's blossoming relationship with her husband Sam. As the clouds of war loom, a group of Europeans is breaking up whose last summer together was explored in Livia. Blanford takes a post in Egypt, kindly offered to him by the Prince. During a visit there from Sam, now a soldier, a picnic trip ends in disaster as the party comes under friendly fire. Sam is killed and Blanford crippled in the attack. Constance has moved to Geneva in neutral Switzerland. She has met Robin Sutcliffe and Toby there (they have previously been described as fictional creations from one of Aubrey Blanford's novels). There she learns of Sam's death. Eventually Constance decides to return to France, where the Vichy regime rules over Provence and the south of France after the Nazi defeat of the country and occupation of Paris and the north. She lives in the big house of Tu Duc, where Livia returns. Disfigured by the loss of an eye (the reasons for which are not given until Quinx, the last novel of the quintet), Livia commits suicide. Constance returns to Geneva, where she embarks on a passionate affair with the Prince's aide Sebastian Affad. Reception The novel was short-listed for the 1982 Booker Prize. American critic John Leonard, writing for The New York Times, was highly critical of Durrell's work in this novel and the previous two books of the Quintet so far: \\"For a novelist like Mr. Durrell, almost any idea is incapacitating, an excuse to abandon his lyric impulse and resort to old, lazy tricks, like one writer talking to another or confiding in his notebook or finding fragments of a third writer's diary. ... Three books into his Gnostic quincunx, one longs for either amnesia or the stake. Memory - 'a dog on your back gnawing at your eyeballs' - is Mr. Durrell's real subject, but so far, sad to report, Proust has nothing to worry about.\\"John Leonard, \\"Books of the Times\\", New York Times, 2 December 1982; 1998; accessed 17 October 2016 ReferencesExternal links *The International Lawrence Durrell Society Official website of ILDS *The Lawrence Durrell Archives 1982 British novels Novels by Lawrence Durrell Novels set in Geneva Faber and Faber books ","title":"Constance (novel)"},{"id":"23803843","text":"Bruce Alan Borders is a former Representative for the 45th District in the Indiana House of Representatives.

Origin  In 1937 The Greyhound Corporation, the original parent Greyhound firm, formed the New England Greyhound Lines (GL) to take over three routes of the New England Transportation (NET) Company, along with two subsidiaries of the NET Company – the Berkshire Motor Coach Lines and the Victoria Coach Lines, two discount-price carriers which NET had previously bought (not later than 1932) – plus the Quaker Stages and the Old Colony Coach Lines, two independent unrelated firms. The NET Company was the bus subsidiary of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford (NYNH&H;) Railroad, commonly known as the New Haven Railroad. The railway firm bought a one-half interest in the New England GL.  Eastern GL of New York  Already, however, Greyhound had made its first presence in New England in 1930, by forming the Eastern GL (EGL) of New York [as a subsidiary of the undenominated main Eastern GL, which had come into existence in the previous year as a holding company (rather than an operating company), to own a number of Greyhound subsidiaries (both existing ones and future ones) to the east of Chicago (in Illinois) – other than the Pennsylvania GL, in which the Pennsylvania Railroad soon bought a large but minority interest]. The EGL of New York ran in part between Albany (in New York City) and Boston, via Pittsfield, Springfield, and Worcester (all four in Massachusetts).  Eastern GL of New England  In 1930 The Greyhound Corporation, the parent firm, during its rapid growth, formed another subsidiary, the EGL of New England (different and separate from the EGL of New York), then placed it under the undenominated main EGL (the holding company) – along with three other operating subsidiaries (the EGL of Ohio, the EGL of New York, and the EGL of Michigan). In that same year, 1930, the new EGL of New England (different and separate from the EGL of New York) started running, on two intercity routes acquired from the Gray Line of Boston (a part of the famous sightseeing organization), two routes between Boston and New York City – the inland route, via Worcester and Springfield (both in Massachusetts) and Hartford and New Haven (both in Connecticut), and the shoreline route, via Providence (in Rhode Island) and New London and New Haven (both in Connecticut). [In 1935 the main (first) Eastern GL plus three subsidiaries, the EGL of Ohio, the EGL of New York, and the EGL of Michigan, became renamed respectively as the (second) Central GL, the CGL of Ohio, the CGL of New York, and the CGL of Michigan, whereas the EGL of New England (due to its eastern or northeasternlocation) continued to use its same name.] In 1936 The Greyhound Corporation began to eliminate its multiple (and often complex) intermediate holding companies (between the parent firm and the operating companies) – to avoid a hugely increased federal income tax on the undistributed earnings of corporate subsidiaries – one under the Revenue Act of 1936, which the U.S. Congress had passed as a means by which to cause (or force) a simplification of complex corporate structures in the public-utility industries (including the transportation industries). In one response (among several others) to the new legislation, in that same year, 1936, Greyhound merged the EGL of New England (as a division rather than a subsidiary) into The Greyhound Corporation, the parent firm. [Thus The Greyhound Corporation, previously merely a holding company rather than an operating company, became a carrier in its own right and under its own authority with its own ICC-MC number.] While waiting for the mandatory approval (for the investment, the acquisitions, and the mergers pertaining to the NEGL) of the federal Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the EGL of New England (in operation since 1930) and the New England Transportation Company began to coordinate their scheduled trips (between Boston and New York City) with each other, and each company began to accept the tickets of the other. In 1939 the ICC announced its decision to allow the proposed actions, and the two companies (the NEGL and the NET Company) moved forward by carrying out their plans.  Development  The New England GL acquired three routes from the NET Company: the shoreline route between Boston and New York City via Providence, New London, and New Haven, the one between New Haven and Willimantic via Middletown and Marlborough (all four in Connecticut), and the one between New York City and Pittsfield (in Massachusetts) via Danbury, New Milford, and Torrington (all three in Connecticut). The NEGL acquired also (likewise from the NET Company) the Berkshire and Victoria firms (each of which ran between Boston and New York City on an inland route via Hartford). The NEGL further acquired the Quaker firm [which ran between Boston and Bangor (in Maine) via Portsmouth (in New Hampshire) and Portland and Augusta (the last two in Maine) and between Portland and Belfast (both in Maine)] and the Old Colony firm [which ran not only between Boston and New York City but also between Boston and Saint Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, just across the border from Calais, Maine, via Portsmouth (in New Hampshire) and Portland, Augusta and Bangor (all three in Maine)]. [After those acquisitions by the NEGL, Berkshire, Victoria, Quaker, and Old Colony all ceased to exist, although the NET Company continued to operate on several other routes (albeit on shorter ones) in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, until 1958.] The Greyhound Corporation, the parent firm, promptly transferred all the new routes north of Boston (to Portsmouth, Portland, Belfast, Augusta, Bangor, and Saint Stephen) from the NEGL to the EGL of New England, which still ran several trips each day between Boston and New York City alongside the NEGL. In 1940, however, Greyhound transferred to the NEGL the remaining trips of the EGL of New England between Boston and New York City. The NEGL made several minor acquisitions and dispositions of routes during the following years. On the last day of October 1950 The Greyhound Corporation bought back the one-half interest of the New Haven Railroad in the New England GL. On the last day of December 1950 the parent firm merged the EGL of New England into the NEGL. In 1953 the New England GL bought the International Coach Lines (ICL), based in Rumford, Maine, which ran between two points in Canada – Montréal, Québec, and Saint John, New Brunswick – along a route (a shortcut of sorts) mostly through northern New England – via Stanhope (in Québec), Norton (in Vermont), Colebrook, Lancaster, and Gorham (all three in New Hampshire), Rumford, Bangor, Lincoln, and Calais (all four in Maine), and Saint Stephen (in New Brunswick). With that purchase the NEGL received five new MCI coaches (of the model 95-D), which the ICL had already ordered, but which had not yet become delivered before the merger of the ICL into the NEGL. Thus The Greyhound Corporation (through the NEGL as a wholly owned subsidiary) acquired and began to operate its first MCI coaches in the USA. [The Motor Coach Industries (MCI), then based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in one of the “prairie provinces” of Canada, north of North Dakota and Minnesota, was then a Canadian coach builder and was then a subsidiary of one of the Greyhound carriers in Canada.] [In 1948 the Western Canadian Greyhound Lines, Limited, had bought the MCI as the supplier of its coaches for its operations in Canada (and for sale to others); in -58 The Greyhound Corporation (the parent firm in the US) bought a controlling interest in the MCI (thereby taking an important step toward developing again its own source for its future equipment).]  Through-coaches on through-routes  The New England GL ran a number of through-coaches along its own routes, including those between New York City and Boston, New York City and Portland, New York City and Bangor, New York City and Saint Stephen, and Montréal and Saint John. However, the NEGL took part in only a few interlined through-routes in cooperation with other operating companies – those between Boston and both Richmond and Norfolk (both in Virginia), both with the Pennsylvania GL and the Richmond GL, and between New York City and both Bennington and Burlington (both in Vermont), with the Vermont Transit Company, in which The Greyhound Corporation then owned a minority interest.  Meeting other Greyhound companies  The New England GL met the EGL of New York in Boston and the Central GL and the Pennsylvania GL in New York City.  Merger with Pennsylvania GL  In 1955, during a time of consolidation, Greyhound merged the New England GL (and the Richmond GL, another regional subsidiary) with the Pennsylvania GL, all of which became redesignated as the Eastern Division of The Greyhound Corporation [called also the (second) Eastern GL], the first of four huge new divisions (along with Southern, Western, and another Central)]. [In the previous year, 1954, Greyhound had already merged the Capitol GL and the (second) Central GL into the Pennsylvania GL.] Thus ended the New England GL, and thus began the (second) Eastern GL.  Beyond New England GL  Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thereby leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business) to a new company, named as the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., also called the (second) GLI, based in Dallas, Texas – a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., also called TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the Trailways association. Later in 1987 the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey as the chief executive officer (CEO) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has since continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives while continuing to reduce its level of service – by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states – and by doing so on fewer days – that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) – and by using fewer through-coaches, thus requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm) changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial – if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda – Λ – that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound – that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation.  Conclusion  The routes of the New England GL made a major and significant contribution to the present Greyhound route network .

The Act stated that \\"vagabonds, idle and suspected persons shall be set in the stocks for three days and three nights and have none other sustenance but bread and water and then shall be put out of Town. Every beggar suitable to work shall resort to the Hundred where he last dwelled, is best known, or was born and there remain upon the pain aforesaid.\\"  Social context  Local government during the early modern period in England (1400s-1700s) was very different from modern government in that it relied on the community to enforce law and order. No police force existed and local government positions were often filled on a voluntary basis. These positions were held by neighbors, friends, employers, and churchwardens; local government was based around the idea of community and working together to establish societal order. The early modern period challenged these social establishments as England experienced a time of inflation and extreme population growth and incurred a widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. These social pressures and changes caused a disruption in the natural order of society: the idea that every man, woman, and child knew his or her place in English society. This population growth and social change put stress on the established governmental order, changing how the government chose to maintain order throughout the country. Often, the poor became the targets of these newer laws set on re-establishing societal order. Labeled as beggars and vagabonds, laws like the Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1494 aimed to punish the poor of England for simply being poor. Early modern England stressed the idea of societal order and that each individual should know his or her correct place within that structure. The poor challenged the existing structure because they did not necessarily fit into a specific place. The Poor Law and settlement laws and Tudor Proclamations that followed reinforced the Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1494, keeping people in their correct societal place.  Rise of crime  London, with its large population and frequent visitors, made staying anonymous an easy task for criminals. A criminal underworld soon formed and developed a security and intelligence system that protected professional criminals from the minimal policing force. Those who made their living through crime formed their own neighborhood that centered its activity around one of the busiest areas of London, St. Paul's Cathedral. The dangers of London prompted the creation of informational material that warned prospective visitors of the typical scams that criminals utilized; such as Gilbert Walker's Manifest Detection of Dice Play (1552) and Robert Greene's A Notable Discovery of Cozenage (1592). Criminal activity broke gender boundaries and both men and women became professionals. Some women chose to act and dress like men. One of the most successful of these was Mary Frith (Moll Cutpurse) who also helped organize and instruct the criminal underworld.

Gaslamp fantasy (also known as gaslight fantasy or gaslight romance) is a subgenre of both fantasy and historical fiction. Generally speaking, this particular realm of fantasy employs either a Victorian or Edwardian setting. The gaslamp fantasy genre is not to be confused with steampunk, which is often set in the same historical era but usually has more of a super-science edge and uchronic tone. Gaslamp fantasy also differs from classical Victorian/Edwardian faerie or pure fantasy in the J.R.R. Tolkien or Lewis Carroll style or from historical crime-novels in the Anne Perry or June Thomson style by the supernatural elements, themes, and subjects it features. Many of its tropes, themes, and stock characters derive from Gothic literature—a long-established genre composed of both romantic and horrific traits and motivated by the desire to rouse fear, apprehension, and other intense emotions within the reader—and could be described as an attempt to modernize literary Gothicism. Writer and artist Kaja Foglio originally coined the term in an effort to distinguish her and husband Phil Foglio's comic series, Girl Genius, from \\"steampunk\\". Kaja hoped to suggest the work's distinctive style, a medley of alternate history and Victorian-esque \\"mad science\\".Marissa Meli. \\"Hilarious Web Comics for Your Interweb Perusal Pleasure: Finally, a way to waste time on the internet\\" . UGO.com. UGO Entertainment, 11 May 2011: 3. Web. 13 June 2011. Later on, however, fantasy-fans redirected the term to denote a spin-off genre of Holmesian fantasy or Victorian-based Gothic tales. According to fantasy-fans as a whole, the subgenre consists, namely, of contemporary or modern fantasy pieces set in the Victorian \\"gaslamp\\" era. However, the subgenre also includes some works with a pre-Victorian setting (Susanna Clarke's Regency novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, for example). More samplings of the genre can be found in publications such as the Gaslight Grimoire anthologies and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics. Origin The term \\"gaslamp fantasy\\" was first coined on April 26, 2006, by webcomic artist Kaja Foglio to differentiate her comic, Girl Genius, from conventional steampunk fiction. Girl Genius, although science fiction set in nineteenth-century Europe, does not have a firm emphasis on fantastic Industrial Revolution technology. Elements of other types of fiction are featured, including magic and mythical creatures, and the scientific element of it is less prominent. It also includes steampunk takes on contemporary sci-fi biology elements, like clockwork cyborgs, mass-produced Frankenstein-type creatures, and other monsters. Generally, the term refers to fiction based in a Victorian-style setting, similar to steampunk, but with a broader emphasis. The stories are usually not so focused on machinery of the period (or, often, any machinery at all), take more liberties with the actual time period, and may contain elements of other genres. Since the term's coining, gaslamp fantasy has been retroactively applied to other fiction written in the Victorian Age, such as the works of Bram Stoker, Jules Verne, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

It explores the activities of Constance, Aubrey Blanford, Robin Sutcliffe, Lord Galen, and most of the other surviving characters (including some who are theoretically fictional from Blanford's novel) as they return to Avignon and Provence in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Plot summary The surviving characters include \\"two novelists, a psychoanalyst, a German double agent, a Cambridge-educated gypsy, a Jewish lord, a schizophrenic young woman and an Egyptian prince.\\"BARBARA FISHER WILIAMSON, \\"Links and Winks\\", New York Times, 15 September 1985; accessed 23 October 2016 The ex-Nazi double agent Smirgel provides information about the location of the Templar treasure, which has long been sought by Lord Galen. Gypsies are congregating to take part in a Camargue festival. The climax of the book is set below the Pont du Gard, an ancient Roman monument where the characters expect to find the treasure. Durrell develops further in this novel the process of deliberate breakdown of logical narrative, which he has used throughout the series. Time sequences are often contradictory, and there are numerous anachronistic references to events during and after World War II. More than in the previous four volumes, Durrell deliberately includes allusions and homages to the culture of the 1980s in a narrative which is supposedly occurring in 1946. Reception In reviewing Quinx, Patrick Parrinder in the London Review of Books surveys the entire quintet, saying that > \\"This series of novels-with-two-titles, containing characters with variable > names and fluctuating identities, is (as we should expect) suffused with > radical ambiguity. The ‘Avignon Quintet’ which Durrell has now completed is > an enigmatic and secretive work, a cluster of dark passages and gaudy > treasure-filled caves beside the thrusting baroque edifice of his earlier > ‘Alexandria Quartet’.\\"Patrick Parrinder, \\"Naming of Parts\\", London Review of > Books, Vol. 7 No. 10, 6 June 1985; accessed 23 October 2016 He describes his art as \\"undiminished in scale, in inventive gusto and fictive extravagance\\", with a \\"shrewd eye for the sensational.\\" He describes it as a \\"deliberate romance,\\" set around the search for a Holy Grail, the treasure of the Templars. Barbara Fisher Williamson in the New York Times describes \\"the interminable opening religio-literary-sexual-psycho babble of the two novelists\\" before the plot gets underway. In a novel in which patterns dissolve and the characters' belief systems fail, making what she says is \\"a long joke of a book.\\" She praises Durrell's descriptions, saying that \\"Avignon, ancient city of kings and popes, comes gloriously alive.

It has a widespread distribution in North America, and is thought to be part of a species complex that includes other similar-looking Amanitas.  Description  The cap is in diameter and gray to grayish-brown in color; initially the cap is oval, then as it matures it becomes progressively conical, convex, and eventually flattened, sometimes with a small umbo (a rounded elevation in the center of the cap). Internet Archive The gills are white, free (not attached to the stem) to narrowly attached, moderately crowded together, and sometimes have a grayish tint; the lamellulae (small gills that run from the edge of the cap towards the stem) are truncate. The flesh is white and thin, and does not change color upon bruising or injury. The stem is long and thick. Unlike many other Amanitas with stems that are swollen at the base (bulbous), the thickness of the A. vaginata stem is roughly the same at both ends. The stem surface is covered with a finely powdered bloom (pruinose), especially near the top; faint longitudinal lines may be seen. The base of the stem is enclosed in a loose, sack-like volva that may discolor grayish or reddish brown. The spore print is white.

In 2001 Hrádek u Nechanic was declared part of the National Cultural Heritage. The chateau is administered by the National Heritage Trust and the Ministry of Culture. History Hrádek u Nechanic was built between 1839 and 1857 as a representative and summer seat by Count František Arnošt of Harrach, one of the most important representatives of the Jilemnice dynasty. The young Austrian architect Karl Fischer led building operations and suggested decoration of the chateau's interior. The chateau was designed by the English architect Edward Buckton Lamb. It is referred to as “Little Hluboká” because it resembles to Hluboka Chateau in southern Bohemia. Most of the furniture was made by local artisans. The remainder of the interior was brought from Italy and Austria. Around the same time, L. Krüger converted part of the local forest into a park. In the left part of the park, a reserve and pheasantry were founded. In 1945, the chateau was confiscated because of the Beneš decrees. Description The chateau is a two-storey building with a prismatic tower, which includes battlements, a small shooting tower in the middle and two polygonal risalits on both sides. The chateau consists of two symmetrical wings. The west wing includes St. Ann´s chapel. On the east side are economic and administrative buildings, and a theatre. The park covers and includes meadows, and forests with deciduous and conifer trees. Some trees are of exotic origin.

While it is home to Fort York, a National Historic Site, it also contains several mid and high-rise condominium buildings built during the 21st century. History Fort York is situated near the city's original watefront. The area that makes up Fort York neighbourhood was the result of land reclamation projects in the late-19th and early-20th century. The neighbourhood area consists of the former industrial lands immediately east and south of Fort York, a fort since 1793, and designated a National Historic Sites of Canada in 1923. The current Fort York Armoury was built in 1933, and still houses several units of the Canadian Forces. The neighbourhood is one of Toronto's most historically and cultural sensitive areas, and was the location of the lakeside Toronto Molson brewery before it was demolished in 2006. The Fort York Neighbourhood Public Realm Plan is the next step in the planning and design for the Fort York Neighbourhood. The area's redevelopment plan was finalized in 2005, and establishes guidelines for an overall vision of the emerging neighbourhood. It set out the location of public spaces, density, height and built form so that the area's streetscapes, open spaces, parks and pedestrian areas are interconnected with private development. Public Realm =Recent developments= A 38-storey residential tower and 7- to 12-storey podium building was constructed in 2005 at the west end of the neighbourhood, at the corner of Fleet Street Fort York Boulevard. This was the first element of the planned redevelopment of the site into a mixed-use community, including 12 residential towers, podium buildings and stacked townhouses, with grade- level retail and commercial uses. The neighbourhood will eventually house an estimated 6000 units within the area north of Lake Shore Boulevard, south of Fort York Boulevard between Strachan Avenue and Dan Leckie Way (an extension of Portland Street). Malibu, one of several condo developments in the area. It has been the site of a lot of condominium loft and row house development. The area is located close to the Fashion and Entertainment districts. Significant high-rise development has taken place within the Fort York Neighbourhood, south of the Gardiner Expressway between Fort York Blvd. and Fleet Street.Fort York Neighbourhood Master Plan Some of the main roads in the neighbourhood are: *Bathurst Street *Fleet Street *Lake Shore Boulevard *Fort York Boulevard *Gardiner Expressway The Bentway is a unique and innovative public space that transforms 1.75 km underneath Toronto’s Gardiner Expressway into a new gathering place for our city’s growing population. The initial phase – from Strachan Avenue to Bathurst Street – knits together seven local neighbourhoods with over 70,000 residents, becoming a gateway to the waterfront, while providing access to important attractions and destinations – from Fort York National Historic Site, Ontario Place and Exhibition Place to Harbourfront Centre and the CN Tower. The Bentway offers year-round activities and events, including gardens, a skate trail, recreational amenities, public markets, public art, special exhibitions, festivals, theatre and musical performances, and more. Public transportation streetcar passes by the Queen's Wharf Lighthouse. Fort York neighbourhood is served by 509 Harbourfront streetcar line. The Harbourfront is served by the 509 Harbourfront streetcar, which operates between Union and Exhibition Place running along a private right-of-way (ROW) on Queens Quay west to Bathurst and then along Fleet Street. Between September 2007 and March 2008, the Fleet Street portion of Route 509 was converted to a ROW. Streetcar track and overhead power line were also installed at the Fleet loop, which is located at the Fleet Street Lighthouse.

Symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle pain, and a rash. At the site of the bite there is typically a red skin sore with a dark center. The onset of symptoms usually occurs 4–10 days after the bite. Complications are rare, but may include joint inflammation. Some people do not develop symptoms. Tick bite fever is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia africae. The bacterium is spread by ticks of the Amblyomma type. These generally live in tall grass or bush rather than in cities. The diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. It can be confirmed by culture, PCR, or immunofluorescence. There is no vaccine. Prevention is by avoiding tick bites by covering the skin, using DEET, or using permethrin treated clothing. Evidence regarding treatment, however, is limited. The antibiotic doxycycline appears useful. Chloramphenicol or azithromycin may also be used. The disease will also tend to resolve without treatment. The disease occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, the West Indies, and Oceania. It is relatively common among travelers to sub- Saharan Africa. Most infections occur between November and April. Outbreaks of the disease may occur. The earliest descriptions of the condition are believed to be from 1911. African tick bite fever is a type of spotted fever. It has previously been confused with Mediterranean spotted fever.  Signs and symptoms  African tick bite fever is often asymptomatic or mild in clinical presentation and complications are rare. The onset of illness is typically 5–7 days after the tick bite, although in some cases it may take up to 10 days for symptoms to occur. Symptoms can persist for several days to up to three weeks. Common presenting symptoms include: * Fever * Headache * Muscle aches * Inoculation eschar, which is dead, often black, tissue around a bite site (see photo above) ** Eschars may or may not be present. Amblyomma ticks actively attack cattle or humans and can bite more than once. In African tick bite fever, unlike what is typically seen with other Rickettsial spotted fevers when only one eschar is identified, multiple eschars may be seen and are considered pathognomonic. * Swollen lymph nodes near the site of the bite * Maculopapular and/or vesicular rash = Complications = Complications are rare and are not life-threatening. No deaths due to African tick bite fever have been reported. Reported complications include: * Prolonged fever > 3 weeks in duration * Reactive arthritis * Moderate to severe headache  Cause = Bacteriology = Rickettsia africae is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular, pleomorphic bacterium. It belongs to the genus Rickettsia, which includes many bacterial species that are transmitted to humans by arthropods. = Vectors = Amblyomma variegatum, male Amblyomma hebraeum, male Two species of hard ticks, Amblyoma variegatum and Amblyomma hebraeum are the most common vectors of R. africae. Typically, Amblyomma hebraeum transmits the bacteria in South Africa while Amblyoma variegatum carries R. africae throughout West, Central and East Africa and through the French West Indies. Other species of Amblyomma in sub-Saharan Africa can also transmit R. africae and it may be that up to 100% of Amblyomma ticks in sub-Saharan Africa carry R. africae. Amblyomma ticks are most active from November to April. These tick species frequently feed on cattle and other livestock, but can also be found feeding on wild animals in areas where farm animals are not found. Unlike other hard tick species, which passively seek hosts by clinging to plants and waiting for a potential host to brush by in passing, the Amblyomma hard ticks actively seek out hosts. Groups of tourists visiting Africa have returned to their own countries and were diagnosed there as having been infected. Up until 1998, it was thought that only ticks in sub-Saharan Africa carried R. africae. However, a case of locally transmitted African tick bite fever in the French West Indies led to the discovery of R. africae carried by Amblyomma varigatum ticks introduced through cattle shipped from Senegal to Gaudeluope more than a century ago. R. africae has been isolated from ticks on several Caribbean islands, though the only cases in humans in the Caribbean have occurred in the French West Indies. R. africae has also been found in Amblyomma loculosum ticks in Oceania.  Pathogenesis  After the rickettsia bacteria infects humans through a tick bite, it invades endothelial cells in the circulatory system (veins, arteries, capillaries). The body then releases chemicals that cause inflammation, resulting in the characteristic symptoms like headache and fever. The hallmark of all rickettsial diseases is a histology (cellular) finding called lymphohistiocytic vasculitis that involves immune cell deposition into the endothelial cells that make up vessels. This occurs secondary to the chemicals mentioned above, as well as damage from the infection, and involves signals to immune cells (T cells and macrophages) to come to the site of the infection. Rickettsia bacteria species like R. africae replicate around the area of the initial tick bite, causing necrosis (cell death) and lymph node inflammation. This is the cause of the characteristic eschar.  Diagnosis  Many patients with ATBF who live in areas with a high number of infections (Africa and the West Indies) do not visit a doctor, as most patients only have mild symptoms. This disease can, however, cause more serious symptoms in travelers who have never been exposed to the Rickettsia africae bacterium before and are not immune. Travelers who present to a doctor after a trip to affected areas can be hard to diagnose, as many tropical diseases cause a fever similar to that of ATBF. Other diseases that may look similar are malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, acute HIV and respiratory infections. In addition to questions about symptoms, doctors will ask patients for an accurate travel history and whether he/she was near animals or ticks. Microbiological tests are available for doctors, but are expensive and often must be done by special laboratories. The antibiotic treatment available for rickettsiae infections has very few side effects, so if a doctor has a high suspicion of the disease, he or she may simply treat without doing more laboratory tests. = Blood tests = Diagnosis of ATBF is mostly based on symptoms, as many laboratory tests are not specific for ATBF. Common laboratory test signs of ATBF are a low white blood cell count (lymphopenia) and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), a high C-reactive protein, and mildly high liver function tests. = Microbiological tests = Biopsies or cultures of a person's tick wound (eschar) are used to diagnose ATBF. However, this requires special culture media and can only be done by a laboratory with biohazard protection. There are more specialized laboratory tests available that use quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR), but can only be done by laboratories with special equipment. Immunofluorescence assays can also be used, but are hard to interpret because of cross-reactions with other rickettsiae bacteria.  Prevention  Prevention of ATBF centers around protecting oneself from tick bites by wearing long pants and shirt, and using insecticides like DEET on the skin. Travelers to rural areas in Africa and the West Indies should be aware that they may come in contact with ATBF tick vectors. Infection is more likely to occur in people who are traveling to rural areas or plan to spend time participating in outdoor activities. Extra caution should be taken in November - April, when Amblyomma ticks are more active. Inspection of the body, clothing, gear, and any pets after time outdoors can help to identify and remove ticks early.  Treatment  African tick bite fever is usually mild, and most patients do not need more than at- home treatment with antibiotics for their illness. However, because so few patients with this infection visit a doctor, the best antibiotic choice, dose and length of treatment are not well known. Typically doctors treat this disease with antibiotics that have been used effectively for the treatment of other diseases caused by bacteria of similar species, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. For mild cases, people are usually treated with one of the following: * doxycycline * chloramphenicol * ciprofloxacin If a person has more severe symptoms, like a high fever or serious headache, the infection can be treated with doxycycline for a longer amount of time. Pregnant women should not use doxycycline or ciprofloxacin as both antibiotics can cause problems in fetuses. Josamycin has been used effectively for treatment of pregnant women with other rickettsial diseases, but it is unclear if it has a role in the treatment of ATBF.  Epidemiology  Cases of African tick bite fever have been more frequently reported in the literature among international travelers. Data examining rates in local populations are limited. Among locals who live in endemic areas, exposure at a young age and mild symptoms or lack of symptoms, as well as decreased access to diagnostic tools, may lead to decreased diagnosis. In Zimbabwe, where R. africae is endemic, one study reported an estimated yearly incidence of 60-80 cases per 10,000 patients. Looking at published data over the past 35 years, close to 200 confirmed cases of African tick bite fever in international travelers have been reported. The majority (~80%) of these cases occurred in travelers returning from South Africa.

The family lived in the town of Frauenau in Bavaria, where Valentin Eisch was employed as a master engraver at the glass factory of Isidor Gistl.Hampson, Ferdinand, \\"Beauty that Challenges\\" (exhibition catalog), Habatat Galleries, Royal Oak, Michigan, 2004 (unpaginated) The Eisch family was by no means well- off. The elder Eisch supplemented his income by bringing work home to engrave on Sundays. The family also kept a cow, goats, and chickens to put milk, eggs and meat on the table.Buechner, Thomas, Erwin Eisch” (catalog essay), Maurine Littleton Gallery, Washington, DC 1987 unpaginated With Hitler's rise to power the village of Frauenau, located near the border with Czechoslovakia, suffered under the Nazi regime. According to Erwin Eisch, his family, as well as most of the people in Frauenau, were Communists during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and unsympathetic to National Socialism (1933–1945).Eisch, Erwin, “Night of the Crystal Death-My Love to Anne Frank” (catalog essay), Maurine Littleton Gallery, Washington, DC 1992, page 18 Eisch entered the German army in 1945 at age 18. He saw three months of service in Czechoslovakia and Denmark before he was taken prisoner by the British. After an internment of three and a half months,Speis, Uta, \\"Erwin Eisch: Der Himmel Fangt am Boden an\\", Dietmar Klinger Verlag, Passau, Germany 2007, page 13 he returned to Frauenau where he learned glass engraving from his father. From 1946 to 1948 Eisch worked at this trade in the family's cutting and engraving shopBuechner, 1987, unpaginated while studying at the School of Glassmaking in nearby Zwiesel, Germany (Zwiesel Glasfachschule). After taking his journeyman's examination in engraving in 1949 Eisch entered the Munich Academy of Fine Arts (Academie der Bildenden Künste). There he studied glass design, sculpture and interior architecture, returning to Frauenau in 1952 to assist his parents and two brothers, Alfons and Erich, in founding a glassworks there.Byrd, Joan Falconer, “Harvey K. Littleton: A Retrospective Exhibition,” High Museum of Art, Atlanta 1984, page 12 Within a few years the Eisch Glass Factory (Glashütte Eisch) employed a staff of some 200 people. Eisch returned to the Munich Academy of Fine Arts in 1956, where he continued his studies in sculpture and painting. He, along with other young artists in the late 1950s, was aware of the Tachisme and Art Informel movements. Eisch, however, gravitated toward social criticism and anti-art establishment actions. In 1958 he was a founding member of the artist's group SPUR at the Munich Academy. Art scholar Susie J.Silbert identified SPUR as a Situationist group intent on revitalizing European culture by emphasizing artistic individualism. Quoting the group's 1958 manifesto, she wrote: \\"Art relies upon instinct, upon primary creative forces. To the detriment of all intellectual spectators, these free, wild forces always push toward the appearance of new, unexpected forms.\\"Strauss, Cindi et al., \\"Pioneers of Contemporary Glass: Highlights from the Barbara and Dennis DuBois Collection\\", The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston 2009 page 31 Eisch left the group in 1959. RADAMA scandal, marriage In 1960, with his future wife, Margarete “Gretel” Stadler and the artist Max Strack, Eisch formed the group RADAMA.“Erwin Eisch 80th Birthday Celebration”, Accessed 7/30/09 RADAMA became notorious for publishing a biography of a fictitious abstract painter, Bolus Krim, and holding a memorial exhibition of the \\"prematurely deceased\\" artist's work. The Malura Gallery in Munich mounted \\"In Memory of Bolus Krim\\" in 1961. According to Eisch the exhibition was intended to reveal “the failure of the avante garde of the time.” Accessed 7/30/09 Bolus Krim's work, of course, was actually that of the RADAMA members; Eisch showed a number of his glass pieces along with his paintings and sculpture.Byrd, Joan, \\"Erwin Eisch\\" (Catalog essay), Maurine Littleton Gallery, Washington, DC 1992, page 12 The ruse worked; art critics lavished praise on the exhibition and pronounced Krim a genius. Those duped by Bolus Krim were outraged when the hoax was revealed. Accessed 7/30/09 Eisch left the Munich art scene soon after the scandal. In 1962 he and Gretel Stadler married and went to Frauenau to live. There Eisch worked as the designer for the Eisch Glass Factory's commercial line of glassware, and Gretel learned how to paint on glass.Buechner, 1987 (unpaginated) Husband and wife held their first joint exhibition at Tritschler GmbH & Cie in Stuttgart in the spring of 1962. The glass objects shown by Eisch dated from 1952. According to Eisch, the exhibition at Tritschler's was \\"full of all kinds of provocative themes and very unusual glass work, antifunctional, colorful, grotesque.\\" Glasmuseum Frauenau, \\"Harvey K. Littleton Zum 70. Geburtstag 14.Juni '92\\", Glasmuseum Frauenau, Frauenau, Germany 1992 (unpaginated) Contact with Harvey Littleton Harvey Littleton called his first meeting with Erwin Eisch “a milestone” in his development as a glass artist. In August 1962 Littleton was visiting Germany on a research grant when he noticed, in the showroom of the Rimpler Kristall glass factory in Zwiesel, a piece of glass that was unlike the other objects on display. Littleton was told that it was from the Eisch Glass Factory in the nearby town of Frauenau. Visiting the Eisch factory, Littleton met Erwin Eisch and marveled at his expressionistic free-blown glass objects. “Meeting Erwin confirmed my belief that glass could be a medium for direct expression by an individual,” he wrote.Littleton, Harvey K., “Glassblowing: A Search for Form”, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York 1980, page 10 The two met again in 1964 at the first meeting of the World Congress of Craftsmen in New York City. At the conference, Littleton and his students set up a small furnace built by Dominick Labino and proceeded to blow glass. The demonstration impressed Eisch, who said, “The little furnace is the future.”Byrd, Joan, 1984, page 15 After the conference Eisch traveled to Madison, Wisconsin where he and Littleton co-taught a four-week summer class at the University of Wisconsin art department. As Eisch remembers it, his first trip to the U.S. was memorable. He wrote,\\"The Midwest was hot and I was shy, speechless and German in a strange new world. I didn't have an easy time of it. As [a] glassblower I was self-taught and clumsy; I confined myself to making handles. I could never get the first gather properly centered, but luckily we were all beginners.\\" Glasmuseum Frauenau, 1992 (unpaginated) After his return to Frauenau, Eisch built a small studio furnace in the basement of the factory where he melted his own batch”Batch” is the term for the basic ingredients of glass: quartz sand, lime, magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide. from 1965 to 1975. During these years Eisch worked almost exclusively in glass. Working in a studio environment, rather than on the factory floor, allowed him to develop and refine his personal vision for glass as a sculptural medium.Byrd, Joan, 1992, page 14 Notable works produced during this time included his environmental sculptures The Fountain of Youth and Narcissus.Buechner, 1987 unpaginated In November 1967 Eisch returned to the University of Wisconsin as a visiting professor. For two months he worked in Littleton's studio, creating about 200 pieces of glass for exhibition in the United States. Watching Eisch develop his forms intrigued Littleton. Working with his assistant, Karl Paternoster, Eisch created “small, involved sculptural forms” that he fumed to unify the forms’ surfaces, giving them the iridescence that one sees in Art Nouveau glass. Eisch later resorted to enameling the exteriors of his pieces to strengthen his forms.Littleton, 1980 page 126 During the time Eisch worked in Littleton's studio, his influence on his American colleague was strong. For weeks after Eisch's return to Germany, Littleton found himself creating works that were derivative of his friend's complex, intuitively-shaped forms. This, Littleton said, made him change the direction of his work to simple forms based on the column and the tube.Littleton, 1980, page 121 The following summer, Littleton traveled to Frauenau to work in Eisch's studio, where he created about thirty sculptures for exhibition in Europe.Littleton, 1980, pages 121–122 Eisch and Littleton first exhibited together in 1969 in Munich and Cologne.Byrd, 1984, page 16-17 Free-blown work of the 1960s and '70s Although many of Eisch's pieces of the 1960s and '70s were rooted in functional forms such as the vase, the bottle, the pitcher and the stein, the usefulness of these vessels was never Eisch's goal. \\"The purely plastic form, with glass as medium, was a means of art free of an end,\\" he wrote.Eisch, Erwin (essay), \\"Erwin Eisch Retrospective: Glass and Drawings\\"(exhibition catalog)Chelsea Gallery, A.K. Hinds University Center, Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 1980 (unpaginated) Eisch described his own glass forms of the sixties and seventies as \\"poetic or pictorial realism.\\" He made clear that such a realism did not rely on observable fact, but on his inner reality; his fantasies. As important as his reliance on fantasy was to shaping his art, his unwillingness to compromise personal vision to appeal to the marketplace was just as vital. Therefore, his early pitchers, vases and teapots are so eccentrically shaped as to seem to be in the process of becoming, rather than being, commonplace objects. Unique and imperfect as Eisch's forms are, it is not much of a step for their creator to anthropomorphize them. Eisch said, \\"From a glowing inert mass must emerge things of beauty that are endowed with speech. A talent of innovating, creating animatedly, and the breath to blow are requisites. Without blowing nothing happens.\\" Grover, Ray & Lee, \\"Contemporary Art Glass\\", Crown Publishers, Inc. New York, p. 185 s Portrait heads By 1972 Eisch was putting less time into free-blown glass sculpture. Instead, he devoted himself to the creation of sculptures from which ceramic molds for glass- blowing were made. His series of heads, including those of Harvey Littleton, Thomas Buechner, Picasso and the Buddha, and his “Blister-finger” series of works, were all mold-blown. This allowed Eisch to concentrate his efforts not only on sculpting but also on engraving and painting on glass. In using different cold-working techniques to create imagery on each piece in his series, along with distorting the hot glass sculpture as it came from the mold, Eisch made virtually identical mold-blown pieces into individual, unique statements. Painting and drawing Beginning in the mid-1970s Eisch began to create more and more in the traditional art forms of painting on canvas and paper, drawing and printmaking. Eisch draws daily, often working in thematic series. While his imagery can be purely whimsical, the artist also uses it to make political statements. Above all, his guiding idea is the physical relationship of male and female, of human contact through touch with an emphasis on the hand.Angus, Mark, International Magazine of Studio Glass website Harvey Littleton has written of Eisch's paintings and drawings that \\"Erwin...has said that the real landscape no longer exists in art, no more than the classic figure; and so he creates his own vision of the world of the spirit and new relationships of body forms.\\" Littleton Harvey K. (introduction), \\"Erwin Eisch Retrospective: Glass and Drawings\\"(exhibition catalog) Chelsea Gallery, A.K. Hinds University Center, Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 1980 (unpaginated) Vitreographs Eisch first tried his hand at vitreography (printmaking from glass plates) during a visit to Harvey Littleton's studio in 1981. Littleton had begun to explore the possibilities of intaglio printmaking from glass matrices in Wisconsin in 1976; in 1981, after hiring a printer to assist him, Littleton began to invite artist colleagues to experiment in vitreography. Erwin Eisch was one of the first artists invited to engage in printmaking at Littleton Studios. Eisch brought his background in glass engraving to bear on the vitreograph plate. He abraded and cut into the glass surface, which was then inked and printed onto paper under pressure in an etching press. He produced six intaglio prints in four days during that visit.Littleton, Harvey (essay), “Vitreographs: Collaborative Works from the Littleton Studios”, University of Florida, Gainesville, 1992, page 9 Over the following 26 years Littleton Studios published 64 prints by Eisch, including a 10-print portfolio titled \\"Kristallnacht: Night of Crystal Death.\\" According to Eisch, he created the portfolio as a means \\"to relieve some of the clinging shame that weighs down upon us Germans, and to bring courage to all those who oppose hate and violence and the destruction of the environment, today and forever.\\"\\"Kristallnacht-The Night of Crystal Death: Vitreographs from the Littleton Studios\\" (2-sided exhibition publication), Turchin Center for the Arts, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, 2006 Using a palette of primarily red and black ink, Eisch aimed to show in the artworks \\"the brutality and stupidity\\" of the November 1938 pogrom in Nazi Germany that foreshadowed the Holocaust.Clark, Paul, \\"WCU museum to debut 'Kristallnacht' prints\\", Accessed 3/28/08 Teacher and lecturer In addition to teaching in the glass program at the University of Wisconsin in 1964 and 1968, Eisch has been a guest instructor at San Jose State University (1968), Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine (1972), Foley College of Art, Stourbridge, England (1974) and Alfred University in New York (1976). In addition, he taught various subjects, including drawing, glass painting, sandblasting and engraving at Pilchuck Glass School in 1981, 1983 and 1984. Eisch lectured at the XIII International Congress on Glass in London, England (1968), the World Crafts Conference in Dublin, Ireland (1970), the World Crafts Conference in Kyoto, Japan (1978), the Glass Art Society Conferences in New York City (1982) and in Corning, New York (1979, 1991).

HJCK became an online-only station in 2005. HJCK was founded by intellectuals Eduardo Caballero Calderón, Hernando and Alfonso Martínez Rueda, Alfonso Peñaranda, Gonzalo Rueda Caro, Álvaro Castaño Castillo and his wife, Gloria Valencia de Castaño, as the first privately owned cultural radio station in Colombia. They bought Radio Granadina, an AM station in Bogotá (HJCK would move to FM in 1967). Its slogan, \\"El Mundo en Bogotá\\", comes after one of its first programmes, which included Gabriel García Márquez as its correspondent in Caracas. In 2000 HJCK expanded its programming, at the time devoted to classical music and cultural programmes, to include other music genres, such as blues, jazz, bossa nova, son cubano, and classic rock. The station has compiled a series of recordings with voices of famous Colombian and Latin American writers and intellectuals, known as Colección Literaria HJCK. In 2015, public network Radio Nacional de Colombia broadcast some old HJCK recording in the HJCK en la memoria programme. Due to financial problems and increasingly low ratings, HJCK had to lease its frequency to Caracol Radio in 2005. Between 2005 and 2016 its frequency and call signs were leased by Los 40 Principales, a Caracol Radio network. In late 2015 Caracol TV purchased Radial Bogotá, S. A., the company owning HJCK; it was used to expand the Bluradio network since 2016 (both companies, though having been sister companies until 2001, are no longer related). In early 2019 HJCK renewed its website, becoming a portal focused in culture, seeking to compete with Arcadia (owned by Publicaciones Semana) and El Malpensante (an independent magazine).

Ilana is introduced in the sixth episode of the fifth season of Lost as an officer boarding Ajira Airways Flight 316, with Sayid in her custody. However, as her storyline progresses, it is revealed that she is someone deeply connected to the Island and to Jacob, the Island's highest authority figure. Ilana is killed when a bag of dynamite she is carrying explodes when she sets it on the ground too roughly. Arc Prior to travelling to the island, Ilana is seen bandaged and recuperating in a Russian hospital. She is visited by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino), who asks her to help him by guarding six candidates to succeed him in his role on the island. Ilana travels to Los Angeles, where she apprehends candidate Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), and forcibly escorts him onto Ajira Airways Flight 316. The plane crashes on Hydra Island, a short distance from the main island. Ilana and her cohort Bram (Brad William Henke) take leadership of the Flight 316 survivors and arm themselves. Their group transport a large metal crate which they found on the plane to the main island. They visit Jacob's cabin, and upon finding it empty, burn it to the ground. They then travel to Jacob's home in the statue of Taweret, opening the crate to reveal the body of former candidate John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and a group of Others who had believed Locke to be their leader. Ilana's team confront the Man in Black--the being appearing in Locke's form--inside the statue. They learn that Jacob has been killed, and are then killed themselves by the Man in Black. After gathering Jacob's ashes and burying Locke's body, Ilana leads her fellow Flight 316 survivors Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to the island temple. They arrive to find the temple under attack by the Man in Black. Ilana ushers the group, joined by Miles Straume (Ken Leung) into a hidden room to protect them. As they escape, Ilana asks Miles, who is a medium, how Jacob died. She learns that he was murdered by Ben, who she tells that Jacob was the closest thing she had to a father, before forcing him to dig his own grave. The Man in Black frees Ben, who escapes into the jungle and retrieves a rifle. Ilana chases and confronts him. Ben explains his motivations for killing Jacob, and Ilana forgives him, allowing him to rejoin their group. The group are joined at their camp by Richard, and candidates Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). Ilana tells Richard that Jacob instructed her to find him, and asks what they should do next. Richard says that they must prevent the Man in Black from leaving the island by blowing up the Ajira plane. Ilana then travels to the Black Rock, an 1800s sail ship shipwrecked on the island, which contains dynamite. She returns with four sticks of dynamite, which she places in her shoulder bag. She is reminded that the dynamite is unstable. During an argument with Hurley about whether they should go through with their plan of blowing up the plane, Ilana drops her bag to the ground. The impact triggers an explosion, killing her instantly. =Afterlife= In the alternate 2004 timeline, Ilana is an attorney. Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) catches up with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) again and advises her to consult the lawyer he was about to meet before committing to the adoption agency. This turns out to be Ilana, who has already been looking for Claire. Ilana, as the family attorney for the Shephards, knew that Claire had been named in Christian Shephard (John Terry)'s will. She introduces Claire to her half- brother, Jack Shephard. The series finale, \\"The End\\", revealed that the \\"alternate timeline\\" was in fact a form of purgatory for the characters, after their respective deaths, waiting to move on. Ilana, who is credited at the beginning of the episode, does not appear in the episode; as such, she is not among those characters who \\"move on\\" to their afterlives. Development The casting call for Ilana described her as \\"a European female in her late 20s to early 30s who possesses great intelligence, but who's also dangerous as all get out. She's alluring and apparently used to getting her own way.\\" On September 4, 2008, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that actress Zuleikha Robinson had been cast in the role. Executive producer Carlton Cuse initially likened the character to Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight, stating that; \\"There was something very unsettling about the way the Joker kept telling different stories about his background — something very similar to what we had planned for Ilana.\\"\\" On the character's introduction, fellow executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz explained how the negative audience reaction to Nikki and Paulo, introduced in Lost third season, influenced the way in which they slowly integrated Ilana into the story. Initially cast as a recurring character, Ilana was upgraded to regular character status for season six. Robinson was told little about her character's background, and initially wondered if she had been to the island before. She concluded, however, that Ilana's knowledge of island locations stemmed from her training to protect the candidates. She was unaware of Ilana's surname, and in one scene carried identification which falsely identified her as 'Mary'. Robinson stated that a season six episode would reveal Ilana's surname to be similar to Radzinsky, it was later confirmed to be Verdansky in \\"The Last Recruit\\". Commenting on Ilana's relationship with Jacob and her confrontation with Ben in \\"Dr. Linus\\", Robinson explained: \\"I would think Ilana grew up without a father figure and Jacob became that for her for whatever reason. So when she has the exchange with Ben, it's very personal for her, but at the end of the day she understands she has a job to do and that's more important than the way she feels personally.\\" Robinson later confirmed that Ilana had originally been intended to be Jacob's daughter, however this was later dropped as it was deemed that there was not enough screen time to develop the storyline further in the final season. Also, Cuse has said that there were \\"greater plans\\" for Ilana but they decided to spend more time with established characters instead. In the same interview, he also said that Ilana led a \\"hard and tragic life\\" that he could not reveal any details of yet.

Plot  A surviving print of the film A magician enters the frame and stands between two tables. He removes his own head and puts it on one of the tables, where it starts talking and looking around. The magician repeats the action twice, with a new head appearing on his shoulders each time, until four identical heads are presented at once. The magician then plays a banjo, and all four heads sing along. He then bashes two of the heads with his banjo over their obnoxious singing, making them disappear. He then takes off his head and tosses it aside before taking the other head from the second table, tossing it in the air and it lands back onto his neck. He bows to the viewers, bids them farewell and then strolls off.  Production  Méliès himself plays the magician in the film, which takes advantage of his sense of rhythm, his tendency for elegant gestural movements, and his talent for mime. The Four Troublesome Heads features one of the first known uses of multiple exposure of objects on a black background on film, a special effect Méliès went on to use prolifically. It also marks the first known time Méliès filmed living heads or other body parts separated from the rest of the body, which would become a favourite motif of his.

An illegal print of the film, copied without authorization from Méliès, was released in America in 1903 by Siegmund Lubin under the title Four Heads Are Better Than One. Film critic William B. Parrill, reviewing silent films in the 2010s, called it \\"doubtless a wonder when it appeared, the first of a wonderful comic line which produced not only detachable body parts but also the replication of any number of magical reproductions of [Méliès's] own image.\\"  References  External links  * 1898 films French films French silent short films Films directed by Georges Méliès French black-and-white films ","title":"The Four Troublesome Heads"},{"id":"23804625","text":"Curve of the Earth may refer to: * Curve of the Earth (album), a 2016 album by Mystery Jets * The Curve of the Earth, a 2007 album by Attack in Black * Figure of the Earth, the shape of the planet ","title":"Curve of the Earth"},{"id":"23804650","text":"FireDaemon Pro is an operating system service management application. FireDaemon Pro allows you to install and run most standard Windows applications as a service. These include regular standard Windows executables as well as applications written in scripting or pcode languages such as Perl, Java, Python and Ruby. FireDaemon is popular amongst the online gaming community for running dedicated servers such as Minecraft, Rust, and America's Army. It is possible to add services to Windows without FireDaemon Pro or use other free tools found in the Windows Resource Kits. However, setting up services manually can be complicated and error-prone as the Windows registry needs to be edited directly. Windows services by default will generally be restarted after a minimum of 1 minute has passed. However, FireDaemon Pro proactively monitors the application and ensures an immediate restart. This can be critical when using server-based applications such as web servers, FTP servers, etc. Installation Procedure FireDaemon Pro is available as a .exe package. The installation package doesn't contain any malware or spyware and deploys not only the product but also the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime. Licensing FireDaemon Pro is currently released as licensed software. In the past, there was a free \\"Lite\\" version that was limited to a single service, but it has since been officially discontinued. It can be sourced by searching for \\"FireDaemon Lite\\". Limitations  FireDaemon Pro is sometimes unable to close all error popup windows for applications such as Source Dedicated Server. This is because FireDaemon only intercepts popups of type WS_POPUP and the window class is #32770. Workarounds include leaving the computer logged in rather than logged out or writing custom GUI automation scripts with tools such as AutoIT to automatically close popups. Windows Error Reporting can also interfere with the correct function FireDaemon Pro and should generally be disabled. Security Issues FireDaemon Lite was used in a variety of trojans and worms from around 1999 to 2004 that exploited various security holes in Windows (e.g. Symantec: W32. Tkbot. Worm, Backdoor. Vmz, NAI: Generic Dropper.h,McAfee Threat Library BAT/Mumu.worm.c). Typically, very old or cracked versions of FireDaemon would have been included in the trojan/worm payload and was used to run tools that facilitated the establishment of botnets (e.g. IRC, FTP servers). The use of FireDaemon in botnets is well documented across several security forums as well as written about in several books on botnets and internet security (e.g. Hacking Exposed). Probably the best known botnet that included FireDaemon is XDCC. On rare occasions, anti-malware products may misidentify recent legitimate versions of FireDaemon Pro as being a potential threat by performing \\"trojan like behaviour\\". Advances in anti-malware software since 2005 has resulted in malware authors ceasing to use FireDaemon Pro. As such, there have been no reports of FireDaemon Pro being used in malware since 2005.

Biography Bettina Freeman was born in Boston in 1889. Her mother was French and her father an American of German descent. She was educated in the public schools and began to take lessons on the piano at the age of thirteen, her teacher being Madame de Berg Lofgren, who began to teach her singing also when she was sixteen. When the Boston Opera enterprise was launched Madame Lofgren took her young pupil to the opera school, and after some coaching with Minetti and Conti, Freeman made her debut as Siebel in Faust, and sang with the Boston Opera Company for one season. Seeking an opportunity for larger parts she went to New York where she was engaged for the Quinlan Opera Company, and made a tour through England and Scotland, singing leading parts—Madame Butterfly, Micaela, Gretel—, and even singing Elizabeth in Tannhäuser, a role considered much too taxing for a young singer. Her voice was of mezzo-soprano quality with an unusual range. Freeman had a rather unusual study path, for in 1907, being consumed with the desire to study abroad, she went to Paris, took three or four lessons, was taken ill, and returned to Boston in time to resume her lessons, in the fall, with Madame Lofgren. She thus made her operatic debut with practically no European study or experience.

Founded in 1945 and based in East Providence, Rhode Island, its performing home is Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence. Along with the annual Rhode Island Chamber Music Concerts and the Providence Singers, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the best examples of classical music companies in Rhode Island. RIPO is the country's largest combined professional orchestra and music school. Establishment and history The RIPO was founded in 1945 by Francis Madeira who went on to be its director and conductor; he retired in 1978. Its current music director (as of September, 2019) is Bramwell Tovey and current Resident Conductor is Francisco Noya. Following Francis Madeira's retirement in 1978, Alvaro Cassuto led the Orchestra from 1979-1985. Andrew Massey served as Music Director from 1986–1991, followed by Zuohuang Chen who served in that capacity through the 1995-96 season. As of 2012, the orchestra has attracted the likes of guest conductors Jahja Ling and Michael Stern, violinists Jennifer Frautschi, Karen Gomyo and David Kim, cellist Alban Gerhardt and pianists Ilya Yakushev, Jessie Chang and Jon Kimura Parker to perform with the orchestra. Past special guests include Art Garfunkel, Ben Folds and Chris Botti. In January 2012, soprano Renee Fleming performed a Gala with the Orchestra for the re-dedication of the Vets Auditorium which is undergoing drastic renovations. On June 1, 2014, Yo- Yo Ma performed Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto with the orchestra. Music school The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is the only fully integrated professional orchestra and music school in United States. It has a major music school founded by Alan Fox, which educates over 1,500 students statewide on a weekly basis with an additional 13,000 students through periodic partnerships, residencies, education concerts and in-school performances. The educational program of the school spans not only classical music but extends into pop, jazz, rhythm & blues and advocates youth orchestras and big band ensembles. Instruction is provided on 35 different instruments. In December 2006, the Philharmonic moved into its permanent home on Waterman Avenue in East Providence. This facility, also housing the administrative offices, is now the Carter Center for Music Education & Performance which opened in the fall of 2008, the only facility of its kind in Rhode Island. In the Fall of 2011, the Carter Center added an electronic keyboard and technology lab.

It commemorates the presumed place of St. Vladimir's baptism.  History  According to legend and historic facts the baptism of Vladimir the Great took place in 988 in the Chersonese (or, as it was called by ancient Russians, Korsun), now - Chersonesos Taurica, a National Preserve near Sevastopol. In The Tale of Bygone Years by the monk Nestor the city's conciliar Church was mentioned: “in the middle of the city, where the inhabitants gather to trade”, which, as supposed, could be the probable place of this event crucial for the whole of Rus. The idea to immortalize the place of the Baptism of the Holy Prince Vladimir Equal-to-the-Apostles was first represented in 1825 by the Black Sea Fleet Chief vice-admiral Alexey Greig. On his initiative excavations under the direction of K. Kruse were conducted in Chersonesos Taurica in 1827. As a result, the remains of the ancient Christian churches, including a cruciform basilica were found at the centre of the market square. In the 1830s the historians Frédéric Dubois de Montpéreux and N. Murzakevich made the conjecture that Vladimir the Great was baptized in this basilica. After that, all doubts about the place of the future Church were dispelled. In 1850 on the initiative of Innocent, archbishop of Tauric Chersonese, St. Vladimir's Cloister was founded. On August 23, 1850 the grand laying of the foundation stone of the Church in honor of Saint Vladimir took place. Building thumb The author of the project of St. Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonese was academician David Grimm. According to his plan, the cathedral had to be built in Byzantine style. The construction took 15 years and was finished in 1874–1876, with the assistance of engineer M. Arnold. It was one of the biggest cathedrals in Russia (height – 36 m, total area – 1726 sq. m, dome diameter – 10,5 m) and could accommodate up to a thousand people. The decoration of the church began on the eve of the 900th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus. It was not completed in time for this significant date, so on June 13, 1888 on the Memorial Day of Grand Prince St. Vladimir only the Lower Church in honor of the Birth of Mary was consecrated. That year the iconostasis carved out of wood was placed in the church and the interior work on the Upper Church under the direction of architect Nikolay Chagin began. The painting and icons for the central iconostasis of St. Vladimir Cathedral were made by academician Alexei Korzukhin. Furthermore, in the interior of the cathedral works of the 1850s by academician T. Neff, painter F. Riss, and icons made by I. Maikov and E. Sorokin were also used. Works in marble, such as the iconostasis of the Upper Church, the mosaic floor of the cathedral, and the marble balustrade along the solea, were carried out by Italian masters J. Seppi and brothers Baskarini. The consecration of the Cathedral took place on October 17, 1891, though the final decorative design was completed only in 1894. As far back as 1859 the marble reliquary in the form of a Gospel with relics of Grand Prince St. Vladimir was passed from the Small Church of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to Chersonese. After the building of St. Vladimir Cathedral, his relics were placed in the Lower Church near the ruins of the ancient basilica. At the Upper Church altar is situated the list from the miracle-working Korsun icon of the Mother of God, which, according to legend, was brought from Chersonese by Vladimir the Great. Altogether, the relics of 115 saints were passed to the cathedral. Interior of St. Vladimir Cathedral Reconstruction The bell of Chersonesos with St. Vladimir Cathedral in the background During World War II the cathedral was destroyed. Work on its restoration began in the late 1990s. The project of reconstruction was carried out by the Kiev Institute “UkrProjectRestoration” under the direction of architect E. Osadchiy. From 2002 Vladimir Cathedral was painted by artists from St. Petersburg, Kiev and the Crimea, who recreated the lost paintings of academician A. Korzuhin. The following monumental compositions can be seen on the walls of the cathedral: “The Holy Spirit” (authors – L. Steblovska, E. Revenko), “The Baptism of Christ” (author – A. Dmitrenko), “The Transfiguration of Christ” (authors – L. Dmitrenko, N. Dmitrenko), and “The Lord's Last Supper” (A. Pigarev, K. Popovskiy). The icons for the marble iconostasis of the Upper Church were painted by the young artists A. Dmitrenko and N. Dmitrenko. The consecration of the high altar of Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonese took place on April 3, 2004, and a week later the Easter liturgy was celebrated.

It pays a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected health care utilization of that patient, with payment for patients generally varying by age and health status. Types There are differing arrangement in different healthcare systems. =Capitation in the USA= Primary capitation is a relationship between a managed care organization and primary care physician, in which the physician is paid directly by the organization for those who have selected the physician as their provider. Secondary capitation is a relationship arranged by a managed care organization between a physician and a secondary or specialist provider, such as an X-ray facility or ancillary facility such as a durable medical equipment supplier whose secondary provider is also paid capitation based on that PCP’s enrolled membership. Global capitation is a relationship based on a provider who provides services and is reimbursed per-member per-month for the entire network population. =Capitation in the UK= Between 1948 and 1968 NHS financial allocations were essentially based on sequential inflation uplifts. The Resource Allocation Working Party devised a formula which operated from 1977 to 1989, based on population adjusted for age and sex, weighted for morbidity by Standardized mortality ratio. Incentives Under capitation there is an incentive to consider the cost of treatment. Pure capitation pays a set fee per patient, regardless of their degree of infirmity, giving physicians an incentive to avoid the most costly patients. Care Providers who work under such plans focus on preventive health care, as there is a greater financial reward in the prevention of illness than in the treatment of the ill. Such plans divert providers from the use of expensive treatment options. Insurance The financial risks providers accept in capitation are traditional insurance risks. Provider revenues are fixed, and each enrolled patient makes a claim against the full resources of the provider. In exchange for the fixed payment, physicians essentially become the enrolled clients' insurers, who resolve their patients' claims at the point of care and assume the responsibility for their unknown future health care costs. Large providers tend to manage the risk better than do smaller providers because they are better prepared for variations in service demand and costs, but even large providers are inefficient risk managers in comparison to large insurers. Providers tend to be small in comparison to insurers and so are more like individual consumers, whose annual costs as a percentage of their annual cash flow vary far more than do those of large insurers. For example, a capitated eye care program for 25,000 patients is more viable than a capitated eye program for 10,000 patients. The smaller the roster of patients, the greater the variation in annual costs and the more likely that the costs may exceed the resources of the provider. In very small capitation portfolios, a small number of costly patients can dramatically affect a provider's overall costs and increase the provider's risk of insolvency. Physicians and other health care providers lack the necessary actuarial, underwriting, accounting and finance skills for insurance risk management, but their most severe problem is the greater variation in their estimates of the average patient cost, which leaves them at a financial disadvantage as compared to insurers whose estimates are far more accurate. Because their risks are a function of portfolio size, providers can reduce their risks only by increasing the numbers of patients they carry on their rosters, but their inefficiency relative to that of the insurers' is far greater than can be mitigated by these increases. To manage risk as efficiently as an insurer, a provider would have to assume 100% of the insurer's portfolio. HMOs and insurers manage their costs better than risk- assuming healthcare providers and cannot make risk-adjusted capitation payments without sacrificing profitability. Risk-transferring entities will enter into such agreements only if they can maintain the levels of profits they achieve by retaining risks. =Reinsurance= Providers cannot afford reinsurance, which would further deplete their inadequate capitation payments, as the reinsurer's expected loss costs, expenses, profits and risk loads must be paid by the providers. The goal of reinsurance is to offload risk and reward to the reinsurer in return for more stable operating results, but the provider's additional costs make that impractical. Reinsurance assumes that the insurance-risk-transferring entities do not create inefficiencies when they shift insurance risks to providers. Without any induced inefficiencies, providers would be able to pass on a portion of their risk premiums to reinsurers, but the premiums that providers would have to receive would exceed the premiums that risk-transferring entities could charge in competitive insurance markets. Reinsurers are wary of contracting with physicians, as they believe that if providers think they can collect more than they pay in premiums, they would tend to revert to the same excesses encouraged by fee- for-service payment systems.

Mr Edward Terrell - Obituary. The Times 22 November 1979 p16G. with a flair for invention; by 1940 he had registered a number of patents relating to pens, ink bottles and peeling knives.Terrell, Edward. US Patents 2215942, 1724980, for example. When war came, he volunteered for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Special Branch of the Volunteer Reserve to run an information section.Terrell, 1958, p 21. Early life He was the son of Thomas Terrell KC, who was a Liberal Member of Parliament. He graduated at London University and was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1924. He first stood for Parliament at the 1929 General Election, when he was Liberal candidate for Watford. He came second, ahead of the Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1931 General Election but stood as Liberal candidate for Lambeth North at the 1935 General Election when he again finished second. From 1935 he was Recorder of Newbury. While still a civilian Terrell had outlined a scheme to the Admiralty suggesting that bases and units would need an attached lawyer to deal with the many personal legal problems that would arise with mass call-ups, and at the same time had applied to the commissioning board of the RNVR. Shortly afterwards he was approached by Charles F. Goodeve, on the staff of Sir James Sommerville, to run an information section. His selection was based on his scientific background and to some extent that his father (a KC) had practised in patent law. As a result, he joined the RNVR as a lieutenant. World War II He was now part of what Terrell described as \\"private army\\" for Goodeve to develop naval weapons. It was nominally the staff of the \\"Inspector of Anti-Aircraft Weapons and Devices\\" but with Sommerville's departure to the Mediterranean fleet this post would be vacant, and the group (consisting of Terrell, Goodeve, the aeronautical engineer Nevil Shute Norway, the scientist F. D. Richardson, and a regular naval officer Millar) would have been disbanded but Goodeve and Millar made an arrangement with the Trade Division which was responsible for protection of the merchant fleet. As such Terrell was in charge of collecting information on the German methods of attacking the merchant ships. He developed plastic armour for which he received an award from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors.Although the Commission decided that Terrell was the \\"sole inventor\\", he passed a proportion of the award to Dr Glanville, who had worked with him on it. When asked for films of German aircraft attacking merchant ships as propaganda for American production of Oerlikon guns, Terrell proposed a more substantial story using genuine mariners which received immediate approval from Sir Bruce Fraser, Controller of the Navy. The resulting film, The Gun, included the American commentator Edward Morrow. The film used some of Terrell’s collected footage of attacks on real ships.Terrell, 1958, pp. 116–128. Recognised for his ingenuity, energy and tact, Terrell was appointed to the staff of the First Sea Lord as an assistant to Vice-Admiral Cecil Vivian Usborne. He was promoted with exceptional rapidity to the temporary rank of commander.RN Officers – Double step in acting rank – Terrell – ADM 1/13712. The Catalogue, The National Archives Usborne's task was to develop weapons and techniques against U-boats, and he and Terrell formed a team of two. Their first success was introducing a tactical table to train and practise anti-submarine tactics at Western Approaches Command. After investigating the captured U-boat U-570, they determined that if the hull was penetrated by 20 mm shells, the crew would be unable to stop the flooding. As a result, patrol craft were armed with Hispano 20 mm cannon. At the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development he helped with the development of a more powerful version of the Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon called Squid. He developed techniques for reducing the conspicuous smoke given off by ships, and he worked on a bunker- busting rocket-powered bomb, the Disney bomb.Terrell, 1958. pp. 197–212. Terrell enjoyed a close relationship with Millis Jefferis of MD1, and he once defended Jefferis in court when he had been found to be driving while uninsured.Terrell, 1958, p. 179. In 1947 he represented Robert Stuart Macrae, also of MD1, at the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors, who was being considered for his work on the sticky bomb and other inventions. Postwar life Terrell returned to the legal profession after the war, taking silk and became a Recorder of the Crown Court. In 1958, be published a book on his wartime experiences.

The bridge carried U.S. Route 35 over the Ohio River, connecting Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio. On December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge collapsed under the weight of rush-hour traffic, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. Two of the victims were never found. Investigation of the wreckage pointed to the cause of the collapse being the failure of a single eyebar in a suspension chain, due to a small defect deep. Analysis showed that the bridge was carrying much heavier loads than it had originally been designed for and had been poorly maintained. The collapsed bridge was replaced by the Silver Memorial Bridge, which was completed in 1969. History of eyebar-chain bridge construction At the time of the Silver Bridge construction, eyebar bridges had been built for about 100 years. Such bridges had usually been constructed from redundant bar links, using rows of four to six bars, sometimes using several such chains in parallel. An example can be seen in the Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The chain eyebars are redundant in two dimensions. This is an early suspension bridge still in service. Other bridges of similar design include the earlier road bridge over the Menai Strait built by Thomas Telford in 1826; the Széchenyi Chain Bridge in Budapest, built in 1839–1849, destroyed in the closing days of World War II by retreating Germans in 1945, and rebuilt identically by 1949, with redundant chains and hangers; and the Three Sisters, self-anchored suspension bridges of similar design and construction period (from 1924 to 1928) in Pittsburgh. Silver Bridge structure=Low redundancy, high strength= The eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as links were composed of only two bars each, of high-strength steel (more than twice the tensile strength of common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner bars of modest material strength \\"combed\\" together, as is usual for redundancy. With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the second, causing total failure -- which would be unlikely if more bars were used. While a low-redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is completely dependent upon correct, high-quality manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance. In comparison, the Brooklyn Bridge, with wire-cable suspension, was designed with an excess strength factor of six. Wire cables have extremely high levels of redundancy, with the failure of a single wire strand almost unnoticeable. During the Brooklyn Bridge's construction it was discovered that some rejected steel wire had been used. To compensate for the rejected steel wire already in the cables, 150 more good steel wires per cable were added to bring the total up to 5,434 redundant strands. The designer's son, Washington Roebling, decided the safety factor may have been reduced, but was far more than sufficient. =Rocker towers= The towers were \\"rocker\\" towers (a design common in Europe), which allowed the bridge to respond to various live loads by a slight tipping of the supporting towers, which were parted at the deck level, rather than passing the suspension chain over a lubricated or tipping saddle, or by stressing the towers in bending. The towers required the chain on both sides for their support; failure of any one link on either side, in any of the three chain spans, would result in the complete failure of the entire bridge. Design loads At the time of the bridge construction, a typical family automobile was the Ford Model T, with a weight of about . The maximum permitted truck gross weight was about . By contrast, at the time of the collapse, a typical family automobile weighed about and the large truck limit was or more. Bumper-to-bumper traffic jams on the bridge were also much more common, occurring several times a day, five days each week, thus causing more stress to the bridge elements. Wreckage analysis The bridge failure was due to a defect in a single link, eye-bar 330, on the north of the Ohio subsidiary chain, the first link below the top of the Ohio tower. A small crack was formed through fretting wear at the bearing, and grew through internal corrosion, a problem known as stress corrosion cracking. The crack was only about deep when it went critical, and it broke in a brittle fashion. Growth of the crack was probably exacerbated by residual stress in the eyebar created during manufacture. When the lower side of the eyebar failed, all the load was transferred to the other side of the eyebar, which then failed by ductile overload. The joint was then held together only by three eyebars, and another slipped off the pin at the center of the bearing, so the chain was completely severed. Collapse of the entire structure was inevitable since all parts of a suspension bridge are in equilibrium with one another. Witnesses afterward estimated that it took only about a minute for the whole bridge to fall. The damage to the link would have been difficult to see during inspection of the bridge: > Inspection prior to construction would not have been able to notice the tiny > crack ... the only way to detect the fracture would have been to disassemble > the eye-bar. The technology used for inspection at the time was not capable > of detecting such cracks. Aftermath The collapse focused much needed attention on the condition of older bridges, leading to intensified inspection protocols and numerous eventual replacements. There were only two bridges built to a similar design, one upstream at St. Marys, West Virginia, and the notably longer Hercilio Luz Bridge at Florianópolis, Brazil. The St. Marys bridge was immediately closed to traffic and the bridge was demolished by the state in 1971. A small truss bridge was kept to allow access to an island in the river. The Hi Carpenter Memorial Bridge was later built to replace the demolished bridge. The Hercilio Luz Bridge remained in active service until 1991 to be reopened only in 2019 after a restoration and still stands at Florianópolis due to being built to a higher safety factor than the West Virginia bridge. Modern non-destructive testing methods allow some of the older bridges to remain in service where they are located on lightly traveled roads. Most heavily used bridges of this type have been replaced with modern bridges of various types. The collapse inspired legislation to ensure that older bridges were regularly inspected and maintained; however, aging infrastructure is still a problem in the United States. In 1983 the Mianus River Bridge in Greenwich, Connecticut, collapsed, causing the deaths of three drivers. The I-35W Mississippi River bridge disaster in 2007 resulted in 13 deaths. In early September 2009, the failure of an eyebar in the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge was discovered during a scheduled closure, resulting in an emergency repair to reinforce the failed member. A scale model of the original Silver Bridge was on display at the Point Pleasant River Museum. An archive of literature about the bridge was also kept there for public inspection. On the lower ground floor, the museum displayed an eyebar assembly from the original bridge. The museum closed July 1, 2018 due to significant fire damage. The future of the Silver Bridge exhibit is not known. Another eyebar example has been erected for public viewing at a small rest area on the Ohio side of the river, along Route 7. A memorial was installed in Point Pleasant to commemorate the 46 bridge collapse victims. Legacy Reviewing the collapse and subsequent investigation in his 2012 book To Forgive Design, engineering historian Henry Petroski finds it \\"a cautionary tale for engineers of every kind\\". As a result of the thoroughness of the investigation, the cause of the disaster was precisely and indisputably found to be \\"a design that inadvertently made inspection all but impossible and failure all but inevitable. If ever a design was to blame for a failure, this was it\\". He does not fault the bridge's designers, who were ignorant of many of these hazards. Instead he points to the future. \\"If there is anything positive about the Silver Bridge failure\\", he concludes, \\"it is that its legacy should be to remind engineers to proceed always with the utmost caution, ever mindful of the possible existence of unknown unknowns and the potential consequences of even the smallest design decisions\\". In popular culture *In his 1970 book Operation Trojan Horse, and his 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies, Fortean author John Keel linked the Silver Bridge collapse to alleged sightings of the Mothman. The story was adapted as a film by the same name, released in 2002. * Author Jack Matthews wrote a novella, Beyond the Bridge, written as the diary of an imaginary survivor of the disaster starting a new life as a dishwasher in a tiny West Virginia town. *Honky tonk singer-songwriter and West Virginia native Ray Anderson released \\"The Silver Bridge Disaster\\" as the A-side of a 1967 single. Silver Memorial Bridge Aerial view of the bridge in 2019 The Silver Memorial Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Ohio River between Gallipolis, Ohio and Henderson, West Virginia. The bridge was completed in 1969 as a replacement for the collapsed Silver Bridge, although it is located about 1 mile (1.6 km) downstream (south) of the original. The bridge carries US 35 across the river and serves as a major crossing for people and goods traveling between Charleston, West Virginia and Southern and Central Ohio. The speed limit on the bridge is 65 mph (105 km/h). No toll is imposed at either end.

KDPS went through several divisions in the sixties. Mustafa Barzani (The father of Massoud Barzani the current president of Iraqi Kurdistan) attempted to reunify the party by inviting all the fractions in 1970 to Iraqi Kurdistan. During the meetings Miro was chosen and later re-elected in 1972 as the chairman of KDPS.

Its pointed shape is similar to the pilos helmet that is placed underneath a konos as an interior protector.

Bronze ear guards that hang to the jawbone were later added for further protection, also differing from the pilos.

The city's major river port and an industrial park are located there. History The name President or President's Island appeared as early as 1801 or 1802 in a river guide called Cramer's Navigator.Vrettos, N. Story of Presidents Island. Presidents Island, Industrial Association, 2005. The name referred to the island's size, then the largest on the Mississippi River. At that time President's Island was an actual island. Some old river maps identify the northern third of the present island as Vice President's Island. The Freedmen's Bureau established a camp on the island for freed slaves in 1865, and about 1,500 former slaves stayed there for a time. Some years later, Nathan Bedford Forrest contracted with local officials to establish a penal farm on the island to raise corn and cotton. Forrest offered to pay Shelby County 10 cents a day for each worker. Forrest died in 1877, possibly of dysentery contracted by drinking impure island water. In the late 1870s the island served as a refuge for many people fleeing the yellow fever epidemics that swept the city, killing thousands. The development plan devised in the 1940s called for closing the Tennessee Chute that had separated the island from the eastern bank. This created a deep-water harbor (later named McKellar Lake) accessible from the Mississippi by the channel at the south end of the island. The Flood Control Act of 1946 allocated $17 million for the project, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction in 1948. The flood control and industrial development project in the late 1940s dammed the section of river between the island and the eastern bank and created a peninsula. Prior to that time, the island was surrounded by the river and subject to its power. Floods interfered with various attempts to raise crops and endangered the lives of those who had settled there. The island's relative isolation and untamed landscape made it a favored location for illicit activities, including gambling, cockfights, and moonshining. Four Memphians were most responsible for transforming President's Island into an industrial center: businessman Frank C. Pidgeon, E.H. Crump, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, and Jack Carley, an editorial writer for the Commercial Appeal newspaper. McKellar was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which was instrumental in funding the project. Gen. M.C. Tyler, former president of the Mississippi River Commission, was also instrumental in plans for island development. The island was annexed by the city in 1947. Today The 7,500 acre peninsula is home to a diverse wildlife habitat with 1,200 acres zoned for industrial development. 95% of the industrial land is already occupied with an annual economic impact of $7.1 billion. The industrial park supports about 200 companies with 4,000 employees. Most of the land is in the flood plain with several thousand acres of undeveloped woodlands.

Clemen was born in Leipzig, son of Professor Christian August Julius Clemen (1838–1920) and his wife Helene Voigt (1842–1907). His two brothers Carl and Otto became prominent scholars in their own right in the fields of comparative religion and history, respectively.Lützeler 1957, p. 281 He studied at the universities of Strassburg (now Strasbourg), where he was awarded his doctorate in 1889 for a dissertation on the portraits of Charlemagne (Porträtdarstellungen Karls des Grossen)Porträtdarstellungen Karls des Grossen (diss.

He became extraordinary professor of art history in Bonn in 1898 and professor of the History of Art and Literature at the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts in 1899. In 1902, he was appointed professor (ordinarius) of art history in Bonn, a position he held until his retirement in 1936. In Bonn, Heinrich Lützeler was one of his students. He served as guest professor at Harvard University during 1907–1908.Lützeler 1957, p. 281 Clemen's earliest publications on medieval art impressed the authorities of the province enough to make him responsible for the inventory of the monuments of the province. He began, in 1891, the publication of the series Die Kunstdenkmäler der Rheinprovinz (Monuments of the Rhine Province), for which he served as editor for the next 46 years. The project culminated in 1937 with the publication of the volume on the Cologne Cathedral, Der Dom zu Köln, a collaboration with Heinrich Neu and Fritz Witte, but with Clemen as main author.Appel 1938, p. 67 During World War I, Clemen was head of the art commission for the German occupation force in Belgium. An obituary of Clemen published in an American journal noted that \\"far from despoiling the occupied country of its art objects this commission saw its purpose in the cataloguing and photographing of Belgian monuments.\\"Nathan, p. 217 His work during the war years resulted both in a book on the subject, Kunstschutz im Kriege (in English translation as Protection of Art During the War, both 1919), and in the two-volume Belgische Kunstdenkmäler (Munich 1923). Many of the monuments Clemen had dedicated himself to protect, including several of the medieval churches in Cologne, were destroyed during World War II, and his house was destroyed by air bombardment in 1944, along with his library and a manuscript for a large treatment of the history of the art of the Rhineland.Nathan, p. 216; Lützeler 1957, p. 281 NotesReferences *Appel, Heinrich, review of Paul Clemen (et al.), Der Dom zu Köln, in: Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte, 7 Bd., H. 1 (1938), pp. 67–69 *Lützeler, Heinrich: \\"[Clemen, Paul]\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie, Bd 3 (1957), p. 281\\\\. *Nathan, Walter L.: \\"Paul Clemen (1866-1947)\\", College Art Journal, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Spring 1948), pp. 216–218. *Schrey, Heinz Horst: \\"[Clemen,] Carl Christian\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie, Bd 3 (1957), p. 280 (on the family).

Strick's directing debut, the film follows the struggles of a couple who have just adopted a 6-year-old girl, only to discover that her biological parents, a murderous couple, are trying to reclaim her. Released in the United States on September 8, 1995, The Tie That Binds grossed over $5 million at the domestic box office. At the 17th annual Young Artist Awards in 1996, Julia Devin was nominated for Best Young Supporting Actress - Feature Film, but lost out to Kristy Young, who was in the movie Gordy. Plot In California, John Netherwood (Keith Carradine) and his wife Leann Netherwood (Daryl Hannah) are fugitives who are wanted for murder. They have a 6-year-old daughter named Janie (Julia Devin). John and Leann are robbing a house when the elderly residents of the house show up. After killing the two residents, John and Leann go outside, where there are cops waiting. John and Leann escape after John gets shot by Officer David Carrey (Ned Vaughn). Janie is found in the car that John and Leann left behind, and Janie is placed up for adoption. Helped by adoption agency case worker Maggie Hass (Jenny Gago), Los Angeles architect Russell Clifton (Vincent Spano) and his photographer wife Dana (Moira Kelly) adopt Janie, welcoming a traumatized Janie into their home. Though intelligent and charming, Janie's behavior is very disturbing: She hides in closets, cuts herself, steals food, and draws monstrous pictures of the \\"Tooth Fairy,\\" of whom she's terrified. Russell and Dana believe that with love, Janie will be alright. The Netherwoods begin planning to reclaim Janie. Leann picks up Officer Carrey, and John tortures the name of the adoption agency out of Carrey before John slits Carrey's throat, killing Carrey. The Netherwoods then force Maggie to tell them who adopted Janie, then they kill Maggie. At the same time, Russell and Dana have found out who Janie's biological parents are. Leann tries to kidnap Janie from school, forcing the Cliftons to go into hiding with Janie. The Netherwoods track down the Cliftons' friends, Lisa Marie Chandler (Cynda Williams) and her husband Gil Chandler (Bruce A. Young), and Leann threatens to hurt the Chandlers' newborn baby, forcing Lisa Marie to tell Leann where the Cliftons are hiding—a half- built house that Russell designed for himself, Dana, and Janie. The Netherwoods head to the half-built house and take Janie and the Cliftons hostage. John sets the house on fire. Russell and John struggle with each other, then John starts running through the burning house looking for Janie, who has now run off into the nearby woods. Along the way, John runs into Leann in the blinding smoke. Leann has found Dana and Janie, and has had a change of heart. Because of that, John kills Leann by snapping her neck. Dana runs into the woods to find Janie, and John is following Dana. John is the first to find Janie, and Janie pulls out a knife, stabs John in the stomach, and then says \\"I learned that from you, Daddy.\\" Just as John is about to lunge at Janie for stabbing him, Russell shows up and grabs a log the size of a baseball bat, and he hits John with it, knocking John to the ground. When John gets back up and tries to lunge again, Russell hits John in the head with the log, killing John. Dana finds Russell and Janie, and Janie finally feels comfortable about being with the Cliftons.

The teenager remained in hiding within Poland under the false name of 'Krzysztof Zaleski', a name he maintained afterwards in remembrance of the ordeal. During that time, he worked in a tomato field together with a Pole who happened to speak Esperanto; this person once tried to recruit him to the cause, asking him: Ĉu vi konas Esperanton? (\\"Do you know Esperanto?\\"). 'Christoph' blurted out: Ho jes, mi konas; ĝin inventis mia avo! (\\"Oh yes, I know it; my grandfather invented it!\\") He immediately feared that he had been indiscreet and would be denounced and arrested, but nothing untoward occurred. Career After earning a doctorate in civil and marine engineering, he began work as a professional engineer. Beginning in Poland after World War II and since the 1960s in France, he has designed precast concrete structures and projects ranging from deep-sea oil rigs, sports complexes, and the Charles de Gaulle Memorial, which dominates the village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. He has also taught the theory and techniques of land and sea construction at various academic institutions. On 14 April 1999 Hanna Konopka, president of the Zamenhof Foundation of Białystok, announced that Pope John Paul II would be the first recipient of the Foundation's Tolerance Medal (Medalo de Toleremo). As well as the Esperantist trustees of the Foundation, the award committee included eminent persons such as Archbishop Stanisław Szymecki; the award met with general approval among the people of Białystok. Zaleski-Zamenhof presented the Tolerance Medal on 10 June 1999, during the Pope's historic visit to Poland. Dr. Zaleski-Zamenhof wrote a foreword to L'homme qui a défié Babel (\\"The man who defied Babel\\", 2003), a French-language biography, by René Centassi and Henri Masson, of the originator of Esperanto.(fr) René Centassi and Henri Masson, L'homme qui a défié Babel. 2003: L'Harmattan, 339 pp. Louis- Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof with the deputy mayor of Białystok during the 2008 World Congress of Esperanto. World Congress addresses In a 2001 speech, Dr. Zaleski-Zamenhof characterized the 86th World Congress of Esperanto in Zagreb, Croatia as not only the first such World Congress in the third millennium of the civil calendar but also the third century of Esperanto, reminding the delegates: \\"You came to discuss intercultural dialogue, the pressing need for which inspired the initiation of the international language. In fact, almost all his biographies relate the story of the young Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof living in the multicultural city of Białystok, observing the animosity that then governed relations among the varied nationalities, not finding a commonly understandable language, a tool that was, as he said, necessary for dialogue among the respective cultures. Mutual dialogue enables people to understand and respect different cultures; without such an understanding, a foreign culture may appear strange or inimical and inspire disdain, contempt or hatred.\\"(eo) Message of Dr. Zaleski-Zamenhof to the 86th World Congress of Esperanto (Zagreb, Croatia, 2001). Retrieved 2009-07-28. Indeed, he pointed out, the English word strange and the French word étrange both mean 'odd' or 'peculiar', while the related words stranger and étranger mean 'foreigner', and the neutral language used at World Congresses of Esperanto, which implies equality among linguistic communities, can respect other cultures yet strictly avoid imposing any particular mode of thought on them, even if they happen to be non-influential minorities. The following year, Zaleski-Zamenhof sent a written greeting to the 87th World Congress meeting in Fortaleza, Brazil. Declaring that mankind is a species created for diversity, he congratulated the Brazilian hosts for the variegatedness of the nation's natural setting and the diversity of its peoples, customs and cultures and favourably compared Brazilians to the \\"great family circle\\" of worldwide Esperantism, urging people to not to see cultural differences as a threat but as their good fortune.(eo) Greetings to the 87th World Congress of Esperanto (Fortaleza, Brazil - 2002). Retrieved 2009-07-28. In 2003 Dr. Zaleski-Zamenhof again addressed a World Congress, this time in Gothenburg, Sweden, recalling how, 60 years previous during World War II, the very name of Gothenburg had for him and his family been emblematic of human rights and freedom: \\"To us, then in occupied Warsaw, incarcerated within its infamous walls, Gothenburg was a fabled world from which, like the manna from the skies in Biblical times, a panoply of delicious foods used to come whose very existence we had by then long since forgotten. I will always remember the sender's name written on the packages: Einar Adamson, an Esperanto speaker from Gothenburg. I fondly remember having the chance in 1948 to meet him in person on the occasion of the Malmö World Congress of Esperanto, the only Congress I was able to attend during the decade after the war. At that time I also became acquainted with the city of Gothenburg, and became a friend with Adamson's entire family; moreover, Einar's daughter remains my very dear friend.\\"(eo) Speech to the 88th World Congress , (Gothenburg, Sweden - 2003). Retrieved 2009-07-28. Further, he called for harmony among peoples, for recognition of all people's right to speak their chosen language, including the neutral language of Esperanto, and for the ending of world hunger through support for an effective and measured campaign of action at UNESCO and the United Nations. Zamenhof Street biography Thoroughly committed to the Esperanto cause, as attested by his customary public greetings to World Congresses of Esperanto on behalf of the Zamenhof family, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof was nevertheless been disinclined to assume a leading role in the Esperanto movement. Though he had no plans to write an autobiography, Polish journalist Roman Dobrzyński persuaded him to participate in a series of conversations over a ten-year period, which resulted in La Zamenhof-strato (\\"Zamenhof Street\\", 2003),(fr) Roman Dobrzyński, La rue Zamenhof (Ginette Martin, tr.), 2009: L'Harmattan, 249 pp. a book detailing his life during the Nazi occupation of Poland, including his experiences in the Warsaw Ghetto and the Polish Resistance. Beyond an account of his own life, the book also relates the philosophy, history and tribulations of the Esperanto movement pioneered by his grandfather, and speculates as to the planned language's future prospects. The book has now been published in Polish, Esperanto, Lithuanian, Czech, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovakian, French and Korean.(eo) Dirk Bindmann, Review of La Zamenhof-strato (Roman Dobrzyński's biography of L.C.

She is invited to dinner by Kim Fielding, an intelligent classmate who never breaks any rules. She has to babysit her sister Julia, since her father is out of town for the night. Lisa feels she does not have anything in common with her, and she only agrees to come over to meet her boyfriend there. They meet a man named Randy, he offers mangoes. Bored and awaiting his arrival, she joins Kim and Julia in making prank calls. When it's her turn, she calls Adrian Lancer, a man with mental problems who just murdered his girlfriend Robyn Griffin because she declined a marriage proposal from him. Lisa decides to hang up and later calls people, saying \\"I saw what you did, and I know who you are\\" before hanging up. Lisa and Kim later discuss Kim's love life, and they decide she needs an older man who appreciates her. They decide on calling Adrian again, but Lisa, afraid to seduce him, repeats the line \\"I saw what you did, and I know who you are.\\" Adrian, who was caught in the act when he was burying Robyn's body, does not realize it's a prank and is determined to get rid of her. She thinks he was flirting with her on the phone and later calls him again, agreeing to meet with him. She is nervous to actually meet him, but she is convinced that she should drive by his house. Meanwhile, Adrian's neighbor and brother Stephen notices blood coming through the wall, and he starts to suspect that there is something wrong. Adrian notices Kim and Lisa standing in front of his door and opens it. Kim, too afraid to admit she is the girl he talked to on the phone, pretends that their car broke down and that she has to use the phone to call for help. While Lisa is waiting outside, Adrian lets Kim use his phone. She pretends to call someone and mentions she is at Adrian's. Adrian immediately becomes suspicious, as he has not told his name to her. She starts to get afraid of him and leaves, but forgets her purse by mistake. After she drives away, Stephen drops by and informs him that he informed Robyn about his mental problems. Back at home, Louis and his friends finally drop by Kim's house to pick up Lisa. Not wanting to ditch Kim, she decides not to go with him. Kim still feels hurt, though, for finding out Lisa only used her for meeting friends, and Lisa soon leaves. Stephen finds out that Adrian killed his girlfriend, but before he can do anything about it, Adrian knocks him out. He pours gasoline on him and is about to light him on fire, but he diverts his attention to silencing Kim first. He leaves and Stephen regains consciousness and reports him to the police. Meanwhile, Adrian is on his way to Kim's house, but a policeman is behind him, trying to pull him over. Adrian speeds away and loses control of his car. It goes off the road and a few moments later blows up. The police assume he perished in the explosion, but he got out of the car before the explosion and continues on to Kim's house. We also notice Randy standing in an empty yard. Upon confronting her, she admits she prank called him. They are interrupted by a phone call from Lisa, informing Kim that she just heard on the news that Adrian murdered his girlfriend and that he is now presumed dead. Kim tries to warn the police, but Adrian stops her, setting the house on fire. Julia attempts to go out, but Kim stops her, explaining that Adrian is outside, not knowing that he is in fact inside. He attempts to kill Kim, but the family dog charges into him, knocking him into the fire. During the commotion, Kim and Julia are eventually able to get outside with the help of Randy. After Kim and the police arrive, they witness Adrian running outside, burning alive and dying before he can hurt anybody else. One night, after the incident is over, Kim receives a phone call from Stephen, who says 'Kim, I know who you are. You killed my brother.' Kim screams and the film ends.

It is probably the only feral herd of horses residing in Africa, with a population ranging between 90 and 150. The Namib Desert Horse is athletic in appearance, resembling the European light riding horses from which it probably descends, and usually dark in color. Despite the harsh environment in which they live, the horses are generally in good condition, except during times of extreme drought. The horses have been the subject of several population studies, which have given significant insight into their population dynamics and ability to survive in desert conditions. The origin of the Namib Desert Horse is unclear, though several theories have been put forward. Genetic tests have been performed, although none to date have completely verified their origin. The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses, many from German breeding programs, released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century, especially during World War I. Whatever their origin, the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains, near Aus, Namibia, the location of a man-made water source. They were generally ignored by humans, except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat, until the 1980s. In 1984, the first aerial survey of the population was made, and in 1986, their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park. At several points, some horses have been removed from the herd, including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992. Since the early 1990s, close records of the population have been kept, and studies have been performed to determine the horses' effect on their environment. Despite being considered an exotic species within the park, they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country's history and draw as a tourist attraction.  Characteristics  Two horses showing typical dark coloration The most common color of the Namib Desert Horse is bay, although there are a few chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, clean-limbed, and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances. Scientists studying the horses rate their body condition on a scale of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role.Greyling pp. 106–107 Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.Greyling, p. 108 =Behavior and ecology= Spotted hyenas are known to predate young Namib Desert Horses Namib Desert Horses near Garub The home range of the Namib Desert Horse reaches north in the Namib Desert to the Koichab River, usually dry, and west to the Great Escarpment. Bands of horses range together, consisting of as few as two animals, although there are generally more. In observations between 1993 and 2003, between six and eleven bands were identified, including a mixture of bachelor herds, breeding groups and co-operating stallion groups (groups with more than one stallion that share breeding duties).Greyling, p. 103 The Namib Desert Horse travels extensively, searching for food, water and shelter from the climate and insects. A 1994 study found that they have an average home range of , although not all of that is traversed each day. They must cover considerable distances, as much as between the few existing water sources and the best grazing sources. This creates severe selection pressure and removes weak animals from the population. Due to scarcity of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water for as long as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state. The horses, especially young foals and juveniles, provide a major food source in the southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food appears to have a significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black- backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and lameness.Greyling, pp. 92–93 Other large plains animals, including the mountain zebra, may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area.Greyling, p. 22 The endangered Hartmann's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.Greyling, p. 26 =Genetics= Genetic testing results published in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses are one of the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.Greyling, p. 110 The 2001 testing showed the Namib Desert Horse to be part of the Oriental horse grouping, genetically closest to the Arabian horse, although even this association was distant. They were closer to the Arabian than to the three South African breeds tested, the Nooitgedacht pony, the Boer pony and the Basuto pony. As the genetic similarity to Arabian-type horses is distant, they do not closely resemble them in outward appearance, although they are both of the \\"hot blooded\\" type, resulting in both being athletic, lean-muscled animals. Further, in blood typing studies done in the 1990s, a new variant was noted. Its absence from the blood samples of all other horse breeds indicates the presence of a mutation that probably occurred after the horses became established in the desert.  History  Resting in the shade next to an abandoned German train station Southern Africa has no native horse populations, so the origins of the Namib Desert Horse trace to imported herds of horses. There are several theories on the ancestors of the Namib Desert Horse, and the true story may never be known. One theory says that a cargo ship carrying Thoroughbreds to Australia wrecked near the Orange River, and the strongest horses swam ashore and traveled to the Garub Plains, the home of the Namib Desert Horse, near Aus, Namibia. Another theory states that they descend from Cape horse/Basuto pony crosses ridden by Khoikhoi raiders traveling from southern Africa to north of the Orange River. The most likely theory has the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of escaped South African military horses and Namibian-bred German horses. During World War I, horses were used in campaigns in Namibia between the German Schutztruppe and South African troops, and some escaped or were released into the desert. Prior to this time, a German Baron von Wolf built Duwisib Castle on the edge of the Namib Desert, where he held a herd of approximately 300 horses. Von Wolf was killed in action in Europe during World War I, and his farm was abandoned, leaving his horses on unfenced land relatively close to the area where the Namib Desert Horses now roam. The Namib Desert Horse phenotypically more closely resembles the horses bred by von Wolf and ridden by the World War I-era troops than the horses ridden by Khoikhoi tribesmen, making the former story the more likely. The genetic evidence of the 2001 study gave less credence to the descent from von Wolf's horses. He used Thoroughbreds, Hackneys and Trakehners in his breeding program, rather than the Arabian horse to which the Namib Desert Horses are the most genetically similar. Research in the archives of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek, combined with blood typing studies, suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals, as opposed to work horses. A study released in 2005 reinforces the theory of the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses. One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub, leased by Emil Kreplin (previously mayor of Lüderitz) from 1911 to 1919. Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse. In addition, in early 1915, during the fighting of World War I, bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub. Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses, for the purposes of scattering them. These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin's stud farm during the turmoil of the war. Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub.Greyling, pp. 24–25 =1970s to present= The Namib Desert Horses were originally forced to compete with domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed. Due in part to this competition for limited forage, the horses nearly became extinct. However, they were saved in part due to the efforts of Jan Coetzer, employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine (CDM or DBCM), mining in part of Sperrgebiet. Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977, when diesel locomotives took over the route. The horses, who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives, were placed in danger when the pumping stopped, with several horses dying of dehydration. Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water, which they did in 1980, installing holding tanks and a water trough.Greyling, pp. 25–26 Between 1964 and 1984, population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses, but generally averaged 140 to 160. In 1984, an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses, while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals.Greyling, p. 85 The watering hole at Garub, with a shelter for human visitors in the background. In the mid-1980s, the horses' habitat was made part of Namib-Naukluft Park, the largest game reserve in Africa. In 1986, after the expansion to the park, a movement was made to remove all horses (which were considered an exotic species); public outcry prevented this from happening. The following year, 10 horses were removed from the park for research purposes and 8 others for use as patrol horses in Etosha National Park, although they were unsuccessful in the latter use.Greyling, p. 27 In 1992, as Namibia gained its independence and a drought enveloped southern Africa, a decision was made to reduce the population, then estimated at 276 animals. In June, 104 animals were captured unselectively and sold, but many did not adjust well to their new habitats and by 1997 at least half had died. In 1997, with the feral population at 149 horses, 35 horses, selected for age, gender and degree of genetic relationship, were removed, with the intent being to sell them at auction. The horses were kept in holding pens for six weeks, during which time the stallions became very aggressive and had to be separated; after this, the auction was cancelled and the horses released back to their range.Greyling, p. 28 Beginning in December 1993, semiannual population counts have been completed. Between 1993 and 2005, herd numbers ranged between 89 and 149 animals, with the 1999–2001 counts providing sub-100 population numbers. Although several attempts were originally made to exterminate the horses, due to a possible threat to oryx habitat, they are now protected by the South West Africa/Namibia Directorate of Nature Conservation. The Namib Desert Horse is likely the only herd of feral horses in Africa. Feral Namib horses interacting closely with human visitors to the watering hole at Garub There is concern in some quarters that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat, through overgrazing and competition with native species. While exotic species, such as the Namib Desert Horse, are generally unwanted in the Namib-Naukluft Park, the horses are a special case, given their close ties with Namibian history, their popularity with visitors, and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands.Greyling, p. 113 Studies during 2003 and 2004, however, found that while an area of approximately around the watering area at Garub has been affected by the horses, there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius. The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses, probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing. Due to the lack of effect on vegetation by horses, it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations. The horses also appear to have no measurable effect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species, which in several cases are more threatened by human influence. As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not, the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species.Greyling, pp. 149–152 The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as \\"ghost horses\\", as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen. However, when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve, a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary, bringing the horses into closer contact with humans. This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia, who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds. While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia, there are also concerns about negative horse-human interactions, including vehicle accidents, disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans.Greyling, p. 165 See also *Running Free film NotesReferences * Further reading * Horse breeds Feral horses Horse breeds originating in Namibia ","title":"Namib Desert Horse"},{"id":"23805211","text":"Mark Philp is a British political philosopher and historian of political thought who specialises in British political thought in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Member of the American Federation of Art. Joint author with Anna Hotchkis, also a painter, of two books of their travels in China, illustrated by themselves, entitled Buddhist Sculptures of the Yun Kang Caves (Librairie française, Peiping, 1935) and The Nine Sacred Mountains of China (Vetch and Lee, Hong Kong, 1973). She also contributed to the National Geographic Magazine a number of articles accompanied by her drawings, including \\"China's Great Wall of Sculpture\\" in the March 1938 National Geographic (pp 313–348) on the earliest Buddhist sculptures in what were known as the Yun Kang caves, and \\"Tài Shan, Sacred Mountain of the East\\" in June 1945. Her paintings and drawings were also featured in exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C. and at the Philadelphia Academy, as well as in the Brook Street Galleries in LondonNotice in The Times, 15 April 1933 and numerous exhibitions in China.  Early life  Mary Mullikin's formal art training was at the Cincinnati Art Academy, followed by studies in Paris under James Whistler at the Académie Carmen, and in London under Walter Crane. From 1901-1921, she was an Art Professor at Lasell Seminary for Young Women (now Lasell College) in Newton, MA. In 1920 she left Boston for a six month visit with her elder sister Katherine and Katherine's husband, Edward Kingston Lowry, an export-import merchant and property manager affiliated with the Methodist Mission, in the Lowries' home in Tianjin, China. Mullikin's six month stay in Tianjin eventually extended to 26 years.  Travels in China  Mullikin travelled widely in China and to Korea and Japan during the 1930s. She published a book via the Librairie française, a Peking publishing firm, on early Buddhist sculptures. She then set to writing a book about the sacred Daoist and Buddhist mountains and travelled an estimated 10,000 kilometres through China.The basic source of Mary's time in China 1932-1941 are letters to her friend Leila Mechlen in the Archives of American Art, held by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Due to health problems Mullikin did not travel again in China. She devoted herself to the care of her sister Katherine. In July 1937 the Japanese occupation began, and Mullikin and the Lowries were trapped in Tianjin until the end of World War II. Turned out of her home, Mullikin survived by staying with Swiss friends, and by painting pictures of Chinese ancestors from old photographs, and by selling property. She was finally repatriated in 1946. She sold a number of her paintings to members of the International community located in Tianjin, between 1920 and the start of World War II.  Later life  Mullikin safely made her way to her niece and nephew at the United States Embassy in Paris, after she arrived in England. From there, she returned with them to the United States. And in 1947 they set off for Africa, where Mr. Taylor served as consul general in Nairobi, Kenya Colony, East Africa. After two years he transferred back to Washington, so Mullikin, now 75, accompanied her niece and nephew-in-law to make her home in America. Her arrival was chronicled by an article in the Christian Science Monitor of August 29, 1949, together with a staff photo which made the mistake of spelling her last name “Millikin”. She did considerable landscape painting in the Nairobi area and despite difficulty getting indigenous people to pose, she also did some figures. These paintings have seemed to vanish, although we know she received them in the US. However, as far as we can determine, they have never appeared on the market.(Her family still holds most of those paintings) She had a policy of firmly noting her complete name on most canvases. Some were signed MM with a date, mostly in the interim between the end of the war and her departure for England, so it is unlikely that they would not be identifiable.Arndt, Jesse Ash (August 29, 1949) “American Artist ’Painted’ Way in China”, Christian Science Monitor - Women Today.

For this purpose, a winged reusable launch vehicle technology demonstrator (RLV-TD) has been configured. The RLV- TD will act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies like powered cruise flight, hypersonic flight, and autonomous landing using air-breathing propulsion. Application of these technologies would bring down the launch cost by a factor of 10. This project has no connection with the Avatar spaceplane concept by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation. Development In 2006 the Indian Space Research Organisation performed a series of ground tests to demonstrate stable supersonic combustion for nearly 7 seconds with an inlet Mach number of 6. In March 2010, ISRO conducted the flight testing of its new sounding rocket: Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV-D01), weighing 3 tonnes at lift-off, a diameter of , and a length of ~. It carried a passive scramjet engine combustor module as a test-bed for demonstration of air-breathing propulsion technology. In January 2012, ISRO announced that a scaled prototype, called Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD), was approved to be built and tested. The aerodynamics characterization on the RLV-TD prototype was done by National Aerospace Laboratories in India. The RLV-TD is in the last stages of construction by a Hyderabad-based private company called CIM Technologies. By May 2015, engineers at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station were installing thermal tiles on the outer surface of the RLV-TD to protect it against the intense heat during atmospheric reentry.

It was launched from the first launchpad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 23 May 2016 at 7:00 AM local time on board a HS9 solid rocket booster. After a successful launch, booster burn- out occurred 91.1 seconds into flight at a height of about 56 km, the RLV-TD separated from the HS9 booster and further ascended to a height of about 65 km. The RLV-TD then began its descent at about Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound). The vehicle's navigation, guidance and control systems accurately steered the vehicle during this phase for a controlled descent down to the defined landing spot over the Bay of Bengal, at a distance of about from Sriharikota, thereby fulfilling its mission objectives. The vehicle was tracked during its flight from ground stations at Sriharikota and a shipborne terminal. The total flight duration from launch to splashdown lasted about 770 seconds.

This edition of the Bible is also noteworthy for the way it recombines books that have traditionally been divided, and for the way it puts the biblical books in a different order. The edition was first published by the International Bible Society (now Biblica) in 2007 in Today's New International Version (TNIV). It was re-released in September 2012 in the latest update to the New International Version (NIV). Features=Natural literary structure in place of chapters and verses= The traditional chapter divisions in the Bible were introduced around the year 1200 by Stephen Langton, later Archbishop of Canterbury, when he was at the University of Paris. The verse divisions were added by Robert Estienne, a French printer and scholar, in the mid-16th century. Biblical and literary scholars have noted that chapter and verse numbering disguises the actual form of the biblical writings and interferes with the act of reading. Ernest Sutherland Bates wrote, \\"Certainly, no literary format was ever less conducive to pleasure or understanding than is the curious and complicated panoply in which the Scriptures have come down to us. None but a work of transcendent literary genius could have survived such a handicap at all.\\" Richard Moulton noted, \\"We are all agreed to speak of the Bible as a supremely great literature. Yet, when we open our ordinary editions, we look in vain for the lyrics, epics, dramas, essays, sonnets, treatises, which make the other great literatures of the world; instead of these the eye catches nothing but a monotonous uniformity of numbered sentences.\\" New Testament scholar Hermann von Soden urged publishers, \\"It is high time, in any editions that wish to facilitate rather than impede readers' understanding of the New Testament writings, for not only the verse divisions… but also the conventional chapter divisions to disappear completely from the text. Without giving any consideration to these divisions, the text must be printed in a way that will illustrate visually what units the authors themselves created within their works.\\" In response to these concerns, in several 20th-century versions of the Bible, including two major committee translations, the chapter and verse numbers were moved to the margins, but they remained the organizing feature of the text. In one individual translation and one abridgment the numbers were eliminated entirely, but in the former case the text was still divided into the traditional chapters and in the latter topical divisions were introduced. The Books of the Bible, according to its Preface, uses characteristics such as \\"changes in topic, movement in place or time, or shifts from one kind of writing to another\\" to identify the natural literary divisions within biblical books. It also relies on the tendency of authors to repeat \\"particular phrases… each time they [make] the transition from one section to another.\\" The placement of these phrases \\"reinforces a structure that can already be recognized implicitly from other characteristics.\\" The Books of the Bible uses line spacing of different widths to mark off natural literary sections on various levels. It still provides a chapter and verse range, in faded type, at the bottom of each page. =Divided books recombined= The biblical book of Samuel-Kings was divided into two parts in the original Hebrew so it would fit conveniently onto ancient scrolls. When it was translated into Greek it expanded by a third (because Greek writing uses more letters per word in average than Hebrew writing), and so each part was divided in half, producing the books known today as 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel and 1 Kings and 2 Kings. (In the Septuagint the entire work, even though divided into four parts, is considered the \\"Book of Reigns.\\") In The Books of the Bible the work is treated as \\"one long book\\" that \\"tells the story of the Israelite monarchy from beginning to end.\\" It is organized by \\"a consistent structuring pattern,\\" a series of notices about kings' reigns, that \\"runs through the whole book\\". Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah is another long biblical work that was divided into four parts in antiquity because of limitations on scroll length. The first two parts, 1 and 2 Chronicles, still make up a single book in the Hebrew Bible, as do the other two parts, Ezra and Nehemiah. G.F. Hasel writes, \\"It is rather widely accepted in current scholarship that Ezra-Nehemiah forms a continuation of Chronicles.\\" The four books were presented together as \\"The Chronicles\\" in . The Books of the Bible presents this work as \\"one long book, telling one continuous story.\\" Luke–Acts was also originally a single book. In The New Testament in Its Literary Environment, David Aune describes it as an example of the \\"general history\\" genre that \\"focused on the history of a particular people… from mythical beginnings to a point in the recent past.\\" The book was divided into two parts not because of its length, but so that its first half, Luke, could be grouped with the other stories of Jesus' life (the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John). The second half, Acts, is traditionally placed after the gospels, so that the book of John creates a barrier between the halves. The Books of the Bible reunites Luke and Acts and treats them as \\"two volumes of a single work.\\" Luke-Acts was also presented as a single book in The Original New Testament (1985).Hugh J. Schonfield, ed., The Original New Testament (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1985).) In 2006 the International Bible Society published Luke-Acts as a separate volume in the format of The Books of the Bible under the title Kingdom Come, Kingdom Go.Colorado Springs: International Bible Society, 2007 =A new book order= The accustomed order of the books of the Bible only became fixed in the mid–15th century with the advent of printing. Before that, the books were presented or listed in a variety of orders. In the case of the First Testament or Old Testament, Roger Beckwith explains that \\"this stability of order is a relatively modern phenomenon, and owes a good deal to the invention of printing. It was preceded by an era of fluidity, both among the Jews (the chief guardians of the Hebrew Bible) and among Christians (the chief guardians of the Greek [Bible]).\\" In the case of the New Testament, Bruce M. Metzger notes similarly that beyond today's familiar order, \\"Prior to the invention of printing… there were many other sequences, not only of the five main groups of books [gospels, Acts, Pauline epistles, general epistles, Revelation], but also of the several books within each group. …Such matters were of no great significance for the ancient and medieval Church; they became an issue only with later editors and publishers.\\" The order of the biblical books still differs between some ecclesiastical traditions today. Some earlier editions of the Bible also presented the books in non-traditional orders: The Modern Readers' Bible; The Bible Designed to Be Read as Living Literature; The Twentieth Century New Testament; and The Original New Testament. The Books of the Bible, again according to its Preface, seeks to \\"order the books in such a way that their literary types, the historical circumstances in which they were composed and the theological traditions out of which they speak will be evident.\\" This new order is introduced because \\"the order in which today's readers are used to encountering the books of the Bible is yet another factor that hinders their understanding.\\" The book order in The Books of the Bible, and the rationale for it, is as follows: First Testament The Covenant History \\"The first quarter of the Bible unfolds as one continuous narrative.\\" Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth Samuel–Kings The Prophets The prophets are presented in \\"what… is plausibly their historical order.\\" Jonah Amos Hosea Micah Isaiah Zephaniah Nahum Habakkuk Jeremiah Obadiah Ezekiel Haggai Zechariah Joel Malachi The Writings \\"The Writings… represent a much looser grouping… They have been drawn together from a wider range of traditions, genres… and time periods.\\" They are \\"grouped by genre, so that each can be read meaningfully alongside other examples of the same kind of literature.\\" Psalms Lamentations Song of Songs Proverbs Ecclesiastes Job Chronicles–Ezra–Nehemiah Esther Daniel New Testament \\"The order of the New Testament books in this edition seeks to express the ancient concept of the fourfold gospel in a fresh way. The traditional priority of the stories of Jesus is retained, but now each gospel is placed at the beginning of a group of related books.\\" Luke- Acts and the Pauline epistles Luke-Acts 1 Thessalonians 2 Thessalonians 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians Galatians Romans Colossians Ephesians Philemon Philippians 1 Timothy Titus 2 Timothy Matthew and works addressed to Jewish believers in Jesus Matthew Hebrews James Mark and works addressed to a Roman audience Mark 1 Peter 2 Peter Jude John and the letters of John John 1 John 2 John 3 John Revelation (Revelation stands somewhat by itself because of its unique perspective and literary form, but its placement here also acknowledges its customary association with Johannine literature.) =Other features= The Books of the Bible also removes the NIV section headings and places the translators' notes at the end of each book. It presents the text in a single column. These changes, along with the removal of chapter and verse numbers and the recombination of divided works, are designed to \\"encourage meaningful units to be read in their entirety and so with greater appreciation and understanding.\\"The Books of the Bible, p. v. Development of The Books of the Bible The format for The Books of the Bible was developed from 2003–2007 under the direction of Glenn Paauw, Director of Product Development at the International Bible Society (now Biblica). Editors who worked on the volume included Lisa Anderson, Paul Berry, John Dunham, Jim Rottenborn and Micah Wieringa. The graphic designer was Kate Hoyman. Consultants to the project included John R. Kohlenberger III, a master Bible typesetter and author and editor of Bible reference works; Dr. Eugene Rubingh, retired vice president for translation at the International Bible Society; and the Rev. Dr. Christopher R. Smith, a pastor, author, and scholar of biblical literature. Bibles and Scripture portions published by the International Bible Society and Biblica in this format include: Today's New International Version The Search (Ecclesiastes) 2005 The Journey (Gospel of John) 2005 The Book of Psalms 2006 Kingdom Come, Kingdom Go (Luke-Acts) 2006 Amos: Hear This Word 2007 The Books of The Bible 2007 The Books of The Bible New Testament 2009, 2010 New International Version The Books of the Bible New Testament 2011 The Books of the Bible Covenant History (Genesis-Kings) 2012 The Books of the Bible 2012 The Books of the Bible has become the centerpiece of Biblica's program of Community Bible Experiences, in which churches or similar groups read through a quarter of the Bible together in six to eight weeks. InterVarsity Press is developing a series of study guides, entitled Understanding the Books of the Bible, that do not use chapters and verses and are instead keyed to the natural literary format of The Books of the Bible. Biblica is developing a Spanish-language version of The Books of the Bible using the Nueva Versión Internacional entitled Los Libros de la Biblia. Zondervan is planning to release a trade edition of The Books of the Bible in the fall of 2012. Responses to the edition In its 2007 \\"Bible and Bible Reference Survey,\\" Preaching.com called The Books of The Bible \\"one of the most interesting [Bibles published] this year,\\" and predicted that the format changes would \\"aid reading and seeing the more natural divisions in the text which are often obscured by the chapter and verse divisions.\\" A review in the journal Themelios stated, \\"The way [this edition] presents the Bible as a library of literature is unique, simple, and elegant\\"; the reviewer anticipated that \\"some other translations\\" might \\"follow suit.\\" Bible Design and Binding described the edition as \\"a new approach both to the design and organization of the biblical text\\" that would \\"serve as an example to others.\\" One of the contributors to the Better Bibles Blog expected that \\"the new format will bring increased understanding\\" and noted that \\"the format can be used with any version of the Bible.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * \\"Why We De-versified the Bible\\" by Glenn Paauw (Beliefnet, November 2008) * \\"Chapters and Verses?

He represents Jhanjharpur assembly constituency in Madhubani district in 13th, 14th and 15th Bihar Legislative Assembly. He is presently Vice President, BJP - Bihar. https://www.business- standard.com/article/pti-stories/bjp-s-bihar-unit-expands- team-118073001361_1.html https://www.livehindustan.com/bihar/madhubani/story- nitish-mishra-becomes-bjp-vice-president-2099070.html He is contesting as BJP candidate from Jhanjharpur assembly constituency. Mishra had been at the helm of various ministries in Bihar government between 2005 and 2015. These included ministry of Rural Development, Department of Social Welfare, Department of Disaster Management(Minister of State, Independent Charge) and Department of Sugarcane Development (Minister of State, Independent Charge). Early life and education Nitish Mishra was born in a prominent political family of Bihar. His father Jagannath Mishra served thrice as the Chief Minister of Bihar. Mishra's uncle, the late Lalit Narayan Mishra was also a well-known politician who held many cabinet berths during his career. Lalit Narayan Mishra was assassinated in a sensational bomb blast at a function in Samastipur, Bihar in 1975. =School Days= Mishra did his schooling at St. Michael's High School, Patna and was also the school captain in 1990-91. =College Years= Mishra earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Delhi in 1994. He won College Crest Award for Co-curricular and Academic Excellence in the same year. In 1995, he graduated from the Fore School of Management, New Delhi and Maastricht School of Management, Netherlands with a Masters in Business Administration) In 1998, he went on to earn a post graduate diploma in Global Political Economy from the University of Hull, United Kingdom. He has also been awarded a Certificate of Completion for the Emerging Leader's Programme from Kennedy School at Harvard University, Executive Education. =Pre political career= Before joining politics, Mishra was an educationist and also dabbled in social work. From April 1999 to March 2002 he worked as Assistant Director for Bihar Institute of Economic Studies, a non-profit economic and social research organization. From April 2002 to February 2005 Mishra was Additional Director (Administration) of the LN Mishra College of Business Management, Muzaffarpur an autonomous institution under Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University. Political career=Performance in Assembly elections= Mishra has been consecutively elected to the 13th, 14th and 15th Bihar Legislative Assembly from Mishra family stronghold of Jhanjharpur Assembly Constituency in Madhubani. His father Jagannath Mishra also won the same seat five times(1972 to 1990). =Ministerial Berths in Bihar Government= Between 2005 and 2015, Mishra held charge of three different ministries in the Bihar Government. He served as Minister, Department of Rural Development,(November 2010 to February 2015), State Minister(Independent Charge), Department of Disaster Management(April 2008 to March 2009), and State Minister(Independent Charge, Department of Sugarcane Development(November 2005 to April 2008). =Performance as Minister, Department of Rural Development= Mishra is credited with revamping Department of Rural Development during his stint as minister. The department won three national prizes/recognition during his tenure. Two of these prizes were for effective and transparent implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, The department won the first prize in ‘Transparency and Accountability in Implementation in MGNREGA’ and the second prize in ‘Convergence in MGNREGA’. To ensure transparency and accountability in Department of Rural Development, all panchayat bank accounts were mapped on the Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System to streamline release of funds from district to panchayats. E-muster rolls were made mandatory to put an end to fake muster rolls and to make the process transparent and fool proof and regular social audits were conducted by gram sabhas. Weekly MGNREGA Diwas was also observed every Wednesday to monitor the quality of work and processes in MGNREGA. Information related to MGNREGA was put in public domain through a management information system. Mishra also made it mandatory for the schemes to be wall painted, photographed and uploaded on a management information system. For effective convergence with state rural development mission (Jeevika), self-employment and small entrepreneurship scheme as poultry farming, pond management, goat Rearing etc. were allowed to be taken up under MGNREGA. Young professionals with degrees from prestigious institutes like LSE and IRMA were hired to implement state projects under National Rural Livelihood Mission. Department of Rural Development, under the stewardship of Mishra inked memoranda of understanding with companies to provide training to the youth in state through skill development centres. To bring about transparency and integrity in implementation of Indira Awas Yojna he came up with the innovative idea of holding block level disbursement camps for beneficiaries of the scheme. These camps were held in front of Ministers and Secretaries in charge of various districts, Divisional Commissioner, District Magistrate and panchayat level public representatives. In an unprecedented move, Mishra adopted a policy of strict action to ensure people completed construction of their houses within a stipulated time period . Block administration was directed to issue white notices to those failed to complete their houses after two years of getting the first instalment. If the beneficiaries did not take action even after three months of issuance of the white notices, they are again issued red notices. If he took action against defaulters, Mishra also made sure that he encouraged those who adhered to deadlines. An incentive of Rs. 2000 was announced for Mahadalit beneficiaries who completed their houses within two month of getting their second installment. Madalit families were also given incentives to build toilets in their houses. Much before \\"Swach Bharat Abhiyan\\" gained popularity, Mishra took steps to enforce cleanliness by linking payment of final installment to Indira Awas Yojna beneficiaries with construction of toilets. Mishra also introduced monitoring of Indira Awas Yojna completions through satellite based geotagged and time-stamped photography. This was an unheard of practice in Bihar and unparalleled in Indira Awas Yojna monitoring in the nation. Mishra facilitated the setting up of online recruitment portal \\"Samvida\\" to recruit over 10,000 block and panchayat level staff for looking after Indira Awas Yojna. These recruitments were made in a short period of four months. Project Samvida got national recognition when it won the National Award for e-Governance (gold medal ) in the specific sector award category. Department of Rural Development under Mishra’s leadership played an active role in setting up Development Management Institute, a state of art management institute in Bihar. This institute has been oriented to create a cadre of development management professionals and enhance competence of existing practitioners. During Mishra’s tenure as the Minister for Department of Rural Development, Bihar became the first State to publish the draft list of Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) and distribute it to the actually surveyed people for putting forth their claims and objection against the draft publication. This was a mammoth task considering the size of population and limitations like delay in release of funds from the GoI(Government of India). Fifty lakh application were received from across the state for redressal of claims and objections in the draft publication which were disposed of in a record time. This SECC data was made available to the Food and Consumer Protection Department, Bihar and thus became the basis of rollout of the Food Security Act in Bihar. As the Rural Development Minister, Mishra paved the way for creation of a separate cadre of Rural Development Officers and young officers were appointed for all 534 Blocks of Bihar through Bihar Public Service Commission. These officers were provided quality training of governmental rules and regulations, best practices in management and leadership, need for re-engineering governmental process, official etiquette and sensitivity to the needy at Bihar Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development. He also designed a performance appraisal mechanism for the regular and transparent evaluation of these BDO’s across state with the help of Harvard Kennedy School. =Performance as Minister, Department of Social Welfare= While at the helm of affairs at the Department of Social Welfare, Mishra initiated development of MIS wherein all information related to any Anganwadi Centre and the tagged/covered families was to be put online. An iris based bio-metric identification system for all the beneficiaries of any AWC was also created along with transferring funds directly to them. This process expedited the fund delivery system and reduced scope of any leakage in the process =Performance as Minister of State, Department of Disaster Management= As MoS, Department of Disaster Management, Mishra supervised one of nation's biggest rescue and relief operations for over three million people affected by flooding of river Kosi in August 2008. The floods were declared as a national calamity by the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. Supaul, Madhepura, Araria and Saharsa were the four worst affected districts. Stationing himself at Araria, Mishra personally monitored relief and rescue operations. He used his personal rapport to reach out to NGOs and corporate groups to lend a helping hand to flood affected families. 300 relief camps and mega camps were established where 2155 hand pumps and 3750 temporary toilets were built. 200 health centers and 150 veterinary centers were put in motion. =Performance as Minister of State , Department of Sugarcane Development= In his debut ministerial role, Mishra displayed business-like acumen in reviving the sick sugarcane sector in Bihar. He conceptualised state’s Sugar Industry Incentive Policy. Within two years of its launch, sugar industry in Bihar staged a turnaround. A privatisation policy was also initiated for 15 sick and closed sugar units in Bihar three of which were successfully privatised during his tenure. Signs of revival of sugar industry became evident as Bihar received proposal worth rupees 20 thousands cores for setting of new sugar complexes. Existing sugar mills witnessed over 40% expansion in production capacity. Mishra ensured that payments worth Rs. 8.84 crores pending in the Bihar State Sugar Corporation since 1997 were also cleared.

He was also a member of the Nesser Brothers, a group consisting of seven brothers who made-up the most famous football family in the United States from 1907 until the mid-1920s. Ted was the first Nesser to make money at football, playing for Massillon's state championship teams in 1904, 1905 and 1906. Ted was considered the toughest of the Nesser brothers. In 1906, he reputedly ended the career of Willie Heston, a former Michigan All-American, with a hard tackle in a Massillon Tigers-Canton Bulldogs game. In 1908, Ted reputedly stayed for a game with two broken bones protruding from an arm, just because he thought that his brothers needed him. Nesser was also reported to have had broken his nose at least eight times. He was also considered a football genius and is credited with originating several plays including the triple pass, the criss-cross and the short kickoff.

The main ingredients of the drink include peanuts/peanut butter, milk and sugar. However, variations occur whereby regular milk is often replaced or added to a mixture including condensed milk, spices (dominantly nutmeg and cinnamon), corn flakes, Angostura bitters, glucose powder and quite often granola mix. The drink is often regarded by some to be an aphrodisiac due to its high fat, protein and overall energy content. In Trinidad, it is made with peanut butter, milk, sugar and sometimes spices. Rum is sometimes used as an ingredient. It is also available commercially in supermarkets and grocery stores as well to cater those markets. In Trinidad and Tobago, peanut punch is a popular drink that is often sold on sidewalks or in established food stores. The drink is traditionally marketed as an energy drink and made with a variety of ingredients according to the vendor. In Jamaica, peanut punch is made with roasted peanuts, peanut butter, or commercial peanut powder mixes. White rum or stout beer is often added, as well as condensed milk or another sweetener with milk, water, and spices.https://originalflava.com/drinks/peanut-punch/ Retrieved 2020-04-24https://gracefoods.com/recipe-a-z/recipe/4795-peanut-punch Retrieved 2020-04-24 Peanut Punch Drank is a variation of the official drink inspired by former Chicago Bears and Carolina Panthers CB Charles Tillman, whose nickname is \\"Peanut\\", and his penchant for punching the ball loose and forcing fumbles.

The screenplay was written by Herz and Fuks. The film was selected as the Czechoslovakian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 42nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences In 1972, it won the Festival de Cine de Sitges Best Film award, where it also received awards for its star Rudolf Hrušínský and cinematographer Stanislav Milota. The story is set in 1930s Prague, where the cremator Karel Kopfrkingl lives and works. Kopfrkingl slowly devolves from an odd but relatively well- meaning cremator of the dead into a murderer of his family and mass murderer who runs the ovens at the extermination camps due to the influence of the Nazi party and Tibetan Buddhism, under which he believes his murders are \\"liberating\\" the souls of the diseased into a better life. The film is made up of mostly monologues from Karel Kopfrkingl that follow his descent into madness and all the scenes center on this character, often with frequent closeups of his face. It is often recognized as a follower of German Expressionist film and also as an example of the Czechoslovak New Wave. The film was banned after its premiere in 1969, and remained \\"in the vault\\" until the collapse of the communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989 . With a 90.2% score on the Czech and Slovak Movie Database as well as praise from movie critics, The Cremator is often considered to be one of the best movies ever made in Czechoslovakia. It has also gathered a prominent cult following. Plot The movie takes place against the backdrop of the political radicalization of Europe during the 1930s, more specifically the demise of the golden era of the First Czechoslovak Republic and the installation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia under Nazi Germany in 1939. Spiritually, the movie takes place in the aftermath of the death of Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, in 1933. Karel Kopfrkingl works at a crematorium (his beloved \\"Temple of Death\\") in Prague. While taking his wife and children to visit the zoo to visit the leopard's cage where he first met his wife 17 years previously, he mentions that he wishes to invite his new assistant Mr. Strauss to a gathering. The gathering has many elderly people and people interested in funeral preparations. An \\"abstinent\\", Kopfrkingl wants no alcohol on the premises, only tea and \\"weak coffee\\" are to be served. He also puts out the cigar of a smoker. He meets Strauss and discusses his work with the confectionery business. He tells him he wants to take him on as an agent. Karel's wife Lakme compliments Strauss as being a good businessman and a Jew. Karel retorts that Strauss is a German surname but Lakme says names are not always what they appear. She says that her real name is Maria and that he only calls her Lakmé because of the opera and that his name is Karel but he always prefers Roman. Kopfrkingl just laughs and says that he is a \\"romantic\\". Kopfrkingl delivers a speech to them about the importance of cremation and the reincarnation that awaits them and it is clear that he is obsessed with his duties and believes he is not just cremating the dead, but liberating the souls of the departed. Kopfrkingl gives a speech to the guests and reads excerpts from a book about Tibetan mysticism by David-Neel. This is his prized possession and he will frequently quote from it throughout the film (usually before committing murders). At this gathering, he meets Reinke, a former soldier who fought with him in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI and who now works as a chemical engineer. Reinke is a Hitler supporter who sees the annexation of Austria as liberation from unemployment and misery. He will introduce Kopfrkingl to the Nazi party. While browsing paintings at the store, he notices a portrait of Hitler and is smitten with his \\"noble face\\". He settles on a painting of Emiliano Chamorro Vargas that he brings home to his wife, claiming it is actually of Louis Marin. Reinke comes over to Kopfrkingl's house and describes in greater detail his support of Hitler and the good things the Nazis have done in Austria. He gives Kopfrkingl a flyer about joining the party but he remains uncertain. He tells Reinke that he has been raised Czech, reads Czech and lives as a Czech and only distantly has a \\"drop of German blood\\". Reinke tells him that sensitive people like him can feel even just that one \\"drop\\". Kopfrkingl shows the new assistant Mr. Dvorak the ropes at the crematorium. When discussing the crisis in Sudetenland he says he is not worried because he has \\"a drop of German blood\\". He asks the coworker he is smitten with to go on the tour of the facility with them but she refuses. Kopfrkingl shows Dvorak the catafalque and the coffin room. Dvorak bumps into a metal rod that was standing against the wall and Karel snaps at him not to throw it away because it could be very useful to them later. He also shows Dvorak a room filled with urns, all of which are filled with human ashes. Kopfrkingl is proud that he has \\"liberated\\" these people from the terrible sufferings of their life and sent them on to be reincarnated. Despite claiming to be moral and abstinent, Kopfrkingl sexually harasses a coworker at the morgue, visits a brothel run by \\"Mrs. Iris\\" (comically, the prostitute he chooses named \\"Dagmar\\" is played by Vlasta Chramostová, the same actress as his wife) and drinks (though he assures his compatriots that it is only a \\"ceremonial glass\\"). He also has some qualms with his assistant Mr. Dvorak's frequent smoking. Kopfrkingl now takes his wife and children on visits to the carnival (in particular a wax museum displaying gruesome murders and severed heads and body parts) and to a boxing match but it remains clear that he is aloof and cut off from them. At Christmas Eve dinner, Karel openly mentions his new-found respect for the Nazi party and the Third Reich which begins to worry his wife. On Reinke's orders, Kopfrkingl spies on a Jewish ceremony and reports at the Nazi owned casino. Reinke thanks him for his work but warns him that his wife is possibly Jewish due to her having prepared a Jewish style carp dinner for them both earlier on Christmas Eve and having hid an invitation from Reinke. He tells Karel that it will be impossible for him to get better positions within the party if he remains married to her. Kopfrkingl now under the sway of Reinke and his disturbed Buddhist beliefs hangs his wife from a noose. He sees visions of himself as an asian monk assuring himself that he is doing the right thing by \\"liberating\\" them and that he will be rewarded by becoming the next Dalai Lama. The vision says he must prepare to journey to the eternal Fatherland in the Himalayas. Kopfrkingl next delivers an eulogy for his wife but it quickly descends into a Hitler-influenced mania about the importance of death in the new world order the Fuhrer is creating. Most of his former friends leave but Reinke and his Nazi comrades are overjoyed and give him the Sieg Heil salute. Karel visits a brothel with his friend Reinke and they talk through the doors to each other about Karel's son Mili. Karel says he is worried by how effeminate and weak he has become and that his mother's coddling has done this. Reinke tells Karel that quarter Jews will not be allowed to go to school or pursue careers in the Third Reich so it is best to be rid of him. Karel then takes Mili on a trip to see his father's crematorium business, cutting through a \\"scenic\\" shortcut through the graveyard. Kopfrkingl takes his son to the crematorium's basement and kills him with a metal rod, under the belief that he is \\"liberating his soul\\". He puts his son in a coffin with a dead German soldier that won't be open for viewing to the public and goes straight into the oven on the next Monday. The vision reappears and tells him that he is the reincarnated Buddha. He tells the vision that he will ascend the Tibetan throne in Lhasa but only after he first liberates his Jewish daughter. Afterwards, a Nazi leader discloses to him about the idea of gas chambers, which he very much approves of. He sees it as a faster way to liberate more people than his crematorium that only burns one coffin at a time. Overjoyed, he enters a mania but the Nazi minister tells him to calm down and remember to keep it secret. He takes his daughter to the basement of his crematorium and attempts to murder her with an iron rod, but while in the process she gets away due to him having another schizo-like vision of himself as a Buddhist monk. The monk tells him the time has come for him to rule the throne as the next Dalai Lama and that the people of the world beckon for his wise guidance. The crematorium briefly appears as a Tibetan monastery and the monk throws open the gates to reveal the Nazi commanders parked outside. He tells them that his quarter Jewish daughter was about to be liberated but unfortunately she got away and they state that they will eliminate his daughter for him and he mustn't worry. The last scene is him driving away in a Nazi vehicle they put him in on his way to run the death camps with the female personification of death chasing after the car in the rain. He states \\"I shall save them all. The whole world\\" and the closing shot is of the Potala Palace in Tibet.

The film is based on a novel by Ladislav Fuks Spalovač mrtvol (). The main character is played by Rudolf Hrušínský, an actor previously known for his comedic main role as the soldier Josef Švejk in Dobrý voják Švejk and Poslušně hlásím. The director Juraj Herz wrote the script first and then shot the film exactly by the script. He was very pleased with the original script and mentioned that he had left extra space for empty pages in the back of the book for anything else that might come to mind but those pages were never used.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/this-way-to-the- cooling-chambers There were multiple shooting locations for this film. Kopfrkingl's \\"Temple of Death\\" was shot at three different crematoriums.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/this-way-to-the-cooling- chambers The first one was a crematorium in Prague in which Mr. Dvorak's suicide, the murder of Mili and the attempted murder of Zina were shot. The actors were well-prepared for these scenes and always ended on time at 3 PM because they did not want to be around the coffins with dead bodies inside. Filming took place during July and August in the middle of the summer heat and the bodies were starting to smell. The second shooting location was an urn grave in Plzeň. The third shooting location was a crematorium in Pardubice that was chosen by the film's set designer. This building was built in a Cubist style and makes up all of the exterior shots of the crematorium. The eulogy for Lakme and the subsequent Hitler-style rant delivered by Kopfrkingl on the importance of death were also filmed here. The tour Kopfrkingl gives to Mr. Dvorak (Jiri Menzel) of the ovens was shot near the ovens in the back of this crematorium. The director Juraj Herz set up two torches outside the main entrance that were used in the film (referred to as \\"Spartan torches\\" in the film by Kopfrkingl). The building retains these torches to this day even though they were set up for the film. The crematorium in Pardubice was declared a National Cultural Monument by the Czech government due to its appearance in this film and impact on Czech culture. These shooting locations and description of the actor's feelings while behind the scenes can be heard described by Juraj Herz himself in the documentary This Way to the Cooling Chambers which he made for the German release of The Cremator. None of the actors had much trouble shooting in the crematoriums besides Jiri Menzel.DVD Spalovač mrtvol (edice Zlatá kolekce českých filmů), kapitola Bonusy - Rozhovory: Stanislav Milota Vlasta Chramostová would rehearse each scene to herself to prepare while Hrušínský just wanted the first shot. Hrušínský did not like to prepare at all for his roles, he preferred to do all the acting on the stage and screen.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/rudolf-hrusinsky This acting method probably originated from his stage origins. Olga Dimitrovová was responsible for the costume design while Frantisek Straka designed the sets and chose the crematoriums to use.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/this-way-to-the-cooling-chambers Herz and the story's author Ladislav Fuks shared a love of the macabre and gallows humor but Herz did not like how dialogue heavy The Cremator was an initially thought it was uncinematic.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre Herz thought the title alone was interesting enough for its own movie but didn't like the long monologues, and believed it was too dialogue- heavy.https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6916-the-cremator-no-one-will- suffer Music composer Zdenek Liska bet a box of champagne to the cameraman Stanislav Milota that the film would not be successful or stick to the script. Liska was forced to buy Milota the wine after it was completed.https://web.archive.org/web/20070511040150/http://www.kinema.sk/clanok.asp?id=25400 This is the only film on which actress Vlasta Chramostová collaborated with her husband Stanislav Milota. She recalls that when the film began to be shot in the relaxed pre-August atmosphere of 1968, no one would have guessed that it would become an award-winning cult film. After the shoot and the premiere, the film was banned by the Socialist government. She recalled a humorous story where her husband Stanislav Milota (film cinematographer) prophetically answered her question about how they want to shoot the scene with Kopfrkingl hanging her from the noose in the bathroom. Stanislav Milota replied with sarcasm worthy of Kopfrkingl: \\"Like it's your last shot.\\" He had no idea what truth he had just prophesized as Vlasta Chramostová was not allowed to act after August 1968 and Stanislav Milota also ended his career in Czech film. DVD Spalovač mrtvol (edice Zlatá kolekce českých filmů), kapitola Bonusy - Rozhovory: Vlasta Chramostova Influences The director Juraj Herz was allowed to see many western films before making this one, especially those by Alfred Hitchcock, Victor Sjostrom, Ingmar Bergman and also Luis Buñuel. It is possible to see the influence of these directors in the film but Herz firmly denied he copied them but only enjoyed watching them.http://www.kinoeye.org/02/01/kosulicova01.php Herz enjoyed watching genre films and horror films himself even though at that time it was looked down upon.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre He liked genre films because he saw them as easier opportunites to include macabre imagery and eroticism which he liked. These would be hard to incorporate into drama films. Jan Švankmajer's influence is also seen in the first scene at the zoo. Some of the shots are also influenced by Sartre.https://web.archive.org/web/20070511040150/http://www.kinema.sk/clanok.asp?id=25400 Herz shared many similarities with Švankmajer including the use of a serialist style. They both influenced each other.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre The film makes good use of serialist techniques and acting methods. Herz cast actors in different, contradictory roles within the film in order to confuse. For example, the actress who plays Kopfrkingl's pure wife Maria/ Lakme also plays the prostitute Dagmar in the scene in Mrs. Iris's brothel. The intention of this device was to confuse and make the film off-putting. Juraj Herz uses it in other films too.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the- macabre Lost ending The original ending of this film was deleted in post- production and is assumed lost. In the scene, two of the former crematorium employees are chatting at a coffee shop while Soviet tanks roll by. Two female employees are discussing Mr. Kopfrkingl and how he was a nice man and always practiced abstinence. They wonder what happened to him. The next shot is then of a building blowing up and depressed faces reflected in the shards of glass among the rubble. Then Kopfrkingl's face is seen again in the middle of a crowd, gleefully smiling. This scene was removed by the studio director possibly due to being too critical of the post-68 Soviet backed government. The director Juraj Herz believes the negatives of this scene were burned and are now lost forever.http://www.kinoeye.org/02/01/kosulicova01.php The intention of this scene was to show that conformists exist all the time, no matter the ideology.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the- macabre Themes The movie and story are about the rise of Nazism and collaboration among Czechs during World War II. The Nazi ideology caused many German descended Czech citizens to side with the Nazis during occupation. Early in the film, while at a store to buy a painting, Kopfrkingl spots one of Adolf Hitler and says he has a \\"noble face\\". Kopfrkingl's hair is also cut and parted in a similar fashion to Hitler's. The Jewish children Mili and Zina are introduced playing around in the animal cages at the zoo. Kopfrkingl responds by telling his children to get out and that \\"cages are for dumb animals\\". At the funeral for his wife, Kopfrkingl delivers a Hitler style oration from a podium that resembles Hitler's in Triumph of the Will. The speech gradually descends into mania with many of his wife's friends and relatives leaving while Kopfrkingl states the importance of death in \\"the Fuhrer's happy new Europe\\". This gets him a Roman salute and \\"Heil\\" from his Nazi compatriots. Even the visions he receives while Buddhist in nature use Nazi style rhetoric. The monk says Kopfrkingl must ascend the throne of \\"the beloved Fatherland Tibet\\" and rule it with his noble guidance and that the world is waiting to be \\"liberated\\". Kopfrkingl kills his own family, the ones who should be dearest to him, in the name of the Nazi ideology and his deluded visions of what constitutes a \\"paradise on Earth\\". Interestingly, though the Nazis and the Third Reich government feature so heavily in this film and are the main focus they are never referred to by their actual name the NSDAP, just as \\"the party\\".http://www.kinoeye.org/02/01/kosulicova01.php The leaflets the Nazis use in this film are also modelled after the ones the Communist party in Czechoslovakia used at the time.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre The film can be read as a commentary on the politics of the Czechoslovakians at the time. Though she never speaks, Death is also a character in this movie portrayed by Helena Anýzová. She appears in the background in scenes that relate to death in some way or where Kopfrkingl is grappling with his conscience. His reactions to her are always negative. She is a spectator at Kopfrkingl's speech about the importance of cremation, in the background in the painting store, a figure in the wax museum, a prostitute at Mrs. Iris's, and in the crowd at the boxing match that turns violent. She is also seen when the Gestapo come to arrest Mr. Strauss, Mr. Fenek and others at the Crematorium, immediately before and after Kopfrkingl murders his family and chasing after his car at the very end of the film while he is on his way to the extermination camps. Whenever Kopfrkingl sees Anýzová's character he gets angry as if he realizes his actions are cruel and will result in pain and torment but he must suppress it.https://web.archive.org/web/20070511040150/http://www.kinema.sk/clanok.asp?id=25400 The propaganda of the Nazis and the reality of their horrors are portrayed by Kopfrkingl's \\"abstinence\\". Throughout the film Kopfrkingl loudly professes his abstinence to alcohol and devotion to his wife when in reality, he visits prostitutes at a brothel, sexually harasses a female coworker at the morgue and drinks quite a bit. He downplays his drinking by stating they are only \\"ceremonial glasses\\". He also gripes constantly about Mr. Dvorak's smoking when this character is only seen smoking briefly a couple times. His opening monologue at the zoo also mentions how much he loves his family and will do anything for them when the entire film is about him murdering them. Kopfrkingl's inner ferocious and bloodthirsty nature is portrayed from this very first scene at the zoo. He discusses how he met his wife at the leopard's cage and closeups of his Hitler style hair are intercut with shots of the leopard moving around in its cage. His wife and children are shown in a more sympathetic manner with the children goofing around with smiles on their face in the cages. The film relies heavily on black comedy revolving around death and cremation. Herz noted that he tried to distill the frightening scenes with humor, because it lightens the horror. Humor was also a way to keep it from being censored by the Czechoslovakian government. The director intentionally combined horror with humor.http://www.kinoeye.org/02/01/kosulicova01.php Míla Myslíková and Vladimír Menšík add a humorous touch to this film through their comedic side characters. Myslikova plays a ditzy, airheaded woman who cluelessly stumbles around into the actions of the main cast while Mensik plays her hair-trigger husband with a ferocious temper who is constantly berating her for being so clueless. These characters serve as a sort of Greek chorus to comment on the main cast's actions. In Mensik's very last appearance he is looking for his wife who was last with him at the cemetery. He off- handedly mentions he saw Kopfrkingl with Mili before Mili disappeared. This makes Zina a bit suspicious but she continues with Karel anyways, while in the next scene Karel attempts to murder her. Cinematography The film was shot in black and white even though the director Juraj Herz wanted it to be in color.DVD Spalovač mrtvol (edice Zlatá kolekce českých filmů), kapitola Bonusy - Rozhovory: Stanislav Milota Herz initially planned the film to be in color but with all the clothing and sets in very dark, macabre colors such as black and grey. The only bright colors would have been the skin tone of the cast and the red of the blood in the murder scenes. This plan fell through though because Stanislav Milota thought it was a bad idea that would not work. He would not work with Herz if the film were in color so Herz chose black and white.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre The film was shot without sound and all the dialogue and music was added with post- synchronization in post-production. Stanislav Milota shot the film with wide lenses so that small rooms filled with coffins would seem much larger.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/this-way-to-the-cooling- chambers Stanislav Milota used unusual camera tricks and lenses that were not common before while making this film. He used the fisheye lens to distort Rudolf Hrušínský and make his appearance seem more grotesque (also funnily enough the credits to this film feature a literal \\"fish eye\\").DVD Spalovač mrtvol (edice Zlatá kolekce českých filmů), kapitola Bonusy - Rozhovory: Stanislav Milota The fisheye lens wasn't widely available in Czechoslovakia so Milota had to go to France to acquire one.https://web.archive.org/web/20070511040150/http://www.kinema.sk/clanok.asp?id=25400 The fisheye lens combined with closeups to Kopfrkingl make his face very elongated and creepy at points like when Kopfrkingl makes sexual advances on a female coworker at the morgue before another employee stops him. Herz thought the fisheye lens was overused in this film though many film critics are pleased with the final product.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre Jaromír Janáček's editing is also fast and erratic paralleling Kopfrkingl's delicate mental state. Grotesque shots of dead bodies with syphilis and paintings of nude women are spliced into the middle of conversations at odd points to disorient the viewer and make them feel uncomfortable. Sartre's novel The Reprieve also served as an inspiration for the editing, particularly the scene where Reinke has Kopfrkingl spy on the Jewish ceremony. In Sartre's book, two characters talk to one another though only later do you find out they are miles apart in different countries. This effect is used in the film where the Jewish singing at the ceremony and Kopfrkingl's expression is halted by Reinke whispering evil things about the Jews in his ear and prodding him to confess that they are agitating against the Germans.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/madness-and-the-macabre This effect is also used when Kopfrkingl gives a present to his favorite prostitute and then stands on a chair which then leads to him hanging a picture on his wife's bedroom wall, when he is looking at pictures of prostitutes and then turns around to serve Christmas Eve dinner and several other times throughout the film. Several times you also are led to believe Kopfrkingl is talking to someone and then the camera pans back to reveal it is actually someone else. This editing style is used to very humorous effect in one morbid scene, in which Kopfrkingl asks Mr. Dvorak his opinion about suicide (the character commits the act later in the film). Mr. Dvorak meekly turns around and responds \\"I want out.\\" The camera then pans to reveal he means he wants to work in the furnace room and \\"out\\" of the job in the coffin room at the other end of the building. Karel Kopfrkingl himself seems to have a bit of an obsession with photography and paintings. He says \\"a photograph eternally preserves the present moment\\" after having a picture taken of his family and his children's friends. In a very early scene, he is at a painting shop looking for a painting for his wife. His home is decorated with dozens of photos and paintings (some of which appear as naked women in his imagination, both in his home and at the painting store). At one point, he is given pictures by Reinke of blonde prostitutes the Nazis hire and he is sure to thoroughly examine each one. Before attempting to kill his daughter Zina he meets her boyfriend Kaja in the street and asks him to take a photo to preserve the present moment as it is though he doesn't have a camera on him and is unable to. The monologue that Kopfrkingl delivers toward the end of the film on the death camps and the process of reincarnation is visually punctuated with frantic closeups of the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. He is standing of the Right panel of Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights. As the speech becomes more frantic, what follows next is a montage of other Bosch paintings including; Christ Carrying the Cross, Ascent of the Blessed and The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things. These paintings depict the grotesque processes of death and ascension into the afterlife. These paintings visually accentuate Kopfrkingl's deteriorating mind and his obsession with death and the afterlife as he descends into madness. Score The score was composed by Zdenek Liska. Before production, Liska asked Herz what type of film it would be, would it be scary or pretty? Juraj Herz replied to him \\"There's already enough in this film that's scary. Go for melodious and lovely.\\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/music-by-zdenek-liska Kopfrkingl is a dilettante that is obsessed with classical composers such as Strauss, Dvorak, Saint-Saens and Mahler. The score reflects this by being a beautiful waltz. Kopfrkingl plays it on the radio several times throughout the film, both at family gatherings but also before committing his murders. His daughter Zina also practices the tune on the piano in an early scene. The score also uses many traditional asian instruments and music such as gongs, bells and chanting whenever the vision of the Tibetan monk appears to Kopfrkingl and also when he is describing in detail the process of reincarnation for the Nazi leader. In the final scene at the coffin room where Kopfrkingl attempts to murder his daughter, the European waltz is playing but asian motifs such as the gongs and bells are added when the vision appears to him. The gongs and bells blend with the waltz. This makes the film truly unique as nothing like it had ever been done before at the time.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/music-by-zdenek-liska Mixing European waltzes with traditional asian motifs was unheard of in film scores. Besides using traditional asian instruments, the film's score is unique in other ways. Everyday tools are part of the music. When Kopfrkingl kills his son and puts him in the coffin the waltz plays. He hammers the nails into the coffin and this hammering rhythmically becomes part of the waltz and leads into the Tibetan bell motif and chanting in the next scene (the hammering and the bells are the exact same rhythm and tempo). Release=Home media= The film was released on DVD by Second Run on April 10, 2006. It was later re- released on DVD by Dark Sky Films on March 31, 2009. A new 4K transfer was released by the Criterion Collection on April 21, 2020. It is spine #1023. Reception Jason Pirodsky of The Prague Reporter praised the film, writing, \\"Spalovač mrtvol is a masterpiece of atmosphere, conveying the horror of the Holocaust through style rather than story; stark black & white cinematography by Stanislav Milota is a real standout, while unusual rapid-fire editing by Jaromír Janáček helps to keeps the viewer off balance.\\" Adam Schofield, writing in A Black Pearl of the Deep: Juraj Herz's The Cremator stated that audiences unfamiliar with Eastern Europe's political past could \\"surely enjoy it as a work of black comedy or psychological horror\\" as it was an \\"ingeniously orchestrated film, full of complexities, and capable of giving the horror genre a better name.\\" Herz commented that the films reaction were different in every country, noting that \\"In Prague, people were depressed; in Slovakia, they laughed; in the Netherlands, it was a comedy from the beginning to the end.\\" TV Guide awarded the film 3/5 stars, stating that \\"Hrusinsky's scary performance highlights this morbid, darkly funny work.\\" The Cremator was screened at the Sorrento Film Festival in 1969 and the Sitges Film Festival in 1972. It continues to be screened at film festivals around the globe even today, most recently at the Zagreb Film Festival in 2015, the Washington Jewish Film Festival in 2016, and the Athens International Film Festival, the Mumbai Film Festival, and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in 2019.

It can be seen as a twofold enol and fourfold ketone of cyclohexene, more precisely 5,6-dihydroxycyclohex-5-ene-1,2,3,4-tetrone. Rhodizonic acid is usually obtained in the form of a dihydrate . The latter is actually 2,3,5,5,6,6-hexahydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1,4-dione, where two of the original ketone groups are replaced by two pairs of geminal diols. The orange to deep- red and highly hygroscopic anhydrous acid can be obtained by low-pressure sublimation of the dihydrate. Like many other enols, rhodizonic acid can lose the hydrogen cations H+ from the hydroxyls (pKa1 = , pKa2 = at 25 °C), yielding the hydrogenrhodizonate anion and the rhodizonate anion . The latter is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond and the negative charges are delocalized and evenly distributed over the six CO units. Rhodizonates tend to have various shades of red, from yellowish to purplish. Rhodizonic acid has been used in chemical assays for barium, lead, and other metals. In particular, the sodium rhodizonate test can be used to detect gunshot residue (which contains lead) in a subject's hands, and to distinguish arrow wounds from gunshot wounds for hunting regulation enforcement. History Rhodizonic acid was discovered by Austrian chemist Johann Heller in 1837, by analyzing the products of heating a mixture of potassium carbonate and charcoal. The name comes from Greek (rhodizō, \\"to tinge red\\"), on account of the color of its salts. Chemistry=Salts= Rhodizonates tend to have various shades of red, from yellowish to purplish, in transmitted light, with a greenish luster in reflected light. Potassium rhodizonate can be prepared with good yield and purity by oxidizing inositol with nitric acid and reacting the result with potassium acetate in the presence of oxygen. The rhodizonate crystallizes out of the solution due to its relative insolubility in water. Sodium rhodizonate is dark brown and stable when dry, but the aqueous solution decomposes in a few days, even in the refrigerator. Lead rhodizonate is dark violet. =Oxidation and decomposition= Rhodizonic acid is a member of a chain of oxidation products: benzenehexol , tetrahydroxybenzoquinone (THBQ) , rhodizonic acid , and cyclohexanehexone . Lithium rhodizonate, together with salts of THBQ and benzenehexol, has been considered for possible use in rechargeable electrical batteries. The monovalent anion has been detected in mass spectrometry experiments. Rhodizonic acid and the rhodizonate anion can lose one of the CO units to yield croconic acid and the croconate anion , respectively, by mechanisms that are still imperfectly known. In basic solutions (pH > 10), rhodizonic acid quickly converts to the THBQ anion in the absence of oxygen, and to croconic acid in its presence. At pH 8.3 and exposure to light, solutions are stable for days in the absence of oxygen, and decompose to croconic acid and other products (possibly including cyclohexanehexone or dodecahydroxycyclohexane) in its presence. Structure=Acid= In solution, the acid and the hydrogenrhodizonate ion are mostly hydrated, with some of the carbonyl groups >C=O replaced by geminal hydroxyls, . =Salts= In anhydrous rubidium rhodizonate , the rhodizonate anions are stacked in parallel columns, as are the rubidium ions. In the plane perpendicular to the columns, these are arranged as two interleaved hexagonal grids. The anions are planar. Anhydrous potassium rhodizonate has a distinct but similar structure. The anions and cations are arranged in alternate planes. Within each plane, the anions are arranged in a hexagonal grid. Each potassium ion is arranged so that it connects symmetrically to eight oxygens of four anions, two from each adjacent plane.

History Originally called Lonely 451, the band formed as a trio in January 2000 with Eli Chartkoff on bass/guitar/vocals, Mary Chartkoff on drums and Mike Dennis on bass/guitar/vocals. This configuration lasted only 9 months and played a single show: a house party in Mary Chartkoff's living room. The band reformed as The Monolators in the summer of 2002 with Eli Chartkoff on bass/vocals, Mary Chartkoff on drums, and Mike Dennis on lead guitar. Soon after, The Monolators began taking the project more seriously and recorded the EP Hi-Fi Sound in their garage, followed by their first live show at Silverlake restaurant Zen Sushi in September 2002. In 2003, the band self-released a holiday-themed 7\\" vinyl single Santa Claus vs. Dave Matthews, followed by the full-length record Rejection Set Me Free in 2004. In 2005, Mike Dennis left the band but they continued as a duo with Eli on guitar. The band recorded their second album Our Tears Have Wings in the Fall of 2005 at producer Raymond Richards's Red Rockets Glare Studios with future member Tom Bogdon as a studio musician on lead guitar. They began a monthly \\"First Friday\\" residency at the Los Angeles club Mr. T's Bowl in June 2006, which ended exactly two years later in June 2008. The band became a trio again in 2006 with the addition of Andy Bollas on bass. After releasing the You Look Good on the Train EP in 2007, the band (following the departure of Bollas and with new members Ashley Jex on bass and Tom Bogdon on guitar) released their third record Don't Dance in 2008. In October 2008, the band won the LA Weekly Detour Music Festival Battle of the Bands contest sharing the stage with Gogol Bordello, Black Lips, and Datarock. In November 2008, the band contributed their song \\"Hot Sleigh\\" to the benefit holiday compilation \\"Plastic Snow\\" featuring Los Angeles bands Great Northern, Earlimart, and others. In 2009, the band changed their lineup again with the departure of Tom Bogdon and the additions of Ray Gurrola on lead guitar and Jillinda Palmer on keyboards, followed by the digital EP release of Ruby, I'm Changing My Number in Spring 2009.

Plot  In a run down apartment complex, Bunny is looking through a photo album of memories. The pictures start to come to life as she daydreams. At nursing school Bunny sings about how lonely she is. As she walks down the stairs she slips, and her journal falls into the hands of a handsome fighter pilot, Bear. He states how beautiful her smile is. They are soon on a date in which they both realize they are in love with each other. As he flies through the air Bear sings about how madly in love he is. Bunny's dreams are interrupted by a knock on the door (a pig invites her for bacon in which she quickly shuts the door on his face). As her dreams continue, the couple are seen outside a military ball they were invited to. The couple dance and sing to one another. Later in the night Bear is seen outside on one knee ready to propose. Just as the words are said, the General is seen in the doorway. War has begun and there was a red alert. Bear has been called to duty. The couple kiss goodbye and Bear heads out to war. As war goes on Bunny waits at nursing school, worried for her love. After a successful mission, the flight is about to head to base when Bear's plane is shot down. Wounded but not ready to give up, Bear trudges through the wilderness. After shooting down several enemy soldiers, he promises to a picture of Bunny that he will return home. Spotted by the enemy, Bear is shot down at open lines. We return to the apartment where Bunny sings to a portrait of her love of how she misses him. The picture suddenly comes alive and sings back to her. In song, Bear states that life will go on, and it is revealed that Bunny was pregnant and had a child before Bear went to war. As the movie closes, Bunny sings about how her and Bear's love will live on in their child.

For example, training software such as simulators are often used to help prepare first responders, word processors can keep form templates handy for printing and analytical software can be used to perform post-hoc examinations of the data captured during an incident. All of these systems are interrelated, as the results of an after-incident analysis can then be used to program training software to better prepare for a similar situation in the future. Crisis Information Management Software (CIMS) is the software found in emergency management operation centers (EOC) that supports the management of crisis information and the corresponding response by public safety agencies.Crisis Information Management System (CIMS) Feature Comparison Report National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, US Department of Justice 2001 History Although such software had existed prior to 9/11, after 2001 there was a significant increase in focus on emergency management. A 2001 study by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) compared software features from 10 vendors. In 2004, the Institute for Security Technology Studies published a report addressing the interoperability of different software, which has remained a strong focus in the development of software for the Emergency Management field. To support National Incident Management System implementation, the Department of Homeland Security established the National Incident Management System Support Center (NIMS SC) and the Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (STEP) in 2005. In 2007 a study similar to the National Institute of Justice report was conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF).Commercial Emergency Management Software: Evaluation Methods and Findings Office of GeoIntegration, Air Force Space Command 2007 In 2008 the United States Air Force and the University of Colorado Center for Homeland Security surveyed several hundred Emergency Management personnel seeking to prioritize user requirements.USAF Emergency and Incident Management Systems: A Systematic Analysis of Functional Requirements Robillard & Sambrook 2008 Characteristics Common features of the software include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), weather and plume modeling, resource management, and Command, Control, and Communication (C3) functions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supports evaluation of software through the National Incident Management System Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (NIMS STEP). As of October 1, 2013 the FEMA P-TAC Center (formally the NIMSSC) is no longer taking applications for STEP. The National Preparedness Directorate Incident Management Systems Integration Division (NPD-IMSI) identifies criteria for this program to evaluate against. These criteria are derived primarily from the National Incident Management System.National Incident Management System (NIMS) Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (STEP) Guide Federal Emergency Management Agency, US Department of Homeland Security 2009 For example: *Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) as per National Response Framework (NRF) definition *Incident Command Functions as per National Incident Management System **Resource Management (preparedness, incident response, post-incident recovery, reimbursement) *All-hazards philosophy as per the National Incident Management System **Specific hazards identified as per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600: Standard on Disaster / Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs *Standardized framework / Common Operating Picture as per National Incident Management System *Scalability as per National Incident Management System *Command and Management – Incident Command System (ICS) as per National Incident Management System FEMA currently uses WebEOC as its emergency management software. =Interoperability= The primary focus of these standards is interoperability. A lack of interoperability was identified as a key drawback (although not limited in scope to the software) in a National Institute of Justice feature comparison report conducted in 2001. In 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency created the National Incident Management System which addresses interoperability by providing standardized definitions for different software to utilize. The National Incident Management System prescribes several required features that these systems must incorporate.2008 National Incident Management System (NIMS) Communications and Information Management Standards *American National Standards Institute InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (ANSI INCITS) 398-2005: Information Technology – Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1512-2006: Standard for Common Incident Management Message Sets for Use by Emergency Management Centers *National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1221: Standard for Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Emergency Services Communications Systems *Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.1 *Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL) Distribution Element v1.0 =Crisis and emergency modeling and simulation= Software simulation is mainly used in the preparedness phase of the emergency management process. Simulation can be performed both to analyze possible emergency scenarios, to evaluate recovery strategies and to train institutional or private operators in better facing a crisis. Simulations can deal with weather and climate forecasting, landslides, ash clouds propagation, earthquake impact, cyber attacks, people behavior, and critical infrastructures. Precondition to simulation is modeling. Furthermore, an increasing interest is in simulating socio-technical systems where the impact of an emergency (e.g., due to a natural disaster) should be considered on both infrastructures and population. For this purpose, a novel approach is to adopt domain-specific modeling techniques in order to support representation of a crisis scenario as an executable model.De Nicola, Antonio; Tofani, Alberto; Vicoli, Giordano; Villani, Maria Luisa (2012). \\"An MDA-based Approach to Crisis and Emergency Management Modeling\\".

The book provides an overview of the historical and philosophical debates that have continued throughout the history of evolutionary theory, and carry on to this day in debates surrounding the merits of gene-centric selection and group selection models. The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. The book also claims Dawkins embraces an outdated and prescriptive conception of evolution that actually restricts debate rather than promoting it. Acclaim and criticism The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas.

The core is normally a disposable item that is destroyed to get it out of the piece.. They are most commonly used in sand casting, but are also used in die casting and injection moulding. For example, cores define multiple passages inside cast engine blocks. One model of GM V-8 engine requires 5 dry-sand cores for every casting. Materials required to make cores *Core sand *Bentonite clay *Pulverized coal *Resin oil Advantages and disadvantages Cores are useful for features that cannot tolerate draft or to provide detail that cannot otherwise be integrated into a core-less casting or mold. The main disadvantage is the additional cost to incorporate cores. Requirements There are seven requirements for cores: #Green strength: In the green condition, there must be adequate strength for handling #In the hardened state, it must be strong enough to handle the forces of casting; therefore, the compression strength should be 100 to 300 psi (0.69 to 2.07 MPa). #Permeability must be very high to allow for the escape of gases. #Friability: As the casting or molding cools, the core must be weak enough to break down as the material shrinks. Moreover, they must be easy to remove during shakeout. #Good refractoriness is required as the core is usually surrounded by hot metal during casting or molding. #A smooth surface finish. #Minimum generation of gases during metal pouring. Types Many types of cores are available. The selection of the correct type of core depends on production quantity, production rate, required precision, required surface finish, and the type of metal being used. For example, certain metals are sensitive to gases that are given off by certain types of core sands; other metals have too low of a melting point to properly break down the binder for removal during the shakeout. =Green-sand cores= Green-sand cores Green-sand cores makes casting long narrow features difficult or impossible. Even for long features that can be cast it still leave much material to be machined. A typical application is a through hole in a casting.. =Dry-sand cores= The simplest way to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core segments are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat. Single-piece cores do not need to be assembled because they are made in a split core box. A split core box, like it sounds, is made of two halves and has at least one hole for sand to be introduced. For simple cores that have constant cross-sections they can be created on special core-producing extruders. The extrusions are then cut to the proper length and hardened. More complex single-piece cores can be made in a manner similar to injection moldings and die castings. Types of core: *cold box *half core box *dump core box *split core box *left and right core box *gang core box *strickle core box *loose piece core box =Lost cores= Cores are used for complex injection moldings in the fusible core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath. Binders Special binders are introduced into core sands to add strength. The oldest binder was vegetable oil, however now synthetic oil is used, in conjunction with cereal or clay. The core is then baked in a convection oven between . The heat causes the binder to cross-link or polymerize. While this process is simple, the dimensional accuracy is low.. Another type of binder process is called the hot-box process, which uses a thermoset and catalyst for a binder. The sand with the binder is packed into a core box that is heated to approximately (which is where the name originated from). The binder that touches the hot surface of the core box begins to cure within 10 to 30 seconds. Depending on the type of binder it may require further baking to fully cure.. Cores produced using this method are sometimes referred to as \\"shell-core\\" because often, only the outside layer of the core is hardened when in contact with the hot corebox. When the corebox is opened and the core removed, the uncured sand inside the core is dumped out to be reused. This practice can also be observed in some cold-box coremaking practices, though cold box shell-core making is much less common. In a similar vein, the cold- box process uses a binder that is hardened through the use of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.. Special binders are used in air-set sands to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas catalyst because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates the curing process. The only disadvantage with this is that after the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. A third way to produce room temperature cores is by shell molding. The term no-bake sands can refer to either the cold-box process or air-set process. =Other considerations= To increase the strength of cores internal wires and rods can be added. To enhance collapsibility, straw can be added to the middle of the core or a hollow core can be used. This attribute is especially important for steel casting because a large amount of shrinkage occurs. Except for very small cores, all cores require vent holes to release gases. These are usually formed by using small wires to create holes from the surface of the mold to the core. When this is not feasible cinder and coke can be added to the core to increase permeability. Chaplets A diagram of chaplet usage Various types of chaplets If Fub≤0, no chaplet is used. If Fub>0, chaplets is used. As mentioned earlier, cores are usually supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means are required to support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied in the form of chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create weak spots in the casting.. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will tend to float upward in the molten metal. Cheeks A cheek used to create a pulley When casting a reentrant angle, instead of using a core a cheek can be used. This is a third segment in the flask, in addition to the cope and drag. This allows the entire mold to be made from green sand and from removable patterns. The disadvantage of this is more mold-making operations are required, but it is usually advantageous when the quantities are low. However, if large quantities of casting are required, it is usually more cost effective to simply use a core. See also *Core plug NotesReferences *.

It is known from one fossil found at Jianchang, Liaoning Province, in rocks of the Jiufotang Formation, representing the type species Zhongjianornis yangi.

It consists of a complete skeleton, possibly only missing a few tail vertebrae. History and classification Z. yangi was initially believed to be the most primitive (though not earliest) bird species that completely lacked teeth, and one of the most basal birds known. It was described by Zhou, Zhang and Li, in a paper published in January 2010 (though the paper had appeared on the Internet during 2009).Zhou, Z., Zhang, F. and Li, Z. (2010). \\"A new Lower Cretaceous bird from China and tooth reduction in early avian evolution.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 277(1679): 219-227. They found that Zhongjianornis was more primitive than Confuciusornis, and that it predated the split between euornithean and enantiornithean birds. The authors also reported that Zhongjianornis shared features with very basal birds like Jeholornis, Sapeornis and Confuciusornis, including a highly expanded deltopectoral crest, and suggest that this was an early flight architecture that was replaced by an enlarged, keeled breastbone in more advanced birds. However, later analysis of the anatomy of Z. yangi cast doubt on this interpretation of the bird as very primitive. Research published in 2012 found that some of the apparently primitive features were due to poor preservation of the bones, and that Zhongjianornis is more similar in anatomy to primitive euornitheans like Chaoyangia and Schizooura. A phylogenetic analysis showed that a very primitive position in the bird family tree for Z. yangi is unlikely given current evidence.O'Connor, J.K. and Zhou Z.

He's going to shut down one side of the field when he's out there.\\"Rusty Simmons, \\"Cal's shutdown corner Thompson has hands full with Cougars' Gibson\\", San Francisco Chronicle, September 6, 2008. The NFL Draft Scout, a CBS Sports affiliate, rated Thompson 15th of its Top 32 seniors for the 2009 season, and wrote, \\"His straight-line speed, agility, reliable open-field tackling and natural return skills would be earning significantly more attention from the national media if he played in the Big Ten or SEC.\\"Rob Rang, \\"Top 32 seniors: Top heavy with the heftier prospects\\", CBS Sports, July 10, 2009.

J. M. Turowicz, was a Polish-Pakistani aviator, military scientist and aeronautical engineer. Turowicz was the administrator of Pakistan's Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) from 1967 to 1970. He was one of forty five Polish officers and airmen who joined RPAF on contract in the early fifties. After completion of his initial contract, Turowicz opted to stay on in Pakistan and continued to serve in PAF and later, SUPARCO. Turowicz made significant contributions to Pakistan's missile/rocket program as a chief aeronautical engineer. In Pakistan, he remains highly respected as a scientist and noted aeronautical engineer. Early life and education Turowicz was born to an aristocratic family in the village of Wadziejewsko in Siberia (Russia) in 1908, where he graduated from high school. The Polish name of the village may suggest it was inhabited by Poles who were exiled or imprisoned by the Tsar, as it was unusual for Polish aristocrats to live in Siberia for non-political reasons. From an early age on, Turowicz was fascinated by aviation technology and had collected different models of aircraft. Due to this passion, he moved to Warsaw where he attended the most prestigious engineering institute, the Warsaw University of Technology (WTU) in 1930, majoring in aeronautical engineering; upon graduation, he received his PhD with honours in 1936. While at Warsaw University of Technology, Turowicz joined and became a pioneering member of a Aeroklub Polski (better known as Polish Aero Club) where he had previliged to study and work with noted Polish engineers to the field of aerospace engineering. A distinguished member of Polski Club, he had an opportunity to study and work with Ryszard Bartel, Jerzy Drzewiecki, Henry Millicer, to name a few. It was here at the Aero Club that Turowicz met his future wife, Zofia Turowicz with whom he would have 4 children. In addition, he completed an MSc in astrodynamics in 1937 from the same institution. He joined the Polish Air Force as an aeronautical engineer and fighter pilot, but later emigrated to United Kingdom where he joined the Royal Air Force in 1939 as a reservist Polish pilot. World War II and RAF career Though initially joining the Polish Air Force, Turowicz enlisted as a Royal Air Force reservist during World War II. He was immediately sent to Great Britain where he flew the British-built Handley Page Halifax during the war. Later, he was transferred into the Royal Air Force Aeronautics division where he served as Technical Inspector, and was put in charge of aircraft electrical and system information, organising, testing, and evaluating aircraft. After World War II, Turowicz did not return to Communist Poland due to the official negative attitude towards those who had served with the Allied Forces during the war. Career with Pakistan Air Force As the political situation in Poland got worse, many Polish Air Force officers began to move to United States, Australia, Norway and Canada. Turowicz and 45 of his colleagues opted to move to Pakistan in 1948 on a three-year contract. Turowicz set up technical institutes in Karachi. He taught and revitalised Pakistan Air Force Academy, where he worked as a chief scientist. He initially led the technical training in the airbase and a part of the Polish specialists in the technical section in Karachi. In 1952, Turowicz was promoted to the rank of wing commander. In 1959, Turowicz was promoted in the rank of group captain. In 1960, he became an air commodore and an assistant chief of air staff, in charge of PAF's Maintenance Branch. Pakistan's space program In 1966, the Government of Pakistan transferred him to SUPARCO, Pakistan's national space agency, where he worked there as a chief scientist and an aeronautical engineer. He, along with noted Pakistani theoretical physicist, Dr. Abdus Salam, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979, met with President Khan where he successfully convinced him of the importance of a space program for a developing country like Pakistan after Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik. He along with Dr. Salam travelled through to the United States to reach a space-co-operation agreement. He successfully convinced the United States Government to invest and train Pakistan's scientists in the field of rocket technology. =SUPARCO Administrator= Turowicz was appointed head of SUPARCO in 1967 by the Government of Pakistan. As the administrator, he revitalised and initiated the space program as quickly as possible. As a noted aeronautical engineer, Air. Cdre. Władysław Turowicz upgraded Sonmiani Satellite Launch Centre in which he was responsible for installing Flight-Test Control Command, Launch Pad Control System and System Engineering Division. Turowicz started a project for the fabrication and launch of a Pakistani satellite. As a result, Pakistan mastered the field of rocket technology by the end of the 1970s. He also set up the educational engineering institute at the SUPARCO. Family Zofia, Turowicz's wife, and his two daughters joined him in Karachi in 1949, where a third daughter was born. Between 1950 and 1954, Zofia taught gliding to the Shaheen Air Cadets in Karachi and Rawalpindi. Two of his daughters married Pakistanis while the third daughter married a Bangladeshi. His widow, Zofia Turowicz, who died in 2012, was awarded the Pride of Performance and Sitara-i- Imtiaz, and taught applied mathematics and particle physics at the Karachi University. Turowicz's son is currently working at the SUPARCO as an aerospace engineer and chief scientist.Bravehart Turowicz's grandson has completed a PHD in quantum physics from Brown University and is currently running the AI statistical modelling division at JP Morgan. Documentary A documentary film on the life and scientific work of Air Cdre Władysław Turowicz was completed in 2008. It was directed by Anna T. Pietraszek, a Polish journalist and film-maker with an honorary Pakistani citizenship. The film shows how Air Cdre Turowicz and other Polish officers and technicians had contributed in building the PAF and SUPARCO soon after independence.Dawn 3 October 2016 Death and legacy Air. Cdre. Turowicz was involved in a car accident on 8 January 1980 along with his driver. He was quickly taken to the military hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was buried in the Christian Cemetery in Karachi with full military honours. Both Polish, including the Consul- General of Poland in Karachi Mr. Kazimierz Maurer, and Pakistani military and civilian personnel attended his funeral in Karachi. The Government of Pakistan issued a condolence letter to his family, stating that Turowicz was not only an outstanding Air Force officer, but also a scientist, and had served in the country's space program. Honours and recognition In 2005, PAF Museum, Karachi, placed a memorial plaque in the honour of Air. Cdre. Władysław Turowicz where both Polish and Pakistani civilian and military personnel attended. On this occasion the Consul General of the Republic of Poland in Karachi Ireneusz Makles profoundly thanked the PAF and especially Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman and other officers for their efforts to make this memorial a reality. * Władysław Turowicz Monument (PAF Museum, Karachi). * Władysław Turowicz Space Complex (SUPARCO), Lahore Center.

It is considered to be part of the Mount's Bay mining district.Dines (1956) p.169. Until the mid 19th-century the mine was notable for its willingness to try out new innovations. Although very rich in copper and tin ores, the mine never lived up to its expectations: during the later part of the 19th-century it had several periods of closure, and an attempt to reopen it in the 1960s was not successful mainly because of bureaucracy. Today the site is part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. Geology The country rock at the mine is killas, mostly hard, blue-grey rock. The mine's main produce was copper and tin derived from the nearby Tregonning-Godolphin granite, part of the Cornubian batholith. There were four main lodes at the mine, two of which were crossed by two wide elvan dykes, wide. At the intersections the lodes widened and mineralization spread through the dykes, forming irregular masses which were stoped to the full width of the dykes.Dines (1956) p.224. Early history Wheal Vor is an ancient mine: the ground shows the remains of old surface excavations following the lodes, and mining may have taken place here in late Roman times.Dines (1956) p.227, citing James, C.C. 1945. Great Wheal Vor, Trans. Roy. Geol. Soc. Corn., vol, xvii, pp. 194–207. The underground mine probably started in the 15th-century and continued until 1715 producing mainly copper ore.Dines (1956) p.227 The mine was associated with the Godolphin family who were keen on trying out recent innovations, and through their connections it may have been the first mine in Cornwall to make use of gunpowder, at the close of the 17th-century.Earl (1994) p.42. Shortly after 1700 the mine may have been one of the few sites to trial Thomas Savery's pump,Hancock (2008) pp.131–132 which was, according to his patent application, \\"A new invention for raiseing of water … by the impellent force of fire, which will be of great use and advantage for drayning mines…\\". It is not certain whether Savery's experiments took place at Wheal Vor or at another nearby mine, but it is known that c. 1710 a Newcomen engine had been installed here, which was probably the first in Cornwall.Earl (1994) p.38L T C Rolt and J S Allen, The steam engine of Thomas Newcomen (3rd edn. Landmark, Ashbourne 1997), 44, from R L Galloway, The steam engine and its inventors, quoting a paper by Joseph Carne on the history of copper mining in Cornwall. The mine was abandoned in about 1715 and it was almost a century before it was reopened by Captain John Gundry.Hunt (1887) p.414 It then continued to trial new inventions, such as the second Woolf engine in the county (1815);Barton (1966) p.37 one of the first Brunton Calciners (1830);Earl (1994) p.93 and an early man engine (c. 1856).Barton (1966) p.210 It also one of the few mines to operate its own smelter, having taken over the one owned by the Cornish Copper Company (a major shareholder) in 1823 and later moving to the mine. Wheal Vor was also the site of the first steam stamping mill in 1812.Hunt (1887) p.725 The years between 1812 and 1848 were the mine's most successful, and it was for a time the richest mine in Cornwall. The ore raised from the 274 fathom (501 metres) level contained on average 5% tin, instead of the 1–1.5% that was usually found in Cornish mines, and for some time after the discovery of this rich lode the mine regularly produced 200 tons of white tin per month. Despite this, the profits from the mine were not enough to keep Gundry's company solvent and in 1828 the company entered into bankruptcy, with the litigation lasting twenty years. In 1840 the mine was employing 1,174 people, but it closed between 1848 and 1853. Surface work continued at the site until 1852, when the mine property was under new ownership. Before the mine was abandoned in 1848,Hunt (1887) p.416Phillips (1850) p.128 its condition was described as being unsafe to work in, and accidents were attributed to these poor conditions.Phillips (1850) p.131 The mine was in litigation for some years before it was abandoned and during this time no repairs were made and safety conditions steadily became worse. However, under new ownership safety issues at the mine were corrected and it was reopened; afterwards employing about 1,200 men. 1850 onwards In 1854 a steam engine, the largest in Cornwall at the time, was installed on Crease's shaft for draining the mine. This engine was built by Harvey & Co of Hayle (the other main shareholder in the mine) and its starting was accompanied by a large celebration. But by 1860, it and another were using 600 tons of coal a month, which was determined to be unsustainable so both engines were stopped and later sold. From a peak production of over 840 tons of black tin in 1865 and 1866, the output from the mine declined until in 1877 only 13 tons was produced. Between 1877 and 1881 the mine was apparently idle until 1881 when five people were working there, and on 23 October 1879 the mine was put up for sale at a public auction. When running at its peak out of £2,000,000 worth of tin, Messrs Gundry and successors had a profit of £272,000. The Godolphin family and Messrs Williams and Co yielded nearly £100,000 in dividends from copper ore. An engine was erected near the head of the valley, in 1885, to extract tin from the accumulation of many years of waste which filled the valley. Until 1885 up to 22 people were employed, though only minimal amounts of ore were sold. There was another gap until 1906, when 65 people were recorded as working at the mine, 16 of them underground. The mine produced some black tin between 1907 and 1910, but then evidently closed again,Burt et al. (1987) pp.548–549 probably due to difficulty keeping water out of the mine. Wheal Vor was the main component of the \\"Great Wheal Vor United\\" group of mines, which included among others, Polladras Mine, Penhale Wheal Vor, Wheal Metal and Sithney Wheal Metal. Wheal Vor also took over the mining setts of two other mines; Carleen Mine (otherwise known as West Wheal Vor), and Wheal Vreah. 20th century to present By the 1960s it was considered that the mine had never been fully developed and there were several ore bodies that could be commercially exploited. The sett was investigated by Camborne Tin Limited which submitted an application to re-open the mine. It was thought that as it might employ some 400 people in a designated Development Area which had an unemployment rate of 6% there was a good chance that permission would be granted, but planning permission was refused because the local water company obtained part of its water supply from an adit flowing out of the old mine. The water company was encouraged to locate an alternative source, and it identified Loe Pool as a potential source, but this was opposed on the grounds that it was polluted by sewage. The cost of treating this led to another public enquiry which caused delays. Meanwhile, the ownership of the mineral rights for the proposed mine was also causing problems: although the major part was held by the Treworlis Estate which was cooperative, the 11th Duke of Leeds owned land that the deeper parts of the mine were to pass under, and negotiations with the Leeds Estates were prolonged and later complicated by the death of the Duke and then, within a year, the death of his successor without an heir in 1964. This meant the Leeds estate had to be sold which caused further delays. Pending resolution of the outstanding issues, Camborne Tin Limited applied for permission to make exploratory drillings – this was granted, but they were not allowed to drill in the former Leeds Estate lands, and it became apparent that this was where the undiscovered ore bodies were likely to be found. In 1967, the company decided that it could no longer tolerate the delays, and the mine was never re-opened. Today, there is little visible above ground of the once extensive sett of the mine. An engine house and chimney are the most obvious remains. The cottages at Wheal Vor have been listed as Grade II buildings since 22 December 1972. The Trevithick Society published a history of the mine, entitled Great Wheal Vor in October 2015. Since 2006 the site has been part of the Tregonning and Trewavas Mining District of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape.

Development In December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea. In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was commercially launched in December.  Gameplay  Players control an avatar that spends most of its active time fighting and most of its inactive time running a shop. Character classes are chosen at level 15 and sub-classes at levels 60 and 130, referred to as the first, second, and third job changes. The job changes are obligatory—when a character reaches the requisite level, experience gain stops until the completion of one of the job quests. Levels are gained based on experience, which can be acquired by killing Masquerpets and by performing quests. Quests generally involve killing specific Masquerpets and collecting the different quest objects they drop; a typical early quest is that of \\"Party of Is,\\" with the requirement of collecting 7 Chupims through killing Pukepukes. At each level, the character receives skill points that can be invested in skills available to its job(s). There are two types of skills: those used for attacking and those used for protection and/or enhancement. Skills may have cool-down times and may cause status effects, with confusion, stun, and bleed among the most common effect. It is not possible to acquire maximum levels in all available skills until becoming a level 60 Master. Characters can be improved by acquiring objects such as improved equipment. Masquerpets drop equipment, the in-game currency penya, consumable items such as food and potions, and quest objects, or players can purchase equipment from other players note this is usually extremely expensive because of the high quality gear that can be acquired this way. These can all be traded between players; Flyff gameplay involves large amounts of buying and selling in order to collect desired equipment. Most equipment items have minimum levels at which they can be used. = Combat = Flyff features melee, ranged and magic combat, with different skills available to different classes. Health points, fight points, and magic power bars are able to be replenished through food, vital drinks and mana refreshers; some classes depend on assists to heal them with magic. = PvP = Player versus player (PvP) combat is allowed on all servers without penalty in the form of dueling. Both players must be over level 15, and within 30 levels of each other, then they must confirm the duel first unless they are within the PvP Arena, a free-for-all environment found on all servers. Player killing is allowed only on the Yetti server and carries a high penalty. Social systems=Lord System= Introduced in version 12, the Lord system allows eligible players to be voted as the Lord of their server for 2 weeks. Players must have obtained Hero or Master status to qualify as a Lord candidate. While a Lord, a player may introduce a number of events on the server. =Party System= Players who join a party gain increased experience and loot. A lone player does not benefit from or harm a party. A party starts as a Regular Party, in which experience is distributed evenly among party members in the same location. At level 10, the party becomes Advanced, at which point experience can be distributed to players based on their amount of damage done. An Advanced Party may have up to 8 players; having this many players in a party increases player experience with each monster killed during training. =Guild System= Guilds allow players to socialize; players within a guild can chat with each other and many in-game activities are guild-based. Guilds have a hierarchical chain of command, consisting of the Master/Leader, Kingpins, Captains, Supporters, and Rookies. The guild master may change the permissions for guild members, allowing members to withdraw items or money from the guild bank, rank-up or de-rank other members, and be paid daily. Guilds are able to choose an emblem and cloak to represent themselves and have the use of a warehouse. When a guild reaches the appropriate guild level, increased by supporting the guild through quest items and Penya, the guild master may create guild cloaks at a cost that sport the guild's symbol. A large amount of Flyff end-game content is guild- related. Guild Siege This event, held on Saturday in channel 1 of each server, allows guilds to compete in a free-for-all environment. A total of 8 Guilds may enter, and each Guild may have 10 players. To compete, the Guild leader must place a bid; the 8 highest bidders compete. Clockworks War The Clockworks War is a guild dungeon that guilds of any level may enter a single time. If the guild fails against the dungeon boss, its players may reattempt to win as many times as necessary for a time period of one hour. Only one guild is permitted inside the Clockworks Arena at a time. =Couple System= The couple system, implemented in Version 13, allows a marriage- style connection between two characters. Characters who become a couple are granted special buffs and skills and receive gifts with new couple level gained. =Mentor/Pupil System= The Mentor/Pupil system, implemented in Version 15, allows any player level 91 or above to take on any character who has not completed their second Job Change as a pupil after completing the mentor qualification quest. This Mentor/Pupil bond provides a special bonus to experience gained by both mentor and pupil while both characters are logged on to the same server. Additionally, upon the pupil reaching certain level marks, the mentor gains 'Mentor Points'; as the mentor gains more of these points, additional pupils may be taken on, to a maximum of 3 pupils when over 100 Mentor Points are gained. These additional pupils grant increases to the experience bonus of the mentor; the other pupils' experience bonus' remain unchanged. While no action apart from the initial bonding is necessary within the Mentor/Pupil relationship, mentors are encouraged to help their pupils with advice, quests, and/or occasional gifts. If at any time either pupil or mentor becomes dissatisfied, the player may cancel the bond. The Mentor Points of a mentor who loses all pupils returns to 0 and must be regained through new Mentor/Pupil bonds. Other game systems=Events= Events involving rare drops and extra experience are held almost every week by the gamemaster team. Maintenance is held every Tuesday evening (gPotato) and Thursday noon (FlyFF PH). =Collector System= Re-Introduced in version 11, the Collector System allows players to collect rare and unique game items through the use of a Collectors. =Private Shops= Players can open private shops, in which held items can be sold at any price. Other players can enter these shops and purchase the items within, with the purchase money transferred to the shop owner's inventory. =Raising Pets= Players may keep seven types of Raised Pets, which start out as eggs. An egg can be hatched by the Pet Tamer NPC after feeding the egg 50,000 pet feed. To evolve a pet, players must complete quests given by the Pet Tamer. Pets must also be fed to keep them alive. Each Raised Pet has five levels and three appearances. A player accompanied by a pet receives additional stat points based on the type of pet. =Elements= Monsters are generally associated with a particular in-game elements, of which there are five. Each element is vulnerable to one element and resistant to another. Weapons and armor can be \\"elemented\\", conferring advantages against monsters of some types and disadvantages against others; many aggressive spells are also elemented. =Cash Shop= Flyff uses a micropayment system through which users can obtain 'Game Cash'. Game Cash can be exchanged for premium items not otherwise available in the game, including clothing, potions, different kinds of scrolls and pick-up pets. Sequel On February 13, 2012, Gala Lab, the development arm of Gala, Inc., revealed artwork for its upcoming game named F2: Floating Fortress. F2 was announced to have large- scale duel and PvP arenas, aerial combat, sieges and various types of PvP quests. The title was meant as a sequel to FlyFF. On July 25, 2014, the sequel was officially cancelled by Gala Lab. The project was ceased because of various internal circumstances that the company had been through.

Her novels combine themes of feminism and women's rights with issues relating to the Hausa people and Islam, drawing from her own experiences as a member of these groups. Bilkisu Funtuwa maintains the role that is expected of her and the religious practice of polygamy that constitutes the Hausa female’s reality, and therefore writes about how to combat such circumstances. Funtuwa’s works focus around female protagonists who use their education in combination with their religious devotion to elevate themselves to extraordinary success. These characters take on the careers of lawyers, doctors, and government officials while also leading charmed lives of wealthy businessmen. One of the most defined themes in her work is passionate love. Within her works, couples share relationships full of respect, intimacy, and mutually enjoyed pastimes.

Davis (November 7, 1852 – December 2, 1926) was a 20th-century bishop of the Catholic Church in the United States. He served as the third bishop of the Diocese of Davenport in the state of Iowa from 1906 to 1926. Biography=Early life and ministry= James Davis was born in Tinvaun, County Kilkenny, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to James and Margaret Davis. All of his siblings either entered a religious order or the priesthood. His eldest brother, Thomas, entered the Carmelites and became provincial in Ireland. Richard became a priest of the Diocese of Louisville, Kentucky. His three sisters also entered religious life. One of his sisters became the superior of Sacred Heart Convent at Sag Harbor, New York, and another, Sr. Sebastian, was a member of the same order in France. A third sister, Sr. Constance, became the superior of the Immaculate Conception Academy at Newport, Kentucky. Davis studied with the Carmelites at St. Carmel at Knocktopher, and studied for the priesthood at St. Patrick's Ecclesiastical College in Carlow. While he was in school he was recruited to serve in the Diocese of Dubuque by Bishop John Hennessy. He was ordained a priest on June 21, 1878, by Bishop James Walshe of the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin. Shortly after his ordination he left Ireland and came to Dubuque, Iowa. He was assigned for a short time to St. Raphael's Cathedral, and was then assigned to St. Peter's in Windham, which he had trouble finding because it wasn't on any map of Iowa. When the Diocese of Davenport was established on May 8, 1881, Davis was the pastor of St. Mary's Church in Oxford and he became a priest of the new diocese. In 1885 he was transferred to St. Michael's in Holbrook and its mission in Parnell where Davis built a church and a school. At the time of his pastorate St. Michael's was the largest parish in the diocese. In 1889 he became rector of St. Margaret's Cathedral. He supervised the construction of the new Sacred Heart Cathedral as well as the parish's new rectory. He became the vicar general of the diocese in 1895. =Bishop of Davenport= On October 7, 1904, Pope Saint Pius X appointed Davis Titular Bishop of Milopotamus and Coadjutor Bishop of Davenport. He was consecrated bishop in Sacred Heart Cathedral on November 30, 1904, by Archbishop John J. Keane of Dubuque. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Henry Cosgrove of Davenport and Mathias Clement Lenihan of Great Falls. He succeeded to the See of Davenport on December 22, 1906, upon the death of Bishop Cosgrove. Bishop Davis was the second bishop of Davenport in a row to be named from the clergy of the diocese. Regina Coeli Monastery in Bettendorf, Iowa. Bishop Davis brought the Discalced Carmelites to the Midwest. Bishop Davis would serve the diocese as its bishop for 20 years. In 1908 the Redemptorists established a mission house and St. Alphonsus parish in Davenport, and in 1911 the Discalced Carmelites from Baltimore established a monastery in the diocese. Two other religious communities, that were already established in the diocese, built new motherhouses. The Congregation of the Humility of Mary built their new headquarters in 1911 in Ottumwa with the financial assistance of the clergy. The Sisters of St. Francis built their new motherhouse, Mt St. Claire Convent, in Clinton. It was during this time that Bishop Davis started to standardize parish administration. He required pastors to file annual reports that were audited and signed by two laymen. The parishes themselves were incorporated according to the laws of the State of Iowa. The Diocese of Des Moines was established on August 12, 1911, from the western half of the Davenport Diocese. Davis was named administrator of the new diocese until a bishop was named. At the time the Holy See was petitioned to establish the new diocese, Bishop Davis requested that all the diocesan boundaries in Iowa be redrawn for a more equitable distribution of the population. If the Davenport Diocese was simply divided in half, it would be reduced to 35,000 Catholics and the new diocese would have only 25,000. The Archdiocese of Dubuque had 109,000 Catholics and the Diocese of Sioux City had 50,000 Catholics within its boundaries. While the request was not fulfilled, the Davenport Diocese received Clinton County from the archdiocese to compensate it for its loss, and it gave the diocese its current borders. The diocese at this time had 50,000 Catholics in a total population of 589,000. During World War I Bishop Davis joined other members of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States in pledging their support to President Woodrow Wilson for the war effort. He encouraged men to sign up for the military, women to be supportive of the cause and vowed religious to offer their services to the war effort. Bishop Davis preached a sermon at St. Anthony's Church in Davenport on patriotism. He was quoted in the Catholic Messenger, \\"It is not the flamboyant generalization of patriotism or Fourth of July oratory, but it is the patriotism that acts and responds to the call of the President. The Catholic Church teaches loyalty to the state authority, which is of God…the Catholic is the first to respond to the call of the country—the first to pay, even with his life, for what his government has given him.\\" Davis Hall at St. Ambrose University St. Ambrose College started enrolling women on a limited basis by admitting members of religious orders of teaching sisters in 1924. The next year the Congregation of the Humility of Mary opened St. Joseph Junior College in Ottumwa. It was the first institution of higher education for women in the diocese. The Diocesan Council of Catholic Women was also organized in 1925. =Later life and Death= As his health declined Davis requested an auxiliary bishop, and on December 13, 1923, the Rev. Edward D. Howard of the Archdiocese of Dubuque was appointed by Pope Pius XI. Bishop Howard, however, was appointed the Archbishop of Oregon City eight months prior to Davis' death. His death occurred on December 2, 1926, and he was laid to rest with his predecessors in the crypt of Sacred Heart Cathedral. Their bodies were later moved to the Bishop's Circle in Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Davenport. Legacy Davis Hall, a residence hall at St. Ambrose University in Davenport, is named in his honor.

Its understated production was also received positively, particularly coming after the group's previous album Love, which sold well in the United Kingdom but had been criticised by some for being too sanitised and glossy.

He defied the atonal trend of his generation with his uniquely harmonic, contrapuntal style. His legacy of over 300 works,The Hugo Kauder Society \\"Kauder Musical Scores\\" many yet to be published, is receiving renewed interest today. Biography Kauder's father Ignaz Kauder was Oberlehrer (principal) of the local German language primary school. As a boy, Hugo Kauder had violin lessons with the local teacher, who eventually dismissed him when he had “taught him everything he knew.” These lessons were his only formal training in music. In 1905, Kauder moved to Vienna to study engineering but often skipped school with classmate Egon Lustgarten to study scores in the Imperial Court Library. Of particular interest to him were several volumes of Denkmäler der Tonkunst in ÖsterreichMonuments of Music in Austria \\"Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich\\" (Monuments of Music in Austria), mainly works of Flemish composers of the 15th and 16th centuries. Drawing of Hugo Kauder by C. Ssu-Tu, 1948 From 1911 to 1917, Kauder played violin in the Wiener Tonkuenstler OrchesterWiener Tonkuenstler Orchester \\"Wiener Tonkuenstler Orchester\\" under such conductors as Ferdinand Loewe, Franz Schalk, Arthur Nikisch, and Richard Strauss. There he began a lifelong friendship with Dutch horn player Willem Valkenier (1887–1986), inspiring his numerous horn compositions. From 1917 to 1922, Kauder was the violist of the Gottesmann Quartet. In 1919, he met poet and philosopher Rudolph PannwitzRudolf Pannwitz \\"Rudolph Pannwitz\\" (1886–1969). Though he could not play an instrument, Pannwitz composed settings of classic poems, following his idea — quite unconventional at the time — that composers should find and reveal the music latent in texts, rather than creating the musical setting at will. Kauder adopted and elaborated this approach to vocal music and regarded Pannwitz as a lifelong mentor. In 1923 Kauder married the linguist, archeologist, and bible scholar Helene Guttman (1898–1949), a cousin of his study companion Egon Lustgarten. For the rest of his life, in Vienna and later in New York City, Kauder was self-employed as a composer and teacher of violin, music theory, and composition. As part of his efforts to bring his music to life, he conducted a chorus and a chamber ensemble of students and friends (including his son Otto) who studied and performed the classics as well as his own compositions. Notable musicians who appreciated and performed Kauder’s music in Vienna before 1938 and to some extent after 1945 included the Gottesmann Quartet, Sedlak-Winkler, Rosé Quartet, and the Kolbe string quartet; the conductors Josef Mertin (1904–1998), Viktor Bermeiser, Siegmund Levarie, Karl Ristenpart, and Alexander Zemlinsky; pianist Adolf Baller, hornist Ernst Paul, and oboist Alexander Wunderer.  Hugo Kauder Society  A Hugo Kauder Society was founded in 2002 to foster awareness and appreciation of the composer and to provide opportunities to emerging musicians to perform his works. In 2003, the society established an International Music CompetitionThe Hugo Kauder Society International Music Competition \\"International Music Competition\\" to provide opportunities for young musicians to present and in some cases premiere Hugo Kauder's music.

Overview The No. 15 was a time-fused grenade. It was internally fragmented and incorporated a cast-iron body. To light the grenade, the user had to remove a covering that was on the fuse, then strike an external Brock matchhead igniter against the fuse. There were two types of fuses available; the five-second and the nine-second. The former was intended for throwing, while the latter was intended for catapults. History The No. 15 was one of the interim grenades created because of the problems associated with the No. 1 grenade.Saunders, Weapons of the Trench War, p.16. Unlike the others, the No. 15 had been created specifically for the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, mostly for the fighting in the Dardanelles.Saunders, Weapons of the Trench War, p.24. While crude, the No. 15 did well in the Dardanelles. In addition, it could easily be mass-produced; in September 1915, more than 200,000 No. 15s were created per week. However, there were a few problems; the explosive charge was too large, which created smaller-than-expected fragmentation when the grenade exploded. In addition, it was considered too large because of its 3-inch circumference.Saunders, Weapons of the Trench War, p.25. These problems were remedied with the No. 16 \\"oval grenade\\". =Battle of Loos= The No. 15 was first widely used in the Battle of Loos. Tacticians envisioned that the No. 15 would be useful in breaching German defenses and trench clearing. The No. 15 was used because production of the No. 5 \\"Mills bomb\\" was running seriously behind planned figures, and not enough of them could be supplied before the start of the Loos campaign. When the Battle for Loos started, the No. 15 was beset with problems, in particular the wet conditions encountered made the fuse almost useless. It was estimated that approximately 18 out of 20 No. 15s failed to ignite due to inoperative fuses. On November 20, 1915, the No. 15 and its cousin, the No. 16, were withdrawn from France and were replaced with the No. 5 \\"Mills bomb\\".Saunders, Weapons of the Trench War, p. 27. Variants=No. 16 \\"oval grenade\\"= The No. 16 is essentially an improved version of the No. 15. Instead of a ball shape, it has an oval shape and has less explosive charge. It was planned to completely replace the No. 15, but the defeat at Loos caused both the No. 15 and No. 16 to be withdrawn from service, as they both had the same lighting system.

The rancho located between present-day Martinez, Pleasant Hill, Orinda, and Lafayette. Diseño del Rancho Boca de la Cañada del Pinole History Felipe Santiago Briones (1790 -1840) was a soldier at the San Francisco Presidio. He married Maria Manuela Valencia in 1810. Maria Manuela Valencia's brother, Candelario Valencia, was the grantee of Rancho Acalanes. In 1829, Briones and his family settled on the El Pinole lands, built a home (near what is now the Bear Creek Staging area), and in 1839, petitioned for a grant of El Pinole. When Felipe Briones was killed in 1840, his widow, Maria Manuela Valencia de Briones, petitioned for the land grant in her name. In 1842, Governor Alvarado, made a three square league grant of Rancho Boca de la Cañada del Pinole to María Manuela Valencia and a four square league grant of Rancho El Pinole to Ygnacio Martinez.J. P. Munro-Fraser,1882,History of Contra Costa County, California, W.A. Slocum. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 138 ND and the grant was patented to María Manuela Valencia in 1878. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 In 1870, the Briones family sold their lands to Simon and Elias Blum who developed orchards and cultivated fruit. In 1909, the Peoples' Water Company, the precursor to the East Bay Municipal Utility District, purchased the land for the watershed. The nearby Briones Reservoir was constructed in 1964. The East Bay Regional Parks District later acquired Briones and opened the Briones Regional Park in 1967.

He was long mistaken for a senior bishop, as by Carlos González de Posada, who interposed his episcopate in that of Oveco for the years 915–22, and Manuel Risco, who placed it in 921–26.Antonio Palomeque Torres (1948), \\"Episcopologio de la Sede de Oviedo durante el siglo X,\\" Hispania sacra, 1(2): 277, 280.Posada, Memorias históricas del Principado de Asturias y obispado de Oviedo 1 (Tarragona: 1794), 90.Risco, España Sagrada 37 (Madrid: 1789), 268–70. The earliest reference to Hermenegild as a bishop of Oviedo probably dates to 899. In that year, Alfonso III of Asturias, who kept his capital at Oviedo, founded the temple of Santiago in a church council held at Oviedo.Ermelindo Portela Silva (2003), Historia de la ciudad de Santiago de Compostela, , p. 54 The acts of the council are preserved in the Tumbo Nuevo of Lugo Cathedral, and Hermenegild's name is attached to them. Their date, however, is controversial. A date of 14 June 927 that comes down to us in one copy of the acta is certainly false, as Alfonso III was long dead at the time, but the alternative date of 7 May 899 provided by another copy is consistent with the names of all signatories of the acta.Palomeque Torres, 281. Hermenegild's name appears on a document dated 27 May 912 in the Libro de los testamentos, but it is probably a falsification of Bishop Pelagius.Palomeque Torres, 276.

The channel is a branch of Lake Huron. History The Round Island Lighthouse was constructed in 1895 to mark the southern side of the Round Island Channel. In 1936, the United States Coast Guard developed plans to construct another lighthouse, 1000 feet south of Mackinac Island, to mark the northern side of the navigable channel. However, World War II intervened, and construction was delayed. In the interim, a buoy with a radio beacon was moored near the site. The Coast Guard began construction on the Round Island Passage Light in 1947, and finished in 1948. Construction included building a control house at the southern tip on Mackinac Island, and running power cables underwater to the light. The lighthouse was equipped with a beacon light, fog signal, and radiobeacon. The light flashed a green signal from an array of sealed beam lamps mounted at the top of the light tower. The Passage Light was one of the last lights to be constructed on the Great Lakes. The light was built at the same time that the 1895 lighthouse was deactivated. In 1959, the lighthouse's beacon characteristic was changed from green to a flashing red light, and the radiobeacon distance-finding system was deactivated in 1962. In 1968 the formerly all-white light was given a red-painted base on a white pier. In 1973 the light was automated, and the steel antenna tower was removed in the early 2000s. In 1996, the Round Island Light was relighted as a private aid to navigation, and as of 2017 both lights currently mark the channel. On August 7, 2013, the light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the same year, the General Services Administration announced that Round Island Passage Lighthouse was not needed by the Coast Guard. The light was sold at auction in 2014 for $65,500. Description The Round Island Passage Light is constructed on a timber crib foundation which is 56 feet square. The timber crib has perimeter cells filled with concrete, and internal cells filled with rock. Atop the crib is a concrete superstructure with a 41-foot square reinforced concrete deck. The superstructure is octagonal, with four vertical and four sloping sides. Atop the tower's concrete deck is a red-painted 20 foot square enclosure, eleven feet high, constructed of steel plates. The enclosure can be entered through a nine-foot wide door on one side. Above the enclosure is a five-story octagonal steel tower, 41-1/2 feet high and 12 feet across. Each side of the tower contains a four-foot bronze relief Indian head, commemorating the fact that Mackinac Island was a sacred spot for Native American tribes. On the interior, ladders reach from each story to higher ones. The light originally had a 47-foot steel antenna atop the tower, but it was removed in the early 2000s.

The rancho extended from present day Crockett to Martinez and south to Lafayette. Diseño del Rancho Cañada del Hambre y las Bolsas History The grant to Teodora Soto was \\"sobrante\\", being a remainder after the four square league Ygnacio Martinez Rancho El Pinole on the west and the three square league William Welch Rancho Las Juntas on the east were accounted for. It was estimated that the sobrante would contain three square leagues of land. Teodora Soto was married to Desiderio Briones. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Joseph Bryant Crockett (1809–1884) was an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, for whom the town of Crockett is named. Lucy B. Page was the wife of Crockett's law partner Gwyn Page. Piper was also a business partner of Crocket. Later Crockett and Page sold a portion of the rancho to Ira J. True. Although the rancho was patented to Soto in 1866, the exact boundaries were not determined until the boundaries of Rancho El Pinole and Rancho Las Juntas were fixed.

Born in Peterborough, Stedman attended Peterborough County Grammar School, then worked as a librarian in her home town, and served in the National Fire Service in Derbyshire during World War II. After marrying Harry Stedman in 1941, she helped run his family horticultural business.Phyllis Stedman profile, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; accessed 26 July 2014. In 1946, Stedman was elected to the Soke of Peterborough County Council, representing the Labour Party, serving on it and its successors until 1976. She was the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Hampstead before the 1951 general election, but withdrew due to illness. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours. At the 1966 general election, Stedman was the election agent for Michael Ward. When it became apparent that the result was very close, Stedman requested repeated recounts. After the seventh recount - a record which stands to this day - Ward was defeated by the incumbent, Harmar Nicholls, by three votes. In 1972, Stedman was appointed to the Peterborough New Town Development Corporation. On 25 June 1974, she was created a life peer as Baroness Stedman, of Longthorpe in the City of Peterborough, to bolster the Labour Party in the House of Lords, and was appointed as a whip. In January 1979, she was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport and Water Resources. When the Labour Party lost the 1979 general election, she was moved to become their spokesperson on the environment. Stedman defected to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on its formation in 1981. She became the party's chief whip in the Lords in 1986. Most of the SDP peers opposed the party's merger with the Liberal Party in 1988. She led them into the continuing Social Democratic Party and served as its leader in the Lords. When that party dissolved in 1990, she became a crossbencher.

He served as the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Helena in the state of Montana from 1933–1935, and as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport in the state of Iowa from 1944–1966. Between those two appointments, he served as the rector of the Pontifical North American College from 1935–1944. Biography=Early life and Ministry= Hayes was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Patrick Nagle and Mary Jane (O’Donnell) Hayes. He received his high school and college education at Holy Ghost College (now Duquesne University). He played on the school football, basketball, and baseball teams while in college, and in the summer on a semi-pro baseball team. He studied for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College and the University of the Congregation of Propagation of the Faith in Rome. He was ordained a priest there by Cardinal Pietro Respighi for the Diocese of Pittsburgh on September 19, 1909. He initially served in a parish before he was appointed to the diocesan mission band where he eventually served as its director. From 1917–1925 he was superintendent of schools for the Pittsburgh Diocese. He then spent seven years as pastor of St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Pittsburgh doing what he called ‘’real priest’s work.” =Bishop of Helena= On June 23, 1933, Pope Pius XI appointed Hayes as the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Helena and he was consecrated bishop on September 21, 1933 by Bishop Hugh Boyle of Pittsburgh. The principal co- consecrators were Bishops James Griffin of Springfield in Illinois and Alphonse Smith of Nashville. Both co-consecrators were classmates of his in Rome. He served the diocese as its bishop for two years. =North American College= On October 26, 1935, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Hieropolis and rector of the Pontifical North American College. With the onset of World War II Pope Pius XII chose to temporarily close the national seminaries and Hayes returned to Pittsburgh. While in Pittsburgh, Hayes continued to look after the financial and other business matters relating to the college. He also assisted Bishop Boyle in his episcopal responsibilities. =Bishop of Davenport= On November 16, 1944 Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Hayes as fifth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport. He was installed in Sacred Heart Cathedral on January 11, 1945. Pius XII also appointed him Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on April 30, 1958. During his 22 years in Davenport, there was an expansion to school facilities across the diocese. Muscatine Central Catholic High School (now closed) in Muscatine (1953), Notre Dame High School in Burlington (1957), Regina High School in Iowa City (1958), Assumption High School in Davenport (1958), Aquinas High School (now Holy Trinity) in Fort Madison (1959), Walsh High School (now closed) in Ottumwa (1960), and Cardinal Stritch High School (now closed) in Keokuk (1965) were all established. Many of these communities had been served by parish high schools, while Davenport's new high school was a merger of St. Ambrose and Immaculate Conception academies. New buildings were also added at St. Ambrose, Marycrest and Mt. St. Claire Colleges. The four bishops of Iowa built Mt. St. Bernard’s Seminary in Dubuque. Hayes Hall (left) and Christ the King Chapel at St. Ambrose University. The chapel was built when Hayes was bishop. Enrollment in the Catholic Schools reached their highest enrollments during Bishop Hayes’ episcopate. Elementary school enrollment reached its highest mark in 1960 at 12,074. The high schools reached their highest mark in 1965 with 4,129 students. The church’s social teachings was a theme that ran throughout Bishop Hayes’ episcopacy. A four-day conference sponsored by the National Catholic Welfare Council was held in Davenport in 1949. It focused on the themes of industry, education and rural life. From 1954–1956 Bishop Hayes served as the president of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference. Their national convention was held in Davenport, Iowa in 1956. The Papal Volunteers of Latin America were established in the diocese in February 1961 in response to a plea from Pope John XXIII. Rev. Luis Colonnese, who would later become Director of the Latin American Bureau of the United States Catholic Conference, was put in charge. Fundraising was led by the Knights of Columbus, and Johnny Lujack, who was responsible for a special gift drive. For the most part, missionaries from the diocese went to Cuernavaca, Mexico or to Ponce, Puerto Rico. The Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award was created by the Davenport Catholic Interracial Council in 1964 in commemoration of the 1963 encyclical Pacem in terris by Pope John. Bishop Hayes attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. He was the oldest bishop from the United States at the council. The Catholic Messenger published the decrees of the council in their entirety in the paper. Liturgical renewal was already underway in the diocese under the direction of the Rev. Cletus Madsen. In the 1950s he had been working on reforming liturgical music in the diocese by advocating the replacement of the more sentimental devotional music with liturgical music and participation by the laity. He also advocated teaching children Gregorian Chant so as to lead the congregation in singing. =Later life and Death= On his 82nd birthday, September 21, 1966, Bishop Hayes submitted his resignation to the Holy See in compliance with the Vatican II decree Christus Dominus. His resignation was the first such resignation accepted by Pope Paul VI. On October 20, 1966, he was named Titular Bishop of Naraggara and Bishop Emeritus of Davenport. He retired to the Kahl Home. He died there in 1970 at the age of 85. Following his funeral in Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bishop Hayes was laid to rest in the Bishop's Circle of Mt. Calvary Cemetery.

He participated in talent shows, including a loss to future- actor/comedian Frank Gorshin. He enlisted in the United States Air Force after completing high school and served for four years, where his duties included serving as a security officer for the king and queen of Thailand. After completing his military service, he worked at the Pittsburgh International Airport as head of the facility's fire department. He later worked as a civilian contractor for the Air Force as a disaster preparedness officer, where he developed plans to deal with chemical, biological, and nuclear warfare.Balingit, Moriah. \\"Obituary: Clayton Hill / Played a lead zombie in 'Dawn of the Dead', Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 27, 2009.

As a means to deal with on-the-job stress, his wife Sharon Ceccatti, an actress, convinced him to participate in acting classes at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, which he started in the early 1970s. While they were performing in operettas, he and his wife were approached about a director who was casting a horror film. Despite their unfamiliarity with zombies, they were hired to play the \\"lead zombies\\" in a film being directed by George Romero. A crew member described Hill's acting as making him \\"one of the most convincing zombies of the bunch\\", citing his skill at maintaining his stiff pose and rolling his eyes back into his head, including heading down the wrong way in an escalator while in character. He was also given responsibility for overseeing the use of weapons on the set. In other films, Hill played such roles as a bum in a bar, a detective, a priest and was an announcer at a basketball game together with Marv Albert. He played a security guard in the 1979 film The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh which also starred Julius Erving, a bailiff in the 1980 move Death Penalty, Kilroy in the 1985 film Rappin' with Mario Van Peebles and the priest in the 1992 horror film Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth.

He played college football at Syracuse. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round of the 2010 NFL Draft and won Super Bowl XLVII with them. Jones has also played for the Indianapolis Colts and Washington Redskins. He is also the older brother of former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones, and defensive end Chandler Jones of the Arizona Cardinals. Early years Jones was born in Rochester, New York to parents Arthur Jr. and Camille Jones. After moving to Samoa, Jones attended Union–Endicott High School. At Union–Endicott he played both football and wrestled. As a senior, he had 64 tackles, six sacks, and one fumble recovery to help lead Union–Endicott to a Section IV championship. Following that championship season, Jones was ranked as the 18th best prospect in New York by SuperPrep. Considered only a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jones was not ranked among the nation's best defensive tackle prospects. He chose Syracuse over Pittsburgh and Rutgers. College career In 2005, as a true freshman, Jones was redshirted. In a 34–14 win over Miami (Ohio), Jones sacked their quarterback, Daniel Raudabaugh, for a loss of seven yards. On November 11, 2006, in a game at Raymond James Stadium home of the South Florida Bulls, Jones recovered the first fumble of his collegiate career. In the same game he recorded a career-high five tackles. After playing in every game, Jones had 15 tackles (including sacks) and one fumble recovery. Against Illinois, after Jones made a tackle on third down, Post-Standard blogger and local radio host Brent Axe wrote, \\"Arthur Jones is having the game of his life right now.\\" As of October 21, 2007, Jones had five tackles for a loss. As of November 2, Jones had 14.5 tackles after the ball carrier crossed the line of scrimmage. In the beginning of the second half against South Florida on November 11, Jones injured his ankle on a chop block. On November 17, Jones was held out of the game against Connecticut and according to coach Greg Robinson the decision came because, \\"Arthur has been too good of a football player for us to risk putting him out there and really getting him hurt.\\" For the season, he played in every game but the Connecticut game and was named Second-team All-Big East. His season high in tackles came against Iowa when he had nine. On September 10, 2008, against Penn State, Jones had one sack and three tackles for a loss. After one month, Jones had four sacks to be one of the leaders for the Orange. After the 2008 season, Jones was named to the First-team All-Big East Conference and was an All- America candidate. Jones was one of only 10 players on the team to start every game. His season high in tackles came against Rutgers when he had eight. Following Syracuse's upset win over Notre Dame he was named Big East Defensive Player of the Week and was also awarded an ESPN Helmet Sticker for his performance. He ranks sixth on the Orange career record list for tackles for loss. In 2009, Jones missed three games, playing in nine and made 19 tackles (7 for losses) and 1.5 sacks and recovered 2 fumbles and was named First-team All-Big East for the second consecutive season. Professional career=Pre-draft= He was considered as one of the top senior defensive tackles for the 2010 NFL Draft. =Baltimore Ravens= Jones was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round (157th overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a three-year deal on June 21, 2010.. During his rookie season in 2010, Jones played 2 games without recording a single stat. Jones saw an increased role in the 2011 season by playing 14 games with one start, making 20 tackles. During the 2012 season, Jones had 4.5 sacks in the regular season. The Ravens advanced to Super Bowl XLVII for the second time in franchise history against the San Francisco 49ers. In that game, Jones registered a fumble recovery as well as a key sack on 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The Ravens ended up winning the game 34-31, earning Jones his first Super Bowl Ring. In 2013, Jones played 14 games (started 13) with 4 sacks on 53 tackles. =Indianapolis Colts= Jones with the Colts in 2014 On March 11, 2014, Jones signed a 5-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts, worth more than $30 million. During his first season with the Colts in 2014, Jones played 9 games (started 3) with 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble on 34 tackles. On September 5, 2015, Jones was placed on injured reserve for an ankle injury. Jones was suspended the first four games of the 2016 season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. After returning from his suspension, Jones started all eight games he appeared in and tallied 30 tackles before being placed on injured reserve on December 19, 2016, with a groin injury. On March 24, 2017, Jones was released by the Colts. =Washington Redskins= On November 1, 2017, Jones signed with the Washington Redskins. He was placed on injured reserve on November 11, 2017, with a dislocated shoulder. =Retirement= After the 2017 season ended, Jones announced his retirement via Instagram. Personal life Jones earned his degree in communication and rhetorical studies. His brother is mixed martial artist Jon Jones, who is the current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, who is considered by some to be one of the best mixed martial artists of all time. His youngest brother Chandler is an outside linebacker for the Arizona Cardinals who previously played defensive end for the New England Patriots. Their teams played one another for the first time when the Ravens played the Patriots in Week 3 of the 2012 NFL season, and again in the 2012 AFC Championship Game, Arthur winning both games.

It is part of the Klamath River drainage basin. It flows generally northwest from its source in the Klamath Mountains, through Humboldt and Trinity Counties, to join the Trinity near Salyer. The main tributaries are Hayfork Creek and the East Branch South Fork Trinity River. The river has no major dams or diversions, and is designated Wild and Scenic for its entire length. One of the largest undammed river systems in California, the South Fork drains a rugged, remote watershed of . The large areas of intact habitat are important for several endangered species and rare plants. Historically, the South Fork watershed was known for its prodigious anadromous fish population and dense old-growth forests. During the mid-20th century, the river channel was heavily damaged by major flooding, which was exacerbated by erosion caused by mining, logging and ranching. Decades later the South Fork is still considered in the process of recovery. Course The South Fork Trinity River begins as a small spring on the west slope of the Brooks Ridge near North Yolla Bolly Mountain, above sea level. From there, it flows briefly west and turns to the north, receiving numerous small tributaries which drain a series of steep, forested valleys in the headwaters. At about from its source, the river is crossed by the Humboldt Trail, then it receives north-flowing Shell Mountain Creek from the west. Shortly downstream, the long East Branch South Fork Trinity River joins from the east. Shortly afterwards, it receives Happy Camp Creek from the west and Smoky Creek from the east. Below here the river passes Forest Glen, receives Rattlesnake Creek from the east, and crosses underneath California State Route 36. Here the river runs roughly parallel to the Mad River, separated by a divide to the west. Below State Route 36, it receives Butter and Indian Valley Creeks, both from the east. The river then enters the wide Hyampom Valley, where it passes the town of Hyampom and receives its biggest tributary, Hayfork Creek, from the east. It then passes the Hyampom Airport and receives Pelletreau Creek from the west. Within the valley the river briefly exhibits braided characteristics, with a wide floodplain. At the north end of the valley the river enters another canyon, receiving Mingo Creek from the west, then veers sharply eastward and then turns sharply north again. The river receives Madden Creek from the west and crosses underneath California State Route 299. Directly below the bridge, the South Fork flows north into the Trinity River. = Crossings = There are crossings of the river between it's headwaters and the mouth. They are listed from top to bottom here, with coordinates, river mileages, and elevation listed if available.

Geology Over hundreds of millions of years, the westward movement of North America caused it to accrete many terranes from the Pacific Ocean region along its west coast. Four major terranes have so far collided with the northwest coast of California—the oldest dating to pre-Jurassic times—crumpling the crust upwards into the -high massif of the Klamath Mountains. Most of the Klamath Mountains consist of granite and batholiths underlie most of the major peaks. The second most recent of the terranes—dating to the Cretaceous—which is composed almost entirely of granite, brought with it a strip of mica that roughly aligns with the present course of the South Fork Trinity River. The mica caused the granite to become weaker than the surrounding rock, so this area was subjected to greater erosion that created the valley of the South Fork, the lower Trinity River, and the lower Klamath River. This is also why the Klamath and Trinity rivers have this sharp northwest bend on their generally southwest courses, and the South Fork Trinity River valley is the southernmost extension of the roughly -long gorge formed by this abundance of mica. The vast majority of the South Fork watershed is mountains, with the only level land found in the Hyampom Valley at the confluence of the river and Hayfork Creek, along the Hayfork valley, and along narrow river terraces. There are large parts of the watershed where the ground is composed of stable bedrock, while large portions of hillsides are composed of loose soil and rock. Historically, riverbeds in the watershed were narrow and rocky, but due to vast amounts of silt washed down by poor logging practices, streambeds have become wide, braided, elevated and shallow. Watershed The river and its tributaries drain in Trinity County in the south and Humboldt County and Trinity County in the north and comprising 34 percent of the Trinity River watershed. The Hayfork Creek sub- watershed contains , or 38 percent of the entire South Fork Trinity watershed. Most of the watershed lies on public lands (79 percent), while for Hayfork Creek, 78 percent of its watershed lies on public lands. With the Yolla Bolly Mountains in the south and the Klamath Mountains in the north, the topography of the South Fork Trinity's watershed is dissected by deep gorges and valleys separated by narrow ridges. The South Fork is the longest undammed National Wild and Scenic River in California. (The Eel River, also a Wild and Scenic River, is over twice as long, but is dammed near its headwaters. The Smith River drains a greater area but is much shorter.) While along the length of the South Fork itself there is little human development, it receives agricultural pollutants from Hayfork Creek, whose valley contains over of ranchlands and farmlands. In fact, there have been sightings of frequent fish kills in Hayfork Creek and it is said to have \\"severe water quality problems in the summer\\". Diversions off Hayfork Creek have only furthered the pollution problem by concentrating it. Logging and road-building are the two primary negative factors affecting the South Fork mainstem. Clearing hillsides has accelerated erosion, clouding the water and causing difficulties for steelhead trout and chinook salmon, which once spawned in the river in prodigious numbers. Although logging has mostly ceased since the designation of the national forest, the landscape has not yet fully recovered from its impacts. Much of the South Fork Trinity River's watershed is the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, which covers most of the mountainous areas in the southern and central part of the watershed, and the Six Rivers National Forest, which covers most of the northern third of the basin. Nearly the entire length of the South Fork above the Hayfork Creek confluence is inside the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, while below the confluence, national forest lands peter out into privately owned land and the river then enters Six Rivers National Forest. Most of the upper and lower Hayfork Creek reaches also are in the Shasta-Trinity forest, while a large amount of private land surrounds its middle reach in Hayfork Valley and the town of Hayfork. Throughout nearly the entire watershed, there are sporadic patches of private lands and Bureau of Land Management-owned lands. =Streamflow= The river flows into the Trinity River northwest of Salyer. The United States Geological Survey monitors the South Fork Trinity River's flow at four gauges; these are at Salyer, downstream of Hyampom, at Hyampom upstream of the Hayfork Creek confluence, and Forest Glen (from mouth to source). The average flow of the river at its mouth is . For Salyer, closest to the mouth, the highest peak flow was on December 22 in the 1964 flood, while the lowest was on 31 December 1954. For the location downstream of Hyampom, the highest recorded peak flow was on 22 December 1964, while the lowest was . For the location at Hyampom, the highest peak was on 22 December 1964, while the lowest was on 13 February 1962. For Forest Glen, the largest peak was on 22 December 1964, and the lowest was on 13 February 1962. History For what may have been hundreds of years, the South Fork Trinity River had a rich history of Native Americans. The river annually produced enormous salmon runs, one of the richest sub-basins in the Trinity watershed, and virgin old-growth forests covered most of the watershed. In the 19th century, many events the largest of which was the California Gold Rush spurred Europeans, Americans and others to flood the region in search of furs, and later gold. One particular trail crossed through the Yolla Bolly Mountains, then wound down to Hayfork Creek and west to the South Fork Trinity. In the 1930s, hydraulic mining was already taking place at the Swanson Mine near the mouth of the river. Beginning in the late 1940s, logging companies moved into the South Fork Trinity's watershed. It was said that the \\"big logging started when Pat Veneer came in\\", referring to a logging company from Oregon. It was not long before debris and silt began to cloud the creeks feeding the South Fork, many of which were still located on United States Forest Service land. In the Christmas flood of 1964, heavy rains washed enormous amounts of silt and debris from clear-cut lands into the river, and killing entire fish and amphibian populations. The flood peaked on 22 December at .USGS streamflow data for four stream gauges along the South Fork It was said that the \\"South Fork is a lost cause, a 'dead river' which will never recover from the devastation of the 1964 storms.\\" Even decades after the flooding, erosion rates in the watershed remain much higher than the pre-1964 average. By the 1970s, anadromous fish populations saw a significant decline as a direct result of siltation. In 1947, Six Rivers National Forest, which encompasses most of the northernmost quarter of the South Fork Trinity's watershed, was established. By 1954, the Shasta–Trinity National Forest, which covers the vast majority of the South Fork Trinity River's watershed, was established, bringing nearly 70 percent of the South Fork watershed under federal protection. In 1980, the United States Forest Service designated the South Fork National Recreation Trail, which runs from Forest Glen to near its headwaters. Fish and wildlife In 1964 before the floods, the spring chinook salmon run was estimated to be as large as 10,000 and with a minimum of 3,400, which declined to an annual run of between 345 and 2,460 prior to 1990. Due to the gradual recovery of the mountainsides after logging, salmon runs have once again begun to return, averaging 2,000 to 4,000. Although the water from the South Fork continues down the Trinity to the Klamath and eventually, the Pacific Ocean, undammed, the diversion of most of the Trinity main stem's water and pollution in the Klamath have made access to the river difficult for migrating fish. It is of note that part of the reason of the declined population is a high mortality rate of female salmon, resulting in less offspring.

Online version accessed on 2009-07-08. In 1844 Heller established a laboratory of pathological chemistry in Vienna's General Hospital, but his appointment as head of the lab was delayed until 1855 because some of the faculty thought that the position should be occupied by a medical doctor. During that period he studied the chemistry of urine, and he developed the well-known Heller's ring test for albumin in the urine (1852). He also identified a fatty substance that he called urostealith, a constituent of certain bladder stones, and developed a treatment based on solutions of sodium carbonate, which were found to dissolve the substance in vitro (1845). Also in 1844, Heller took over editorship of the recently founded Archiv für Physiologische und Pathologische Chemie und Mikroskopie, the first journal to deal exclusively with pathological chemistry; which stopped publication after six volumes, for lack of articles. The Austrian Association for Clinical Chemistry (ÖGKC) awards a scientific prize named after him. An Austrian stamp was issued September 4, 1981 with his portrait on the face.

Creation and composition Gocol was a truck- borne flying column created in early June 1941, to pursue and capture Dr. Fritz Grobba, the German Ambassador to the Kingdom of Iraq. Grobba went on the run after the collapse of the pro-German Rashid Ali government, to flee Iraq and get to Nazi occupied Europe. Two other columns were created in early July, Mercol, commanded by Major E. J. H. Merry, to round up irregular troops under Fawzi al-Qawuqji and Harcol, under Major R. J. Hardy, with the task of securing Kirkuk. Gocol was named after its commander, Major R. E. S. Gooch and comprised B Squadron of the Household Cavalry Regiment, six Royal Air Force armoured cars, two 3.7 inch mountain howitzers and Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) transport. Operations On 3 June 1941, travelling from Habbaniya by road, Gocol reached Mosul but Dr. Grobba had gone. On the same day, two companies of the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles arrived by air from Habbaniya with a detachment of the RAF. The remainder of the 2nd Battalion reached Mosul by air next day. In addition to Gocol and the air lifted forces, the 1st Battalion of the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) left Baghdad on 2 June and arrived in Mosul by road on 3 June. Gocol drove west from Mosul and illegally entered Vichy French territory just prior to the commencement of the Syria–Lebanon Campaign, which started in the early hours of 8 June. During the week following 7 June, Gocol made every effort to capture Grobba. The column entered Qamishli in Syria fully expecting to capture him there but Grobba had again left in time. In the end, Grobba escaped, Gocol having been a failure.

He is recognized for his research on social neuroscience, cognitive dissonance, and the motivating aspects of emotions.Professional Profile: Eddie Harmon-Jones. Beginning in the late 1990s, Harmon-Jones and his colleagues began a series of studies examining whether affective valence (positive vs. negative affect) or motivational direction (approach vs. withdrawal) best explained the relationship between properties of emotions and left vs. right prefrontal cortical activation. Prior to this work, most researchers thought the left prefrontal cortex was involved in the expression and experience of positive emotions, whereas the right prefrontal cortex was involved in the expression and experience of negative emotions. However, the past research had confounded positivity with approach motivation (and negativity with withdrawal motivation), so that all tests examined positive emotions associated with approach motivation inclinations (joy that urges one to move toward the source of the joy). By investigating anger, a negative emotion that urges approach motivation, Harmon-Jones and colleagues were able to tease apart the valence from motivational direction views. They found that anger caused greater relative left frontal cortical activity, and thus posited that asymmetrical frontal cortical activity was due to motivational direction rather than affective valence.New York Times article describing the anger research Harmon- Jones' research has been covered in national news on several occasions.

From the mid-1990s, 150 were exported to New Zealand and after being rebuilt, refurbished and re- gauged, entered service with a variety of operators on New Zealand's railway network. The carriages generally replaced older NZR 56-foot carriages, some of which had been in use for almost 70 years. History=In Britain= Mark 2 TSO M6046 in April 2012 in original British Rail livery The British Rail Mark 2 was the second design of carriage by British Rail (BR). The first was built in 1963. Between 1964 and 1975, 1,876 Mark 2 carriages were constructed at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. There were seven sub-classes, 2 & 2A to 2F. The Mark 2D to 2F classes, built from 1971 onwards, had air conditioning and could be distinguished from earlier sub-classes by having sheet glass windows. All of the carriages imported into New Zealand were from these latter three sub- classes. When introduced they were used on all mainline services in Great Britain. They were superseded by British Rail Mark 3 carriages. = In New Zealand = Because of construction constraints, most railway lines in New Zealand have a limited loading gauge. Great Britain uses , but its loading gauge is only slightly larger than New Zealand's Cape gauge. This means that British Rail rolling stock like the Mark 2 carriage can run on most New Zealand lines after gauge conversion. To fit the New Zealand loading gauge, the Mark 2s were lowered on their new bogies by 25 centimetres.Intelligence Railway Gazette International December 1996 page 786 New Zealand rail operator Tranz Rail and heritage operator Mainline Steam Heritage Trust bought 69 Mark 2 carriages (one damaged by fire after arrival) in 1996. Eight were extensively refurbished for the Wellington–Palmerston North Capital Connection, classified S (for Scenic), with new Japanese bogies and new auto plug doors and interiors. The refurbishment proved more costly than expected, and the remaining carriages were laid up until a rebuilding programme began for the Auckland Regional Transport Authority for Auckland suburban trains. Classified SA/SD, these have two sets of sliding doors each side and are operated by Transdev Auckland for Auckland Transport in push-pull mode, with DC (four-car sets) or DFT (six-car sets) locomotives leased from KiwiRail. The SD carriages include a driver's cab and operate in a similar manner to DBSOs in the UK. In the southern autumn of 2006, Mark 2E and 2F carriages formerly operated by One were imported into New Zealand. They were bought by Greater Wellington Regional Council for operation by Tranz Metro on the Metlink Wairarapa Connection between Wellington and Masterton and were rebuilt at Hillside Workshops in Dunedin, classified SW, SWG and SWS. Six more were bought by Greater Wellington Regional Council for trains between Wellington, Upper Hutt and Plimmerton, top-and-tailed by EO electric locomotives. These were refurbished by Hillside Workshops and classified SE, SEG and SES. In late 2009, all S, SE and SW carriages were required to be modified so that their pneumatically-operated interior doors open automatically if the compressed air supply is lost. This was identified as an issue after the locomotive on a Wairarapa Connection train derailed when it hit a landslide on 23 July 2009, resulting in the locomotive having to be shut down and cutting the compressed air supply to the SW carriages in the process. The doors stuck in position, and three people were required to open them manually, sparking safety concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire. = Capital Connection = The eight S (Scenic) carriages operate on KiwiRail's Capital Connection service between Wellington and Palmerston North, each seating 60 (except the servery car, S 3200, which seats 31) in both alcove and airline-style arrangements. These were the first Mark 2 rebuilds, and they retain the original window configuration and curved Corten-steel vestibule ends. Seven cars, accompanied by refurbished baggage/generator carriage AG 130, were provided in 1998. An eighth car was added in 1999. They are in the Capital Connection livery of light and dark blue, having originally been in Tranz Rail 'Cato Blue' with grey roofs and black underfloor equipment. = Wellington suburban = The SW (Suburban Wairarapa) type is owned by the Greater Wellington Regional Council, leased to Transdev Wellington to operate on Metlink's Wairarapa Connection between Wellington and Masterton. There are 12 SW, three SWS and three SWG carriages in three sets, of three to eight cars depending on the service, with the consist made up of an SWG, an SW, an SWS, and then the remaining SW cars. Some trains have luggage/generator van AG 222 to supplement or replace the SWG. SW carriages have 64 seats in both alcove and airline-style arrangements with a single toilet at the north end (next to the A2 door), automatic doors and a public address system. SWS carriages have 37 seats (31 plus six that can be folded away to fit up to four wheelchairs), with a space for a servery (not used), a wheelchair hoist on each side, an audio induction loop system, and an accessible toilet. SWG carriages have 37 seats, a luggage compartment and a diesel generator to power the carriages. They are in Metlink livery. The interior of an SE carriage, formerly used on Metlink peak services in Wellington. The SE (Suburban Express) type is similar to the SW, owned by the Greater Wellington Regional Council. They were brought into service as part of a number of temporary measures to increase capacity until arrival of the FP/FT class \\"Matangi\\" units in 2010–2012, with the intent that they may be eventually transferred to the Wairarapa Connection service. They were operated as a single consist by Tranz Metro on peak express services top-and-tailed by EO class electric locomotives. There are four SE, one SES and one SEG carriages, which received a less thorough rebuild than the SWs and retain their BR airline-style seating. The SES is accessible like SWS carriages but lacks the servery. In November 2011, they were taken out of service due to frequent faults of the run-down electric locomotives pulling them and the availability of sufficient Matangi units to replace them. In December 2012, it was announced that they would be reintroduced on the Wairarapa Connection to alleviate capacity issue and rolling stock constraints. After minor modifications, the SE carriages would be introduced on the Wairarapa line in July 2013. They were criticised by train users for their smaller seat pitch, poor lighting, and lack of tray tables and power outlets. This led Greater Wellington to make additional modifications to the carriages over Christmas 2013 by installing a number of tables and removing a row of seating to increase space between the seats. They are in the Metlink livery of dark blue and grey, with lime green highlights. = Auckland suburban (retired) = Over 30 SA and SD coaches remained at Taumarunui at the end of 2019 SA (Suburban Auckland) Auckland Transport carriages were operated by Transdev Auckland in sets of three to five cars, with an SD car (see below) and a DC (four- and five-car total) or DFT/DFB (six-car total) diesel-electric locomotive in push-pull configuration. They have electronic double doors and have two types of bogie: re-used from 56-foot carriages, and new with air- cushion secondary suspension, nicknamed S-Ride bogies. They were in the MAXX livery of blue and grey. Diesel-hauled services were phased out starting in 2014 and entirely September 2015 replaced by AM class EMUs, then placed into storage in Taumarunui and sold into other uses. The original push-pull train concept was initiated by Tranz Rail, and construction of the push-pull sets began in 2003 at Dunedin's the Hillside Workshops. The carriages were classified as SA and SD driving trailers. 104 carriages were converted. They were operated by Veolia Transport Auckland for Auckland Transport, branded with MAXX and powered by DC class locomotives classified DC or DCP and driven by Toll Rail and later KiwiRail locomotive engineers. Auckland's SA set operations ceased in September 2015 after the electrification of the Auckland network. The 104 surplus SA/SD carriages were relocated to Taumarunui where unsuccessful attempts to sell them overseas fell through. The 24 SD (Suburban Driving) Auckland Transport carriages have a driving cab to allow push-pull SA/SD trains, similar to British Rail Mark 2 Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO) carriages, and diesel generators to power the carriages. Besides the two different bogie types (x28020 and S-Ride), the SD fleet does not vary by much. However, SD 5624 and SD 5762, both being x28020 type vehicles, are fitted with park brake controls as their sets contain S-Ride type cars fitted with park brakes. Both of those SDs retain a conventional ratchet type handbrake. SD 5794 was fitted for several years with European Train Control System (ETCS) equipment, to test the system prior to full-scale introduction on board the AM class EMU. As at August 2014, this ETCS equipment has been removed, and the cab instruments reverted to the standard layout, and ETP installed. All SDs are now fitted with Electronic Train Protection (ETP) equipment. Retired from AT service September 2015, placed into storage, then sold for other uses. , the disposition of on-sold SA/SDs from Auckland Transport are: * KiwiRail 39 carriages * Antipodean Explorer – 31 cars (28 SAs and 3 SDs) * Mainline Steam Heritage Trust – 4 SDs (3 bodies onsold per below) * Steam Incorporated – 2 SDs * Octagonal Capital – 26 cars (under conditional sale) * Balance of two SD driving carriages remaining. Three SD bodies were onsold by Mainline Steam for private use, minus bogies and generators, and are located at C&R; Developments Ltd – a mining vehicle contractor and builder in Hannon Road, Hautapu, Cambridge in the North Island of New Zealand. = Te Huia Hamilton to Auckland commuter service = The new 80-minute Te Huia passenger service from Hamilton to Papakura, Auckland will commence in 2021 (probably February); having been delayed from 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, late delivery of bogies, and an urgent and unexpected track replacement programme in Auckland. There are to be two return services on weekdays and one return service Saturdays. Each train will carry 150 passengers from Hamilton to Papakura twice in the morning from 05:30–07:00 weekdays, stopping at Rotokauri and Huntly along the way. The service will take 91 minutes, including stoppage times at stations along the route. The disposition of the eleven overhauled carriages are 5 x SR, 3 x SRC and 3 x SRV, plus two un- overhauled Auckland SA carriages held in reserve; namely carriages SR 5847, SR 6061, SRC 5889 and SRV5893. There are to be two trains made up of four carriages each, having capacity for 150 passengers. Carriages will be equipped with Wifi, air conditioning, heating, USB points, a cafe bar and toilets. The fare was to have been $12.20 one way from Hamilton to Papakura. Trains will set off at Frankton, stopping at the new Rotokauri Transport Hub and Huntly station, before reaching Papakura. They will be operated by KiwiRail on behalf of the Waikato Regional Council The three refurbished SDs and seven SAs have been overhauled by KiwiRail in the Hutt Railway Workshops. They will be hauled by DFT locomotives. SR (Suburban Regional) are former Auckland SA carriages. SRC (Suburban Regional Catering) are former Auckland SA carriages, now with a cafe, servery and wheelchair hoist and wheelchair help points. SRV (Suburban Regional Vehicle) driving carriages with generator sets, which are former Auckland SD driving carriages. =Antipodean Explorer= During 2018, 31 SA and SD class formerly used in Auckland sets were purchased by the Antipodean Explorer company and transported from storage in Taumarunui to Dunedin by KiwiRail for refurbishment into a luxury train at the former Hillside Railway Workshops. Initially, 16 carriages arrived in early April 2018, with the balance to follow. Three SD carriages have been purchased for conversion to observation carriages with the SA as sleepers, restaurant, lounge, baggage and crew carriages. Antipodean Explorer has financial backing from Chinese company Fu Wah. The train is planned to be in service in 2020.. The project was placed on hold in June 2020. =KiwiRail overhauls= During early 2018, six former Auckland SA carriages were relocated by KiwiRail from Taumarunui to the Hutt Workshops in Wellington, three of which are for overhaul as additional luggage vans to be classified AKS for KiwiRail including the Northern Explorer, Coastal Pacific and TranzAlpine. eight of the remaining carriages will be converted into a brand new SR class for KiwiRail on the Auckland-Hamilton service, Te Huia. there are expected to be two trains running the route with four carriages and a 147-passenger capacity. In March 2018 two SA carriages were overhauled and converted into luggage vans for KiwiRail. This was later revised to three SA carriage conversions into AKS luggage vans of six SA carriages moved to Hutt Workshops. The first of the new AKS luggage vans was photographed in the Great Journeys of New Zealand livery on the Hutt Workshops traverser and is fitted with a crew compartment, improved catering provision storage, recycling storage facilities, luggage and cycle racks. AKS 5658 and 5926 are ready for service after trials in late 2019 and early 2020. AKS 5658 is waiting for new bogies.  Mainline Steam Heritage Trust  In 1996, Mainline Steam Heritage Trust (MLST) principal Ian Welch bought 15 former Anglia Railways Mark 2 coaches with the intention of rebuilding them for MLST excursions. Seven cars were unloaded at the Port of Lyttelton for MLST's Christchurch depot at Middleton, the other eight at the Port of Auckland for MLST Auckland at the former Parnell Diesel Depot. This move was initiated by concerns that Tranz Rail would no longer be able to offer carriages from its charter fleet, made up of the 56-foot carriages. Rather than fitting them with x-28020 high-speed bogies from scrapped FM guards' vans, they were to be fitted with x-27750 Kinki bogies from scrapped FS steam-heating vans built in the late 1960s. However, in 1997 Tranz Rail advised that the charter fleet would be available in future and Welch sold them to Tranz Rail, which moved them into storage at Hutt Workshops by the end of that year. In 2007, the situation had changed with rail operator Toll Rail having moved the Auckland charter fleet carriages south to Wellington to replace more 56-foot carriages, which were being withdrawn so that their x-28020 bogies could be fitted to the SW cars being rebuilt at Hillside Workshops in Dunedin. With very few options available, Welch purchased ex Virgin Trains West Coast Mark 2F FO 3433 and TSOs 5915/5939/6419, arriving later that year at the Port of Auckland. They were trucked to the group's Wellington base, adjacent to Plimmerton railway station. In 2008, Welch purchased four ex Virgin and five ex-Gatwick Express coaches from Angel Trains and Porterbrook, arriving at the port of Auckland in 2008 and trucked to Hutt Workshops for storage. This brought the total to 13 coaches, nine of which were in storage at Hutt. The Virgin cars – Mark 2E FO 3299/3393, Mark 2F TSO 5914/5988 – were stored until MLST had space at Plimmerton, which was becoming increasingly pressured for secure storage space. The Gatwick Mark 2F cars were: Class 488/2 set 488209: TFOH 72508 (ex FO 3409), TSOH 72644 (ex TSO 6039) Class 488/3 set 488313: TSOLH 72624 (ex TSO 5972), TSOLH 72625 (ex TSO 6085), TSOL 72172 (ex TSO 6091). In 2009, rebuilding began with TSO 5939 as the template, 5915, 6149 and 3433 following in order. In 2011 FO 3299/3409 and TSO 5914/5988 were trucked to Plimmerton for rebuilding. As of 2012, work had begun on rebuilding 5914. The work involves the following: * Removing the battery boxes and generator and replacement with connectors for head-end power, to be supplied from a 240kVa generator in rebuilt luggage/viewing van FM 3010 * Replacement of brake components with a mixture of new and refurbished equipment * Fitting a retention toilet at one end (the cars had the straight-discharge toilets, which are no longer acceptable) * Refurbished interiors including a public address system and renewed electrical wiring * Fitting x-27750 Kinki bogies ex-FS steam-heat vans, of monocoque construction. Originally they were used without being altered, but they have now been rebuilt with new bogie bolsters welded in to replace the original castings. Other cars may be fitted with x-28020 bogies ex-FM guards' vans, similar to many of the S/SA/SD/SW cars. They are painted Midnight Blue with a Pearl Grey roof (easier to clean than a white roof, as they will be steam-hauled) and a white window band. Four have been named after railway landmarks, famous sections of the line, and railway companies. Like the S class, they retain their original external appearance with curved Corten-steel ends (the SA/SD/SW/SE cars have flat ends). Five cars are still in open storage at Hutt: Mark 2E FO 3393, and Mark 2F TSO 5972/6039/6085/6091. They will be overhauled at a later date when time, space and funding allow. SD 5761 one of Ian Welch's original 15 Mark 2s from 1997 was purchased by Mainline Steam and arrived on 22 August 2018 at Plimmerton from storage in Taumarunui for conversion into an observation carriage for its Mark 2 rake of carriages.

It features 87 fully licensed cars, including cars from Ford, Chevrolet, and Ruf. The game lacks Xbox Live capabilities, and does not support custom soundtracks or high quality video.  Arcade mode  Group S Challenge features four styles in arcade mode: Single Player, Two Player Versus, One Make and Time Attack. Single Player allows the player to race against AI (artificial intelligence) drivers. In Two Player Versus, two players race on a split screen. One Make measures who possesses the best driving ability, with the player choosing one car for both his or her use and the use of all AI drivers. In Time Attack, the player focuses on trying to post the fastest lap-time.  Circuit mode  Group S Challenge also offers a career mode. Unlike many games featuring a career mode, Group S Challenge contains no cutscenes and lacks a developing story. Instead, the game offers three different racing types: Championship, Line and Dual. In Championship, the player races his or her car to unlock different classes of cars and earns money for upgrades or a new car. Championship has four different \\"classes\\" or \\"tiers\\", for cars, with higher tiers offering faster cars. Group C is the lowest tier containing the slowest car. Groups B and A contain progressively faster rides. Group S is the top class and it contains supercars and hypercars. (Note: A car from a slower group is allowed in a higher class race, but faster cars cannot enter a lower class race.) The player can earn money by driving in the racing line on the track during Line mode. Dual mode allows the player to unlock special cars that cannot be bought. In order to acquire these cars, the player must race and win against the car he or she wishes to unlock in three different cars that the player already owns.  Tracks  Three different race courses appear with six variations per course: Part A, Part B, Full Track, Part A Reverse, Part B Reverse, and Full Track Reverse. The three different race tracks are Monaco in Europe, Surfer's Paradise in Australia (found in Queensland, Australia), and Shibuya in Japan.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40. Many reviewers gave it positive to mixed reviews a few months before its U.S. release date.

In the 1930s, the Episcopate of the Catholic Church of Germany comprised 6 Archbishops and 19 bishops while German Catholics comprised around one third of the population of Germany served by 20,000 priests. In the lead up to the 1933 Nazi takeover, German Catholic leaders were outspoken in their criticism of Nazism. Following the Nazi takeover, the Catholic Church sought an accord with the Government, was pressured to conform, and faced persecution. The regime had flagrant disregard for the Reich concordat with the Holy See, and the episcopate had various disagreements with the Nazi government, but it never declared an official sanction of the various attempts to overthrow the Hitler regime. Ian Kershaw wrote that the churches \\"engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime, receiving the demonstrative backing of millions of churchgoers. Applause for Church leaders whenever they appeared in public, swollen attendances at events such as Corpus Christi Day processions, and packed church services were outward signs of the struggle of ... especially of the Catholic Church - against Nazi oppression\\". While the Church ultimately failed to protect its youth organisations and schools, it did have some successes in mobilizing public opinion to alter government policies. The German bishops initially hoped for a quid pro quo that would protect Catholic schools, organisations, publications and religious observance. While head of the Bishop's Conference Adolf Bertram persisted in a policy of avoiding confrontation on broader issues of human rights, the activities of Bishops such as Konrad von Preysing, Joseph Frings and Clemens August Graf von Galen came to form a coherent, systematic critique of many of the teachings of Nazism. Kershaw wrote that, while the \\"detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church\\", it did not preclude church leaders approving of areas of the regime's policies, particularly where Nazism \\"blended into 'mainstream' national aspirations\\"—like support for \\"patriotic\\" foreign policy or war aims, obedience to state authority (where this did not contravene divine law); and destruction of atheistic Marxism and Soviet Bolshevism - and traditional Christian anti-Judaism was \\"no bulwark\\" against Nazi biological antisemitism. Such protests as the bishops did make about the mistreatment of the Jews tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers, rather than explicit public pronouncements. From the outset, Pope Pius XI, had ordered the Papal Nuncio in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo, to \\"look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved\\" in the aid of Jews, but Orsenigo proved a poor instrument in this regard, concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics, than with taking action to help German Jews. By 1937, after four years of persecution, the church hierarchy, which had initially sought to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned and Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge anti-Nazi encyclical, which had been co-drafted by Cardinal Archbishop Michael von Faulhaber of Munich together, with Preysing and Galen and the Vatican Sectretary of State Cardinal Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII). The encyclical accused the Nazis of sowing \\"secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\". The German Bishops condemned the Nazi sterilization law. In 1941, Bishop Clemens von Galen led protests against the Nazi euthanasia programme. In 1941, a pastoral letter of the German Bishops proclaimed that \\"the existence of Christianity in Germany is at stake\\", and a 1942 letter accused the government of \\"unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church\\". At the close of the war, the resistor Joseph Frings, succeeded the appeaser Adolf Bertram as chairman of the Fulda Bishops' Conference, and, along with Galen and Preysing, was promoted to Cardinal by Pius XII. The Anschluss with Austria increased the number and percentage of Catholics within the Reich. A pattern of attempted co-operation, followed by repression was repeated. At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer, the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler's arrival in the city on 14 March 1938. However, wrote Mark Mazower, such gestures of accommodation were \\"not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globocnik\\". Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer's residence, after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. In the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany, the Church faced its most extreme persecution. But after the invasion, Nuncio Orsenigo in Berlin assumed the role of protector of the Church in the annexed regions, in conflict with his role of facilitating better relations with the German government, and his own fascistic sympathies. In 1939, five of the Polish bishops of the annexed Warthegau region were deported to concentration camps. In Greater Germany through the Nazi period, just one German Catholic bishop was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp, and just one other expelled from his diocese.

The Vatican too persisted in seeking to maintain a \\"legal modus vivendi\\" with the regime. Thus when Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen of Münster delivered his famous 1941 denunciations of Nazi euthanasia and the lawlessness of the Gestapo, he also said that the church had never sought the overthrow of the regime. Cardinal Bertram, head of the German Catholic Bishops Conference, \\"developed an ineffectual protest system\\" to satisfy the demands of other bishops, without annoying the regime. On 10 August 1940, the president of the Bishops Conference on the one hand begged Hitler to resist influences hostile to Christianity - but at the same time assured the Führer of his \\"loyalty to the state as it is\\". Only gradually did Catholic resistance from the hierarchy re-emerge, in the form of the efforts of individual clerics, including Cardinal Preysing of Berlin, Bishop Galen of Münster, and Bishop Grober of Freiberg. The regime responded with arrests, the withdrawal of teaching privileges, and the seizure of church publishing houses. Pastoral letters of 1942 and 1943 denounced government breaches of the Concordat and declared support for human rights and rule of law. Kershaw wrote that, while the \\"detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church\\", it did not preclude church leaders approving of areas of the regime's policies, particularly where Nazism \\"blended into 'mainstream' national aspirations\\" - like support for \\"patriotic\\" foreign policy or war aims, obedience to state authority (where this did not contravene divine law); and destruction of atheistic Marxism and Soviet Bolshevism. Traditional Christian anti-Judaism was \\"no bulwark\\" against Nazi biological antisemitism, wrote Kershaw, and on these issues \\"the churches as institutions felt on uncertain grounds\\". Opposition was generally left to fragmented and largely individual efforts. Yet from the early stages of Nazism, Nazi ideology and Catholic doctrine clashed - from Alfred Rosenberg's anti-Catholic stance in The Myth of the Twentieth Century, to the Nazi sterilization and euthanasia programs. The Nazis also moved early against the church's organisational interests - attacking Political Catholicism, Catholic schools and the Catholic press. Against these things, church leaders mounted vigorous defences. Bishop Konrad von Preysing was Bishop of Berlin, the capital city of Nazi Germany. He provided aid to the city's Jews and had links to the German Resistance. ;Preysing Bishop von Preysing was among the most firm and consistent bishops to oppose the Nazis. Preysing served as Bishop of Eichstatt from 1932 to 1935 and in 1935 was appointed as Bishop of Berlin - the capital of Nazi Germany. Preysing was loathed by Hitler, who said \\"the foulest of carrion are those who come clothed in the cloak of humility and the foulest of these Count Presying! What a beast!\\". He spoke out in public sermons and argued the case for firm opposition at bishops' conferences. Bishop von Preysing was one of the Catholic contacts of the Kreisau Circle of the German Resistance. His Advent Pastoral Letters of 1942 and 1943 on the nature of human rights reflected the anti-Nazi theology of the Barmen Declaration of the Confessing Church, leading one to be broadcast in German by the BBC. In 1944, Preysing met with and gave a blessing to Claus von Stauffenberg, in the lead up to the July Plot to assassinate Hitler, and spoke with the resistance leader on whether the need for radical change could justify tyrannicide. ; Galen The Bishop of Münster, Clemens August Graf von Galen was Preysing's cousin. In response to Nazi Ideologist Alfred RosenbergThe Myth of the Twentieth Century, Galen derided the neo-pagan theories of Rosenberg as perhaps no more than \\"an occasion for laughter in the educated world\\", but warned that \\"his immense importance lies in the acceptance of his basic notions as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education. Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood.\\" Often Galen directly protested to Hitler over violations of the Concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in schools, protest by Galen led to public demonstration. Like Presying, he assisted with the drafting of the 1937 papal encyclical. He denounced the lawlessness of the Gestapo, the confiscations of church properties and the cruel program of Nazi euthanasia. He attacked the Gestapo for seizing church properties and converting them to their own purposes - including use as cinemas and brothels. His three powerful sermons of July and August 1941 earned him the nickname of the \\"Lion of Munster\\". Documents suggest the Nazis intended to hang Galen at the end of the war. The Nazi press called him \\"enemy number one\\", Hitler called him a \\"liar and a traitor\\", and Göring said he was a \\"saboteur and agitator\\" and those who published the text of his sermons were attached - but the regime did not have him arrested. ; Faulhaber Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber was an early and prominent critic of the Nazi movement. Soon after the Nazi takeover, his three Advent sermons of 1933, entitled Judaism, Christianity, and Germany, affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion, the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"Throughout his sermons until the collapse (1945) of the Third Reich, Faulhaber vigorously criticized Nazism, despite governmental opposition. Attempts on his life were made in 1934 and in 1938. He worked with American occupation forces after the war, and received the West German Republic's highest award, the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit. On November 4, 1936, Hitler and Faulhaber met. Faulhaber told Hitler that the Nazi government had been waging war on the church for three years and that the church must be free to criticize the government \\"when your officials or your laws offend Church dogma or the laws of morality\\". ; Bertram Cardinal Adolf Bertram ex officio head of the German episcopate sent Hitler birthday greetings in 1939 in the name of all German Catholic bishops, an act that angered bishop Konrad von Preysing. Bertram was the leading advocate of accommodation as well as the leader of the German church, a combination that reined in other would-be opponents of Nazism. The Church Struggle The Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, among the most aggressive anti-Church Nazis, wrote that there was \\"an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view\\". The Nazis disliked universities, intellectuals and the Catholic and Protestant churches. According to Gill, their long term plan was to \\"de-Christianise Germany after the final victory\\". The Nazis co- opted the term Gleichschaltung to mean conformity and subservience to the National Socialist German Workers' Party line: \\"there was to be no law but Hitler, and ultimately no god but Hitler\\". The Kirchenkampf (Church struggle) saw the Nazis attempt to control the religious confessions of Germany. Aggressive anti-Church radicals like Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists. Hitler too disdained Christianity.Alan Bullock; Hitler, a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218 According to Kershaw, the German church leadership expended considerable energies in opposing government interference in the church and \\"attempts to ride roughshod over Christian doctrine and values\\". While offering \\"something less than fundamental resistance to Nazism\\", church leaders \\"engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime\\". To Alfred Rosenberg, a neo-pagan, and the official Nazi Philosopher, Catholicism was one of Nazism's chief enemies. He planned the \\"extermination of the foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany\\", and for the Bible and Christian cross to be replaced with Mein Kampf and the swastika. Bishop Sproll in Rottenburg. It reads: On June 23, 1938, the National Socialists stormed the apartment of Dr. Joannes Baptista Sproll, 1870–1949, the seventh Bishop of Rottenburg. In the same year, the government forced the bishop into exile; he could not return to his diocese from Krumbad until after the war. A threatening, though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. The Reichskonkordat between Germany and the Vatican was signed at the Vatican on 20 July 1933. Within three months of the signing of the document, Cardinal Bertram, head of the German Catholic Bishops Conference, was writing in a Pastoral Letter of \\"grievous and gnawing anxiety\\" with regard to the government's actions towards Catholic organisations, charitable institutions, youth groups, press, Catholic Action and the mistreatment of Catholics for their political beliefs. Prior to 1933, the Church had been quite hostile to Nazism and \\"its bishops energetically denounced the 'false doctrines' of the Nazis\\", however its opposition weakened considerably after the Concordat. Cardinal Bertram \\"developed an ineffectual protest system\\" so satisfy the demands of other bishops, without annoying the regime. Only gradually did Catholic resistance from the hierarchy re-emerge, in the form of the efforts of individual clerics, including Cardinal Preysing of Berlin, Bishop Galen of Münster, and Bishop Grober of Freiberg. The regime responded with arrests, the withdrawal of teaching privileges, and the seizure of church publishing houses. The Concordat, wrote William Shirer, \\"was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government\\". On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or \\"immorality\\". In effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance, the security services monitored the activities of the bishops very closely - instructing that agents be set up in every diocese, that the bishops' reports to the Vatican should be obtained and that the bishops' areas of activity must be found out. Deans were to be targeted as the \\"eyes and ears of the bishops\\" and a \\"vast network\\" established to monitor the activities of ordinary clergy: \\"The importance of this enemy is such that inspectors of security police and of the security service will make this group of people and the questions discussed by them their special concern\\". In January 1934, Hitler appointed Alfred Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich. Rosenberg was a neo-pagan and notoriously anti-Catholic. In his \\"Myth of the Twentieth Century\\" (1930), Rosenberg had described the Catholic Church as one of the main enemies of Nazism. Bishop von Galen derided the neo- pagan theories of Rosenberg as perhaps no more than \\"an occasion for laughter in the educated world\\", but warned that \\"his immense importance lies in the acceptance of his basic notions as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education. Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood.\\" Goebbels noted the mood of Hitler in his diary on 25 October 1936: \\"Trials against the Catholic Church temporarily stopped. Possibly wants peace, at least temporarily. Now a battle with Bolshevism. Wants to speak with Faulhaber\\". On November 4, 1936, Hitler met Faulhaber. Hitler spoke for the first hour, then Faulhaber told him that the Nazi government had been waging war on the church for three years - 600 religious teachers had lost their jobs in Bavaria alone - and the number was set to rise to 1700 and the government had instituted laws the Church could not accept - like the sterilization of criminals and the handicapped. While the Catholic Church respected the notion of authority, nevertheless, \\"when your officials or your laws offend Church dogma or the laws of morality, and in so doing offend our conscience, then we must be able to articulate this as responsible defenders of moral laws\\". Kershaw cites the meeting as an example of Hitler's ability to \\"pull the wool over the eyes even of hardened critics\\" for \\"Faulhaber - a man of sharp acumen, who had often courageously criticized the Nazi attacks on the Catholic Church - went away convinced that Hitler was deeply religious\\". By early 1937, the German bishops, who had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge () encyclical. It accused the government of \\"systematic hostility leveled at the Church\\". Bishops Konrad von Preysing and Clemens August Graf von Galen helped draft the document. The Nazis responded with, an intensification of the Church Struggle, beginning around April. Goebbels noted heightened verbal attacks on the clergy from Hitler in his diary and wrote that Hitler had approved the start of trumped up \\"immorality trials\\" against clergy and anti-Church propaganda campaign. Goebbels' orchestrated attack included a staged \\"morality trial\\" of 37 Franciscans. In March 1938, Nazi Minister of State Adolf Wagner spoke of the need to continue the fight against Political Catholicism and Alfred Rosenberg said that the churches of Germany \\"as they exist at present, must vanish from the life of our people\\". In the space of a few months, Bishop Sproll of Rothenberg, Cardinal von Faulhaber of Munich and Cardinal Innitzer of Vienna were physically attacked by Nazis. After initially offering support to the Anschluss, Austria's Cardinal Innitzer became a critic of the Nazis and was subject to violent intimidation from them. With power secured in Austria, the Nazis repeated their persecution of the Church and in October, a Nazi mob ransacked Innitzer's residence, after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. On 26 July 1941, Bishop von Galen wrote to the government to complain \\"The Secret Police has continued to rob the property of highly respected German men and women merely because they belonged to Catholic orders\\". Because the Nazi Gleichschaltung policy of forced coordination encountered such forceful opposition from the churches, Hitler decided to postpone the struggle until after the war. Hitler himself possessed radical instincts in relation to the continuing conflict with the Catholic and Protestant Churches in Germany. Though he occasionally spoke of wanting to delay the Church struggle and was prepared to restrain his anti- clericalism out of political considerations, his \\"own inflammatory comments gave his immediate underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat in the 'Church Struggle, confident that they were 'working towards the Fuhrer'\\". =1941 Pastoral Letter of the German Bishops= On 26 June 1941, the German Bishops drafted a pastoral letter from their Fulda Conference, to be read from all pulpits on 6 July: \\"Again and again have the bishops brought their justified claims and complaints before the proper authorities ... Through this pastoral declaration the Bishops want you to see the real situation of the church\\". The Bishops wrote that the church faced \\"restrictions and limitations put on the teaching of their religion and on church life\\" and of great obstacles in the fields of Catholic education, freedom of service and religious festivals, the practice of charity by religious orders and the role of preaching morals. Catholic presses had been silenced and kindergartens closed and religious instruction in schools nearly stamped out: =1942 Pastoral Letter of the German Bishops= The following year, on 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on \\"The Struggle against Christianity and the Church\\": The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of \\"unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church\\", despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholics soldiers. It accused the regime of seeking to rid Germany of Christianity: The letter outlined serial breaches of the 1933 Concordat, reiterated complaints of the suffocation of Catholic schooling, presses and hospitals and said that the \\"Catholic faith has been restricted to such a degree that it has disappeared almost entirely from public life\\" and even worship within churches in Germany \\"is frequently restricted or oppressed\\", while in the conquered territories (and even in the Old Reich), churches had been \\"closed by force and even used for profane purposes\\". The freedom of speech of clergymen had been suppressed and priests were being \\"watched constantly\\" and punished for fulfilling \\"priestly duties\\" and incarcerated in Concentration camps without legal process. Religious orders had been expelled from schools, and their properties seized, while seminaries had been confiscated \\"to deprive the Catholic priesthood of successors\\". The bishops denounced the Nazi euthanasia program and declared their support for human rights and personal freedom under God and \\"just laws\\" of all people: Austria Cardinal Innitzer of Vienna. The Anschluss saw the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938. Austria was overwhelmingly Catholic. At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer, the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler's arrival in the city on 14 March. However, wrote Mark Mazower, such gestures of accommodation were \\"not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globocnik\\". Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly and October 1938, wrote Mazower, saw the \\"very first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime\\", when a rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting \\"Christ is our Fuehrer\\", before being dispersed by police. A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer's residence, after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. L'Osservatore Romano reported on 15 October that Hitler Youth and the SA had gathered at Innitzer's Cathedral during a service for Catholic Youth and started \\"counter-shouts and whistlings: 'Down with Innitzer! Our faith is Germany'\\". The following day, the mob stoned the Cardinal's residence, broke in and ransacked it—bashing a secretary unconscious, and storming another house of the cathedral curia and throwing its curate out the window. In a Table Talk of July 1942 discussing his problems with the Church, Hitler singles out Innitzer's early gestures of cordiality as evidence of the extreme caution with which Church diplomats must be treated: \\"there appeared a man who addressed me with such self-assurance and beaming countenance, just as if, throughout the whole of the Austrian Republic he had never even touched a hair of the head of any National Socialist!\\" Nazi euthanasia The Blessed Clemens August Graf von Galen, Bishop of Münster spoke out against euthanasia in Nazi Germany. From 1939, the regime began its program of euthanasia in Nazi Germany, in which those deemed \\"racially unfit\\" were to be \\"euthanased\\". The senile, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with Down Syndrome and people with similar afflictions were all to be killed. The program involved the systematic murder of more than 70,000 people. The Papacy and German bishops had already protested against the Nazi sterilization of the \\"racially unfit\\". Catholic protests against the escalation of this policy into \\"euthanasia\\" began in the summer of 1940. Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of handicapped people were still under the care of the Churches. Galen wrote to Germany's senior cleric, Cardinal Adolf Bertram, in July 1940 urging the Church take up a moral position. Bertram urged caution. Archbishop Conrad Groeber of Freiburg wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery, and offered to pay all costs being incurred by the state for the \\"care of mentally people intended for death\\". Caritas directors sought urgent direction from the bishops, and the Fulda Bishops Conference sent a protest letter to the Reich Chancellery on 11 August, then sent Bishop Heinrich Wienken of Caritas to discuss the matter. Wienken cited the commandment \\"thous shalt not kill\\" to officials and warned them to halt the program or face public protest from the Church. Wienken subsequently wavered, fearing a firm line might jeopardise his efforts to have Catholic priests released from Dachau, but was urged to stand firm by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. The government refused to give a written undertaking to halt the program, and the Vatican declared on 2 December that the policy was contrary to natural and positive Divine law: \\"The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed\\". Bishop von Galen had the decree printed in his newspaper on 9 March 1941. Subsequent arrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster, convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior had become pointless. On 6, 13 and 20 July 1941, Galen spoke against the seizure of properties, and expulsions of nuns, monks and religious and criticised the euthanasia programme. In an attempt to cow Galen, the police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar. She escaped the confinement, and Galen, who had also received news of the imminent removal of further patients, launched his most audacious challenge on the regime in a 3 August sermon. He declared the murders to be illegal, and said that he had formally accused those responsible for murders in his diocese in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all \\"unproductive people\\", like old horses or cows, including invalid war veterans: \\"Who can trust his doctor anymore?\\", he asked. He declared, wrote Evans, that Catholics must \\"avoid those who blasphemed, attacked their religion, or brought about the death of innocent men and women. Otherwise they would become involved in their guilt\\". Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life, even if it meant losing their own lives. \\"The sensation created by the sermons\\", wrote Richard J. Evans, \\"was enormous\\". Kershaw characterised Von Galen's 1941 \\"open attack\\" on the government's euthanasia program as a \\"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism\\". According to Gill, \\"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state. He spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights. Galen had the sermons read in parish churches. The British broadcast excerpts over the BBC German service, dropped leaflets over Germany, and distributed the sermons in occupied countries. Bishop Antonius Hilfrich of Limburg wrote to the Justice Minister, denouncing the murders. Bishop Albert Stohr of Mainz condemned the taking of life from the pulpit. Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons. Hitler wanted to have Galen removed, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The regional Nazi leader, and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end. The Catholic bishops jointly expressed their \\"horror\\" at the policy in their 1942 Pastoral Letter: Under pressure from growing protests, Hitler halted the main euthanasia program on 24 August 1941, though less systematic murder of the handicapped continued. While Galen survived, Bishop von Preysing's Cathedral Administrator, Fr Bernhard Lichtenberg met his demise for protesting directly to Dr Conti, the Nazi State Medical Director. He was arrested soon after and later died en route to Dachau. Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons. The Holocaust=Knowledge of= According to historians David Bankier and Hans Mommsen a through knowledge of the Holocaust was well within the reach of the German bishops, if they wanted to find out. According to historian Michael Phayer, \\"a number of bishops did want to know, and they succeeded very early on in discovering what their government was doing to the Jews in occupied Poland\\". Wilhelm Berning, for example, knew about the systematic nature of the Holocaust as early as February 1942, only one month after the Wannsee Conference. Most German Church historians believe that the church leaders knew of the Holocaust by the end of 1942, knowing more than any other church leaders outside the Vatican. However, after the war, some bishops, including Adolf Bertram and Conrad Grober claimed that they were not aware of the extent and details of the Holocaust, and were not certain of the information they did possess. =Public statements= Bishops von Preysing and Frings were the most public in the statements against genocide. According to Phayer, \\"no other German bishops spoke as pointedly as Preysing and Frings\\". =Fulda meetings= The bishops met annually during the war in Fulda. The issue of whether the bishops should speak out against the persecution of the Jews was debated at a 1942 meeting in Fulda. The consensus was to \\"give up heroic action in favor of small successes\\". A draft letter proposed by Margarete Sommer was rejected, because it was viewed as a violation of the Reichskonkordat to speak out on issues not directly related to the church. In 1943, bishop Grober expressed the opinion that the bishop should remain loyal to the \\"beloved folk and Fatherland\\", despite abuses of the Reichskonkordat. =Defence of Jews= Memorial tablet for Joseph Frings at the parish church of Cologne-Fühlingen. At the height of the Nazi Holocaust, Frings preached against racism. What protests the German bishops did make regarding anti- Jewish policies, tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers. Traditional Christian anti-Judaism was \\"no bulwark\\" against Nazi biological antisemitism, wrote Kershaw, and on these issues opposition was generally left to fragmented and largely individual efforts. Bishops Konrad von Preysing and Clemens August Graf von Galen assisted with the drafting of Pope Pius XI's 1937 German encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, which was written partly in response to the Nuremberg Laws. The papal letter condemned racial theories and the mistreatment of people based on race. According to Gill, \\"Hitler was beside himself with rage. Twelve presses were seized, and hundreds of people sent either to prison or the camps\\". This despite Article 4 of the reichskonkordat guaranteeing freedom of correspondence between the Vatican and the German clergy, Later, in Pius XII's first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus, which came only a month into the war, the Church reiterated the Catholic stance against racism and anti-semitism: \\"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all\\" and endorsed resistance against those opposed to the ethical content of \\"the Revelation on Sinai\\" (the Ten Commandments given to Moses) and the Sermon on the Mount given by Jesus. When the newly installed Nazi Government began to instigate its program of anti-semitism, Pope Pius XI, through his Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli, ordered the Papal Nuncio in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo, to \\"look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved\\" in their aid. Orsenigo proved a poor instrument in this regard, concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics, than with taking action to help German Jews. Cardinal Innitzer called him timid and ineffectual with respect to the worsening situation for German Jewry. Nazi racial ideology held that Jews were subhuman and posited that Christ had been an Aryan. Ludwig Muller was Hitler's choice for Reich Bishop of the German Evangelical Church, which sought to subordinate German Protestantism to the Nazi Government. But Muller's heretical views against St Paul and the Semitic origins of Christ and the Bible quickly alienated sections of the Protestant church, leading to the foundation of the Confessing Church. The attack on the Biblical origins of Christianity also alarmed Catholics. Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber responded with three Advent sermons in 1933, entitled Judaism, Christianity, and Germany, He affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion, the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany. According to Michael Phayer, Bishops Konrad von Preysing and Joseph Frings were the most outspoken against Nazi mistreatment of the Jews. While Preysing was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position, his cathedral administrator Bernard Lichtenberg, was not. Lichtenberg served at St. Hedwig's Cathedral from 1932, and was under the watch of the Gestapo by 1933. He ran Preysing's aid unit (the Hilfswerke beim Bischöflichen Ordinariat Berlin) which secretly assistance to those who were being persecuted by the regime. From 1938, Lichtenberg conducted prayers for the Jews and other inmates of the concentration camps, including \\"my fellow priests there\\". For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, and died en route to Dachau Concentration Camp in 1943. Gorsky wrote that \\"The Vatican endeavored to find places of refuge for Jews after Kristallnacht in November 1938, and the Pope instructed local bishops to help all who were in need at the beginning of the war.\\" In 1943, the German bishops debated whether to directly confront Hitler collectively over what they knew of the murdering of Jews, but decided not to take this course. Some bishops did speak out individually however - Von Preysing of Berlin spoke of a right of all people to life, Joseph Frings of Cologne wrote a pastoral letter cautioning his diocese not, even in wartime, to violate the inherent rights of others to life, even those \\"not of our blood\\" and preached in a sermon that \\"no one may take the property or life of an innocent person just because he is a member of a foreign race\\". Historical evaluation=Praise= Some German bishops are praised for their wartime actions. According to Phayer, \\"several bishops did speak out\\". (a post-war bishop) very likely personally hid Jews in Berlin during the war. Clemens August Graf von Galen was a well-known public opponent of the Nazi \\"euthanasia\\" program, if not the Holocaust itself. =Criticism= Phayer believes that the German episcopate--as opposed to other bishops--could have done more to save Jews. According to Phayer, \\"had the German bishops confronted the Holocaust publicly and nationally, the possibilities of undermining Hitler's death apparatus might have existed. Admittedly, it is speculative to assert this, but it is certain that many more German Catholics would have sought to save Jews by hiding them if their church leaders had spoken out\\". In this regard, Phayer places the responsibility with the Vatican, asserting that \\"a strong papal assertion would have enabled the bishops to overcome their disinclinations\\" and that \\"Bishop Preysing's only hope to spur his colleagues into action lay in Pope Pius XII\\".

The No. 6 was a concussion grenade. A variant of it, called the \\"No. 7\\", contained shrapnel, making it a primitive fragmentation grenade. Pulling a loop at the top of the grenade ignited the fuse. Once the loop was pulled, the grenade was armed and had to be thrown immediately. History The No. 6 was one of the intern grenades, created because of problems associated with the No. 1 grenade. It is one of the few intern grenades that uses a friction-based lighting system. While this seemed fine in theory, in practice it had multiple problems. The most prominent of all was that the arming method did not work as intended. In many cases pulling the loop was too difficult for one man to do and it required two men. For a lone soldier, the best method was to hold the grenade between the knees and pull on the loop with both hands. However, this often resulted in cutting the fingers in addition to igniting the fuse. Another danger was that the friction igniter was very sensitive, a powerful blow to the grenade with the detonator inserted could set it off. This made the No. 6 almost as dangerous as the percussion cap grenades that it was designed to replace. At the end of December 1915, the No. 6 and No. 7 were declared obsolete. However, it appears they were still in use up to at least 1917, as grenade manuals made during that time have a section on how to activate and ignite it. Variants ;No. 7 The No. 7 is a variant of the No. 6. Unlike the No. 6, it has an inner and outer casing. The inner casing contained the explosive while the outer contained scrap that was intended to be used as shrapnel. Generally, the No. 6 was used in preference to the No. 7 as it was lighter and there was the possibility of shrapnel from the No. 7 hitting friendly soldiers.

A surface is implemented as a simplicial complex. The user defines an initial surface in a datafile. The Evolver evolves the surface toward minimal energy by a gradient descent method. The aim can be to find a minimal energy surface, or to model the process of evolution by mean curvature. The energy in the Evolver can be a combination of surface tension, gravitational energy, squared mean curvature, user-defined surface integrals, or knot energies. The Evolver can handle arbitrary topology, volume constraints, boundary constraints, boundary contact angles, prescribed mean curvature, crystalline integrands, gravity, and constraints expressed as surface integrals. The surface can be in an ambient space of arbitrary dimension, which can have a Riemannian metric, and the ambient space can be a quotient space under a group action.

He also wrote two science fiction novels. One of his sons is United States Attorney General William Barr.  Early life and education  Barr was born in Manhattan, New York, the son of Estelle (née DeYoung), a psychologist, and Pelham Barr, an economist. He and his wife, Mary Margaret (née Ahern), had four children including William P. Barr (who served as the 77th U.S. Attorney General in the George H. W.

He was born to a Jewish family, but later converted to Catholicism; he sent his children to a Catholic elementary school and his son William would later describe him as \\"more Catholic than the Catholics.\\" Barr graduated from Columbia College in 1941 with a degree in mathematics and anthropology.  Career  Barr served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. Following the conflict, he returned to Columbia, where he earned an M.A. in English in 1950 and completed course requirements for a Ph.D. in the discipline while teaching in the English department. During this period, he also taught \\"courses with field work in sociology and political science at the School of Engineering\\" and wrote \\"science and mathematics texts for elementary and junior high school students.\\" He initiated the Columbia University Science Honors Program in 1958 and was its director (as an assistant dean at the School of Engineering) until 1964.

The first paper on the subject was written by Nikolay Nekhoroshev in 1971. The theorem complements both the KAM theorem and the phenomenon of instability for nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems, sometimes called Arnold Diffusion, in the following way: The KAM Theorem tells us that many solutions to nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems persist under a perturbation for all time, while, as Vladimir Arnold first demonstrated in 1964, some solutions do not stay close to their integrable counterparts for all time. The Nekhoroshev estimates tell us that, nonetheless, all solutions stay close to their integrable counterparts for an exponentially long time. Thus, they restrict how quickly solutions can become unstable. Statement Let H(I) + \\\\epsilon h(I, \\\\theta) be a nearly integrable n degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, where (I, \\\\theta) are the action-angle variables.

Method of placement Method of placement is to trench down to a naturally occurring horizontal zone which is rootproof, place the root barrier in one continuous piece into the trench with the root barrier top finishing above the ground. Development of root barriers Root barrier construction and applications has progressed since 1992 when technology progressed from a concrete barrier which cracked and failed, to specific plastics with the capacity to handle major stresses and loads created by matric suction, soil and moisture movement. Initial development of this product was based on stopping trees from affecting buildings, but as the research evolved it was discovered that what was actually being done was stabilizing moisture in reactive clay. A flexible waterproof cut off wall placed around a building will allow the building foundations to float on a block of stable clay and moisture, reducing the need for piers and other structure and proving to be very economical. Normal placement The normal placement of the barrier is to locate it around the structure, out from and parallel to the footings of the structure. Try not to surround the tree. The preferred method is placing the root barrier along beside the building, path, road etc. so that the tree roots cannot gain access to the structure. Root barrier works as a waterproof seal protecting the soil under the structure from moisture loss laterally. The structure prevents loss of moisture vertically and so the moisture content of the soil can be stabilized and will stay constant. After installation the soil under the building can be rehydrated if necessary to return it to the moisture content that it was when the building was built. Arboricultural considerations Arboricultural considerations, working in from the drip line, the closer you get to the trunk the higher the risk of damaging or destabilizing the tree. About 50% of the distance from the drip line to the trunk is regarded as the closest you can cut without major risk to plants' health. If it is necessary to trench closer than halfway towards the trunk, it would be advisable to engage the services of an arborist to assess the tree prior to the work being carried out, and to help nurse the tree through the period of installation. Soil considerations Area of good soil that the plant will require to live a healthy life may be calculated by multiplying the radius of the mature plant canopy by p r2 x .3m. The answer will give you the cubic volume of good soil required. If works require the ground surface area is not available for the plant, special pits filled with quality soils, drainage etc. may provide the answer.

In October 2013 Williamson pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud totaling nearly 1 million, one charge of fabricating invoices and another charge of recruiting others to hinder a police investigation. The same day that he pleaded guilty, Williamson declared himself bankrupt. An earlier independent report commissioned by the union detailed that companies associated with Williamson and his family had allegedly fraudulently received more than $5 million from the union in period from 2006 to 2011. In the NSW District Court in March 2014, Williamson was sentenced to sevenandahalf years of imprisonment; with a nonparole period of five years. Biography Williamson rose to prominence as an official of the HSU, representing the interests of low-paid workers in the health sector in New South Wales and then Australia. Williamson was general secretary of HSU NSW branch, later to become HSUeast, serving in this role between 1997 until June 2012. He was elected as the inaugural national president of the union in 2003 until October 2011. During his term as national president he controversially merged the NSW and two Victorian branches of the union to create HSUeast. He was elected as the national president of the Australian Labor Party, serving between 2009 and 2010; and was a vice president of NSW Labor. Williamson was also a vice president of Unions NSW until April 2012, when he resigned after being asked to explain to its executive why he should not be removed. He was a member of the national executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); a trustee of First State Super; and a non-executive director of SGE Credit Union, a credit union for NSW Government employees. =Health Services Union expenses affair= Allegations of improprieties in the HSUeast branch were first publicly revealed in The Sydney Morning Herald on 9 September 2011. It was alleged that Craig Thomson (whilst serving as national secretary of the HSU) and Williamson (as the general secretary of HSUeast) received secret commissions from a major supplier to the union. This was the first occasion that Williamson was implicated in any matter. The media report detailed that Williamson was a director of a computer company, United Edge, that provided information technology services to the HSUeast branch, without going to competitive tender. This decision was made while Williamson was general secretary of HSUeast. Following the public airing of allegations, Williamson's position as national president of the HSU became untenable, and he was suspended as president in October 2011. In April 2012 he resigned as President from Unions NSW after being asked to explain to its executive why he should not be removed. Williamson's position as the general secretary of HSUeast was dissolved when the Federal Court declared all elected positions vacant in June 2012; appointing an administrator to run the union's affairs. The final report by Ian Temby and Dennis Robertson, an accountant, delivered at the request of the HSUeast Union Council in July 2012, made findings that Williamson engaged in irregularities, such as placing family members in union jobs, paying inflated prices for services, and heading United Edge, a company supplying information technology services to the union. Meanwhile, NSW Police officers raided the union's Sydney office on 2 May 2012, seizing documents and computers as part of the \\"Strike Force Carnarvon\\" investigation into secret commissions allegedly received by Williamson and Thomson. Williamson was intercepted in a basement attempting to remove a bag of documents. On 4 October 2012, Williamson was charged with more than 50 offences relating to fraud and obstruction of justice, and was suspended as director of United Edge. Appearing before the Sydney Magistrates Court on 15 October 2013, Williamson entered a guilty plea to four major charges related to cheating and defrauding HSUeast, creating false documents with the intention to deceive and the recruiting of others to hinder a police investigation. All other charges were dropped. No charges were laid against Williamson's wife or family members. On 3 March 2014, legal counsel for Williamson declined to seek a bail extension and Williamson was imprisoned. He was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales on 28 March 2014 to sevenandahalf years of imprisonment; with a nonparole period of five years, ending in March 2019. In addition to criminal charges, HSUeast filed civil proceedings against Williamson. Prior to his guilty plea, the union and Williamson reached agreement on the terms of settlement via mediation supervised by Robert McClelland, a former Labor Attorney-General. The terms of the settlement included judgement against Williamson for $5 million in the Supreme Court, set aside his claimed pay rates back to 2003 resulting in the union reducing defined benefits superannuation liabilities to Williamson by approximately $1.1 million; eliminated in excess of $ worth of claimed leave entitlements; and received a public letter of apology to members of the Health Services Union, that the union published: Following his conviction and imprisonment, on 4 April 2014 the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party expelled Williamson as a member of the party.

The SFAA – which, by 1961, completed a long sequence of mission shifts and re-namings to become the San Francisco Art Institute – was the predecessor of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Over its lifetime, the association helped establish a Northern California regional flavor of California Tonalism as differentiated from Southern California American Impressionism. Early history SFAA was founded on March 28, 1871, by a group of some 23–30 artists, primarily landscape artists led by Virgil Macey Williams, with two goals: the forming of an art library, the promotion of art exhibitions, and the eventual establishment of an art school. Painter Juan B. Wandesforde hosted the organizational meeting and was elected its first president. Other early artist members included George Henry Burgess, Gideon Jacques Denny, Andrew P. Hill, Thomas Hill, William Keith, Arthur Nahl, Charles Christian Nahl and Ernest Narjot. (Exhibition catalog) The presence of painter-photographer George Henry Burgess among the founders connected the association with the nascent field of fine art photography. Within a few months, SFAA had elected its first honorary member: Albert Bierstadt, the financially successful landscape painter from New York who was at that time sojourning in California. Bierstadt was also interested in stereoscopic photography. By 1874, SFAA had 700 regular members and 100 life members, the latter paying $100 for the privilege. The quarterly receptions were attracting some 1000 people and the semi-annual exhibitions, running for two months each, brought over 7000 viewers. In 1874, there were similar public art institutions in only three other United States cities: New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C. From the beginning of the Bohemian Club in 1872, a web of interconnections between it and SFAA was apparent. Many artists were members of both organizations, and art patronage from well-to-do Bohemians helped provide a living for the all-male artists who were invited to join the Bohemian Club. SFAA exhibits in the late 19th century were very successful—many of the participating artists sold a year's worth of production to wealthy Bohemian and society patrons. By 1915, SFAA prosperity was intimately tied to Bohemian purchasing habits. School of art In February 1874, SFAA founded the California School of Design, installing Virgil Macey Williams as director. Subsequent directors included: Emil Carlsen (1887–1889), Arthur Mathews (1890–1906), Robert Howe Fletcher, Pedro Joseph de Lemos (1914–1917), Lee Fritz Randolph (1917–1941), and William Alexander Gaw (1941–1945). In 1893, the institution moved into the former Mark Hopkins mansion on Nob Hill, using the name Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (for the building but not the School of Design), and became affiliated with the University of California. In 1906, the devastating fire following the earthquake destroyed the building. A simpler replacement was built in one year, using the name San Francisco Institute of Art. During his tenure as Director Pedro de Lemos, an award-winning printmaker, pastelist, and leader of the American Arts & Crafts Movement, created the Departments of Illustration as well as Decorative Design, and introduced the first courses in etching west of Chicago. He resigned after a long dispute with the Board of Directors, which rejected his recommendations for increased faculty salaries, student- teaching grants, building maintenance, and additional painting and life classes. He became the Director of the Stanford University Art Gallery and Museum. His replacement, the highly regarded artist Lee Randolph, is credited with reviving and enlarging the school. The school's name was changed to the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA). In 1926 it moved into a new building on Chestnut Street, still the main campus of the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1941 the celebrated modernist painter William Gaw proved an adept administrator who maintained enrollment by revising the curriculum during World War II. In the spring of 1945 Douglas Macagy became the school's Director. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. Museum of art An art collection existed at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art and could be visited by the public, but it did not take on the identity of a museum. Accounts differ regarding how much of the collection was saved from the 1906 fire. The Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) in 1915 increased local public interest in art and calls for San Francisco to have a permanent art museum. Afterward, the exposition organizers decided to give the Palace of Fine Arts to SFAA if $30,000 in operating expenses could be raised by May 1, 1916.San Francisco Examiner, 28–30 April 1916. In writing up the contract, the negotiating teams were each led by a Bohemian Club member: Charles Templeton Crocker represented SFAA, and his uncle William H. Crocker stood for the Panama-Pacific group. The building, intended only for temporary use, was deeded to SFAA and the land it was on, formerly part of the Presidio, was deeded to the City of San Francisco by an act of Congress, contingent on the federal government being granted the right to operate a spur railroad line from Fort Mason to the Presidio.Oakland Tribune, 1 March 1925, p. 80. To direct the museum, the association hired J. Nilsen Laurvik, a New York art critic who had written a book on modern art in 1913 and co-edited the Catalogue de Luxe of the PPIE Department of Fine Arts. SFAA printed letterhead bearing the title \\"San Francisco Museum of Art\\" and in November 1916 began publishing the San Francisco Art Association Bulletin, intended as an annual journal. The Crockers formed committees within SFAA and filled the positions with successful businessmen. A shift in focus occurred in which traditional patronage practices came to the fore—the aesthetic wishes of the corporate class began to affect the artists' choices in subject matter and style. Against best intentions, attendance at the Palace of Fine Arts was too light to prevent heavy operating losses of $10,000–14,000 each year from 1915 to 1922, and the collection of public art remained small, overwhelmed by the vast space. Landscape painting, once the strength of SFAA fell off in volume. By the mid-1920s, only one modest landscape by reliably compliant Arthur Frank Mathews was being shown at the Palace. SFAA promoted a series of civic bond issues in the mid-1920s, written to fund new museums. Work began on the Palace of the Legion of Honor, a favorite project of SFAA member Herbert Fleishhacker. Large murals began to appear in public spaces, painted by SFAA artists, and were favorably reviewed by art critics and the public alike. A combination of corporate class patronage, CSFA mural training and years of private experience came together to allow the mural artists to succeed. In 1924, the de Young Museum was voted a civic maintenance program, the Legion of Honor museum was finished, and in 1926, a bond was passed to reinforce the weakening Palace of Fine Arts structure. Three public museums were available to San Franciscans. SFAA's own museum operated in the Palace of Fine Arts until 1925. After much fundraising and a bond measure, the San Francisco Museum of Art reopened in the War Memorial Veterans Building in the Civic Center in January 1935. The opening exhibitions included the SFAA Annual, Gothic and Renaissance tapestries from the collection of Mrs. William H. Crocker, 46 examples of \\"Modern French Painting\\" that included Cézannes and Renoirs, and Chinese sculpture which was \\"to remain at the museum as the nucleus of a permanent display of Oriental art.\\"San Francisco Art Association Bulletin, January 1935. Albert M. Bender was a member of the Board of Trustees at the time and is said to have donated some 1100 of the first 1200 objects in the collection. The museum's governance was separate from that of SFAA, but a cooperative relationship between the two entities continued for years. Merger and dissolution In 1961, SFAA merged with CSFA, and the art school took its modern name, the San Francisco Art Institute.

It was first established in 1951 as the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (ENCPyS, National School of Political and Social Sciences), before its conversion to full faculty status from 26 January 1968. FCPyS offers five academic degrees at the Licenciatura (undergraduate) level, in public administration, Communication studies, political science, international relations, sociology and anthropology. At a postgraduate level FCPyS offers Maestrías (Master's degrees) in five areas of study, and a Doctorado (doctorate) in political and social science that is oriented to one of five specialities. FCPyS also operates and has responsibility for a number of specialised semi-autonomous research institutions, such as the Centro de Relaciones Internacionales (CRI). Origin Activities were inaugurated July 25 of 1951. The students were a total of 136 which included 129 men and 13 women, a bigger group than what was expected. One of the priorities for the establishment of the school was the syllabus, which sparked a debate of objectives between an approved school of France and Belgium and a more traditional view. Between 1949 and 1951 there were multiple discussions around where the Public Administration's classes should be imparted. On one side the Economics Faculty stated that Economics and politics were both part of the public space. The Law and Political Science Faculty declared that Law and Political Science couldn't separate. The conflict was solved by negotiating that The Faculty of Economics would keep Public Administration as long as The National School of Political and Social Science would be able to create Political Science, Social Science, Diplomatic Science and Periodism. The first principal was Ernesto Enríquez Coyro who declared himself against the syllabus, because he considered that practical knowledge was needed through field practices. Besides t that were not always taken into account. He also considered that conferences should be taken with formality by planning them ahead of time and publishing date and topics with anticipation. That way students will be able not only to assist but really participate and be part of the conferences actively.

Littleton was reelected in 2014 by 64 percent of the vote in a contest with Democratic challenger Jariah Walker.  Sheriff controversy  Littleton was the first county commissioner to call for the resignation of embattled El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa, who subsequently left office amid allegations and lawsuits that claimed he created a hostile work environment and had affairs with subordinates. One employment complaint claimed the sheriff used female employees as \\"sexual playthings\\" who were rewarded with promotions for sexual favors. Littleton's demand for resignation was not supported by fellow commissioners, until later.  Term limit reinstatement  Prior to Littleton's first election as county commissioner, public controversy erupted after El Paso County Commissioners placed what was criticized as deliberately misleading language on the 2010 ballot. The measure asked whether county officials should be limited to three terms. After the measure passed, some voters claimed they were duped. Commissioners were already limited to two terms and critics claimed an extension of terms was written to appear as a reduction. Upon assuming office in 2011, Littleton fought to put the question to voters again with less confusing language. Voters in 2011 restored the limitation of two terms.
