Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History The unit was formed in July 1854 under the title of Northumberland Militia Artillery. It was one of the smallest artillery militia corps to be raised at that time, with an establishment of only 161 all ranks, including permanent staff, organised in two batteries. Initially, its headquarters was at Tynemouth, but it moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in December 1854.Litchfield, pp. 122‚Äì5.Army List, various dates. In May 1860, while the Northumberland Artillery was embodied for service during the Indian Mutiny, there was a riot at Tynemouth Castle and North Shields, in which the militiamen were accused of maltreating the police in the discharge of their duties. The disgusted townsfolk urgently requested the Northumberland Artillery to be removed from the area or disbanded completely. The unit was moved to Ireland, and in September 1861 its headquarters was shifted to Berwick-upon-Tweed, where it remained for the rest of its existence. The first commandant was Captain Charles Clementson, who was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel when the establishment was increased to four batteries in the 1860s. He was succeeded from 6 August 1868 by Lt-Col Charles Reed. By 1868 the establishment had risen to 392 in four batteries, which was increased to five batteries in 1874 and to six in 1882.Litchfield, Appendix 7. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Northumberland corps became the 3rd Brigade, Northern Division, RA. When the Northern Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Northumberland Artillery (Western Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Berwick unit taking the title of Northumberland RGA (M). Embodiments The unit was twice embodied for home defence: * Indian Mutiny: 4 April 1859 to 2 March 1861. The corps was embodied at North Shields,Edinburgh Gazette, 3 May 1859. moving to Hexham,Edinburgh Gazette, 7 June1859. and TynemouthEdinburgh Gazette, 5 July 1859. before going south to Sheerness in the summer of 1859.Edinburgh Gazette, 2 August 1859. It was back in Tynemouth by the autumnEdinburgh Gazette, 6 September 1859. and remained there until May 1860 when it was involved in a riot (see above). Thereafter it was sent to Ireland, first at Cork,Edinburgh Gazette, 5 June 1860. then at Kinsale,Edinburgh Gazette, 3 July 1860. where it stayed until the end of its embodiment.Edinburgh Gazette, 5 March 1861. * Second Boer War: 7 May to 11 October 1900. Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi- professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the majority of the officers and men of the Northumberland RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8. The last commanding officer was Lt-Col Sir Francis Blake, 1st Baronet, of Tillmouth Park.Burke's, 'Blake of Tillmouth'. Insignia In 1854 the officers of the Northumberland Militia Artillery wore badges that were unique to the unit. Their black leather helmet carried a plate consisting of an ornate silver shield surmounted by a crown and surrounded by a laurel wreath. The shield bore the star of the Order of the Garter with the garter strap in gilt and blue enamel and the cross of St George enamelled red. Below the star were crossed gilt cannons. Beneath the shield was a scroll inscribed 'NORTHUMBERLAND'. The officers' regimental pattern button was silvered with a scalloped edge, bearing the three cannons in pale from the arms of the Board of Ordnance surmounted by a crown, with a scroll underneath inscribed 'NORTHUMBERLAND ARTILLERY'.

She was born to a wealthy family in Hiller√∏d, and attended the private Marie M√∏rks School there. She began to paint at a young age, and after spending time abroad in Oslo, Norway, she attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts to fine-tune her craft, but found the teachings there to be too traditional. Instead, she moved to Paris and joined Fernand L√©ger's academy, studying under him until 1933, when she returned to Denmark and opened up her own studio. Throughout the 1930s, Kernn-Larsen's style moved from a more decorative style to surrealism. She regularly attended exhibitions as one of the only female surreal artists, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936. In 1937, Kernn-Larsen moved back to Paris and met Peggy Guggenheim, who opened a solo exhibition for her the following year in London. She remained in London throughout the war years with her husband, Jewish art dealer Isak Gr√ºnberg. At that time she departed from surrealism, focusing on a more real approach to her paintings during the war. After the war, Kernn- Larsen moved to Saint-Jeannet, Alpes-Maritimes, France, using the Southern French landscape as a motif for her later paintings. She lived there from 1947 to 1992, and while there worked with ceramics, and published a children's book, The Golden Village.

As a two-year-old she was one of the best fillies of her generation in Ireland, winning both of her races including the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes. She failed to win again and ran only four more times over the next two years before being retired from racing. Background Termagant is a bay mare with a narrow white blaze and two white sock bred in County Cork, Ireland by Denis O'Flynn's Old Carhue Stud. As a yearling the filly was consigned to the Goffs sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨34,000 by Frank Barry on behalf of the veteran trainer Kevin Prendergast. She initially raced in the colours of Prendergast's wife before being transferred to the ownership of Joerg Vasicek. She was ridden in all of her races by Declan McDonogh. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Powerscourt a top class international performer whose wins included the Arlington Million and the Tattersalls Gold Cup. He was not a conspicuous success at stud and was exported to stand in Turkey. Termagant's dam Rock Salt showed little racing ability, failing to win in four starts in France as a three-year-old in 2004. She was a granddaughter of the broodmare Populi (a half-sister to Temperence Hill) who was the dam of Vanlandingham and the grand-dam of African Rose. Racing career =2009: two-year-old season= Termagant made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 11 June and started a 14/1 outsider in a five-runner field. After being restrained in the early stages she went to the front a furlong out and broke clear of her opponents to win by two lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Cabaret. After a break of two and a half months, the filly returned to the track and was moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes on heavy ground at the Curragh on 30 August. Lillie Langtry started favourite in the seven-runner field ahead of Long Lashes (winner of the Sweet Solera Stakes) and the Jim Bolger-trained Gile Na Greine with Termagant next in the betting on 16/1 alongside her stablemate Wrong Answer (Marble Hill Stakes). Termagant was settled in mid- division as the 66/1 outsider Famous set the pace from Gold Bubbles and Long Lashes, but made a forward move entering the last quarter mile. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by two and a half lengths from Famous, with Lillie Langtry in third. After the race Kevin Prendergast said \\"It was always the plan to come here after her debut win. She might not run again this season. I hope she'll be just as good on decent ground, but it could be that this is her ground\\". =2010: three-year-old season= On 23 May Termagant made her first and only appearance of 2010 in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh. Before the race Prendergast explained that the filly had been held up in her progress by the exceptionally cold winter but had recently been \\"working nicely\\". Starting the 8/1 fifth choice in the nineteen-runner field she raced towards the rear before making some progress in the last quarter mile and finished ninth, five lengths behind the winner Bethrah. =2011: four-year-old season= After an absence of almost ten months Termagant returned in the Group 3 Park Express Stakes at the Curragh in March. She started joint-favourite but came home fourth of the nine runners behind Lolly For Dolly. On 2 May she was matched against male opposition in the Mooresbridge Stakes over ten furlongs but made little impact, finishing a distant fourth behind So You Think. Nineteen days after the Mooresbridge Stakes Termagant was equipped with blinkers for the first time in the Equestrian Stakes at the same track. She took the lead soon after the start and opened up a clear lead before fading badly and finishing last of the nine runners. Breeding record Following her retirement from racing Termagant became a broodmare for her owner's Kenilworth House Stud. As of 2017, she has produced two foals, neither of whom have appeared on the track: *Coup de Main, a bay filly, foaled in 2013, sired by Oasis Dream. Sold for 350,000 guineas as a yearling. *My Daydream, bay filly, 2015, by Oasis Dream. Sold for 260,000 guineas as a yearling.

Scored for four-part choir and organ, it was written in 1946 for Gloucester Cathedral. It was published by Novello in 1947.  Text  (Song of Mary) and (Song of Simeon) are biblical canticles. Mary sings the Magnificat (\\"My soul doth magnify the Lord\\") on the occasion of her visit to Elizabeth, as narrated in the Gospel of Luke (). Simeon sings the Nunc dimittis (\\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace\\") when Jesus is presented in the temple (). The canticles are part of the daily service of Evening Prayer in the Anglican church and have been set to music frequently.  Music  Howells set the combination of Magnificat and Nunc dimittis 20 times, taking the words from the Book of Common Prayer. The Gloucester Service, his sixth setting, was written in 1946 and is scored for a four-part choir and organ. It is subtitled For the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Indivisible Trinity. In the Gloucester Service, both canticles are set as one movement, with slight changes in tempo, and changes of key and time, to interpret the text. The Magnificat begins, marked \\"Con moto piacevole\\", with the sopranos alone, while the organ supplies a steady slow foundation of chords in halfnotes, and plays the melody after the voices in canon. The verse about being called \\"blessed\\" is sung by the divided sopranos. The text about \\"his mercy\\" is sung by four parts in imitation. Introduced by the organ, only the men sing in unison \\"He has showed strength\\", syncopated and with triplets, expanded to a unison of all voices for \\"He hath put down the mighty\\". The phrase \\"and hath exalted the humble\\" is marked by entrances in succession from the lowest voice to the highest, combined with crescendo. Marked \\"Meno messo\\" (Less moving), the basses introduce \\"He remembring his mercy\\", responded by four other voices, with again divided sopranos. The doxology repeats material from the beginning, but now in imitation of four voices. The Amen is again for five parts, in rich harmony but soft and further diminishing to a long last chord when all parts are divided. The Nunc dimittis, marked \\"Tranquillo a poco lento\\" (Calm and somewhat slow), is set in more homophony. After a few measures of organ introduction, the lower voices enter with a long chord, on which the sopranos begin a melody, all voices joining for \\"depart in peace\\", ended with another long chord marked pianissimo. The doxology is built from material of the first one. Divided tenors emphasize the phrase \\"world without end\\", while all voices are divided for the final soft Amen. Howells knew Gloucester Cathedral's acoustics very well, as he was a pupil of Sir Herbert Brewer, the cathedral's organist. Howells used the resonant space for \\"fervent, majestic\\" doxologies concluding both canticles, but with a quiet and reflective close. Eric Milner-White, then Dean of York, is reported to have been \\"in inward tears for the rest of the day\\" after he first heard the Nunc dimittis. The composer's biographer, Christopher Palmer, described the Gloucester Service as being one of the three Howells canticle settings that \\"tower above the rest\\" (the others being Collegium Regale for King's College, Cambridge, and the St Paul's Service for St Paul's Cathedral) where the music \\"burns through the words' patina of familiarity into a dramatic and purposeful entity\\", while reflecting their \\"constantly varying nuances and inflections\\".  Recordings  The piece has been recorded several times, including a 2012 recording of music by Howells, called Requiem, combined with anthems, the St Paul's Service, and the Requiem, performed by the Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge, conducted by Stephen Layton, with organists Simon Bland and Jeremy Cole.

Rohena was born in Loma Alta, Puerto Rico. He began sampling and making his own songs in 2013 and launched them on social media via his SoundCloud, Instagram and YouTube accounts. He is best known for his single \\"Esclava\\", which gained him popularity in his home country. His breakthrough came in 2016 with \\"Cuatro Babys\\", a song with a Colombian singer Maluma which featured Noriel and Juhn. The song became a commercial success, being certified 4√ó Platinum by the RIAA and peaking at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.  Early life  Bryant Myers was born in Puerto Rico in a neighborhood called Loma Alta. He grew up in what he describes as a hazardous environment (in the alleys and streets). \\"Sometimes we did not have breakfast or lunch, my mom could not buy me some sneakers, that made me want to make a lot of money to have my family well, and that my mother and my brother did not miss anything\\", relates Bryant on an interview with Infobae. Bryant started writing songs in his home while he studied. He later left his studies in order to pursue his music career.  Career  Bryant Myers' first hit \\"Esclava\\" put him on the radar with some well known reggaeton and urban artists, which allowed him to participate in a series of collaborations with charting artists. He followed it with \\"Esclava\\" (remix), featuring Anonimus (his cousin Luis Beauchamp), Anuel AA and Almighty. The latter track garnered over a million views on YouTube in less than three months. \\"Esclava\\" currently has 103 million views (as of June 6, 2018). Follow-up singles \\"Tu Me Enamoraste\\" and its remix with Lary Over and Brytiago, as well as \\"De Camino a Marte\\", performed just as well. He has continued to issue digital and video singles at a rate of at least one a month. In June 2016, he released \\"Vente Encima\\", featuring Anonimus, Noriel and Riko \\"El Bendecido\\", and guested on DJ Nelson's \\"Volverte a Ver\\" and Noriel's \\"La Llamada\\" (remix). In July 2016, he was a featured guest on Farruko's remix of his hit single \\"Ella y Yo\\" along with Almighty and Anuel AA, and \\"Esclava\\" was re-released as a digital download. His debut studio album, La Oscuridad, was released on July 27, 2018. Controversies On February 12, 2016, while Myers was traveling through Puerto Rico in a van with his manager and singers, the police stopped the van for a traffic violation. When they inspected the vehicle, they found a firearm and 40 rounds of ammunition. At the time of the arrest, Myers was a minor, and he spent a night in a juvenile prison. On October 7, 2016, he featured on the song \\"Cuatro Babys\\" by Maluma featuring Noriel and Juhn. This song has been widely controversial over its lyrics as they arguably appear to suggest direct violence towards women. A petition was posted on Change.org demanding for the removal of the song from digital platforms. Despite this controversy, the popularity of \\"Cuatro Babys\\" has only risen with the song having gone quadruple Platinum. Because of this, Latin trap has had a large, but primarily underground, following.

The temple is set on flat land with rocky outcrops as the backdrop. Pura Pulaki is a pura segara or Balinese sea temples, set around the island to form a chain of temples which protect the island. History The area of Pulaki has been inhabited since the prehistoric age. Several stone tools shaped like axe were discovered in Pura Melanting, a temple near Pura Pulaki, in 1987. The area of Pura Pulaki may have been a center of a pre-Hindu religion which makes use of a religious building in the form of a staged pyramid. Geographically, Pulaki forms a safe haven which provides a resting place for sea traders between Java ana Maluku. In the 14th- century, Pulaki was recorded as the center for the development of Vaishnavism, a sect in Hinduism. In late 15th-century, Dang Hyang Nirartha, a Hindu priest or Brahmin from the Majapahit kingdom of Java, arrived in Bali to introduce the Shaivite priesthood in Bali. Nirartha built several temples on Bali including the Pura Pulaki in 1489, the year considered to be the establishment of Pura Pulaki. Local legend mentioned that upon his arrival, Nirartha was escorted by the macaques from the forest into the spot where the Pura Pulaki would be built. Afterwards, Pura Pulaki was abandoned. In 1920, the Dutch colonial government rented the area of Pulaki to a Chinese trader Ang Tek What. The area, including the temple, was taken over by the Indonesian government in 1950 and was restored and protected. Temple compound Pura Pulaki is the main temple of a group of temples surrounding the area, called Pesanakan. The surrounding temples around Pura Pulaki are Pura Pemuteran, which is popular for its hot springs, Pura Kerta Kawat, and Pura Pabean. Pura Pulaki is situated by the beach Pantai Gondol. Pura Pulaki is a pura segara or \\"sea temples\\", which were founded in the 16th century also by Nirartha. Pura segara were built to honor the deities of the sea. Each of the pura segara is traditionally said to be visible from the next, forming a 'chain' around the coast of Bali. Many of the most important sea temples are located along the south-west coast of the island. The temples' positions were meant to provide a chain of spiritual protection for the Bali island. Like all pura, Pura Pulaki is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). The outer sanctum or jaba pisan is the outermost courtyard of the temple. Entry to the outer sanctum of Pura Pulaki is marked by a candi bentar split gate. This candi bentar is flanked with two towering bale kulkul, a pavilion where the drum to call for prayers is kept. The inner sanctum or jero is the most sacred part of a Balinese temple. Entry into the inner sanctum is marked with a portal structure known as paduraksa. The black-stone paduraksa of Pura Pulaki is decorated with figures of Naga Basuki, a dragon which maintain the balance of the cosmos. The paduraksa of Pura Pulaki was built in 1983.

It is endemic to Brazil and known from the middle and southern parts of the Purus‚ÄìMadeira interfluvial region in the Amazonas and Rond√¥nia states. The specific name onca is derived from the local common name for jaguar (Pantera onca) and refers to the blotchy color pattern of this frog; jaguars were also frequently spotted in the Purus‚ÄìMadeira interfluvial region during the field work. Hand and foot of holotype of Scinax onca. Scale bar 5 mm. Color variation in Scinax onca. The specimen on the top row is a male while the others are females. Photographs A‚ÄìD and F were taken after transport of the specimens to the camp, while the image of E was taken immediately in the field. Tadpole of Scinax onca in dorsal, ventral, and lateral views. Scale bar 5 mm. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is truncate in dorsal view and bluntly rounded in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct and a supra-tympanic fold is present but weak. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The forelimbs are slender with long fingers that have narrow lateral fringes and bear horizontally expanded discs; toes II‚ÄìIV hase basal webbing. The hind limbs are long. The toe discs are more rounded than the finger discs. The toes are moderately webbed. The holotype has light brown dorsal ground colour. There is a W-shaped mark between the eyes, an irregular dark brown spot in scapular region, a Œõ-shaped mark in sacral region, and numerous randomly distributed round dark brown spots on the head and body. A dark brown canthal stripe extends to tip of snout and a dark brown supra-tympanic stripe extends from corner of eye to anterior region of flanks. The limbs have brown transverse bars. The belly is yellowish laterally and white medially and has some randomly distributed round dark brown spots. The iris is bright orange. Manipulation of specimens changes their coloration: individuals became darker and spots and blotches became more conspicuous. Males have a subgular, bilobate vocal sac. The male advertisement call is a single short, multipulsed note with duration of 102‚àí121 ms. The tadpole in stage 37 measure in total length, of which the tail makes more than two thirds. Habitat and conservation Scinax onca is known from few lowland rainforest localities at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place during or after heavy rains at middle-sized or large temporary forest ponds. Males call from shrubs growing in water or next to water some above the ground. As of late 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not assessed this species, but Ferr√£o and colleagues suggest that is should be considered \\"data deficient\\". Reconstruction of the Trans- Amazonian Highway BR-319 and the associated immigration and deforestation represent serious potential threats to it. One population, however, occurs in theTapau√° State Forest, representing a refuge.

Protein This protein has more than one known point-mutation, one being A53T where amino acid residue 53 is mutated from its native alanine to a threonine. Wild-type alpha-synuclein fibrils are known to be the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are found in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients. The A53T mutation has been shown have faster kinetics of fibrilization than the wild-type protein. A53T alpha-synuclein has also been linked to early on-set familial Parkinson's disease. Advancements in technology have allowed the development of transgenic mice expressing A53T alpha-synuclein that have been used in multiple studies on Parkinson's disease. Wild-type alpha-synuclein has been shown to form oligomeric species termed protofibrils before forming full fibrils. Research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that the oligomeric protofibril species is neurotoxic rather than the fibrillar species. Electron microscopy has revealed that the A53T mutant protein formed annular and tubular protofibrils easily, whereas the wild-type protein formed annular protofibrils only after extended incubation. This early on-set mutation has been shown to increase the protofibril population that, if toxic, would increase the amount of the toxic species in the brain. There is clinical significance in studying the effects of A53T alpha-synuclein on the protofibrillar species as it may be a relevant therapeutic target in treating early on-set Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

Through temporal shift, other areas are made visible. A pulse-cross is the representation of normally invisible portions of an analog video signal on a studio screen for error analysis. Only part of the video signal contains image information: with an analog 625-line video signal, each field lasts 20 ms. Of these, only 18.4 ms (287.5 lines) are provided for image information; the remaining 1.6 ms (25 lines) form the vertical blanking interval, a time reserved for the vertical retrace of the electron beam. Likewise, of the 64 Œºs of each line, only 52 Œºs contain image information; the remaining 12 Œºs form the horizontal blanking interval for the horizontal retrace. These blanking intervals are thus outside the picture. A pulse-cross circuit delays synchronization in the monitor, shifting the image to the left or up. This will reveal areas of the video signal that are usually outside the image. In addition, the circuit reduces the contrast of the image, so that the sync pulses are also shown, where the voltage is below the black level. In a standard-compliant video signal, the vertical synchronization signal consists of five long pulses of 59.3 Œºs duration and is framed by five 2.35 Œºs short pulses before and after, the pre-equalizing pulses. Home computers, game consoles, etc. often do not provide a standard-compliant signal: the sync signal contains no gaps and no pre-equalizing pulses. A pulse-cross circuit will reveal these inaccuracies. For PAL color coding, the colorburst signal can be seen in the form of an orange bar. For a pure black and white signal, the burst is missing.

The Adam Smith Society has been described as having been formed \\"to achieve in business schools what the Federalist Society achieved in law schools, exposing students to the philosophical and moral underpinnings of capitalism\\", and has been compared with the Benjamin Rush Society in medical schools and the Alexander Hamilton Society in foreign policy education, based on the fact that \\"all three groups subscribe to principles of individual liberty, limited government, and free markets\\". The Society hosts events on public policy, business, entrepreneurship and technology with scholars, experts, and business leaders from across the ideological spectrum. Events have focused on technology, free trade, entrepreneurship, and the works of Adam Smith. In addition to chapter-based lectures, debates, and dinners, the Adam Smith Society has an annual meeting and leadership retreat in New York City; destination-based treks for members to learn about a particular subject; and one-off events, such as case competitions. History In late 2010, the Manhattan Institute partnered with the Marilyn G. Fedak Capitalism Project to establish the Adam Smith Society at elite U.S. business schools, with a goal to create a new organization to: Since 2011, the Adam Smith Society has expanded to more than 30 chapters at MBA schools, as well as professional chapters in major cities. In 2014, the Adam Smith Society collaborated with Encounter Books and James R. Otteson to publish an anthology of writings by Adam Smith and other important economic thinkers titled What Adam Smith Knew.James R. Otteson, What Adam Smith Knew: Moral Lessons on Capitalism from Its Greatest Champions and Fiercest Opponents (2014), p. 1. In fall 2017, the Society launched their first international professional chapter in London, United Kingdom. The Society's first international student chapter was founded at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel in May 2018. The Adam Smith Society is not directly related to the 19th century Adam Smith Society promoted by Italian economist and proponent of capitalism Francesco Ferrara,Manuela Mosca, \\"The 'industrial mentality' of Angelo Marescotti\\", in Associazione italiana per la storia del pensiero economico, Marco Enrico Luigi Guidi, Daniela Parisi, eds., The Changing Firm: Contributions from the History of Economic Thought (2005), p. 162.Cheng-chung Lai, Adam Smith Across Nations : Translations and Receptions of The Wealth of Nations (2000), p. 147. and to the International Adam Smith Society established in 1995, although it has some interests in common with each of these, and all share the same namesake. Chapters , the organization had nine city-based professional chapters and more than 30 student chapters. Professional chapters are located in Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, London, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Student chapters can be found at most of the top business schools across the United States, and in several other countries.

An awards ceremony highlights the winners of various competitive awards. The Principled Leadership Award is presented annually to a business leader who best embodies the Adam Smith Society. Past recipients include Cliff Asness and Kenneth C. Griffin. The April 2018 National Meeting featured a debate in partnership with Intelligence Squared U.S. on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, featuring Tim Draper, Patrick M. Byrne, Eric Posner, and Gillian Tett. Draper \\"was asked how Bitcoin compared with his previous tech investments\\" and gave a positive evaluation of the technology, estimating that it would be bigger than Hotmail, Skype, and Tesla combined. =Case competition= In 2018, the Society inaugurated an annual case competition allowing student chapters to compete against one another in devising a solution to a variety of business issues. All student chapters can apply to host the competition or send a team to compete. The first such competition was hosted, and won, by the Brigham Young University Marriott School of Business chapter. =Other programs= Chapters of the Society have hosted various speaking events on their respective campuses. In October 2016, the MIT Sloan School of Management chapter hosted Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo. In 2017, Time magazine noted that concerns were raised when political scientist Charles Murray was invited to speak at \\"an invitation-only address organized by the Vanderbilt chapter of the Adam Smith Society, an association for MBA students\\" a month after Murray had been aggressively confronted at an event at Middlebury College in Vermont. In February 2018, the Darden School of Business chapter had a Liberty Week, a \\"series of events exploring the role capitalism plays in global economic systems\\", including a speaking engagement by senior Economist editor Ryan Avent discussing the impact that continuing technological development would have on the economy.

Arthur Langhammer, Spring, ca. 1891. Arthur Langhammer (July 6, 1854 ‚Äì July 4, 1901) was a German Impressionist painter and illustrator best known for rural genre paintings. Biography Arthur Langhammer was born in L√ºtzen, Germany. He studied art first at the Leipzig Art Academy and then at the Munich Art Academy, graduating in 1882. He initially earned his living as an illustrator. In 1888 his friend Adolf H√∂lzel moved to the village of Dachau, Germany, and Langhammer began spending time there as well. In 1897, H√∂lzel, Langhammer and Ludwig Dill founded the \\"New Dachau\\" art school, which became the keystone of the burgeoning Dachau art colony. In 1898, the new colony achieved national recognition when H√∂lzel, Dill, and Langhammer mounted a joint exhibition in Berlin under the title \\"The Dachauer\\". Langhammer moved to Dachau permanently in 1900. Langhammer specialized in idealized rural genre paintings of people working in the fields or at home. He painted in an Impressionist style with vigorous brushwork and a rich color palette. He showed with the Munich Secession, and his work is now held by museums and galleries in Dachau, L√ºtzen and elsewhere. He died in Dachau.

Initially, she was in charge of safe houses where downed airmen were kept, nursed wounded airmen, helped prepare false identification cards, and connected airmen with escorts who would accompany them from Brussels to Spain, a roundabout distance of via train, bicycle, and foot. After nearly being captured by the Germans, she went underground, living in safe houses and with other members of the Comet Line. She had a false identification card which said she was 16 years old and a student. Being \\"pert\\" and \\"tiny\\" she appeared that age. According to one airman, she looked to be 12 or 13 years old. She emphasized her youth by dressing like a teenager, young students not being as suspicious to the Germans as older women. She spoke some English which made her suitable for interacting with Allied airman who only rarely spoke French.Eisner, Peter (2004), The Freedom Line, New York: William Morrow, pp 108-109\\"Micheline Dumon, esposa de Ugeux, Michou: guia,\\" p. 18, , accessed 5 Oct 2019 Unlike most Comet Line escorts who tried to be inconspicuous, Dumon was sometimes dramatic. \\"Fifty times or more [she] outwitted the German agents by suddenly enacting a tender, tearful love scene in a streetcar or on a station platform with some airmen she had only known for an hour or two. Encountering such a scene, the embarrassed German agent would pass on and ask no questions.\\"Watt, p. 130 With the near collapse of the Comet Line in June 1943 due to arrests by the Germans, Duman assumed more of a leadership position. \\"She became a sort of odd-job woman: looking for hide-outs, escorting pilots, recruiting new agents, collecting food coupons, restore[ing] the escape route after each wave of arrests.

Under the name Jean Masson he had become useful to the Comet Line in 1943 but had betrayed its leadership to the Germans, nearly destroying the organization. At a Comet Line meeting in February 1944 in Paris, Dumon met a familiar looking man who said his name was Pierre Boulain. He was wearing a polka dot necktie, and she recalled an admonition of her father, \\"If you see someone wearing something garish it could be a signal, so pay attention.\\" She didn't follow up on her suspicions immediately, but in March in Paris, during her brief incarceration, she had an opportunity to ask a Comet Line helper in prison the identity of her betrayer. The answer was Pierre Boulain, and she realized that Boulain was the same man who had betrayed the Comet line one year earlier under the name Jean Masson. She passed this information along to Jean de Blommaert and Albert Ancia, MI9 agents in France implementing Operation Marathon, who were incredulous. They had been favorably impressed by Boulain and were planning to give him 500,000 francs to establish a safe-haven camp for airmen in Belgium. They wanted more proof that he was a German agent. When the two MI9 agents met with Boulain/Desoubrie on May 7, Dumon observed the meeting from a distance and then followed Boulain. He detected her following him and realized that he was under suspicion as a German agent. He moved toward her and she ran, finding her way into a metro station and watching as he searched the station for her. As Boulain knew her identity, she realized the Gestapo would also soon know. She left for southwestern France the next day and Elvire de Greef arranged a quick exit over the border to Spain. From Spain the British flew her to England.\\"The Comet Line,\\" Histomil.com, , accessed 6 Oct 2019. The details of this story differ slightly among sources. Eisner, pp. 265-273.Watt, 137-138.

Dumon identified the man in the photos as Pierre Boulain/Jean Masson/Jacques Desoubrie.

It is roughly bounded by Farmington Avenue, South Whitney Street, West Boulevard, and Sisson Avenue, and includes a diversity of residential and commercial architecture, reflective of its initial development and subsequent growth. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history Hartford's West End, roughly from the Park River to the western city line, was primarily farmland until about 1870. By the early 1890s, the city's streetcar network had extended into the area, and the farmland was purchased by developers, platted, subdivided, and developed. Farmington Avenue developed as a commercial service area for the neighborhood, with residential areas to the north and south. South Whitney Street was laid out in 1897, and Sisson Avenue in 1900. Nearly 1/3 of the district's buildings were erected between 1890 and 1909, and development continued at a similar pace for the next two decades. The historic district extends along Farmington Avenue between South Whitney and Sisson Avenue, with only a few buildings on streets just north of Farmington. It extends along South Whitney, Sisson Avenue, and Evergreen Avenue, all the way to West Boulevard, and along the latter two nearly to Capitol Avenue. Most of its buildings are residential two-story structures, of which the majority are wood frame construction. Stylistically they are diverse, using the architectural vocabulary of revival styles popular at the time. Residences are typically set on small lots with uniform setbacks and scale, giving those areas a unified streetscape.

The series is written and directed by Patrick Graham and jointly produced by Jason Blum, Anurag Kashyap, Ryan Turek, Vikramaditya Motwane, Michael Hogan, Kilian Kerwin, John Penotti and Suraj Gohill under their respective banners Blumhouse Productions, Phantom Films and Ivanhoe Pictures. The story is set in India in a dystopian future where fascism is at its top, and the story's main plot is the interrogation of a dreaded terrorist Ali Saeed in a secret government internment camp that ignites a series of horrifying and supernatural events in the aftermath. Radhika Apte plays the main character Nida Rahim supported by Manav Kaul, Ratnabali Bhattacharjee, S. M. Zaheer, Mahesh Balraj, Rohit Pathak and Mallhar Goenka in prominent roles. The miniseries was conceived based on a dream Graham had seen. Originally meant to be the first of 3 films in a deal between three production houses, Netflix acquired the production in February 2018 after Graham felt that a longer format would be better and had it turned into a miniseries. Ghoul released to positive reviews from critics, with praise to the performances and storyline.  Premise  Nida Rahim (Radhika Apte) is a newly recruited military officer who is fiercely loyal to the authoritarian regime and is ready to go to any limit to prove her faith in the existing system to cleanse the society for a better future. She is appointed at a covert military detention centre to interrogate Ali Saeed (Mahesh Balraj), the most dreaded terrorist who has been recently captured and brought in for interrogation. However, he turns the tables on his interrogators, exposing their most shameful secrets. Rahim comes to the conclusion that Ali Saeed is not from this world and is possessed by some supernatural entity.  Cast  * Radhika Apte as Nida Rahim * Manav Kaul as Colonel Sunil Dacunha * S. M. Zaheer as Shahnawaz Rahim * Ratnabali Bhattacharjee as Major Laxmi Das * Mahesh Balraj as Ali Saeed * Resh Lamba as Sinister Man * Mallhar Goenka as Subedar Babloo * Rohit Pathak as Captain Lamba * Robin Das as Maulvi (Muslim Cleric) * Surender Thakur as Faulad Singh Development Mumbai-based British filmmaker Patrick Graham, who has made a few short films, saw a dream where an inmate enters a prison and manages to terrify the guards and the fellow prisoners. Graham wrote down the dream and developed it into a script. He also read several CIA documents about torture techniques used after 9/11 and at Camp X-Ray and the reports of military centres in Kashmir. He had a dream about being in an Abu Ghraib-like torture centre in Iraq. And then he thought, \\"‚ÄòWhat if an inmate came in and he was scarier than the place, scarier than the guards, scarier than the other prisoners and there‚Äôs something weird about him?\\" On 3 September 2014 Blumhouse Productions, Phantom Films and Ivanhoe Pictures announced a partnership deal for creating local language horror films in India. The first of three films from the partnership is Ghoul written and directed by Patrick Graham. Radhika Apte and Manav Kaul are starring in the film. Graham later felt a longer format would do more justice to the story. It was supposed to be a film and was later turned into a three episode miniseries after Netflix came on board in February 2018. Kaul called it a \\"blessing in disguise\\" as it gave them the breathing room to add a bit more backstory. Graham said that he wanted to take a \\"monster from mythology that hasn't been seen before\\" as he felt \\"Zombies, vampires and werewolves have been done to death.\\" While reading on Arabic folklore's, he came across the ghoul, which he felt \\"fit perfectly because of its characteristics\\". He said that some back story of the characters were added once the film was turned into a miniseries. The dialogues were written by Kartik Krishnan. Some scenes were filmed before Phantom Films, Blumhouse Productions and Ivanhoe Pictures began talks with Netflix. Graham said he was always fascinated by dystopian future and decided to create an \\"oppressive, claustrophobic story\\". He researched the origins of ghoul in Arabic folklore and drew on a couple of things: the Jinn mythology and how one can summon it but it may or may not be on your side, and the supernatural powers such as being able to see people's guilt and using that against them. He said that the \\"main bulk of the story came first, and the atmosphere we wanted to create came after.\\" Kaul played the role of Colonel Sunil Dacunha, who is a patriotic person and has a strained relationship with his family. Apte played the role of newly appointed interrogator, Nida Rahim. Apte was drawn to Rahim's belief system, the strength of her faith, and her way of thinking, which she found to be \\"quite the opposite of what my way of thinking is\\". She also liked \\"her investigation into her own life\\". S. M. Zaheer plays the role of Shahnawaz Rahim, who is the father of Nida Rahim. Ratnabali Bhattacharjee essays the role of Laxmi, a prejudiced interrogation officer.  Production  Principal photography began in June 2016. The series was shot in 14 hours a day for over a month in a place which Apte described as a \\"leaky, damp, and horrible smelling place with no sunlight\\". Graham wrote the script in English and had the dialogues translated to Hindi. Since he is a Britisher, Graham faced some problems while filming Ghoul, as the crew consisted of mostly Hindi speakers. He talked about the scene to actors in English and rehearsed it. He said: \\"I had two people sat with me at the monitors and monitor the dialogues and make sure the intonation and how things were being said sounded correct.\\" Graham minimised the use of jump scares in the series as he felt they \\"diffuse tension\\" and so \\"you need to limit how often you rely on them.\\" The cast did several one-on-one sessions and a 15-day rehearsal of scenes. Kaul did the extensive military training and also worked on how to talk, walk, hold the gun like a military personnel. Jay Oza served as the director of photography and Nitin Baid is the editor. The location of the filming was at the Tulip Star Hotel in Mumbai. Parts of the hotel were made to look like the interrogation chamber.https://www.architecturaldigest.in/content/netflix-on-the-set-of- ghoul-horror-web-series-radhika-apte/#s-cust0 Episodes Marketing and release The miniseries was released on 24 August 2018 by Netflix. They advertised by painting a ghoul symbol over already existing posters of Sacred Games in India. The series was screened on 22 August 2018 in Mumbai. Reception Ghoul received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregated website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 86% of critics have given the series a positive review based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.14/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Short, spooky, and surprisingly poignant, Ghoul concentrated brand of horror is familiar, but effective.\\" Sampada Sharma of The Indian Express called the series \\"unnerving\\" that \\"tackles social change vis a vis religion in an effective and dramatic way.\\" Swetha Ramakrishnan of Firstpost called the series \\"atmospheric, partly disturbing but fully gripping.\\" Adamya Sharma of Digit wrote: \\"These sort of shows demand the kind of critical thinking that audiences in India desperately need to sift invigorating content from the clutter of soap operas.\\" Saraswati Datar of The News Minute opined, \\"In a global environment where regimes in India and abroad are trying to make countries 'great' again or bring back 'ache din', Ghoul sounds a warning bell of the dangerous consequences of state sponsored intolerance\\". Sushant S Mohan of CNN-News18 praised Bhattacharjee and Balraj's performances and called them the \\"surprise package\\". He further called it an \\"innovative\\" series despite its predictability. Dipti Kharude of The Quint wrote: \\"The three-part Indian original horror miniseries may not have been successful in spinning a flawless and chilling yarn but breathes new life in the horror genre with its subversive plot.\\" Rohan Naahar of Hindustan Times praised the series and wrote: \\"The elements are all there - a blazingly original idea, Jay Oza‚Äôs claustrophobic and atmospheric visuals, and a strong, simmering performance by Netflix‚Äôs favourite Indian child, Radhika Apte - but Ghoul, the show, much like its namesake demon, suffers from an identity crisis.\\" Akhil Arora of NDTV praised Balraj's performance the pacing but felt the series is \\"let down by its reliance on cliched genre writing such as characters behaving stupidly for the sake of the plot or falling prey to narrative convenience towards the end to drive up the tension.\\" Siddhant Adlakha of IGN called it a \\"gloriously depraved work\\" and wrote: \\"It‚Äôs the kind of horror where security cameras and sound visualizers build to scares, rather than delivering them at a distance.\\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV praised the performances of the cast and wrote that the series is \\"bolstered by acting of the highest quality\\". Kayla Kumari Upadhyay of Thrillist wrote: \\"[..] Ghoul pulls from Arabic folklore to craft a tense, tightly edited monster movie with a fantastic leading woman.\\" Suhani Singh of India Today called it a \\"camp horror albeit not a thrilling one.\\" Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in felt that the \\"characters are as unconvincing as the treatment\\" and said that the series is \\"neither scary nor convincing\\". Ankur Pathak of HuffPost felt the writing was \\"expository\\" as well as the dialogues were \\"over-written and verbose.\\" He however praised the background score. Alaka Sahani of The Indian Express called it \\"a fine example of using cross-cultural elements to aid storytelling.\\" She further wrote: \\"This subversive show, can be a precursor to content that not only offer chills but also effectively deliver socially- relevant tales.\\" Melissa Camacho of Common Sense Media opined that the series \\"feels a bit uneven, with some segments focusing more on political commentary\\" and felt that the backstories of characters other than Nida were \\"rich with potential\\", but unexplored. She concluded, \\"[T]here's an interesting story here, and one that is worth the watch if you are looking for a compelling, truly scary viewing experience\\". Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine felt that by converting a feature film into a miniseries, the series \\"constantly dips into redundant exposition, all the while eliding emotional textures that might complicate the smooth delivery of unoriginal plotting.\\" A review carried by the IANS called it \\"all atmosphere, no substance\\". Tanul Thakur of The Wire praised the series and cited it as \\"cinematically rich, politically aware ‚Äì that, one hopes, will set a precedent.\\" Raja Sen wrote: \\"Despite compelling cinematography and very slick sound design, this is a derivative (and predictable) B-movie that has been stretched‚Äîfor no reason I can think other than risking the wrath of ticket-bearing theatregoers‚Äîinto a dull three- parter.\\" The Editorial team of Thousand Miles wrote, \\" In short, Ghoul is a horrifying tale with a twisting plot that narrates a story magnificently deeper than the random average haunted tales.\\"  References   External links  * Indian television series distributed by Netflix 2010s horror television series Hindi-language Netflix original programming Indian mystery television series Indian action television series Indian thriller television series Indian horror fiction television series 2018 Indian television series debuts 2010s Indian television miniseries Dystopian television series Demons in television ","title":"Ghoul (miniseries)"},{"id":"55878119","text":"Gladys Afamado (born 24 May 1925) is a Uruguayan visual artist, engraver, and poet. A member of the Montevideo Engraving Club since 1954, she has contributed to many of its monthly editions and almanacs. She later ventured into different plastic artforms, and in recent years has been recognized for her work in digital art. Biography Gladys Afamado was the second of five children of Isaac Isidoro Afamado, a Jewish immigrant based in Montevideo, and his wife Julia, the daughter of Italian immigrants, born in Dolores, Soriano. She attended public school, and in her home she received an open and free education, in which art, letters, and music were encouraged. His sister Ethel Afamado has had a distinguished career in music and poetry. She received artistic training with Adolfo Pastor and Domingo Bazzurro at the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes and at the National School of Fine Arts between 1940 and 1950. Later she took ceramics courses with Duncan Quintela and screen printing with Rimer Cardillo. She studied semiotics with Jorge Medina Vidal and literature with Jorge Arbeleche. From 1945 to 1950 she studied violin with Beatriz Tusset, and in 1951 and 1952 she participated in the \\"Anfi√≥n\\" chamber orchestra directed by Tusset. The 1974 almanac of the Montevideo Engraving Club, titled Canci√≥n con todos, with Gladys Afamado's cover, was censored and removed from circulation by the de facto government. In 1984, she traveled to Spain on a competitive scholarship, where she attended a paper craft course in Capellades, with Laurence Barker and Frederic Amat, material that she would later use in her works. In 1986, she took a postgraduate course in metal engraving at the National Museum of Visual Arts, taught by David Finkbeiner of the State University of New York at Purchase. Afamado's work is known for female figures with large eyes that look directly at the viewer, characteristic of the stage of the editions of the Montevideo Engraving Club. In 2016, the National Museum of Visual Arts organized an anthological exhibition of her work, curated by Mar√≠a Eugenia Grau.

The dynamics of the massacre General Dalla Chiesa was leaving the prefecture on a beige A112, led by his wife Emanuela Setti Carraro to go to dinner at a restaurant in Mondello. The A112 was followed by an Alfetta guided by the escort agent Domenico Russo. At 21:15, as they passed via Isidoro Carini, a motorcycle, led by a killer who had the mafioso Pino Greco sitting behind him, flanked the Alfetta, where Greco killed him with an AK-47 rifle.Shock Therapy Time Magazine, September 20, 1982 At the same time a car, led by Antonino Madonia and Calogero Ganci, reached the A112 and the killers violently opened fire against the car. Dalla Chiesa and his wife were hit by thirty bullets and the car slammed into the trunk of a parked Fiat Ritmo (the general tried to protect the woman with his own body). Greco got off the motorcycle and, turning around the A112 checked the mortal outcome of the incident and shot the victims in the head with a pistol. Immediately after, the car and the motorcycle used in the crime were brought to an isolated place and were burned. Dalla Chiesa's spouse died instantly, while agent Domenico Russo died twelve days later, on 15 September. 150px 150px 150px  Motivations  The general had led as head of the special anti-terrorism centre of the Carabinieri, starting from September 1978, the counteroffensive of the state on extreme left-wing groups, in particular the Red Brigades with remarkable results. He had begun the process of disintegration of the terrorist phenomenon in Italy that would be definitively concluded after his death. In virtue of his achievements, high prestige earned on the field, he was sent to Palermo as prefect of the city after the murder of the unionist and communist political man Pio La Torre. In the three years before his establishment, the Mafia had murdered among others skilled detectives, magistrates and political men such as Boris Giuliano, Cesare Terranova, Piersanti Mattarella and Gaetano Costa. But Dalla Chiesa, in just over one hundred days as prefect in Palermo, did not have the promised and better defined \\"special powers\\" by the Government, complaining in August 1982 in a famous and controversial interview given to journalist of the newspaper La Repubblica Giorgio Bocca. In the former Province of Palermo was also the so-called Second Mafia War, in which the Corleonesi massacred their enemies to take control of the organization. The massacre also surprised for the \\"military\\" mode with which it was executed: Dalla Chiesa and his wife were hit by a Kalashnikov AK 47, an assault rifle. Since the murder of Dalla Chiesa, the hypothesis, journalistic, historical and judicial (even if it was debated at the hearing both in the Giulio Andreotti trial for the external participation in mafia association in the murder of the journalist Carmine Pecorelli) that the death of the general and his wife is in some way also related to the memorial prepared by Aldo Moro during his seizure.

Throughout thousands of years, wars played a great role in shaping the identity and culture of people inhabited the land which is modern day Vietnam. Early period From the beginning of the founding of the Vietnamese Nation in the 1st millennium BC, the H√πng Vuong period spawned many legends of fighting against seaborne invasions of Quynh Chau (now China) from the north and Ho Ton (later to become Champa) from the south. During the era of the Kingdom of √Çu L·∫°c, when the C·ªï Loa Citadel was constructed, King An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng relied on the Hoang Giang River as a natural fortification to protect the south flank of the cidatel. In the 6th century, Emperor L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø built naval forces to fend off the invasion of Liang dynasty's (China) forces in the T√¥ L·ªãch River, Dien Triet lake; and then, King Tri·ªáu Quang Ph·ª•c used guerrilla tactics against the Chinese military at Da Trach lagoon (Kho√°i Ch√¢u, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng). In the 10th century, the Imperial Vietnamese Navy became a regularised force. Naval forces of Kh√∫c Th·ª´a D·ª• in Hong Chau (now Ninh Giang District, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng), D∆∞∆°ng ƒê√¨nh Ngh·ªá in Ai Chau, Thanh H√≥a and of King Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn himself were raised by enlisting and training the fishermen along rivers and seasides. Those elements became well-trained and experienced naval forces, ready to protect the country. Dynastic period Model of 17th century gunboat In L√Ω-Tr·∫ßn dynasty era, the dynasties were occupied with raising naval forces and naval bases. Particularly, the V√¢n ƒê·ªìn port had an important role in protecting the northeast territorial waters of Vietnam. In 1075 L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát mobilised a fleet to ferry 50,000 marines across the Gulf of Tonkin to invade Qinzhou, China. The amphibious assault was well planned and executed with incredible speed that Qinzhou's garrison was totally taken by surprise. The fortress town was taken in one night. To retaliate, the Song dynasty of China mustered a huge invasion force, with a naval arm to provide support to land operations. They were already fearful of Vietnam's reputation at sea combat, thus a large enough force was organised so as to \\"not lose even if they can't score a win\\". L√Ω K·∫ø Nguy√™n, a Vietnamese commander stationed in V√¢n ƒê·ªìn, Qu·∫£ng Ninh, however, had absolute confidence in his fleet that he went on the offensive and took on the Chinese invasion fleet on the high sea. L√Ω defeated the Chinese so badly that their admiral sent messengers to urge Chinese coastal guards to fortify their post in fear of a reverse-invasion. In 1077, the Imperial Vietnamese Navy fought the Battle of C·∫ßu River against the Chinese Song dynasty forces. This was the final battle Song dynasty would fight on Vietnamese land or waters. The battle lasted for several months, and ended with the victory of the Vietnamese Navy and the loss of many Song sailors. This victory demonstrated the successful tactics of war and active defence of the famous Admiral L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát who faced a naval force numerically superior to his own. The Song dynasty lost a total of 8,000 soldiers/sailors and 5.19 million ounces of silver, including all costs of the war. The ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω to√†n th∆∞ records that in 1467 in An Bang province of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (now Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province) a Chinese ship blew off course onto the shore. The Chinese were detained and not allowed to return to China as ordered by Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng.Cooke (2011), p. 108 This incident may be the same one where Wu Rui was captured.Cooke (2011), p. 109 One of the renowned victories in Vietnamese naval history was the Battle of R·∫°ch G·∫ßm-Xo√†i M√∫t in T√¢y S∆°n dynasty, during which Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá (Emperor Quang Trung) defeated the Siamese (Thai) naval force. The battle occurred in present-day Ti·ªÅn Giang Province on 19 January 1785. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá's forces completely destroyed over 50,000 Siamese sailors and 300 warships. Model of warship used by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá in the Battle of R·∫°ch G·∫ßm-Xo√†i M√∫t In the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty period, 19th century Nguyen Emperor Gia Long used his new Chu Su Naval workshop to improve the Vietnamese Navy. Gia Long had first attempted to acquire modern naval vessels in 1781, when on the advice of Bishop Pigneau de Behaine, he had chartered Portuguese vessels of European design, complete with crew and artillery. This initial experience proved to be disastrous. For reasons that remain unclear, two of the vessels fled in the midst of battle against the T√¢y S∆°n, while angry Vietnamese soldiers killed the third crew. In 1789, Pigneau de Behaine returned to Vietnam from Pondicherry with two vessels, which stayed in the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty service long-term. Over time, Vietnamese sailors replaced the original French and Indian crew under the command of French officers. These vessels became the foundation for an expanded military and merchant Nguy·ªÖn dynasty naval force, with Gia Long chartering and purchasing more European vessels to reinforce Vietnamese-built ships. However, traditional Vietnamese- style galleys and small sailing ships remained the majority of the fleet. In 1799, a British trader by the name of Berry reported that the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty's fleet had departed Saigon along the Saigon River with 100 galleys, 40 junks, 200 smaller boats and 800 carriers, accompanied by three European sloops. In 1801, one naval division was reported to have included nine European vessels armed with 60 guns, five vessels with 50 guns, 40 with 16 guns, 100 junks, 119 galleys and 365 smaller boats. French ships invaded Saigon with the brig L'Esperance that was sunk in 1861 by Nguy·ªÖn Trung Tr·ª±c's naval forces In the middle of the 19th century, the Vietnamese Navy fought against the French in many battles. Due to disadvantages in technology, the Vietnamese Navy could not defeat the French Navy, but there were still several battles during which the Vietnamese Navy caused heavy damages to the French. The Vietnamese were especially successful in the Battle of Nhat Tao canal held by Nguy·ªÖn Trung Tr·ª±c on 10 December 1861. Nguy·ªÖn Trung Tr·ª±c's naval forces ambushed the French brig L'Esperance at the Vam Co River, Mekong Delta. Truc's 150 men were grouped into three columns. The first group of 61 sailors under Hoang Khac Nhuong was to attack a nearby pro-French village to provoke an incident and lure the French forces into an ambush. Truc commanded the second group of 59 partisans along with Vo Van Quang, and was assigned to burn and sink the vessel. A third force of 30 sailors was commanded by Ho Quang and Nguyen Van Hoc. Due to the surprise attack, the French Navy suffered major damage: the brig L'Esperance was sunk, 17 French sailors and 20 pro-French Vietnamese naval auxiliaries were killed, only eight people escaped, including two French sailors and six sailors of Tagal (Filipino) background employed by the French.

The Soviet Union and the German Reich fought each other on the Eastern Front (1941-1945) during the war. The Allies also launched other operations - especially involving the Royal Navy - against the traffic. June and July Offensive An important element for the Soviet operation was the small island of Lavansaari, located in the Gulf of Finland and able to accommodate the incoming submarines from Leningrad (under siege) as final step before the attempt to penetrate the Axis minefields. Despite neutrality during the WW2, Sweden agreed to the German request to laying extra fields of mines in Swedish waters. The first Soviet attack group consisted in 10 submarines departing from June 1942. http://kotisivut.fonet.fi/~aromaa/Navygallery/ * ShCh-304 scored no result without breaking through Axis defenses. * M-97 lost during a reconnaissance mission probably due mine. * ShCh-317 sunk Finnish merchant Argo, Swedish merchant Ada Gorthon and German merchant Otto Kords. Damaged Danish merchant Orion. Sunk by Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi on 14 July 1942. * ShCh-405 probably lost due mine. * ShCh-320 sunk German merchant Anna Karin Fritzen. * ShCh-406 damaged German schooner Fides. * ShCh-303 damaged German merchant Aldebaran. * S-4 scored no success. * S-7 sunk Swedish merchants Margareta and Lulea. Sunk German merchant Kathe and Finnish merchant Pohjanlahti. She scored the best success among Soviet submarines of the first group. August and September Offensive The second Soviet attack group consisted in other 10 submarines, departing from August 1942. * M-96 scored no success * M-97 sunk by Finnish boat VMV-5 or mine. Only loss of this group. * M-102 scored no success. * L-3 sunk Swedish merchant Liljevalch. Laid a field of 20 mines off Sassnitz. On these mines was sunk the German merchant Franz Bohmke. * ShCh-407 damaged by air attack and forced to return without results. * ShCh-323 heavily damaged by mine and forced to return without results. * Lembit heavily damaged German merchant Finland. Heavily damaged by escort and forced to return. * ShCh-309 sunk Finnish merchant Bonden. * ShCh-310 sunk German merchant Franz Rudolf. Damaged while returning by mine. * S-13 sunk Finnish merchants Hera and Jussi H. Sunk Dutch merchant Anna W. October Offensive The successes scored by Soviet submarines during the early stage of the campaign prompted a reaction in terms of deployment by Finland of their own submarines Vesihiisi, Vetehinen and Iku-Turso in anti-sub operations. The Soviet offensive in October involved the larger number of submarines (16) but suffered heavier losses with half of the units lost in action, scoring less success.http://kotisivut.fonet.fi/~aromaa/Navygallery/ * S-9 damaged German tanker Mitteleer. * S-12 damaged Geran tanker Sabine Howaldt and merchant Malgache. * ShCh-308 probably lost on mines. * D-2 sunk German merchant Jacobus Fritzen and damaged German merchant Deutschland. * ShCh-307 sunk Finnish merchant Betty H. Despite being chased by Finnish submarines (especially Iku-Turso) managed to return home. * ShCh-303 scored no result. * S-7 sunk by Vesihiisi. 4 prisoners, including the commander. * ShCh-406 sunk Swedish merchant Bengt Sture and Finnish merchant Agnes. *L-3 laid fields of mines at Irben Sound, Libau and Ut√∂. On these mines was lost the German merchants Hindenburg and Edith Bosselmann . In February 1943 the German merchants Tristan and Grundsee were also lost on this area, possibly sunk on old mines from the field. * M-96 attempted twice to attack Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi but failed. * ShCh-302 sunk by mine and Finnish SB bomber. * ShCh-304 probably lost on mines. * ShCh-305 rammed and sunk by Finnish submarine Vetehinen * ShCh-306 probably lost on mines. * ShCh-311 sunk with depth charges by Finnish patrol boats VMV-13 and VMV-15 * ShCh-320 claimed as sunk by Finnish submarine Iku-Turso but most likely sunk on mines earlier according to Russian sources. Outcome The overall number of ships sunk by Soviet submarine during this campaign has been evaluated to 18 ships totaling 37 789 tons, in addition to 10 vessels damaged and 4 vessels sunk by mines laid by submarines (in addition to another possible two sunk in 1943 on mines laid the previous year), while the Soviet forces lost 12 submarines with another 6 being damaged. Despite the heavy losses for few victories scored the Germans perceived the campaign as a threat due to the dwindling number of their transport ships and prepared stronger anti-submarine defenses for 1943. Old Soviet sources overestimated the victories scored to 51 vessels sunk (400.000 tons) All considered, the Soviet campaign was costly and managed to sink only a limited number of vessels but the operation accomplished in creating chaos in the Axis naval supply lines forcing alternate trade routes and investment in escort convoys (previously not assigned) and in greater anti-submarine defenses.http://kotisivut.fonet.fi/~aromaa/Navygallery/ Aftermath A Soviet repetition of a similar campaign was made for 1943, but Axis forces has been strengthened: the exit from the Gulf of Finland was blocked by anti-submarine nets and Soviet submarines suffered heavy losses without penetrating this blockade.

She served as a member of the External Advisory Committee for the NIH Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (2002-2012) and on Review Panels for Komen for the Cure, the DOD Breast Cancer Program, and on NIH graduate and postdoctoral fellowship review committees. She co-chaired the Hormone Action Gordon Research Conference in 1988 and the Keystone Symposium on The Nuclear Receptor Superfamily in 2002.  Research  Katzenellenbogen has clarified structure-function relationships and actions of estrogen receptors alpha and beta, and demonstrated that estrogens have a broad spectrum of effects on gene networks and pathways in breast cancer and other cells. This research has contributed to understanding of the molecular basis for the action of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen in target cells, and for the development of anti-hormonal treatments used in breast cancer treatment and prevention. Her laboratory demonstrated that estrogen receptors regulate and function along with multiple cell signaling pathways involving kinase cascades and growth factors, and that these inputs converge at the level of chromatin to regulate gene expression and cell signaling. This work presaged the current active interest in both the non-genomic actions of estrogens and the cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other cell signaling pathways and their roles in endocrine resistance. Her laboratory has also identified factors associated with aggressiveness and early time to cancer recurrence and their regulation in different subtypes of breast cancer. She has also characterized the activities of estrogens in menopausal hormone replacement therapies and diverse ligands for estrogen receptors, including environmental estrogens, phytoestrogens such as genistein, and estrogen receptor subtype-selective ligands in various estrogen target tissues.

Epichlo√´ typhina is found in Europe, but has been introduced widely in North America and elsewhere. It lives in association with a large number of grass species from multiple genera, including Anthoxanthum odoratum, Brachypodium phoenicoides, Brachypodium pinnatum, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, Milium effusum, Phleum pratense, Poa trivialis, Poa silvicola and Puccinellia distans. Epichlo√´ typhina appears to be seed-transmissible only in Puccinellia distans.  Subspecies  Epichlo√´ typhina has two subspecies and three varieties. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. clarkii (J.F. White) Leuchtm. & Schardl was first described in 1993. It is found in Europe in the grass species Holcus lanatus. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. clarkii is sexual, but not seed-transmissible. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. poae (Tadych, K.V. Ambrose, F.C. Belanger & J.F. White) Tadych was first described in 2012. It is found in Europe in the grass species Poa nemoralis and Poa pratensis, and in North America in Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia and Poa sylvestris. The sexual form has been observed on Poa nemoralis and Poa pratensis. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. poae is seed-transmissible in Poa nemoralis and Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia, but not in Poa pratensis. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. poae var. aonikenkana Iannone & Schardl was first described in 2017. It is found in Argentina (Santa Cruz) on Bromus setifolius. This variety is seed-transmissible, but the sexual stage has not been observed. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. poae var. canariensis (C.D. Moon, B. Scott, & M.J. Chr.) Leuchtm. was first described in 2000. It is found in the Canary Islands on Lolium edwardii. This variety is seed- transmissible, but the sexual stage has not been observed. Epichlo√´ typhina subsp. poae var. huerfana (J.F. White, G.T. Cole & Morgan-Jones) Tadych & Leuchtm. was first described in 1996. It is found in North America on Festuca arizonica. This variety is seed-transmissible, but the sexual stage has not been observed.

Light production in these single celled organisms is produced by small structures in the cytoplasm called scintillons. Among bioluminescent organisms, only dinoflagellates have scintillons. In the dinoflagellates, the biochemical reaction that produces light involves a luciferase-catalysed oxidation of a linear tetrapyrrole called luciferin. The dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra (previously called Gonyaulax polyedra) also contains a second protein called luciferin binding protein (LBP) that has been proposed to protect luciferin from non-luminescent oxidation. Luciferin is released from LBP by a decrease in pH, and the same decreased pH also activates the luciferase. Light production in the dinoflagellates occurs in bioluminescent organelles called scintillons and can be stimulated by agitation of the surrounding seawater. The name scintillon was first used to describe cytoplasmic particles isolated from a bioluminescent species of dinoflagellate that were able to produce a flash of light in response to a decrease in pH. Scintillons were first observed in L. polyedra by fluorescence microscopy, where they appear as small blue dots close to the cell surface. This blue fluorescence is due to the presence of the bioluminescence reaction substrate, a naturally fluorescent molecule called luciferin. When light production is stimulated by addition of dilute acid to the cells under the microscope, the site of light production corresponds to the location of the scintillons. Furthermore, the natural luciferin fluorescence is reduced after the light producing reaction. Cells observed under the electron microscope after a technique involving rapid freezing of the cells followed by substitution of water with a polymer (Fast-freeze Fixation/Freeze Substitution) contain a large number of electron dense bodies around the cell periphery. These structures correspond in size and location to the fluorescent bodies confirmed to be scintillons by their light emission, and they show colocalization of anti-luciferase and anti-LBP labeling meaning both bioluminescence proteins are found in the structures. Scintillons appear as cytoplasmic drops hanging in the vacuolar space, as they are almost completely surrounded by the vacuolar membrane. This structure led to the proposal that a voltage gated proton channel in the vacuolar membrane could allow an action potential to be propagated along the vacuolar membrane. This would in turn let protons enter into the cytoplasm around all the scintillons in the cells virtually simultaneously producing an intense but brief flash of light. Voltage gated proton channels were subsequently identified in a dinoflagellate confirming their predicted existence Scintillons have been extensively purified from L. polyedra by centrifugation, and these purified scintillon preparations contain luciferase and luciferin binding protein as the only detectable protein components. The amount of luciferase, LBP and luciferin all vary over the course of a daily (circadian) period, as do the number of scintillons in the cell. These observations suggest that the circadian control of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and degradation of luciferase and LBP. When synthesized, these two proteins aggregate together and migrate to the vacuole membrane where LBP binds luciferin and the scintillons acquires an ability to produce light upon stimulation. Scintillons are not identical in different species. Scintillons isolated from dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Pyrocystis such as P. lunula (previously Dissodinium lunula) or P. noctiluca are less dense than those of L. polyedra and do not contain LBP. Little is known about the structure or composition of scintillons in species other than L. polyedra.

First described in 1994, Epichlo√´ festucae is a sister lineage to Epichlo√´ amarillans, Epichlo√´ baconii, Epichlo√´ mollis and Epichlo√´ stromatolonga. Epichlo√´ festucae is found across North America, where it lives in the grass species Bromus kalmii and Elymus spp. (including Elymus patula). Genome The complete genome sequence of Epichlo√´ festucae, the first complete genome sequence of any species in the genus Epichlo√´, was reported in 2018. The 35 Mb genome comprises 7 chromosomes, ranging from 3.2 to 7.8 Mb, including approximately 9,000 genes. Varieties Epichlo√´ festucae strains can have both a sexual reproductive morph (teleomorph) and an asexual reproductive morph (anamorph). For this group, the anamorph forms were long classified separately: initially in the genus Acremonium, and after 1996, in the new genus Neotyphodium. Since 2011, the nomenclatural code has required that a single name be used for all stages of development of a fungal species, and following a taxonomic revision of the genus Epichlo√´ in 2014, the asexual forms of Epichlo√´ festucae are now classified as Epichlo√´ festucae var. lolii. Found across Europe, Asia and North Africa, and introduced in New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere, Epichlo√´ festucae var. lolii is associated with the grass species Lolium perenne subsp. perenne.

An interspecies allopolyploid of two haploid parent species Epichlo√´ typhina and Epichlo√´ festucae var. lolii (previously classified as Neotyphodium lolii), E. hybrida was first identified in 1989, recognized as an interspecific hybrid in 1994, but only formally named in 2017. Previously this species was often informally called Epichlo√´ typhina x Epichlo√´ festucae var. lolii, or referenced by the identifier of its most well-studied strain, Lp1. Epichlo√´ hybrida is a symbiont of perennial ryegrass where its presence is almost entirely asymptomatic. The species has been commercialized for the benefits of its anti-insect compounds in a pasture setting, although it is now more commonly used as an experimental model system for studying interspecific hybridization in fungi. The type specimen of E. hybrida is held in the American Type Culture Collection under holotype accession number TSD-66. Hybrid status A conidium of Epichlo√´ hybrida Lp1 stained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) showing that each cell contains only a single nucleus. The genus Epichlo√´ is characterized by the frequent formation of interspecific, typically asexual, allopolyploid species that are commonly referred to as hybrids. Haploid, sexual Epichlo√´ species usually carry only one homeolog ('gene copy') at a given genetic locus, but interspecific hybrids were originally identified by the presence of two or three homeologs, indicating their origin from two or three different parent species. As of 2016, Epichlo√´ had the most known interspecific hybrids of any fungal genus. Epichlo√´ hybrida was one of the first Epichlo√´ hybrids identified. Although the date of the hybridization event is not known with any certainty, an upper bound of ~300,000 years has been estimated. The colony morphology of E. hybrida Lp1 is a compact form with wavy edges, in contrast to the morphology of either parent. Conidia stained with DAPI, which binds to DNA, show only a single nucleus, confirming that E. hybrida is mononucleate and not simply an interspecies dikaryon. Culture morphology of the interspecies hybrid, Epichlo√´ hybrida, contrasted with two strains from its parent species, E. festucae var. lolii and E. typhina. Uniparental inheritance of mtDNA and rDNA With few exceptions, the full complement of nuclear genes appear to be inherited and retained from both parent species. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of E. hybrida is derived only from E. festucae var. lolii, while the ribosomal DNA only exists as the E. typhina rDNA sequence type, with the other parental type likely lost through concerted evolution. In consequence, the ribosomes of E. hybrida likely consist of E. typhina rRNA, but a mix of E. festucae var. lolii and E. typhina ribosomal proteins. Although the presence of divergently evolved ribosomal proteins might be expected to create poorly functioning ribosomes, most E. festucae var. lolii and E. typhina ribosomal protein genes have similar expression levels. It therefore appears that the gene expression of E. festucae var. lolii ribosomal proteins has not been suppressed despite the potential for ribosomal incompatibilities. History Epichlo√´ hybrida was first isolated from perennial ryegrass seeds collected as part of a national breeding program funded by the French Ministry of Agriculture in the early 1980s. Run by Gilles Charmet and Fran√ßois Balfourier at the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA) in Clermont-Ferrand, 547 natural ryegrass populations were sampled across France by INRA researchers and a national team of ten private breeders. A core collection of 110 accessions, including the E. hybrida source population, was transferred to INRA Lusignan in 2000, where it now forms the basis of the modern French perennial ryegrass breeding program. Accession F187 was collected in the summer of 1983 by Jo√´l Meunier, an employee of the French breeding company Ma√Øsadour, and as of 2016 was entered into the INRA collection under accession number #010204. The collection site was a natural meadow near the village of Bidache in the French administrative department of Pyr√©n√©es Atlantiques in southwestern France. Less than 30 km from the Atlantic coast and under 100 m in altitude, this area has hot summers and mild winters, and is very wet with substantial rainfall throughout the year. In the late 1980s, the INRA collection was shared with Sydney Easton, a plant breeder in what was then the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), and this New Zealand branch of the collection is now housed in the Margot Forde Germplasm Centre at the AgResearch Crown Research Institute. Accession F187 was recoded as accession A6056 at that time. An endophyte program aimed at systematically isolating agriculturally promising Epichlo√´ strains from this and other ryegrass seed collections was undertaken by Garrick Latch in the late 1980s/early 1990s. A ryegrass seedling from the INRA F187 seed lot was recognized as producing desirable anti-insect compounds. Originally called 187BB, E. hybrida Lp1 was identified in 1989 as the twenty-eighth isolate obtained from the seed batch. This isolate was placed within a group of Epichlo√´ strains known as _L_ olium _p_ erenne _T_ axonomic _G_ roup 2, LpTG-2, which the formal E. hybrida species definition is now expected to encompass.

Early life Ray Galbraith Fisher was born on 26 November 1940 at Redlands Hospital, Glasgow, the second of six daughters and third of seven children of John Fisher, a police inspector, and his wife, Marion \\"Morag\\" Fisher, n√©e Macdonald (1917‚Äì2008). Her father sang as a soloist in the City of Glasgow police choir, and her mother sang in Scots Gaelic. She was educated at Hyndland Secondary School, as was her brother Archie, and it was where she met Hamish Imlach, followed by Jordanhill Teacher Training College. Career Fisher began in the 1950s with a skiffle group alongside her brother Archie, before they became a folk duo, Ray and Archie Fisher. They were regulars at Norman Buchan's Glasgow Ballads Club, and it was through Buchan and his wife Janie, that Ray met Jeannie Robertson, who invited her to stay in Aberdeen, where she then spent six weeks learning about traditional Scottish folk songs. Ray and Archie later formed a trio, The Wayfarers, with singer/fiddler Bobby Campbell, and the Fisher Family, with their parents, their younger sister Cilla, and later Cilla's husband Artie Trezise. Ray and Archie both also had solo careers. She was a familiar bespectacled face on television music programmes, and appeared on BBC's Jools' Annual Hootenanny and STV's Here and Now.

She was among the first women scientists allowed to participate in research in Antarctica with the International Council for Science (ICSU), conducting research there beginning in 1963. Three lichen species Menegazzia wandae, Pseudocyphellaria wandae, and Strigula wandae have been named in her honor. The Latin American Group of Lichenology has created a prize in her name to recognize research excellence in the field of lichenology. Early life Wanda Quilhot Palma was born in Chile in 1930. As a child, she wanted to be a nurse, but after a childhood accident left her in a cast and with a traction device, forcing her to remain bedfast for five years, she changed her mind. Unable to study during her confinement, by the time she finished her secondary education, Quilhot was twenty-four. At the time, women were not encouraged to pursue university degrees, but her sister an uncle, Octavio Palma, a noted Chilean educator, advocated for her to pursue further education. In 1955, she enrolled in biology courses and worked at the newly created Institute of Zoological Research, under , finishing her degree in 1959. Career That same year, Quilhot began teaching as a professor of biology and natural sciences at the University of Chile. Winning a scholarship to attend the University of Paris and study plant physiology and algae in the Faculty of Sciences. After spending three years, studying, she left without finishing her PhD, because she missed her husband. In the summer season of 1963‚Äì1964, Quilhot and Nelly Lafuente become some of the first women to conduct research in Antarctica. Women had long been barred from working in Antarctica as it was assumed that they lacked the stamina and mental toughness to deal with the inhospitable climate and working conditions. In 1952 the International Council for Science began planning the International Geophysical Year 1957‚Äì1958 with the idea of including women scientists and Lafuente and Quilhot were the first two women from Chile to work in Antarctica. Working for the Instituto Antarctico Chileno at the Bernado O‚ÄôHiggins Station on the northeast edge of the peninsula, Lafuente evaluated bird reproduction, while Quihot, studied the local fauna. Quilhot's research focused on microfauna, and the bryophytes and soil-forming microorganisms which were causing degradation of the soil. The research she conducted in Antarctica created a fascination with lichens for Quihot, which became the focus of her work for the next forty years. She has studied with groups of international scholars researching various lichen species at diverse altitudinal and latitudinal environments, examining the different effects of UVA radiation and UVB radiation. She has written over 200 articles in scientific journals and three lichen species Menegazzia wandae, Pseudocyphellaria wandae, and Strigula wandae have been named in her honor. She teaches in the Faculty of Medicine in the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy, at the Universidad de Valpara√≠so. At the 12th Congress of the Latin American Group of Lichenology , held in Quito, Ecuador in 2016, she was awarded the Vainio Prize for her research on lichens and the Wanda Quilhot Palma Prize was established to recognize research excellence in the field of lichenology.

Excavated continuously since its discovery in 1978, it has produced many fossils dating to the late Early Pleistocene or Epivillafranchian geologic period, approximately 1.2 ‚Äì 0.9 million years before present (BP). Claims that hominins were also present at the site have sparked a major controversy.  Hominin controversy  In a series of papers published between 2013 and 2017, G√ºnter Landeck and Joan Garcia Garriga claimed to have found evidence for a hominin presence at the site in the form of stone tools and butchery marks on bones. If verified, this would be the earliest known occupation of northern Europe by humans, as previous evidence had indicated that Europe was only sporadically occupied, at southerly latitudes, before 500,000 BP. However, these findings have sparked a major controversy. Questions were immediately asked about the provenance of the material, since neither Landeck nor Garcia Garriga had any connection to the Untermassfeld project and had never worked on the excavations at the site. Further doubts were raised in October 2017, in the preprint of a paper authored by several palaeontologists and Palaeolithic archaeologists, including Wil Roebroeks and Ralf-Dietrich Kahlke, the director of the Untermassfeld excavations. The authors reported that they were unable to locate the collections Landeck and Garcia Garriga claim to have based their analysis on, even after contacting them. They alleged that the description of some of the bones discussed in Landeck and Garcia Garriga's papers match those in a package anonymously delivered to a local natural history museum; and that two bones matched specific pieces that were reported stolen from the site in 2009 and 2012. Based on a reanalysis of the material in the anonymous package and the details provided in their papers, they also argued that Landeck and Garcia Garriga had misidentified both the stone tools and the butchery marks. They concluded that there was no evidence of a hominin presence at Untermassfeld. Garcia Garriga has \\"strenuously denied\\" the allegations, stating that he had no connection to the material and had only helped write up Landeck's analysis. Landeck claimed that the material was shown to him by two unnamed private collectors who had found it during \\"rescue activities\\" near‚Äîbut not in‚Äîthe Untermassfeld site. Both told Nature that they had \\"nothing to do with a stolen bone\\" and were writing a detailed response to the allegations.

Family Anne Torcapel was born on 25 November 1916 in Eaux- Vives, now part of Geneva. She was the daughter of John Torcapel (1881‚Äì1965) and of Marthe Berthoud (1887-1964). Her mother was very cultivated, a musician and writer, although her writings have not survived. John Torcapel was the son of a watchmaker. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Geneva. He opened an office as an architect in 1924, and was mainly concerned with new housing in the canton of Geneva. He also undertook many enlargements and conversions of existing buildings. He became chairman of the Federation of Swiss architects. He was a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Geneva from 1930 to 1942 and professor at the School of Architecture of the University of Geneva from 1942 to 1953. He died on 21 July 1965, soon after his wife. Career From an early age Anne Torcapel frequented building sites. She never married. She began studies as a designer at the Geneva Engineering School in 1933, while also working in the engineer Dentan's office. In 1934 she moved to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva to study architecture. Her teachers included Arnold Hoechel, Louis Vincent and her father. In 1937 she obtained a certificate of capacity, with honours. In 1938 she obtained a diploma as architectural designer. As late as 1943 she was took industrial courses in the evening and obtained qualifications in building and wood. Anne Torcapel began working in her father's office in the 1940s, and also collaborated with Marie-Louise Leclerc (1911‚Äì2001), daughter of the architect Antoine Leclerc. By 1953 she had 15 years of professional experience. That year she became her father's partner, and was inscribed in the Swiss Register of engineers, architects and technicians. In 1956, she created the gynecology polyclinic and the operating theater of the Geneva maternity ward in collaboration with Marie-Louise Leclerc. She participated in the 1958 SAFFA (Geneva Pavilion). John Torcapel steadily reduced his activity and retired around 1960. Their only known joint work is the Temple of Onex, designed in the late 1950s. Anne Torcapel was involved with the Soroptimists, a system of local clubs and larger unions in which women from different professions engage in projects for women. The organization is philanthropic rather than militant. She represented architects in the Geneva club for several decades, and was long-term president of this club. She represented the Soroptimists in the Centre de liaison des associations f√©minines genevoises (CLAFG), and was Governor of the Swiss Soroptimists Union in 1952‚Äì53. Anne Torcapel took over her father's office around 1960. She experienced an episode of diabetic coma in 1986 which prevented her from completing two houses she was working on and severely affected her health. Two long-time associates, Pierre Gebel and Yves Rochat, took over the office. Anne Torcapel died on 29 January 1988 in Geneva. She was buried in Th√¥nex cemetery beside her parents. Principal works Ch√¢teau de Crans - Anne Torcapel undertook the conversion Anne Torcapel's work included at least 47 villas, 16 buildings, 10 other works and 30 transformations of existing buildings. She built for the elite families of Geneva and for the poorest, always with high quality. Evelyne Lang has proposed that Anne Torcapel's work exemplified a unique women's architectural design. * 1945-1948: renovations and transformations at the Taverne de la Madeleine (Geneva) - with Marie-Louise Leclerc * 1950-1956: enlargement of the Geneva maternity ward (west wing and polyclinic, making possible the presence of fathers during childbirth, destroyed in 2013) - with Marie-Louise Leclerc * 1951: annex and transformation to the La Rochette preventorium (Longirod) (converted building) * 1953: transformation of the nursery school Le Bon Secours (Geneva) * 1954: series of single-story villas with the engineer Lucien Duflon * 1955-1957: first villa of the writer Alix de Watteville (Cologny) * 1958: interior design of the Geneva Boutique of SAFFA 58 (Zurich) * 1959: second villa of the writer Alix de Watteville (Ch√™ne-Bougeries) * 1959: wings, outbuilding, swimming pool and garden pavilion at Ch√¢teau de Chignan (Vernier) * 1960-1968: real estate complex on Krieg avenue and rue P√©dro-Meylan (Geneva) - with Alfred Damay * 1961-1962: third villa of the writer Alix de Watteville (Cologny) * 1961-1962: social housing building for single women (quai des Vernets 5-7, Geneva) * 1962: \\"Le Clos des Sapins\\" holiday camp (Saint-Cergue) * 1962-1963: silo of Le Pallanterie and enlargement of the mills (V√©senaz) * 1962-1963: HLM buildings for the Protestant Parish (chemin Fran√ßois-Chavaz 3-5, Onex) * 1963-1964: Villa Bodmer * 1964: Villa Dottrens * 1964: Temple of Onex - with John Torcapel.

These \\"ghost ships\\" are believed to result from when North Korean fishermen are lost at sea and succumb to exposure or starvation. Analysis Ships at their home port in North Korea Fishing is a dangerous occupation worldwide; for example, the work-related fatality rate for Australian fisherman in one study was 143 per 100,000 person-years, which was 18 times the Australian national average work-related fatality rate. During the winter, North Korean fishing boats go out searching for king crab, squid and sandfish. Some of the boats appear to be either operated by soldiers or rented by the army to civilians. Fish is one of the main exports from North Korea to China. Wreckage from North Korean boats often washes ashore in northern Japan during winter due to seasonal winds. The ghost ships washing up without living crewmen typically are old, lack powerful modern engines, and have no GPS. A lack of food may play a role in crew death; with little food on board, exposure and starvation can become significant dangers. Scholars such as John Nilsson-Wright of Chatham House find it unlikely that the boats resulted from attempts to defect; given that South Korea has closer cultural and linguistic ties, and is closer to North Korea by boat than Japan is, defection via Japan rather than South Korea by boat is uncommon. There are a few, rare, precedents for defectors ending up near Japan. In 1987, eleven defectors drifted from North Korea to west Japan. In 2006, four defectors floated to northern Japan. In September 2011, nine defectors accidentally made a five-day voyage to Japanese waters in a small boat while attempting to travel to South Korea. An analyst quoted by the South China Morning Post stated that it is unlikely vessels are being used to infiltrate North Korean agents into Japan, as it would be easier for them to just use fake passports and put the agents aboard a flight or a ferry ship to Japan. Defectors aside, fishing boats with living crew have also washed up on Japanese shores. In November 2017, eight North Korean men and a broken boat were found on Japan‚Äôs northern coast; the men stated they had washed ashore after their boat broke down. =Chinese illegal fishing explanation= A Chinese large fishing vessel, far from China Chinese commercial fishermen have engaged in large scale squid fishing in North Korean waters in violation of U.N. sanctions which prohibit foreign fishing vessels from fishing in North Korean waters. The Chinese squid fishing fleet in North Korean waters has at times numbered up to 800 vessels and has caused a 70% decline in squid stock in those waters. According to Global Fisheries Watch ‚ÄúThis is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation‚Äôs waters.‚Äù The decline in the squid stocks as a result of this illegal fishing is also believed to be a contributing factor to the increase in North Korean ghost ships. This is believed to have forced North Korean fishermen to venture further from shore and stay out longer greatly increasing the risks of an already risky job. The so called ‚Äúdark fleet‚Äù of Chinese vessels has harvested half a billion dollars worth of squid in North Korean waters since 2017. Disposition Asked by the Los Angeles Times about fate of the boats and bodies in Wajima, local sources state that the unclaimed bodies are cremated and their ashes stored in a Buddhist compound. The boats are eventually dismantled, destroyed and incinerated. Statistics * 2011 ‚Äì First year for which official data is available from the Japanese Coast Guard; the counts from previous years may be similar, but no pre-2011 data is currently available. 57 boats reported in 2011; number of bodies is not disclosed. Because each piece of wreckage is counted as a separate incident, the number of boats may be overstated. Most are believed to be North Korean in origin, due to the typical lettering, the primitive nature of the boats, and occasionally other clues; however, it cannot be ruled out that some of the boats could be from South Korea or elsewhere. * 2012 ‚Äì 47 boats reported. * 2013 ‚Äì 80 boats reported. * 2014 ‚Äì 65 boats reported. * 2015 ‚Äì 34 boats reported for the year to date, as of November 27 2015. According to the NHK, the wrecks reported in October and November contain the remains of 25 bodies total. The coast guard stated that the bodies were badly decomposed; one boat contained six skulls, suggesting the boat had been adrift a long time. * 2016 ‚Äì Around 24 boats reported to reach the Japanese coast, according to Fox News. Sky News reported 66 or more boats, including boats found drifting off the coast. * 2017 ‚Äì A record 104 boats with at least 31 bodies (and at least 42 survivors) were reported, including a 22-foot wooden boat containing eight skeletonized bodies found in late November. Analysts quoted by Fox News attributed the increase in North Korean ghost ships to North Korean food shortages and to mounting sanctions against Kim Jong Un. * 2018 - 89 boats with 12 bodies were reported for the year to date, as of 13 November 2018. * 2019 - At least 156 boats were reported. In one case, seven bodies washed up on the island of Sado on December 28 2019. North Korean ghost ships have also been reported in the Russian Far East.

It was declared in 1784 and ceased to exist in 1808, after being occupied by the Kokand Khanate. The capital of the country was Tashkent.  History  = Background = In the middle of the 18th century, a troubled period occurred in the history of Tashkent, when the city was at the crossroads of the interests of the Kalmyk Khanate, Kazakh Khanate, Kokand Khanate, and, to a lesser extent, Emirate of Bukhara. The city repeatedly passed from one ruler to another. In addition, there was an internecine war of four parts of the city ‚Äì dakhas: Kukcha, Sibzar, Sheykhantaur and Beshagach. The head of each of them ‚Äì hakim  sought to subdue other regions. By the 1780s, lengthy and bloody strife became intolerable. Many people of Tashkent voted for the creation of a single independent state, which would have a beneficial effect on trade and handicraft. At the same time, the Sheykhantaur hakim died, transferring the power to his son, Yunus Khoja. = Yunus Khoja's reign = In 1784, the rivalry of the four parts of Tashkent resulted in an armed clash. The battle took place near a city bazaar, in a ravine, along which flows the Bozsu channel. This section of the channel became known as \\"Djangob\\" ‚Äì \\"stream of battle\\". The victory was won by Yunus Khoja, and the posad recognized his authority over the whole city. As a residence, the ruler chose a fortress that stood on the dais on the bank of the Chorsu aryk (later this area has been named Karatash). The Institute of the Four Hakims (Charkhakim) was abolished, although the division into the dakhas was preserved.

It traced its origins back to an artillery battery of the Russian Civil War that was expanded into a battalion and a regiment between the wars. At the end of the 1930s it was relocated to Moscow as the 193rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and provided air defense for the city during World War II. It was converted into the 72nd Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment in November 1942, and expanded into the 1st Guards Anti- Aircraft Artillery Division in June 1943. The division covered a sector of the air defense of the city until its disbandment in 1960.  Before 1941  The division traced its history back to the formation of the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Railway Battery of the Steel Putilov Battalion in November 1917 at the Putilov Factory, shortly after the October Revolution. The unit was formed in order to provide air defense against the aviation of anti-Bolshevik forces, and included workers from the Putilov Factory. The battery saw action in the suppression of Pyotr Krasnov's attempt to restore the Russian Provisional Government, and on 13 March 1918 claimed two German Albatros fighters downed near Pskov. From November it fought against the North Russia Intervention in the Russian Civil War as part of the 6th Army, claiming eight aircraft downed. For its \\"courage and valor\\" in battles at Plesetsk station in October and November 1919, the battery was awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner on 7 February 1920. It subsequently fought against the Armed Forces of South Russia on the Rostov-Kislovodsk and Makhachkala railway lines, then advanced south to participate in the Red Army invasion of Georgia. From 1922, the unit provided air defense for the Baku oil fields on the Caspian coast. In 1927, the battery was reorganized as the 90th Separate Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, becoming the 3rd Baku Regiment PVO on 5 December 1928 and the 60th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment PVO in 1930. In 1938, the regiment was relocated to Moscow to strengthen its air defenses after being redesignated as the 193rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, receiving new 85 mm and 37 mm anti-aircraft guns, along with PUAZO-3 fire control devices and DCh optical rangefinders. In March 1939, Major Mikhail Kiknadze took command of the 193rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, part of the Soviet air defense forces defending Moscow, the 1st Air Defense Corps. It was responsible for the southwestern sector: the Tushino Airfield, Minsk highway, and Moscow Canal.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, the regiment became part of the Moscow Air Defense Front. On the night of 21 July, it was involved in the repulse of a German air raid, claiming two planes downed out of 22 shot down that night. On 21 October, two batteries from the 193rd were among the six anti-aircraft batteries with 211 guns sent to the front to serve in an anti-tank role during the Battle of Moscow; they were credited with destroying 21 tanks, three mortar batteries, two armored vehicles, and seven bunkers, as well as killing more than 200 German soldiers. It defended against German air raids on Moscow, and was credited with downing 38 aircraft by 29 December. The 193rd helped repulse small groups of German aircraft attempting to raid Moscow in bad weather on 6 January 1942. For \\"successful fulfillment of command tasks, organization, and discipline of personnel\\", the 193rd was converted into the 72nd Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment on 7 November, the first Guards unit in the Air Defense Forces.Preparing AA guns for a training exercise in Moscow, c. 1943On 3 June 1943, the regiment was expanded into the 1st Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division of the Special Moscow Air Defense Army, under Colonel Kiknadze's command. It included the 236th, 237th, 240th, 242nd, and 244th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments, the 1st Guards Searchlight Regiment, and the 32nd Guards Separate Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion with light guns. The division's regiments were expanded from the 193rd's battalions. For the rest of the war, the 1st Guards provided defense against German air raids for the western sector of the Moscow Air Defense Zone. After the front moved farther away from Moscow, the division saw progressively less combat. Kiknadze was promoted to Major General on 18 November 1944. In 1945, the division participated in the May Day parade on Red Square. On 24 June, Kiknadze led a contingent of eight batteries with 32 85mm guns and 34 vehicles from the division in the Moscow Victory Parade.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Kiknadze continued to command the division until January 1951, when he was promoted to become deputy commander of the Moscow Air Defense Region's anti-aircraft artillery. The division became part of the Moscow Air Defense Area in 1948 when the Air Defense Forces in the Moscow area were reorganized, transferring to the Moscow Air Defense District in a 1954 reorganization. Major General Vasily Gladkov commanded the division between May 1953 and January 1957. By 1955, the division included three regiments: the 47th, 236th, and 240th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments. Its command post was located in the Maryino-Znamenskoye area. In mid-1960, the division was disbanded, after gradually being replaced by the 1st Special Purpose Air Defense Army as surface-to-air missiles replaced anti-aircraft guns.

In August 1595 the area of Mount's Bay in Cornwall had been attacked by a Spanish raiding force led by Carlos de Am√©squita. In that attack over two days, Penzance, Newlyn, Mousehole, and Paul were raided and torched. In March 1596 a Spanish pinnace arrived in Cawsand Bay just below Mount Edgcumbe with upwards of 25 men armed with muskets. The Spanish managed to land on the beach and made their way to the village. They fixed barrels of gunpowder and brimstone to the doors of several houses and to two boats in the harbour, setting them on fire. The Spanish were spotted by one member of the militia who had gone ahead of the main force; he promptly opened fire with a caliver, scaring the intruders off. Shortly after, the main militia force arrived in the village from Plymouth in time to prevent the fire from spreading to the whole settlement. The defences were strengthened as it was feared that the Spanish would try again. The heights were then manned by 170 pikemen, 300 musketeers and cavalry commanded by Sir Nicholas Parker and maintained by sole expense of Richard Carew. The Spanish would try much larger descents on the British isles; an attempt in October the same year known as the 2nd Spanish Armada failed due to storms. The following year an attempted landing also failed after a storm in the English channel dispersed the fleet and a number of ships were captured. A second naval raid on the area took place on 26 April 1599, when four Spanish warships captured five fishing boats from Plymouth Sound. Years later, when the Mayflower's Pilgrims had a port of call at Cawsand, they recalled the Spanish burning of the village, and how they spared the brick walls by the beach.

November 1832 ‚Äì d. January 30, 1883) was a United States Navy sailor and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration the Medal of Honor for his actions in the American Civil War. Military service Matthew McClelland was born November 1832 in Ireland. McClelland enlisted July 12, 1861 for three years and served on the USS North Carolina from that date to July 27, 1861 as a Second Class Fireman. He then served on the USS Richmond from July 28, 1861 to August 29, 1864 as a First Class Fireman and the USS Princeton from August 30, 1864 to honorable discharge on September 9, 1864. During the Civil War, McClelland served as a First Class Fireman aboard the steamship . As a fireman, McClelland's duties were to tend to the ship's steam boilers. In the prelude to the siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana, Rear Admiral David Farragut attempted to move a flotilla of ships, including the Richmond, up the Mississippi River past the town of Port Hudson. On March 14, 1863, the flotilla reached the town and came under heavy fire from Confederate artillery batteries. The enemy guns inflicted severe damage on the Union flotilla, forcing most of the ships to turn back. During the battle, the Richmond's fireroom, which housed its boilers, was damaged by an enemy shell and began to fill with hot steam. McClelland entered the room and \\"hauled the fires\\", or put out the furnaces, to prevent further danger. For his actions he was awarded the Medal of Honor four months later, on July 10, 1863. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: First Class Fireman, U.S. Navy. Accredited to: New York. G.O. No.: 17, 10 July 1863. McClelland's official Medal of Honor Citation reads: > Serving on board the U.S.S. Richmond in the attack on Port Hudson, 14 March > 1863.

Death and burial Medal of Honor recipient Matthew McClelland died of pulmonary catarrh & irritation of the heart and his remains were initially stored at the now defunct Lafayette Vault, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 4, 1883.

Erez started her career with intentions of only releasing singles, but the similarity of themes in the songs she was writing and being signed to City Slang convinced her to have a full-length album in her discography. Off The Radar was compared by multiple critics to the works of acts such as M.I.A., FKA Twigs, Bj√∂rk, and Grimes and was labeled by Erez as \\"very high rhythmic dancey music with political content.\\" It lyrically depicts her PJ Harvey-inspired personal and emotional takes on world problems such as surveillance, media manipulation, sexual assault, and social media. Among its sound design and production, the record's use of controversial political subject matter alongside fun music styles helped the album garner critical acclaim upon its distribution. Off The Radar was promoted with four single releases (\\"Dance While You Shoot,\\" \\"Pity,\\" \\"Toy,\\" and \\"Off The Radar\\") and six music videos that were directed by Erez as well as other talents such as Zhang + Knight, Hen Makhluf, Eden Kalif, Daniella Meroz, and Omri Ben Shalom.

For most of the tracks on Off The Radar, the instrumental was made first and the lyrics came afterwards. Mixing was near completed by December 2016. Some of the sounds were tracked outside of the studios. The glass-breaking foley on \\"Toy\\" was recorded at a recycling place, where Erez and Rousso threw the bottles in a bin that gave the glass breaks an echo effect. Critic Michael Sumsion described the sounds on the album as \\"extremely personal and informed by experience whilst suffused with wigged-out flourishes of microscopic deftness.\\" He analyzed that \\"the fractured and unwieldy blurts, burps, bass blasts, whooshes and clanks embedded in her jerky arrangements are presented with a brio that confounds as much as it communicates, wringing agitation as well as catharsis from its ominous, chaotic soundscape.\\" Flying Lotus, Thundercat, Kendrick Lamar, Vince Staples, Bj√∂rk, Frank Ocean, Little Simz, M.I.A., St. Vincent, FKA Twigs, and Grimes were heavy influences of the album's sound,Hageman, Estefania (7 July 2017). \\"noga erez\\".

The record also occasionally deals with the feelings of having white privilege. In particular, \\"Dance While You Shoot,\\" a critique on a \\"more extreme, more religious, more nationalistic\\" government in Erez's words, is about enjoying life \\"when you know that the very existence of your life is something that harms others.\\" Despite these themes, Erez wrote the lyrics based on rhythm rather than grammar, which, as Huchinson claimed, made them \\"playful yet often oblique.\\" Erez's take on political problems was influenced by PJ Harvey, her reasoning being that Harvey approached controversial subjects in an \\"effective way and she still manages to keep it very personal.\\" While numerous critics have described the album as a protest record, Erez did not agree with this categorization, as the LP \\"is more of an emotional documentation of events and influences in our lives...how we experience the world.\\" She wanted the lyrics to relate to her listeners on a \\"global\\" level, reasoning that \\"we all have this primal need to be noticed.\\" As Erez explained, \\"You can hear one of my songs and say ‚Äòhey, that song is about America‚Äô or ‚Äòthat one is about Trump.‚Äô The only message I truly stand behind is the need to wake up because crazy things are happening everywhere today.\\" Singles and music videos After being signed to City Slang, Erez emailed \\"maybe 15 or 20\\" demos to the label.

From the typological point of view, it is a wall of straight, rectangular section, consisting of homogeneous stone blocks mortared in opus caementicium. It is situated in an open valley, which is relatively open, develops in the direction of the river Ribeira de Bensafrim. It is built where the valley begins to narrow, about 1.3 km west of Ribeira de Bensafrim. Barragem Romana da Fonte Coberta may have served to irrigate cultivated fields, or as part of a water supply system for the town of Lacobriga, which was situated on Monte Moli√£o, on the east bank of Ribeira of Bensafrim. In the areas that preserve the face of this structure it is possible to identify some negatives of what appear to be horizontally arranged boards, which would probably form part of the frame work system assembled for its construction.

It was constructed in 1923 and gained National Historic status in 1988. History The Arizona Highway Department (AHD) began a major improvement in what was then known as the Holbrook-Lupton Highway, running between the state line with New Mexico to Adamana. The Sanders Bridge was one of two bridges included in the proposed upgrade, the other being the Allentown Bridge. Based upon engineering drawings by AHD, the Monarch Engineering Company, based in Denver, Colorado, was awarded the contract for the Sanders Bridge. Construction began on May 22, 1923, and was completed by September 10, at a cost of $15,005. This section of highway would later become part of US Route 66. However, in 1931, after another realignment of the highway system, the Sanders Bridge, along with the one at Allentown, were no longer included on Route 66. Currently, it carries local traffic on the Navajo NationNavajo Indian Reservation. It is currently owned by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Description The substructure consists of concrete abutments and piers, on which sit timber stringers, supporting a timber deck which is covered with asphalt. The superstructure consists of a riveted steel, 6-panel Pratt pony truss. There are two spans, 75 feet in length and 14 feet 8 inches in width, with a total length of 190 feet, when the on and off ramps are taken into account.

The paper was funded by members of the Tory government led by William Pitt the Younger to counter the contemporary pro-revolutionary press. John Heriot, a Scottish journalist and writer, had worked for the Oracle and the World newspapers in 1791, editing both, but did not remain in either post for long.

The law of the People's Republic of China on the protection of minors (Êú™ÊàêÂπ¥‰∫∫‰øùÊä§Ê≥ï) and the criminal law of China (ÂàëÊ≥ï) do not yet have an article on the subject of child abuse. However, the 49th article of the current Chinese constitution forbids the physical abuses of elderly people, women and children. According to Wang Shengjun, former president of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China, China does not have a specific law enforced to protect the welfare of children. Articles concerning this topic are present but they lack a systematical regulation. There are more than 30 organizations within the Chinese government to which child protection is related, but none of them are specifically established with the purpose of tackling child abuse. Currently, a large number of child abuse incidents in China have not been legally dealt with. Punishments carried out by law have been light, such as 5 day detentions for the offenders in many cases. The detention is executed according to the public security administration punishments law (Ê≤ªÂÆâÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ§ÑÁΩöÊ≥ï) which is not related to the protection of children. The 45th article of the aforementioned law detains people who \\"abuse their family members and are requested be punished by their family members\\". According to the Chinese criminal code, an incident of physical abuse can be taken to the court in the form of private prosecution. However, it is extremely difficult for a child to perform such task. In case of obscenity against children, a criminal will receive a sentence of 5 years in prison or more according to the 9th amendment of the Chinese criminal code. After several violent cases were brought to light, continual backlash from both the general public and netizens have caused the courts in late 2018 to toughen sentences for offenders.

The Lost Patrol  Dempster's patrol at Dawson City, February 1911 In the winter of 1910‚Äì11, the mail patrol was commanded by Inspector Francis Joseph Fitzgerald. The patrol included Fitzgerald, Constables George Kinney and Richard Taylor, and former constable Samuel Carter as guide. They left Fort McPherson on December 21, 1910. The time required for the trip depended heavily on the weather; previous patrols had taken as few as 14 days and as many as 56 for the one-way journey. Fitzgerald took enough supplies for 30 days and may have been seeking to set a new speed record for the trip. Weather conditions on the trail were poor, with heavy snow and low temperatures. Carter, who had only traveled the route in the opposite direction, was not able find the path through the Richardson Mountains. In late December, the patrol encountered local Kutchin families but Fitzgerald did not choose to hire one as a guide. Conditions worsened after January 3, with temperatures averaging and strong winds. On January 12, with only nine days food remaining, they were still lost. Fitzgerald was determined to continue, and it was not until January 18 that they turned back to Fort McPherson. When the patrol failed to arrive in Dawson City by late February 1911, Corporal Dempster was dispatched with Constables J.F. Fyfe and F. Turner and First Nations guide Charlie Steward to find and rescue them. They departed Dawson on February 28. Dempster was initially confident of finding the patrol, given Fitzgerald's experience in the north. Dempster's patrol soon found evidence of trouble, including abandoned dog harnesses and gear, and campsites that showed Fitzgerald's patrol had lost their way. They later found parts of dog carcasses which indicated that the lost men had resorted to eating their sled animals. On March 22 and 23, the bodies of the four missing men were discovered from Fort McPherson. Dempster's patrol continued to Fort McPherson and then returned to Dawson City. On the return to Dawson, Dempster set a new record, covering the distance in 11 days.  Later career  After the loss of Fitzgerald's patrol, the NWMP tasked Dempster with making the patrol route safer. He worked on this through 1912 and 1913, making trail markers and building supply caches and shelters. Dempster continued to lead the winter patrols for several years, establishing several speed records, including 14 days in 1920. He was able to achieve his patrols safely, avoiding unnecessary risks and employing local First Nations guides when required. In 1917, he was asked to find a route from the Porcupine River to Dawson that did not cross United States territory. He was able to find a route within three weeks through unexplored parts of the Ogilvie Mountains. First Nations he encountered on the way stated their surprise when his party appeared, saying: \\"this trail has never been travelled over by white men or Indians, although different parts are travelled by different Indians\\". The difficulty of the terrain meant that no other patrols were sent on the same route. He eventually reached the rank of Inspector, retiring from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (successor to the NWMP) in 1934. At his retirement he was considered to be \\"the best trail man in the Yukon\\". Dempster married Catherine Smith in 1926. They had one son and one daughter. Dempster died October 25, 1964, at the age of 88. Shortly before his death, he was advised that the highway being constructed from Dawson to Aklavik would be named in his honour. The Dempster Highway, eventually routed to Inuvik instead of Aklavik, opened in 1979.

It has a single tubular green leaf and up to forty green, greenish-pink or brownish flowers. It is found in the central- west of the state, growing in open forest. Description Prasophyllum maccannii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf up to long and wide at the base, but which is withered by flowering time. Between fifteen and forty scented flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long, reaching to tall. The flowers are green, greenish-pink or brownish and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long. The lateral sepals are a similar size, linear to lance-shaped and joined to each other, although sometimes only in the lower half. The petals are linear to lance-shaped and long. The labellum is white, pink or brownish long and turns upwards through 90¬∞ near its middle. The edges of the erect part of the labellum are sometimes slightly wavy and there is a raised, greenish, tapering callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in November and December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum maccannii was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and Dean Rouse. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected from near Ponomal. The specific epithet (maccannii) honours the Victorian naturalist Ian Robert McCann (1914-2003). Distribution and habitat The inland leek orchid grows in open forest in the central west of Victoria.

The principal city occupied was Frankfurt, but the French also occupied Dieburg, Darmstadt, Hanau and Homburg. The occupation was in response to the mobilisation of armed forces by the government of Hermann M√ºller to suppress the Ruhr Uprising - which in turn was part of a widespread strike movement which defeated the Kapp Putsch. French economic concerns On 20 January 1920 Alexandre Millerand succeeded Georges Clemenceau as Prime Minister of France. On 31 January he attended the first meeting of the Conseil sup√©rieur de la guerre since the armistice and enquired whether the French Army was capable of occupying the Ruhr. Edmond Buat, the Chief of Staff of the French Army, replied this would only be possible with the mobilisation of reserves. The Kapp Putsch The Kapp Putsch was an attempted coup on 13 March 1920 by parts of the Reichswehr (military), the Freikorps and other conservative, nationalist and monarchist factions. They aimed to undo the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, overthrow the Weimar Republic and establish a right-wing autocratic government in its place. The French justification for the occupation The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland had been broken. These had designated a neutral zone 50 kilometres deep on the left bank of the Rhine. In this area any construction of fortifications or any military maneuvers were strictly forbidden, it being further specified that any breach would \\"be regarded as committing a hostile act against the Powers signatory of the present Treaty and as calculated to disturb the peace of the world.\\" When the German Army sent 7,000 troops into the areas north of the River Lippe, the French government concluded that this was a breach of the treaty, and promptly responded by sending their own troops into the Neutral Zone. Hauptwache incident Photograph from L'Illustration, 1920. The morning of 7 April, before the clash which took place early that afternoon. On 7 April, some Moroccan soldiers of the 3rd Moroccan Tirailleurs Regiment were stationed at the Hauptwache in the centre of Frankfurt. Originally they were surrounded by a curious crowd. However the situation deteriorated and the troops opened fire with a machine gun. This led to nine people being killed and twenty six wounded. The following day, when newspaper publishing was recommenced, the Mayor Georg Voigt, the Police Chief Ehler and the President of the Alternative Government, Cossman, issued a call for calm.

One of his characteristic techniques was to place religious scenes behind a window, create an illusion of depth, and with the scene in the background intended as the main focus of interest. The two most well known examples of this are the \\"Virgin and Child\\" and \\"Christ nailed to the Cross\\" miniatures for the Mary of Burgundy book.

She was the founder of the first kindergarten in South America in 1892, and famous for having contributed decisively to preschool teaching in Uruguay and Latin America. Biography The daughter of Catalan parents, Enriqueta Compte y Riqu√© emigrated to Uruguay with her family while still a child. In spite of her nearsightedness, Compte managed to overcome her difficulties and dedicated herself to studying teaching. She graduated at 19 as a first grade teacher, and in 1886 as a superior teacher. In 1887 she was appointed deputy director of the Normal Institute for Young Women, and during that same year she traveled to Europe on an official mission for the government of M√°ximo Tajes, to specialize in preschool education. She was entrusted to internalize the teachings of Friedrich Fr√∂bel, which is why she toured Belgium, Germany, Holland, France and Switzerland. She returned from this trip in September 1890. As a result of the trip, she wrote a report in which she expressed \\"the hope of realizing in the Republic, the creation of these establishments, approaching the ideal of Fr√∂bel, and incorporating them into the public organization of Primary Instruction.\\" Compte made numerous publications in magazines and specialized books for children between three and six years of age. With psychological and pedagogical methods, her work was inclined to study children respecting their individuality and personal learning capacity. She was also accepted into several associations whose objectives were women's rights, the fight against tuberculosis, such as the Uruguayan League Against Tuberculosis, and against alcoholism and trafficking in women. Her work was a precursor of secular education, based on social equality and the overcoming of prejudices and obstacles that, in her opinion, were harmful for the student, but above all, for the child as a human being who did not deserve to be marked by a world full of disparities of goals and possibilities. Her great moral principle as an educator became clear when she said: Kindergarten When the was founded, it was not the same as those that served as a model for what Enriqueta observed in Europe, although some things remained. Inspired by the thinking of Jos√© Pedro Varela, it was in the end a precursor to the current policy of compulsory preschool education. It also served as inspiration to preschool teachers from several countries, including Argentina. Tributes Monument located in the Children's Corner of Parque Rod√≥, by the Uruguayan sculptor Armando Gonz√°lez Currently the oldest preschool on the South American continent, Kindergarten No. 213, founded by Compte in 1892 in the neighborhood of Aguada, bears her name, as does a street in Montevideo.

It was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Rawson, Brooks and Borg, and built by local contractor F.B. Dickinson & Co. The project provided jobs for local residents during the Great Depression, and 45% of its funding was provided by the Public Works Administration (PWA). The City of Des Moines provided the rest of the funds. The radio tower, which shares the historic designation with the building, was used to dispatch fire personnel from 1958 to 1978. The buildings were used by the local fire department from 1937 to 2013. It was replaced by two different facilities. The old fire station and shop building was acquired by the Des Moines Social Club, a nonprofit arts organization. The buildings were designed in the Streamline Moderne style with Art Deco elements. The two-story brick fire station features stone pilasters that divide the fire apparatus bay openings.

A 14-time NWA World Tag Team Champion and one of the most popular stars in the history of NWA Mid-America, Rossi was also a member of both the NWA Hall of Fame (class of 2016) and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (class of 2004). Early life Len Rositano was born to Italian migrant parents in 1929 in Utica, New York. He worked out at a local YMCA in his teenage years where a coach goaded him into wrestling. Rositano stated that \\"he mopped the floor with me, but I took it as a challenge\\" and from the age of 14, he wrestled for the YMCA. Due to their being no high school wrestling program in the area, he wrestled unsanctioned matches for a few dollars a shot. He then served two years in the U.S. military but his sights were set on a career in wrestling. \\"That was my intention from the very beginning\\" Rositano stated. Soon thereafter he set about a career as a pro under New York promoter Ed Don George/ Professional wrestling career Len Rositano became Len Rossi early in his career after a Boston promoter told him that his surname would not fit onto a promotional poster. His first major rival was Gypsy Joe in 1954 and '55 in the NWA's Utah-Idaho area. He went on to wrestle in Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and New York before traveling to Tennessee for what was scheduled to be a short tenure in 1958. With his son approaching age to start school, Len and his wife decided to settle in Tennessee. Rossi would leave the state to wrestle in different territories, as well as a tour of Japan, but Tennessee would be his home thereafter. In June 1958, Rossi won the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Tex Riley, defeating Don & Jackie Fargo in NWA Mid-America, the first of fourteen reigns for Rossi. They continued as a team throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming the most popular team Nick Gulas's Mid-America territory. Rossi has credited Riley (the veteran of the pairing) for advancing his understanding of wrestling audiences. Rossi and Riley went on to have numerous reigns as tag team champions together with both the NWA World and NWA Southern Tag Team Championship. Rossi was the main babyface and most popular wrestler on Birmingham's Channel 42 \\"Live Studio Wrestling\\" from the 1960s until 1972. \\"He was different than what they were used to seeing down here\\" fellow wrestler Billy Wicks said of Rossi, \\"he was a Yankee coming down to Tennessee and that wasn't easy\\". Rossi was also NWA Southern Junior Heavyweight Champion throughout much of the 1960s, defending the title primarily in NWA Mid-America and various promotions across the Southern U.S. In 1972, at the height of his popularity, Rossi was involved in an automobile accident en route to a wrestling bout in Tupelo. He suffered serious external injuries including broken arms, ribs, ankle and broken bones in his feet though he sustained no internal injuries. ‚ÄúI was able to get out of the car with my left arm, which was not broken and roll into a ditch as a tractor trailer headed straight for us‚Äù Rossi stated about the accident. Ultimately, the injuries ended his wrestling career. Later life After retiring from professional wrestling, Rossi became interested in healthy eating as a means of healing, which was spurred on after his accident and an unrelated stay in hospital. ‚ÄúGod stepped in, and I went back to school to study natural healing and the use of nutriceuticals,‚Äù Rossi said. For the past 40 years, he operated Len Rossi's Health Foods, the oldest operating merchant in Brentwood, Tennessee. Since his retirement from wrestling, Rossi was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame (class of 2016) and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (class of 2004). He was also honored by his adopted hometown in Tennessee for his \\"athletic career, induction into the NWA Hall of Fame and continued commitment to the community.\\" Len Rossi, a professional wrestler died on October 9th, 2020 in Nolensville, Tennessee.

Though the daughter of Giovanni di Scaletta and a Sicilian noblewoman, she was of humble origins. Macalda was noted for her unscrupulous political conduct, inclination to betray marriage (political and human), and for her easy and promiscuous sexual habits; this dissoluteness, even having a brush with \\"suspicion of incest,\\" tended to degenerate into an \\"exhibitionism veined with nymphomania.\\" She was the wife of the Grand Justiciar of the Kingdom of Sicily, . Proud Amazon, educated in arms and courage, gifted with a martial bearing, moved by a cynical and ambitious nature, Macalda's vigorous feminine personality deployed her influence first in the circle of Charles of Anjou and then at the court of Peter III of Aragon, whom, according to a chronicler of the time, Macalda tried to seduce, but without success. Her qualities made her a protagonist in the foreground of this important epoch of transition and violent upheavals in the history of the Kingdom of Sicily that was marked by the bloody revolt of the Sicilian Vespers and led to the tumultuous alternation between Angevin and Aragonese rule. Practicing intrigue at court, but also brazenly vying with Queen Constance of Hohenstaufen, Macalda indeed had an important role in at first favoring, and then toppling, the political fortunes of her second husband, the aged Alaimo da Lentini, who had been one of the major champions of the Sicilian Vespers. Macalda's social and political trajectory, given her very humble ancestry, can be considered as an exemplary and paradigmatic case of the type of social mobility through which, in a late medieval Norman or Swabian context, an ambitious family could achieve emancipation from poverty and from subaltern positions in a few generations, a spectacular journey that starting from misery could attain the high royal spheres. Macalda's career has left behind a recognizable historical trace, though variously treated in the chronicles of that time. One of these, the Historia Sicula by the contemporaneous Messinese chronicler Bartholomaeus of Neocastro, is very unfavorable to her, but the understandable political motives influencing the pro-Aragonese Neocastro may not be enough to justify his acrimony, for some so excessive as to warrant the suspicion that he was \\"one of the victims of the woman's spell.\\" Besides her military education, Macalda is also noted for another quality, unusual as it is for a medieval woman: she knew how to play chess, for which she can be recognized as a historical first among women and in Sicilian chess. Her singular figure, inhabiting the pages of chronicle and history, is transfigured in the collective memory, in folklore and the collective imagination: Macalda became the protagonist of popular traditions, myths, and legends of Sicily, like the one in Catania about the well of Gammazita. A distant echo of Macalda's passion for the Aragonese sovereign, which the chronicler Neocastro disseminated in caustic tones, also seems to reverberate in Boccaccio's storytelling, with enormous difference of tones and accents, in a much more idealized and rarefied courtly and knightly context in the Decameron: the tale of Lisa Puccini's forlorn love for King Peter of Raona (Aragon). Biography =Origins= Interior of the castle of Scaletta Her family was of very humble social extraction, and initially experienced distressed economic conditions, from which they would be able to skillfully free themselves thanks to an unstoppable social rise, whose apex was reached by Macalda. Her great-grandmother led her miserable existence exposed to the weather (\\"under the sun and the rain\\") in front of the Porta Judaeorum of Messina, where she sold food from a stall in the open. With this very modest activity, the woman succeeded not only in making ends meet but also saving up some money. =Social and political rise= Grandfather Son of the itinerant food vendor was one Matteo Selvaggio (\\"who was surnamed 'savage'\\"), who became Macalda's grandfather. In the early 13th century, in the Swabian period, he was himself no more than a servant or a simple soldier employed by the custodian of the state palace of Scaletta, a stronghold built to control traffic on the road that led to Messina from the south, coming from Catania and Syracuse. By 1220, after the castellan was dead, Matteo Selvaggio succeeded in being hired at his job by concession of Emperor Frederic II of Swabia. Matteo owed a further and decisive step forward to a stroke of luck: the discovery of treasure hidden inside the castle. Sloughing off poverty in this way, he also wished to discard his dishonorable surname. Claiming the noble title of Scaletta, Matteo sought to sanction his new advancement in status. Giovanni di Scaletta, Macalda's father The economic progress opened to him the possibility of a further step: to send his son Giovanni to study law. This privilege of studies, as Neocastro wrote, was able to confer great prestige upon anyone who accomplished it. Thus it was that without fail Giovanni opened up wider horizons and new opportunities, including the royal road of a highly placed marriage, sealed with a Sicilian noblewoman of the house of Cottone. From this marriage two children were born in the castle of Scaletta: the firstborn was Matteo II, followed circa 1240 by his sister Macalda, who would be touched by fate with the definitive act in social climbing, the acquisition in two stages of the still-missing political prestige. =Macalda in the contemporaneous Aragonese chronicles= Beatrice of Provence with Charles I of Anjou Various are the shadings that the figure of Macalda takes on in the sources from her time. Bartholomaeus of Neocastro Bartholomaeus of Neocastro, in his Historia Sicula, comes across as particularly hostile to her, inspired by obvious political motives: after the success of the Ghibelline Vespers revolt, though being aligned with the victors, \\"Macalda represents the Sicilian nobles of Guelph tradition who had been prominent in the ', that ephemeral political experiment of island autonomy that had preceded the arrival of the Aragonese. However, there are those who believe that this alone is not enough to justify the chronicler's rancor; his narration on Macalda became \\"particularly poisonous, to the point of warranting suspicion that the austere and learned Messinese historian had been a victim of the woman's spell.\\" =Catalan Chronicles: Bernat Desclot= Bernat Desclot, a Catalan chronicler contemporaneous with her, though a man who sided with Aragon, writes about her in more favorable terms. In chapter 96 of his Llibre del Rei en Pere, he describes her as \\"very beautiful and genteel, talented in her heart and her body, generous in giving and, at the right time and place, valorous in the use of arms on par with a knight.\\" It has been delicately noted that Desclot in this passage had lightly corrected his draft with respect to the even more flattering tone used in a previous version of his chronicle, making a subtle sort of self-censoring for the sake of propaganda: in an early draft, indeed, Macalda was described as leyal (loyal); then, after the woman had fallen into ruin for her presumed conspiracy, this attribute was evidently no longer usable in a neutral way, so it was replaced by \\"beautiful.\\" Macalda's military virtues On the woman's military virtues, underlined by Bernat Desclot, and on her martial bearing, the tradition on Macalda is unanimous. Other authors, even when not inspired by benevolence, if not directly animated by open hostility, agree in describing her as valorous in arms and capable of acquitting herself with heroic courage amid the dangers of war. Ficarra with Macalda's castle atop =First marriage with Guglielmo d'Amico= The very young Macalda was taken as wife by Guglielmo Amico, who once had been baron of Ficarra, but was then despoiled of property and exiled in the time of the Swabians. It was just this state of reduction to misery that gave Macalda and her family the possibility of getting a marriage with a titled noble. Even Guglielmo, for his part, counted on getting some usefulness from this second marriage; his hope, having then become disappointed, was that which would allow him to gain back possession of his lost feudal holding of Ficarra. However, his expectations were revealed to be poorly placed: Guglielmo Amico fell into disgrace and ended his existence reduced to poverty. Macalda had no remorse: without regrets she abandoned her husband dying in the Templars' Hospital, and began wandering for some time, wearing the habit of a friar minor, sojourning in various provinces between Messina and Naples, and exhibiting behavior that was not impeccable. In Naples, particularly, the widow would be entwined in an incestuous relationship with a relative. Having gone back to Messina, she slipped unrecognized into the house of another relative, with whom she committed to a new sexual relationship that verged on incestuous. Finally Macalda, by the will of King Charles, even succeeded in getting confirmation of her ownership of the property claimed in vain by her now dead husband, Guglielmo d'Amico. =Second marriage with Alaimo da Lentini and involvement in the Vespers War= Again by royal will the woman was given in marriage to Alaimo da Lentini, who at the time was quite influential in Angevin circles. His first marriage had been with another woman also named Macalda. When Alaimo's splendors at the Angevin court were about to decline, it was thanks to the maneuvers of his intriguing wife that he managed to rebuild his reputation, at first with the Sicilians, becoming one of the principal instigators of the Sicilian Vespers (a revolt that his consort also adhered to), and then at the Aragonese court. Once the revolt had broken out, in the situation that saw Alaimo leave to defend Messina from the siege, Macalda became the governor of Catania, acting in lieu of her husband. On that occasion, Macalda made herself the leading figure in Catania by an unscrupulous betrayal of the French who had rebelled against her in the clamor of the Vespers: after having feigned a gracious welcome, she stripped them of their property instead, and then left them to the mercy of the enraged people. King of Sicily 1282‚Äì85, King of Aragon 1276‚Äì85 The ambitious Macalda seemed to be aiming much higher to realize her designs for power. The Sicilians had besought Constance of Hohenstaufen, daughter of King Manfred, to accept the crown of Sicily, as the last of the Hohenstaufens. The queen's consort, Peter III of Aragon, supported the initiative and prepared to land on the island.Peter III (recognizable by his crown) with his wife Constance, the heir to the throne of Manfred of Sicily, commands the landing at Trapani of the Aragonese fleet on August 30, 1282. Miniature from the Nuova Cronica by Giovanni Villani (from a manuscript at the Biblioteca Vaticana) =Taking aim at Peter of Aragon= Still during the period of the Vespers, but following the arrival of Peter of Aragon in Sicily, rises an intrigue sketched out by her with the purpose of getting herself the role of the king's \\"favorite,\\" an episode that casts further light on her unscrupulous arrivisme. Indeed, at that time, once she learned of the Aragonese arriving in Randazzo, Macalda presented herself to them in great pomp, adorned with superb military attire, holding a silver mace in her hand, animated by intentions of sexual lust that were soon made explicit. Brought in front of the king, she addressed these words to him: The king was avoiding amorous adventures at the time; he feigned that he did not understand her intentions and, honoring her and treating her with courtesy, personally conducted her to the inn with an escort of knights. Peter's behavior did not make Macalda give up: by pretending not to understand, she began to follow the Aragonese in his itinerary across the island. When the king reached Furnari, near Milazzo, it was nighttime. An old man, in a state of indigence and looking miserable, covered with rags of leather, accosted him and was granted an audience. It was the Messinese Vitale del Giudice (Vitalis de Judice), formerly a friend and crony of Manfred, then reduced to a state of begging because of the consistent fealty he had cultivated for the Swabian dynasty. The old man warned the king of the volatility of political alliances in Sicily and, in particular, of the inconstancy of Alaimo, who had already betrayed Manfred and Charles of Anjou, but made even worse by conditioning and intrigues that, according to the white-haired beggar, he was subjected to by Macalda and by her wicked father, Giacomo Scaletta. The king did not seem to give much weight to this and gently dismissed him, saying that his desire in that land was to make friends and not to cultivate or foment suspicions over past events. The next day, however, remembering the warnings of that vindictive old man, he decided to detoxify the atmosphere, proclaiming amnesty for anyone who was tarnished by political offenses. The castle of Santa Lucia del Mela At Santa Lucia del Mela, Macalda asked for hospitality from the king, who was quartered in the local castle, giving as a reason the lack of inns in that small village, since she had been the last to get there. The king then allowed her two rooms but, not wanting to be tricked, moved to an inn, where he was again seen arriving by the insistent Macalda. Once again the king declined the advances of the woman: he called his majordomo and tried to take his leave for the night. But in front of the insolence of Macalda, who remained glued to her chair, he decided to get free of the embarrassment by calling the proprietors and their family members into the room and entertaining himself with that audience in various conversations and digressions, among which he made a show of his proven marital fidelity. The meeting went on until dawn, until the king had to go out in arms and took leave of all his visitors, frustrating the opportunity pursued by the woman. =Macalda and Alaimo at the court of the King of Sicily= Macalda and Alaimo took part in the new court, so intimate with the king as to be admitted to sit at his table. Alaimo, by intent of the king, had a top-level role: when Peter left the kingdom for France, having to face King Charles in the famous duel of Bordeaux that would never take place, the Aragonese king chose Alaimo, as chief justiciar, and Giovanni da Procida, as chancellor, to support the two regents, Queen Constance and James the infante. Alaimo was thus the only Sicilian in a government where Constance had the delicate task of managing, mediating, and healing the political tensions and the pushes for autonomy going through the island, the same tensions and aspirations of which Alaimo, already Captain of Messina during the time of the Communitas Siciliae, was \\"the most influential exponent.\\" Moreover, the king entrusted to the care of Alaimo the very delicate task of the custody of persons and protection of the physical well-being of his family members. =Rivalry with Constance of Hohenstaufen= Queen Constance II of Sicily But the defeat inflicted on her by Peter of Aragon's ostentatious marital fidelity gravely wounded her feminine pride, inciting Macalda to vindictive behavior, with acts of jealousy and emulation toward the court and particularly toward Queen Constance. Macalda began to defy her openly, acting like a royal highness, and made a show of snubbing and degrading going so far as refusing to call her \\"queen,\\" and limiting her, in her haughtiness, to the reductive title \\"mother of James.\\" Thus Macalda inaugurated a season of mad and extravagant rivalries with the royal highnesses, which led her to refuse the queen's benevolence; she carefully avoided attending her, though not at the opportunities to vaunt a particular hairdo or to show off some special dress woven with imperial purple. The episodes of this rivalry led to great scandal in the surroundings, putting the queen's kindness and proverbial patience to a severe test. Relations between Macalda and Queen Constance Some anecdotes about this one-sided rivalry have been handed down. Once when she fell ill, the debilitated Constance went to the Cathedral of Monreale, entering Palermo on a litter instead of a horse as was her custom. Macalda did not miss the chance to emulate her: in perfect health and for no other reason, she paraded through the streets of Palermo on a luxurious litter festooned with scarlet cloth, held up on the unruly shoulders of some of her husband's soldiers and peasants from her country. On the way back to Catania she did the same while entering Nicosia, burdening the reluctant bearers as far as forcing them to stand still for a long time exposed to the weather. Having become pregnant, Macalda began to lament a presumed state of infirmity, thanks to which she demanded and got the power to live in the monastery of the Friars Minor. According to her, this cohabitation was necessary to guarantee the tranquility she yearned for, far from the clamor of the people, but this forced proximity between the sacred and her controversial profane figure appeared scandalous to most. A little after giving birth, Macalda made herself the protagonist in a new affront to Queen Constance. Together with her sons James and Frederick, Constance was invited by Alaimo to hold the newborn baby at baptism, two weeks from then. Macalda feigned hesitation, claiming the excuse that the baby's fragile constitution, according to her, was not able to bear the water of the baptismal font. But three days later, without any other valid reason, she had him baptized publicly in person, held by the people, blatantly snubbing the royal offer. On another occasion, writes Bartholomaeus, the infante James, under the regency of Constance, set out to review the districts of the island accompanied by thirty knights. Macalda, as was her custom, quickly stepped in to accompany him, but she wanted to do it with her usual arrogance, acting \\"as much a justiciar as her husband,\\" escorted by a cortege comparable in splendor but immensely greater in numbers, and of a rather dubious appearance: the entourage she had with her numbered \\"three hundred sixty men at arms, of doubtful faith or suspicious, deliberately gleaned from various lands,\\" a large company of brigands, a band of disorderly troops, more than a cortege of knights. These behaviors of hers were also to induce her fall from grace, and to favor and accelerate that of her husband Alaimo. =Alaimo's fall into disgrace and the arrest of Macalda= James II, principal adversary of Macalda and Alaimo The event that caused Alaimo's reputation to plummet was in the end his indulgent behavior toward the Prince of Salerno, Charles the Lame, son of Charles I of Anjou. By now fallen into disgrace, suspected of conspiracy, Alaimo ran into the strong hostility of James II of Aragon: bombarded by weakly-founded accusations, he was told by James to go see King Peter in Aragon. He left for Barcelona on November 19, 1284, and was met with a cordial welcome by the king, by whom he was, however, held under such strict surveillance that he could be considered a prisoner. Alaimo's departure threw his entourage into turmoil and meanwhile gave his opponents the chance to identify and prosecute his presumed accomplices. In 1285, correspondence that he had secretly carried on with the King of France was disclosed by the lawyer Garcia di Nicosia, who was promptly murdered by Alaimo's nephews in the desperate attempt, later revealed to be futile, to exonerate Alaimo's position by silencing Garcia forever. So upon Alaimo's departure there followed arrests that ended up getting Macalda too. She was imprisoned in the castle of Messina, together with her children, on February 19, 1285, shortly after her husband's departure. Just before that, a much worse fate had befallen her brother Matteo junior, executed in Agrigento on January 13, 1285, by decapitation at the edge of an axe. Alaimo was held back in Catalonia for a long time, protected by the sincere benevolence that he could still enjoy from Peter of Aragon. As long as Peter was alive, he was saved from every peril. Execution of Alaimo Once the King of Aragon was dead, Alaimo did not survive the loathing of James II, who convinced his elder brother Alfonso III of Aragon to hand him over. So on August 4, 1287, Alaimo was entrusted to only one of James's emissaries, Bertrand de Cannellis, who quickly headed back to Sicily. Without yet seeing fulfilled the proper claim to defend himself in a regular process, together with his nephews (including Adenolfo da Mineo), he was put on the ship that was ostensibly going to take him back to Sicily. But, unknown to him, his fate had already been sealed before leaving: when the journey reached its end near Marettimo, he and his nephews were led unawares onto the bridge of the ship, by which time Sicily was already on the horizon. So they saw fulfilled their hope of seeing their homeland again, but right after that was read out the sentence of death pronounced against them by James, which was summarily executed by drowning. Rolled up in sheets and weighted with ballast, Alaimo and his nephew Adinolfo da Mineo were thrown alive into the sea, following the ritual known as mazzeratura. =Epilogue= With the story of Macalda and Alaimo, the trajectory of the Vespers was used up too. The precise awareness of this unforeseen metamorphosis can be gathered from the disconsolate Macalda's bitter words from the prison on the turn of events, addressing Roger of Lauria, the Aragonese admiral, brilliant for his military command but known for extreme avidity and for a cruelty that appeared unusual even for that time. He had come to visit her in prison in order to regain the papers of the feudal holding of Ficarra to which he laid claim. Boldly addressing the admiral, Macalda expressed her own bitterness like this: (Bartholomaeus of Neocastro, Historia Sicula, ch. 91) =Macalda the chess player= The castle Matagrifone (Rocca Guelfonia), prison of Macalda and the emir Ibn Sebir, site of their chess games Macalda's captivity allowed another of her unexpected qualities to be revealed, that of chess player: we know in fact that, during her imprisonment in the Matagrifone castle of Messina, Macalda entertained herself at the game of chess with the Emir of Djerba, Margam ibn Sebir, who was also held in prison after being captured fleeing to Tunis while trying to escape the naval incursion on the island of Djerba by the admiral Roger of Lauria. Also in these encounters, the haughty Macalda did not fail to astonish the bystanders and her jailers with the sensation caused by her \\"vivacity and the immodesty of her garments\\" that she flaunted. So Macalda was, without distinctions of gender, the first chess player in Sicily for whom there is historical evidence. It would indeed take another two and a half centuries, until the time of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, to have the first three historical mentions by Pietro Carrera of Sicilian chess players: the Palermitans Armini and Branci, and Don Matteoli Genchi of Termine, author of some stanzas on the rules of chess play. =Death of Macalda= From the time of her imprisonment, after the information on her proud address to Roger of Lauria and her entertainments in the prison of Matagrifone, practically every trace of Macalda is missing from the chronicles of the day, a silence that has warranted historians' presumption of her death a few years later. Still, there exists an archival document that records her as still living there on December 3, 1307, when Macalda Scaletta, probably facing financial difficulties deriving from her second widowhood, signed a contract by which she rented to a certain Mastro Pagano Barberio, for a term of 22 years, the service and work (servitia et operas) of Anna, one of her servants of Greek origin (ancillam de Romania). One other mention is in a legal document of October 14, 1308, in the State Archives of Palermo, in which Macalda is noted as living. So October 14, 1308 is the terminus post quem for the woman's death, which some authors instead place in 1305, while others, like Michele Amari, suppose that it happened in prison shortly after her arrest. Macalda in imagination and literature The Well of Gammazita, connected with the Catanese legend of the same name, at the Castello Ursino =Legend of the well of Gammazita= Stepping over the boundary of history, the story of Macalda has entered the popular imagination: her figure populates myths, traditions, and popular legends, like the one in Catania about the . =The Decameron= King Peter, with Constance behind, kisses the ailing Lisa Puccini in the novella of Pampinea from the Decameron, a distant echo of Macalda's amorous transport for the king A distant echo of Macalda's passion for the Aragonese king survives in the tale of Lisa Puccini and her forlorn love for King Piero of Raona in the novella narrated by Pampinea during the tenth day of Boccaccio's Decameron. Enormous, however, is the disparity of accents that separates the \\"poisonous\\" chronicle of Bartholomaeus from the Boccaccio episode, in a context suffused with lingering courtly and knightly virtues that are better suited to the figure of King Peter, known for his virtues of \\"prudence\\" and his \\"knightly soul\\" that contributed to leave a \\"vast record in the literature of the time\\" about him. It is also possible that, in Bartholomaeus, the version of the anecdote was the fruit of a malevolent elaboration, to validate or justify a posteriori the ill-fated role that Macalda had in persuading Alaimo di Lentini to the presumed betrayal: this could also explain the different treatment that Desclot reserves for Macalda's falling in love with the Aragonese sovereign in his Catalan chronicle. The fact then that Boccaccio, not knowing of Desclot's work, came to know of a similar story could indicate that a courtly version of the anecdote was circulated, perhaps orally, in various locations, being transformed through the typical routes of oral tradition, before reaching the ears of the Decameron's author. =Nineteenth century: theater, music, literature= thumb In the second half of the nineteenth century, the figure of Macalda received a fair amount of attention. A German play was dedicated to her in 1877, a tragedy in five acts by the poet Hermann Lingg, who the year before had dedicated the historical drama Die Sizilianische Vesper to the tumultuous years of the Vespers uprising that form the background of the woman's story. Lingg's tragedy Macalda was then translated into Italian: the first version appeared in Messina in 1883, the work of Alessandro Bazzani, printed by Tipografia Fratelli Messina. Around 1880 appeared \\"Macalda: Melodrama for Piano\\" by the Veronese musician Angelo Bottagisio (1842‚Äì?), a minor but successful artist in the panorama of nineteenth-century Italian music, who also composed the opera Alaimo da Lentini, produced at the Fraschini Theater of Pavia in 1885. A romanticized history of Macalda's life and loves is included on pages 797‚Äì811 of an 1889 book, Le Grandi Amorose, illustrated by 70 drawings by Gino de' Bini, the work of Italo Fiorentino, an author who inserts a popular vein into his copious literature, of uneven quality, that nourished a real and proper literary genre of that period in literature, called \\"romance of the mysteries.\\" Fiorentini's book is a collection of literary portraits of femmes fatales, from the mysterious and dissolute lives, famous lovers, and concubines of rulers and men of power. The book was published in Rome in 1889 by Edoardo Perino.

Background Kendle was working as an armed security guard at a Miami strip club at the time of the shooting. Kendle saw Kijuan Byrd and Michael Smathers sitting in a pickup in the parking lot of the club. He later told police he thought the victims were \\"rolling marijuana\\" in the parking lot, and one of the men had threatened his life, and when the car doors swung open, he acted in self defense. Kendle fired eight times at Byrd, with at least four of the shots being fired at Byrd's back as he crawled under the truck. Byrd was killed and Smathers was paralyzed. Smathers has denied any threats being made: \\"we see the security, he sees us, and there were no words even exchanged,\\" Smathers said. 'The only thing I remember was opening my car door, and him telling me to put my hands up. After that, I was shot.\\" Kendle was 29 years old when he was convicted. Trial Kendle decided to represent himself at trial. During the trial, Kendle's former attorney Carlos Pelayo Gonzalez said; \\"we have physical evidence and testimonial evidence has been given pre-trial that there was another gun involved, but Mr. Kendle, because he's representing himself, doesn't know how to get that evidence to the trial\\". Kendle told jurors: \\"the reason the evidence was fabricated is because I'm white\\". Despite a warning from the judge he added: \\"The subjects I shot were African American. I can prove that [...] What they're not allowing me to tell you is that I was arrested because of the George Zimmerman shooting.\\" Controversy CNN and the Center for Investigative Reporting conducted a year long investigation into the licensing of armed security guards. They reported that there are no federal training standards for armed guards and that no national database exists to keep track of abuses. One of the cases they focused on was Kendle's. CNN reported that Kendle's prior convictions for DUI and public drunkenness had not disqualified him from getting an armed guard license in Florida. Additionally, he had not disclosed that he was discharged from the Navy after several alcohol-related offenses. The company which hired Kendle was Force Protection Security. An attorney speaking on behalf of the company's owner said Kendle had the necessary training and passed the required background checks for the position. A prison psychiatrist who examined Kendle after the shooting diagnosed him with \\"impulse control disorder\\" and \\"anti-social personality disorder\\". A second court-appointed psychiatrist determined that there is a \\"substantial likelihood\\" he is \\"suffering from a mental illness.\\" Additional diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists included \\"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\\" and \\"other psychotic disorder.\\" Kendle claimed his case fell under the same stand your ground defense by which George Zimmermann was exonerated in the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin.

Education and career  Theodoros A. Varopoulos, the son of a poor family, was born three days before the death of his father. The financial support of the family was undertaken by his brother Nikolaos Tzanio, who was a teacher. Theodoros completed his primary education at Zervada and his secondary education in Lefkada. Despite the financial problems of his family, he left his home territory to study in Athens where he passed an exam at the Military Academy of Flight. However, due to his inability to pay the required registration fee, he enrolled in 1914 in the Mathematical Department of the University of Athens. To earn income in the evenings he worked on the Athens Telegraph. He also worked as a clerk at the University of Athens. Among his professors at the University of Athens were Kyparissos Stefanos, Georgios Remoundos, and Nikolaos Hatzidakis. He graduated with honors in 1918, and in 1919 he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. In 1920, after receiving a scholarship from Emmanou√≠l Ben√°kis, he was sent to Paris to continue his studies. There, by perfecting the theorems of Georgios Remoundos, he began to send scientific papers to the French Academy of Sciences. These works contributed to the decision of University of Paris to give him the possibility of obtaining a doctoral degree on the basis of his dissertation alone, without taking examinations. Eventually, he received a doctorate in 1923, and remained in the school through 1925. At the same time, he continued to publish scientific papers in journals as well as in conferences. He was also very much appreciated by other French mathematicians of the time and, after his return to Greece, he continued to travel yearly to Paris until the start of World War II. On his return in 1925 from Paris to Greece he worked first as a secondary school teacher at Athens College. In 1927, he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Secondary School of Teaching and in 1929 he was appointed as a professor extraordinarius in higher mathematical analysis at the University of Athens. In 1931 he was appointed professor ordinarius of mathematics at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where he served until his death on 1957 after a long-term illness. Varopoulos was an invited speaker at the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg and in 1924 in Toronto. He was a member of the editorial board of the French journal Bulletin de Sciences Math√©matiques between September 1927 and October 1928. He also served as an editor for the journal of the Hellenic Mathematical Society. He had a close collaboration with Professor Panagiotis Zervos.  Personal life  In his free time Varopoulos read poetry, particularly French poetry, and especially the poems of Paul Verlaine. He was also engaged in amateur photography. His ironic humor and eccentric character inspired anecdotes. He married Aliki Stini, a graduate in physical sciences, on 21 September 1939. The marriage produced a son, Nikolaos Theodoros Varopoulos, who became a noted mathematician.  Teaching and legacy  Theodoros Varopoulos used literary language in his teaching, and in the process of teaching his students mathematical formulas, he developed philosophical theories. He was strict with his students, but several times he financially assisted the poorest of them. He worked extensively on the development of the mathematical department of the University of Thessaloniki, since he was one of its first professors. Among his students were Nicolas Baganas, later professor of the University of Bordeaux, and Nicos Artemiadis, later professor at the American University.

One of the lots had been owned by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The four-story, brick, Romanesque Revival building was constructed in two parts. The commercial blocks at 300-302 and 304-306 were completed and occupied in 1890, and 308-310 was completed and occupied by 1897. Various wholesale clothing firms occupied the various blocks, but by 1920 Lederer, Strauss & Co., Inc., a millinery fabricator and wholesaler, occupied the entire building.

The business was scaled back, and they occupied less of the block, which was filled with other wholesalers by the mid-1950s. In 1957 the Landsco Millinery Co. was liquidated.

She was the plaintiff in the lawsuit English v. Trump, in which she unsuccessfully sought to have herself acknowledged as Acting Director of the CFPB.  Career  English has served in many capacities as a member of the U.S. federal government. Before joining the CFPB, she worked in both the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury. She worked on the transition team that launched the new agency in 2010. She later served as Deputy Chief of Staff. She then returned to OMB, serving as senior advisor to the Deputy Director of Management. She returned to CFPB in 2015, serving as Deputy Chief Operating Officer and then Chief of Staff.  Legal battle over CFPB leadership  On November 24, 2017, English was appointed Deputy Director of the CFPB by outgoing Director Richard Cordray. Cordray resigned his position as Director effective midnight November 25, 2017, and sent a letter to CFPB staff announcing that English would serve as Acting Director. That same evening, President Donald Trump appointed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, as the Acting Director of the CFPB. On November 26, 2017, English filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block Mulvaney from taking leadership of the CFPB. English was represented in the lawsuit by appellate lawyer and former CFPB official Deepak Gupta. Two days later, 28 November 2017, a federal judge rejected English's emergency request to block President Trump's appointment of Mulvaney.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cfpb- director-ruling-20171128-story.html A few weeks later, 10 January, a court ruled against English.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cfpb-acting- director-20180110-story.html English has received backing from a number of current and former Democrat legislators calling her the rightful Acting Director, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Richard Durbin, Representative Nancy Pelosi, and former Representative Barney Frank, co-author of the Dodd-Frank Act. A number of law professors also support her position, including Laurence Tribe, Martin Lederman, and Nina Mendelson. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) allows the president to appoint an interim replacement for an appointed officer of an executive agency without Senate confirmation, but the FVRA does not provide the \\"exclusive means\\" for filling a vacancy when \\"a statutory provision...designates an officer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity.\\" The law establishing the CFPB (the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act) is arguably unclear about whether the director's resignation qualifies as \\"unavailability\\" under FVRA, leading to confusion as to who would lead the agency and setting up a legal battle. The Office of Legal Counsel has consistently interpreted the FVRA as providing a non-exclusive option for appointing a successor when another, more specific option exists in another statute (in this case, the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act). The Office of Legal Counsel thus released an opinion that the FVRA gives the President the right to appoint an interim successor in this case. The top lawyer at the CFPB concurred with the Trump administration's opinion and directed all staff at the agency to disregard English's claims to be the Acting Director. She resigned from office on July 9, 2018, in light of President Trump's appointment of Kathleen Kraninger to serve as CFPB director full-time. She was succeeded by Brian Johnson, who was appointed to serve in an acting capacity.

It is the 14th overall episode of the series and is written by Nic Van Zeebroeck & Michael Sopczynski and directed by Chris Fisher. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on February 9, 2012. Plot Finch (Michael Emerson) and Reese (Jim Caviezel) enter the library for the first time since Finch's encounter with Root. Reese receives the number of Darren McGrady (Astro). He finds McGrady's apartment home is a crime scene, Darren's older brother, Travis, having recently been murdered. Carter (Taraji P. Henson) tells him that the perpetrators were three males linked to local comic-book store owner and drug dealer Andre (Malik Yoba). Travis had ejected the youths for harassing a waitress at a local chicken shop; they then followed him home and murdered him. Darren had seen them leaving and called the police, who arrived only after Travis had been dead for some time. Now, desperate for justice, Darren has pawned his television set and trumpet to buy a gun and is about to shoot one of the men, Brick (Ro Boddie). Reese finds him and calls Carter. Carter arrests Brick as Reese and Darren rush off in her car. Reese leaves him at a convent with Fusco, who is still trailing Finch. Darren escapes, but Reese finds him again. Darren tries to hire Reese to avenge his brother's death, but Reese just keeps a quarter and says he will work to put his brother's killers behind bars, meaning no killing. Reese captures one of the perpetrators in a police car with a load of bottles and threatens the other by burning the drug money until he discloses the location of the murder weapon. Corrupt police captain and HR member Lynch (Michael Mulheren) intervenes to have Brick released in less than a day. Before Reese can send the gun to the police, Darren takes it and runs off, intending to kill his brother's murderers. Reese calls Carter and she and Fusco rush arrive in time to stop Darren and capture the killers, but Fusco is shot when Andre tries to kill Darren. With Darren safe, Reese drives him to meet his new foster family.

Brief history =Fort Tyson= Quartzsite got its name from the quartz that was found in the area. The town was established on what used to be Fort Tyson, which was once used for protection against Indian raids. In the early years of the American gold rush, pan handlers began to arrive in Arizona searching for the precious metal. Gold deposits was discovered in the desert mountains of Plomosa and Dome Rock in the area and a boom in the mining industry followed.GOLD DEPOSITS NEAR QUARTZSITE, ARIZONA.Old Fort TysonEXPLORING QUARTZSITE OVERVIEWQuartzsite Was In the Center of Everywhere Charles Tyson was a miner who foresaw the mining potential of the area. The Yavapai tribe (a.k.a. as Mohave-Apache) resented the arrival of the Anglo-European settlers, who arrived from California and other places in the United States, on their land and raided the early settlements. The water supply in the area became the main target of their raids. In 1856 Tyson built a Fort to protect the settlers and the settlement became known as Fort Tyson. According to the Quartzsite Historical Society, in 1864, Tyson dug a well by hand. The well served the stage coaches that traveled from the towns of Ehrenberg and Prescott. Tyson's Well Stage Station became a busy stage coach station since it was located on the Butterfield Overland Mail route between Prescott, Arizona and Riverside, California. In 1897, the town was officially named Quartzsite. Tyson owned three store, two saloons and a post office. The establishment of the railroad affected the commercial aspect of the area since most people preferred to travel by train. However, Tyson's Well stage station continued to provide rest and refreshment to travelers and freight drivers. =Hi Jolly Cemetery= Gertrudis Serna & Hadji Ali Hadji Ali (1828 - December 16, 1902), a.k.a. \\"Hi Jolly\\" and \\"Philip Tedro\\", was an Ottoman subject of Syrian and Greek parentage,http://www.helleniccomserve.com/philiptedro.html who was among the men hired by the United States Army to introduce camels as beasts of burden to transport cargo across the \\"Great American Desert.\\" Ali was the lead camel driver during the US Army's experiment with the U.S. Camel Corps.

Her research in statistics concerns the design of experiments, and particularly the design of adaptive clinical trials; she is also known for her work on applications of statistics to bone marrow transplantation, and in particular on the graft- versus-tumor effect. She is Curators' Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Statistics at the University of Missouri. Education and career Flournoy is originally from Long Beach, California, the daughter of a plumber and a preschool teacher. She was educated at the Polytechnic School, and then did her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, earning a bachelor's degree in 1969; she became interested in statistics in her junior year there after taking a course from Don Ylvisaker; she tried to change majors from nutrition to mathematics but was prevented from doing so because a marriage and a change of names had snarled her paperwork. Instead, she ended up majoring in biostatistics. After working as a statistician at Regional Medical Programs, where she was asked only to do trivial calculations and where her presentations were ignored until a man presented them for her, she was fired for protesting her treatment. She returned to UCLA, with Olive Jean Dunn as a mentor, and went on to complete a master's degree in biostatistics in 1971. Flournoy learned about experimental design in her next job, in educational psychology at the Southwest Education and Laboratory for Research, and by reading Walter Federer's book Experimental Design: Theory and Application, which she imported from India in order to keep up with the experimental psychologists. She joined the pioneering bone marrow transplant team in 1973, under E. Donnall Thomas, and became founding Director of Clinical Statistics at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 1975. At that time, patient records were stored on punched cards, and Flournoy writes of sorting data sets manually at the laundromat while doing laundry. The center hired Leonard Hearne to create a shared clinical database before the term \\"database\\" existed, and Flournoy married him in 1978. Her work in this time on the graft-versus-tumor effect become \\"the first major application of the proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates\\". In 1982, Flournoy completed a doctorate in biomathematics at the University of Washington. Her dissertation, supervised by Lloyd Delbert Fisher, Jr., was The Failure-Censoring Bichain and the Relative Efficiency of Selected Partial Likelihoods in the Presence of Coprocesses. On the recommendation of Ingram Olkin, she moved to the National Science Foundation as the first female director of statistics in 1986. She made a point of attending talks by young women and encouraging them to apply for grants; by doing so she increased the rate of applications by women from its previous lower value to match the rate of applications by men. She also managed work on a report that led to the founding of the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, and pushed the institute towards a greater emphasis on applications; she was given an award by the Foundation in 1988 for her encouragement of interdisciplinary research. Next, Flournoy became a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of American University in 1988. Her focus in this time was on adaptive clinical trials as a way to make progress through the high- dimensional space of treatment combinations more quickly than by comparing pairs of points in this space one comparison at a time, with each comparison taking five years to make. To push this area forward, she organized a special session on the topic in 1989 (where she met her frequent collaborator Steve Durham) and an entire conference on it in 1992. She became head of the department at American University. However, under president Benjamin Ladner, the university changed its focus and stopped supporting graduate programs in science and technology. In order to maintain her own research program, Flournoy moved from American University to Missouri in 2002. She became chair again at Missouri, stepping down in 2011, and under her leadership, she significantly increased the size and rankings of the department. Recognition Flournoy was elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1990, the American Statistical Association and the World Academy of Art and Science in 1992, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1993. In 2000 the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies gave Flournoy their Elizabeth L. Scott Award \\"for her innovative and highly successful efforts in encouraging women to seek competitive research funding; for envisioning and supporting the pioneering Pathways to the Future Workshops; for serving as a role model and mentor for graduate students and young faculty; for her scholarship in teaching and research, and for her many contributions to the statistical sciences\\". In 2007 they gave her their Florence Nightingale David Award \\"for her fundamental research contributions in adaptive designs, sequential analysis, clinical trials, and particularly in bone marrow transplantation trials; for her devoted teaching; for her passionate mentoring to young statisticians, new investigators, women, and minorities, and researchers in small universities; for her leadership in the profession including her role as the chair of a major statistics department\\". She was named as a Curators' Distinguished Professor in 2012. In the same year she also won the Janet L. Norwood Award For Outstanding Achievement By A Woman In The Statistical Sciences.

He enlisted in an infantry regiment of the French Royal Army in 1784 and was promoted to first lieutenant by 1792. During the War of the First Coalition from 1793 to 1797 he fought mostly in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. He was wounded at Verona in 1799 and fought on the Var and at the Mincio in 1800. He transferred to the Imperial Guard in 1806 before fighting at Jena and being named to command an infantry regiment. In 1809 he was wounded at Wagram. In 1811, Rottembourg was promoted to general of brigade and fought in the French invasion of Russia in 1812 before being sent home to organize units of the Imperial Guard. In 1813, he led a Young Guard brigade at Bautzen and an Old Guard brigade at Leipzig. Late that year he became a general of division. In 1814, he led a Young Guard division at La Rothi√®re, Mormant, Second Bar-sur-Aube and Laubressel. During the Hundred Days he led troops at La Suffel. During the Bourbon Restoration he held several interior posts and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. He retired from the army in 1834. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 10. Early career Rottembourg was born on 6 July 1769 in Phalsbourg in what later became the Meurthe department and is currently in the Moselle department. On 16 September 1784 he enlisted in the 84th Infantry Regiment as a private. He became a corporal on 1 January 1791. In the year 1792 he was promoted sergeant on 1 May, adjutant-sous-officer on 26 August, sous-lieutenant on 1 September and lieutenant on 15 October. In 1792‚Äì94 he fought with the Army of the Centre, Army of the North and Army of the Ardennes. On 21 November 1794 he was elevated to the rank of captain adjutant-major in the 172nd Demi-brigade. This unit later became the 99th and finally the 62nd Demi-brigade. From 1794 to 1801 Rottembourg served with the Armies of Sambre-et-Meuse, Mayence, England and Italy. On 26 March 1799 he was hit by a musket ball in the right thigh while leading skirmishers at the Battle of Verona. He distinguished himself under Louis-Gabriel Suchet in the retreat to the Var River in April and May 1800, winning promotion to major (chef de bataillon) on 28 August 1800. The 62nd Demi-brigade fought at Mount Settepani on 10‚Äì11 April 1800. There were a number of clashes on the Var on 22‚Äì27 May between Suchet's corps and the Austrians. On 25 December 1800, he led his troops in a successful bayonet charge during the Battle of Pozzolo. The next day he took a prominent part in the capture of Borghetto, near Valeggio sul Mincio. Empire =Early empire= On 22 December 1803, Rottembourg transferred to the 56th Line Infantry Regiment as a major and on 25 March 1804 became a member of the Legion of Honor. On 1 May 1806 he transferred to the Foot Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard. For his actions at the Battle of Jena, he was promoted colonel of the 108th Line Infantry Regiment on 20 October 1806. The regiment fought at the Battle of Eylau on 7‚Äì8 February 1807. Rottembourg was awarded the officer's cross of the Legion of Honor on 7 July 1807. During the War of the Fifth Coalition Rottembourg led the 108th Line in Louis Friant's 2nd Division in Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps. The regiment started the campaign with 2,189 men in three battalions. Friant's division took part in the Battle of Eckm√ºhl on 21‚Äì22 April 1809. The 108th Line also fought at the Battle of Wagram on 5‚Äì6 July. By that time the regiment's strength was reduced to 1,724 men. On the second day, while some of Davout's divisions assaulted Markgrafneusiedl, Friant's division and its supporting cavalry advanced to the north of the village. After bitter fighting the Austrians were compelled to retreat. Rottembourg was wounded on 6 July. He became a Baron of the Empire on 20 August 1809 and received promotion to general of brigade on 21 July 1811. =War of the Sixth Coalition= Rottembourg served as an adjutant general in the Imperial Guard during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, but was sent back to France to organize part of the Imperial Guard. He performed this task with such success that he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Legion of Honor on 13 May 1813. At the Battle of Bautzen on 20‚Äì21 May 1813, Rottembourg commanded a brigade in Pierre Barrois' 2nd Young Guard Division. The brigade included two battalions each of the 1st and 2nd Tirailleur Regiments. The 1st Tirailleurs numbered 27 officers and 1,031 rank and file. During the early fighting on 21 May, Barrois' division was ordered to support the attack of Marshal Auguste de Marmont's corps in the center. Late in the afternoon, the massed divisions of the Imperial Guard were used to break the Allies' resistance. Rottembourg is the second name under Column 10 of the Arc de Triomphe. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October 1813, Rottembourg led a brigade in Philibert Jean- Baptiste Curial's 4,664-strong 2nd Old Guard Division. The brigade was made up of the 1st Battalion of the Saxon Guard Regiment, the Polish Guard Battalion and the 2nd Battalion of the Westphalian Guard Fusilier Regiment. The Westphalians were detached to escort the Guard artillery park. On the 16 October, the French launched a counterattack against the Allied Army of Bohemia. It drove back the Allies but failed to secure a decisive victory. Late in the afternoon, one division of the Old Guard was committed to action to drive the Austrians out of D√∂litz. The Old Guard saw action on 18 October in heavy fighting to the northeast of Leipzig near Paunsdorf. Rottembourg was promoted general of division on 20 November 1813. At the beginning of January 1814, Rottembourg's division was organized into two brigades under Jean-Joseph Marguet and Jean-Louis Charri√®re. On 26 January, Marshal Michel Ney was in command of the Young Guard infantry divisions of Rottembourg, Claude Marie Meunier and Pierre Decouz, plus Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes' Guard cavalry division. In all, Ney led 14,505 soldiers. On 25 January, Rottembourg's 5th Young Guard (or 2nd Tirailleur) Division included the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Tirailleur Regiments. Each regiment was 800‚Äì1,000 men strong while the Flanker-Chasseur Regiment only counted 312 men. The two attached artillery companies had 342 gunners. At the Battle of La Rothi√®re on 1 February 1814, the Allies had 113,000 troops available, but only 85,000 and 200 guns were engaged thanks to Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's hesitancy. To oppose the Allies, Napoleon had only 45,100 men and 128 guns, but he sent away Ney's three infantry divisions that morning. Rottembourg's division was the only one immediately available for battle. In the evening, Napoleon ordered Marshal Nicolas Oudinot to recapture La Rothi√®re using Rottembourg's division. Despite intense fire, the 1st Brigade drove Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's Russians from the village, but the place was recaptured by Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev's Russians. The 2nd Brigade stormed the village again, flushing out its defenders. However, on the other side, it encountered an Austrian brigade and a Russian grenadier division which recaptured the village again. At 8:00 pm, the division's survivors reformed 500 paces north of La Rothi√®re, the scene lit only by burning houses. Rottembourg's 5,000 troops fought \\"spendidly\\" according to one author. Brigadier Marguet was killed in the battle. Before embarking on the Six Days' Campaign against Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher's Allied army, Napoleon left Marshals Claude Perrin Victor, Jacques MacDonald and Oudinot to contain Schwarzenberg's army. Oudinot took command of the VII Corps, consisting of two infantry divisions of Peninsular War veterans and Rottembourg's division. At that time, Rottembourg was guarding the army's wagon train and artillery park. On 8 February, the division numbered 3,101 men while 1,020 of its men guarded the wagon train. At the Battle of Mormant on 17 February 1814, the front line consisted of Victor's corps and √âtienne Maurice G√©rard's Paris Reserve. In second line was Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier Boyer's division of VII Corps and behind Boyer was Rottembourg's division. After a successful action, Oudinot's corps pursued to the east while other units moved southeast. In the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 27 February 1814, Rottembourg's division was initially deployed in the second line and later fought on the left flank. A report of 1 March showed the division to have shrunken to 2,496 men. The 1st Brigade of Charri√®re (5th and 6th regiments) numbered 682 men while the 2nd Brigade (7th and 8th regiments) of Pierre Fran√ßois Bauduin counted 1,814. The 11th Young Guard Artillery Company with 75 gunners, six 6-pound cannons and two howitzers and the 9th Guard Train Company with 54 drivers were attached. At the Battle of Laubressel on 3 March, Rottembourg's division held the key village and plateau of Laubressel with 2,628 men. After a struggle against superior numbers, Rottembourg's division withdrew from Laubressel in good order. Later career After the Bourbon Restoration, King Louis XVIII of France named Rottembourg a chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis and inspector general of infantry on 27 June 1814. He was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor on 14 February 1815. After the return of Napoleon, he was appointed to command the 6th Division of the 2nd Corps of Observation on 30 April 1815. His command became part of the Army of the Rhine on 18 May. On 28 June he fought the Battle of La Suffel (Suffelweyersheim) against 7,700 Austrians, W√ºrttembergers and Hessians. His 15th Division consisted of two battalions each of the 36th, 39th, 40th and 103rd Line Infantry Regiments, the 2nd and 7th Horse Chasseurs and the 11th Dragoon Regiments and 12 artillery pieces. His 5,600 troops suffered about 700 killed and wounded and lost six guns and two colors. During the action, the W√ºrttemberg Duke Louis Mounted J√§gers routed the 2nd Horse Chasseurs. Subsequently, the division, which was part of Jean Rapp's V Corps, retreated through Haguenau into Strasbourg. Rottembourg was retired on 9 September 1815 but restored to his rank on 29 March 1816. He was appointed inspector general of infantry on 25 October 1817 and included in the active army general staff on 30 October 1818. He was named president of the committee of infantry on 7 November 1821 and assumed command of the Eastern Pyrenees Division on 12 February 1823. He was awarded the commander's cross of the Order of Saint Louis on 23 May 1825. King Charles X of France appointed Rottembourg head of the 16th Military Division at Lille and awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. He returned to the army general staff on 10 February 1831. He was assigned inspector general of infantry to the 11th and 20th Military Divisions on 5 July 1832 and commander of the 18th Military Division at Dijon on 1 December 1832. He retired from the service on 1 July 1834. He died on 8 February 1857 at Montgeron, France. ROTTEMBOURG is engraved on the north pillar of the Arc de Triomphe. He was the only Jewish general officer to serve in Napoleon's armies. These armies were made up of officers and men who often harbored anti-Semitic views.

It has the pungent paste of fermented mustard seeds, spices and sometimes dried mangoes, dried Indian plum and olives. Kasundi is popular as a dipping sauce in Bengali cuisine. Description Kasundi and tuna carpaccio Kasundi is a mustard sauce made by fermenting mustard seeds, and is much stronger and sharper than other kinds of mustard sauce.Dueep Jyot Singh and John Davidson, The Magic of Mustard, pages 24-25, Mendon Cottage Books, 2016, It is highly pungent, and is capable of exciting the nasal passage and bringing tears to the eyes in the same way as wasabi. The descriptions by famous chefs outside Bengal as the ‚Äúanswer to the ketchup‚Äù, ‚Äúketchup with a lot more going on‚Äù, or ‚Äúa rich, unctuous tomato sauce of Indian origin‚Äù are based, according to food writer Pritha Sen, on mistaken notions.Pritha Sen, For the love of food: A grave danger stalks the Kasundi, Indian Express In modern times, Kasundi is popularly served with Bengali snacks like cutlets and chops, and deep-fried spicy treats, as it brings tartness and pungency to the flavours. It also can be served as a dip with other snacks, as well as sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, omelettes, salads and other food. But, traditionally it was served neither with these treats nor in such quantities at home. In the past, it was stored with care, served sparingly and in small quantities, and paired with hot stir- fried greens, never fish or meat.Plavaneeta Borah, Durga Puja 2017 Special: Kasundi, Bengali Cuisine's Favourite Mustard Sauce, September 25, 2017Tanushree Bhowmick, The rediscovery of kasundi, Live Mint, Mar 05 2017 The practice of pairing kasundi with non-vegetarian dishes evolved in the commercial eateries, beginning with batter-fried fish. Kasundi has always been a revered fixture of Bengali households, its making used to be almost a religious rite, with many restrictions and rituals.Swapna Pradhan, Retailing Management, page 294, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2009, With modern household appliances becoming commonplace, its preparation is no longer a complex ritual. It also is now industrially produced, and widely available in eateries as a sauce and supermarkets as a bottled condiment. Among the bottled kasundis, those following the recipe of Bikrampur, in undivided Bengal is reported to be the best. Kasundi has spread outside Bengal, across India and into the Pacific Ocean countries like Australia (popular as eggplant kasundi) and New Zealand (popular as tomato kasundi). In Australia and New Zealand, kasundi is often part of the Christmas gift hamper. Around the world many different recipes of kasundi are available, like Kasundi Scotch Eggs, Chilean Sea Bass, Spicy Barramundi or Chhana Aam Kasundi Paturi.Anjan Chatterjee, The inglorious mustard, Telegraph India, 2020-09-22 Origin Kasundi was originally used as a type of achar (literally \\"ritual\\", meaning chutney/pickle), though it was not necessarily the same sauce known today. Kasundi was the queen of pickles in Bengal, because it remained edible for up to 20 years if stored in right conditions. In the past, the Bengali pickle- making season began in the month of Magh (January‚ÄìFebruary), which also is the mustard harvesting time. Jujube (kul) were the first pickles to be made, followed by tamarind, and then mustard. Mustard was pickled before the monsoon arrived, with various indigenous fruits and greens such as coriander, pudina or amrul. The pickling of mustard followed, in preparation for the monsoons. Any pickling that was done with dry, ground mustard, with or without using mustard oil, was called a kasundi. Traditions A fish Kabiraji on a plaintain leaf plate served with Kasundi Originally kasundi-making was the prerogative of the Brahmin caste and relished by the elites. Later respected families were allowed to make kasundi following auspicious rituals while maintaining a high level or hygiene and purity. It was mostly made by women who were considered appropriate, as widows, spinsters and menstruating women were barred from taking any part. Those who cleaned, husked and prepared the kasundi were not allowed to taste any bitter or sour food. Families were forbidden to make kasundi in the month of a birth or the year of a death in the family, or if some tragedy had occurred to them in the past while making kasundi. For families who were not forbidden, failing to make kasundi in a particular year meant they would be forbidden to make any in the next 12 years. The way to avoid that was to give away mustard seeds to a Brahmin. Renuka Devi Chaudhurani, doyenne of Bengali cuisine,The road from game pies to gujiyas, Mumbai Mirror, Aug 13, 2017 wrote in her book Stree Achaar (\\"women's rituals\\") that it was mandatory that a Brahmin makes it, not the women of the household. The women were allowed only to wash, dry and pound the mustard seeds, which were then given to the Brahmins. For families that had women making it, the role of the Brahmin was still important in setting the time of kasundi making, lighting the fire to boil water for kasundi and putting the water-filler earthenware pot on the stove. Process and rituals The long and tedious ritualistic kasundi making process used to begin on the day of Akshaya Tritiya (the day of prosperity and worship of goddess Laxmi in late April-early May). The weather of the season, after the mustard harvesting and drying season in winter, was considered optimal weather for fermentation ‚Äî not too cold to delay the process, nor hot or humid enough to spoil the kasundi.Utsa Ray, Culinary Culture in Colonial India, page 135, Cambridge University Press, 2015, It took more than a week to make kasundi. Pickle- making in Bengal had to be done in a certain chronology following the hervests. ‚Å†Kul-er achar (pickled Indian jujube) was made first, followed by tentul-er achar (pickled tamarind), aam-er achar (pickled mango) and finally the kasundi, right before the monsoons arrived.Ananya Baruah, Queen of Pickles: Why Bengal‚Äôs Explosive Kasundi Is The Stuff of Food Legends, The Better India, 2019-10-23 Black and yellow mustard seeds were first thoroughly washed and drained. The washing of mustard seeds was endowed with ceremonial importance in many parts of Bengal, where all the mustard seeds to be consumed by the family during the coming year were washed in one go on the day of Akshaya Tritiya. Mustard processing was ceremonially prohibited after that day. Washing the mustard had its own set of rituals ‚Äî groups of married women bathed in odd numbers, then washed mustard seeds facing east wearing still wet sarees. They sang and chanted for wealth, health and well-being while washing. Mustard was washed in a pond or a river, though washing it under a tap is an acceptable alternative in the modern days. For washing and straining a man's dhoti was used, not a woman's saree. After sunning, it was sifted. The mustard was then brought back into the house amid much ululation and lit up ghee-lamps after it has been presented to the gods. Five kinds of fruits, two unripe mangoes on the same stem, betel leaf, betel nut, Bermuda grass (dhoob) and paddy were also offered to gods along with the mustard. Next the mustard was ground, often with spices, into a fine pulp. Moderation was needed when adding spice, as over-spicing could spoil the kasundi. The seeds were pounded for two to three days to take away the bitterness and introduce the pungency (jhaanjh). Meanwhile, water from the same pond or river in which it had been washed was boiled for a fairly long time in a freshly made earthenware pot.Rebati Mohan Sarkar, Through the Vistas of Life and Lore, page 558, Punthi Pustak, 2000, A little hot water and salt were added to make a paste, sometimes with one or two green mangoes dropped into the preparation, and paste was put in a new earthenware pot in the main house of the family by a woman of the family who had a living husband. One could touch the earthenware pots only after bathing and putting on fresh clothes. Mustard in the sealed pot was then left to ferment for about two days in a cool place. This is the time when the flavours developed - the distinctive pungency, the subtle tang and the spicy notes of an ideal preparation. Once it had slightly fermented, the pots were opened and offered to pregnant women, who were in their third trimester, as shaadh. The ritual also involved giving the pregnant women their favourite foods, along with their elders' blessing. After that it was bottled and sunned for a few more days. If made under the right conditions, kasundi remained edible for years. Three or four days later, on an auspicious day of the week (i.e. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday), a part of the prepared kasundi was put into a small, new earthenware pot with a spirit, a religious rite. Then the pot was covered and sanctimoniously put in a safe place in the house to be opened on the first day of the month of Asharh (June‚ÄìJuly). On the first day of the month of Asadh, fish was prohibited for all the members of the family. On that day Goddess Parvati is worshipped as Nistarini (lit. \\"one who delivers from difficulties\\") by women of high caste Hindu families of some districts of Bengal. Types of kasundi Tomato kasundi Different households traditionally had their own unique recipe and closely guarded process of making kasundi, though the differences lie more or less in the use of spices. Some families prepared kasundi with just salt, ground mustard, dry chillies, turmeric and mustard oil. Others used combinations of different dry and ground spices like black caraway (kalonji), fennel, wild celery (radhuni shaak) seed, ajwain, long pepper (pippali), chilli, black pepper, fenugreek (methi), clove, green and black cardamom, cumin (jeera), coriander (dhonia), nutmeg (jaiphal), mace (javitri), Java pepper (kabab chini), dried mango, dried kul etc. Chaudhurani mentions a dozen spices that were added to the kasundi, including green and black cardamom, cumin, coriander, nutmeg, mace, long pepper, chillies, black pepper and wild celery seeds. It also was made with a combination of fruits like mango, tamarind, indian jujube (kul) or hog plum (amda). The base kasundi is used to make tomato-kasundi, unripe mango-kasundi and other variations.Aliza Green, The Magic of Spice Blends, page 105, Quarry Books, 2015, Satarupa Banerjee, 101 Ways to Prepare Kababs, pages 33-34, Pustak Mahal, 2001, =Jhal kasundi= The most popular variant of kasundi is the plain kasundi that is also knowa as Jhal Kasundi (fiery kasundi). While different homes had different recipes, the simplest one was made with dry ground mustard seeds (both black and yellow, taken from the newest crop), water, salt and haldi. The more complex recipes used to have minuscule amounts of 12 masalas - haldi, dried red chilli, bay leaf, coriander, cumin, fennel, pepper, ginger, wild celery (randhuni), cinnamon, javitri or green cardamom and fennel flower (kalonji) - sometimes added with a paste of green mango as a souring agent. It had to be made with strictly sanitised conditions for fear of the sauce going bad, and therefore could not be made in humid weather. =Phool kasundi= As Bengali kitchens as a principle would not let anything go to waste, the coarse pulp left behind after sieving the mustard was finely ground again and mixed with more mustard to make what is know as phool kasundi. This was also regarded as a part of the rites of making kasundi. With phool kasundi, more chilli, turmeric, green mango and salt were added to make a grainier, bolder, fuller-bodied and spicier sauce. The rest of the process was similar to regular kasundi, except in households where Brahmins made the kasundi the women of the household would make phool kasundi. Also, while kasundi was traditionally not used in cooking or served with fish or meat, phool kasundi was used to prepare shukto, the Bengali vegetable stew, and machher Jhol, the quintessential soup-like fish curry. Modern kasundi available at stores are sometimes indetified as run-down, industrial versions of phool kasundi. =Gota kasundi= Gota kasundi is made with a large number of dry spices along with dried kul or dried mangoes that were powdered and stored. It is sprinkled over cooked vegetables or saags for enhanced flavor. =Tomato kasundi= Tomato kasundi or Tamtar kasundi is typically a spicy and savory tomato and mustard chutney. It is used as a condiment and dipping sauce for foods and dishes such as paratha and naan and fried foods such as samosas and pakoras. It is also used as a spread on sandwiches and grilled meats. =Aam kasundi= Mango kasundi or aam kasundi is one of the more popular kasundi variants.Somdatta Saha, Aam Kasundi: Know How To Make This Bengali's Treasured Mango-Mustard Sauce At Home, NDTV Food, 2020-04-21 It is made from mustard seeds, hot red chillies, garlic, salt, and shredded mango.Kasundi, Cook's Info, 2011-05-05 Green mango (kacchi kairi) is used to make chutneys, pickles, as well as different kind of curries, daal, besides aam kasundi.

It is registered with the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage under number 58558. History In 1775, Gerhard Sch√∏ning stated that there were three monoliths at the church but he was apparently unaware of the inscription; the F√•berg stone was one of these three stones. The stone's runic inscription was first transcribed by Christian C. A. Lange, who stated in 1833 that the stone stood directly south of the church, along the road. In 1866, Sophus Bugge was at the site and studied the inscription. He realized that the upper part of the stone had been broken off and had disappeared. In 1870, the missing part was found and it was given to Antiquities Department at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo. In 1891 the two pieces were joined together, and the complete stone was set up again in Lillehammer. However, many people in F√•berg wished to have the stone returned, and in 1928 it was reinstalled at F√•berg Church, not far from its original site. Inscription Magnus Olsen's interpretation of the inscription on the stone is: :ruar raisti stain √æana aftir alui fa√æur sin Corresponding to Old Norse: Hr√≥arr reisti stein √æenna eptir «™lvi fa√∞ur sinn; that is, 'Roar raised this stone in honor of Olve, his father'.

It has a single smooth, tube-shaped leaf and up to thirty yellowish-green and purple flowers. It is one of the few Western Australian leek orchids which is not stimulated by summer fires and also has an unusually long flowering period. Description Prasophyllum macrostachyum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and about in diameter near its reddish base. Between five and thirty flowers are widely spaced along a flowering stem which is up to long reaching to a height of . The flowers are green and purplish-red, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is an oval shape, about long at maturity. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and green with red edges. The lateral sepals are egg-shaped to lance-shaped long and joined for about two-thirds of their length. The petals are only about long, more or less triangular and have purplish edges. The labellum is purplish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and turns sharply upwards near its middle. Flowering occurs from September to January. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum macrostachyum was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (macrostachyum) is derived from the Ancient Greek words makros meaning \\"long\\" and stachys meaning \\"an ear of grain\\" or \\"a spike\\", referring to the long flowering stem. Distribution and habitat The laughing leek orchid grows with shrubs and sedges in areas that are wet in winter and occurs between Dongara and Cape Le Grand National Park.

The village of Sangsit is located around east of Singaraja. Pura Beji is dedicated to the rice goddess Dewi Sri, and is revered especially by the farmers around the area. Pura Beji is an example of a stereotypical northern Balinese architecture with its relatively heavier decorations than it is soutnern Balinese counterpart, and its typical foliage- like carvings. History The damaged candi bentar split gate of Pura Beji in the early 20th-century. Pura Beji dates back from the 15th-century, during the time of the arrival of Brahmins to Bali from the Hindu Majapahit Kingdom of Java. At that time, the village of Sangsit was known as Beji. Pura Beji was constructed during the reign of Pasek Sakti Batu Lepang in north Bali. The architect and maintainer (pengempon) of Pura Beji was Truna Pesaren. The word Beji has the same meaning with the Balinese temple pond, similar with one in Pura Tirta Empul. This associates Pura Beji with purification by way of holy water. In fact, a former pond supposedly fed by an ancient well has been discovered on the east side of Pura Beji. Because of its association with a water source, the farmers around the village of Sangsit revered Pura Beji as \\"pura subak\\", subak is a term for the Balinese paddy irrigation system which was introduced in 1074 during the reign of Marakata. Because of this, the temple is also known as Pura Subak Beji, and is highly revered by the farmers who honored it in return to the fertility of their rice paddy. Pura Beji has been restored several times. A 20th-century photograph shows damage on the candi bentar split gate of the Pura Beji. The temple's restoration is done carefully by maintaining the original style back into the temple. Temple compound The main shrine of Pura Beji with its heavy plant-like ornaments. Pura Beji is built in the style typical of northern Bali. Shrine bases and the white sandstone walls surrounding the temple are covered in foliage-like carvings e.g. vine motifs or figures of flowers, a feature that can only be found in northern Bali. Traces of colors have been discovered in these carvings, which indicate that the temple have been painted. Intact statues of demons and guardian nagas inspired by Hindu epics decorate the stone staircases and the walls. Pura Beji is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). In the outer sanctum is the bale kulkul where the slit-log drum is kept to announce the time for prayer. The bale kulkul of Pura Beji is unusually lacking plant-like carvings and is relatively bare compared with the other architectural elements of Pura Beji, which indicates that the bale kulkul was built later in period and probably by a non-Northern Balinese sculptor. Access to the middle sanctum is provided by a candi bentar split gate. This candi bentar is carved with heavy decorations of plants and flowers in norther Balinese style. Multiple bhoma heads are carved on the top of the candi bentar, providing extra protection to the temple against evil spirits. In the middle sanctum are several pavilions or bale. Access to the inner sanctum or the jero is provided with a large paduraksa portal. The portal is heavily decorated with carvings of vines and flowers typical northern Bali style. The top of the paduraksa is carved with multiple Bhoma heads, a kind of Balinese Kirtimukha protectors of the temple. A unique feature of the Pura Beji is that the aling-aling (a kind of barrier structure to deflect evil spirits) is carved with a figure of two Dutchmen playing stringed instruments, flanking a figure of Naga. The main shrine in the form of pelinggih is located in the inner sanctum, dedicated to Sang Hyang Widhi. Other deities honored in the temple are Dewa Braban, Dewa Ayu Manik Galih, and Dewi Sri.

He served as ordinary consul for the year 118 as the colleague of the Emperor Hadrian.Werner Eck, Peter Wei√ü, \\"Hadrische Konsuln. Neue Zeugnisse aus Milit√§rdiplomen\\", Chiron, 32 (2002), p. 480 Salinator was a member of the circle of friends and peers around Pliny the Younger. Salinator was a member of the Pedanii, who had their roots as Roman colonists in the town of Barcino in Tarraconensis. Salinator himself was the son of Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator, suffect consul in either the year 83 or 84.Syme, \\"The Ummidii\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 17 (1968), p. 85 Pliny addresses three letters to Salinator (whom he calls Pedanius Fuscus), and mentions him in three more. However, the three letters Pliny wrote him are on trivial matters: one contains advice to Salinator about how to study -- although Pliny notes Salinator's \\"particular interest is pleading\\"; the other two are essays wherein Pliny describes his daily schedule.Epistulae, VII.9; IX.36, 40 The other letters mentioning him to third parties provide us more information about Salinator. One concerns Salinator's debut speech in the Senate, where he was opposed by another young Senator also delivering his debut speech, Ummidius Quadratus.Epistulae, VI.11 Another, addressed to Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, congratulates Servianus on the betrothal of his daughter to Salinator.Epistulae, VI.26 Ronald Syme supplies a name for her: Julia, the daughter of Hadrian's sister Domitia Paulina. As for Salinator's senatorial career, we know few details. Pliny's third letter mentioning him is a letter for recommendation for one Nymphidius Lupus, written to the emperor Trajan in the year 110.Epistulae, X.87 In this letter he writes that \\"Fuscus Salinator\\" has also recommended Lupus in a manner to imply that Salinator was a governor at some time before 110. Over which province he was governor is not stated in the letter, but the consensus of the experts is that it was likely Moesia Inferior. He may be the subject of a mutilated inscription recovered from Durostorum; the tenure of this unknown senator has been dated by Werner Eck from the year 108 to the year 110.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 346-348 After he completed his term as ordinary consul, Salinator vanishes from recorded history, which is surprising. \\"The consular Fasti in the early season of Hadrian's reign duly disclose several of his allies,\\" Syme writes.Syme, \\"The Ummidii\\", p. 86 As Hadrian's colleague in his first consulate as emperor, Pedianus Fuscus Salinator would occupy a very prominent position in Hadrian's list of appointees. One would expect to hear more of Salinator, yet as Syme notes, he is \\"only a name in the Fasti\\".Syme, \\"The Ummidii\\", p. 87 While his disappearance could be attributed to falling out of favor with Hadrian -- the emperor is known to have executed four men thought to have been a threat to him (Avidius Nigrinus, Cornelius Palma, Calpurnius Piso Licinianus and Lusius Quietus) -- Syme suggests that Salinator and his wife simply succumbed to \\"a malady or a pestilence soon after 118.\\" Salinator is known to have had a son by Julia, the daughter of Servianus, named Lucius Pedanius Fuscus Salinator. This son, along with his grandfather Servianus, were accused of being involved in a plot against Hadrian; as a result both men were forced to commit suicide shortly before Hadrian's death.Anthony Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, revised edition (London: Routledge, 1987), pp. 41f, 232f  References  2nd-century Romans Imperial Roman consuls Fuscus Salinator 100 ","title":"Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator (consul 118)"},{"id":"55881615","text":"Deep Run is a tributary of Godbolt Creek in Baldwin County, Alabama in the United States.

Vohra ran for the Maryland House of Delegates once, and for U.S. House twice, as a Libertarian. He was a candidate for U.S. Senate in the 2018 election in Maryland. He lost to Ben Cardin and won 1% of the vote. Profession Arvin Vohra founded a company that helps students who are taking college entrance exams.Adams, Caralee J.

Education Week. p. 10‚Äì11. His Vohra Method approach uses non-linear worksheets to provide individual learning in group classes. Vohra is of Indian American descent. Political positions Arvin Vohra is an anarcho-capitalist who believes in ending the welfare state, abolishing public schools, and ending the income tax. This view puts him at direct odds with prior Libertarian Party nominees, including Gary Johnson, who does support a \\"social safety net\\". Controversies Vohra drew flak in 2017 for calling public schools \\"welfare for the middle class\\", referring to military veterans as \\"paid killers\\", public school teachers as \\"supervisors of indoctrination camps\\", and in April 2018, for joking about violence against school board members. In defense of his view that individuals and families, rather than the state, should determine readiness for marriage and procreation, he stated, \\"Statists insist that there is some magical age at which every single person on earth is ready to give sexual consent, and seem unbothered by the fact that in America, this age varies from state to state. Logically, either that means: 1. There is not actually a magical age 2. Some states have set the age too high, and are prosecuting people unjustly 3. Some states have set the age too low, and are failing to protect kids 4. Human nature somehow varies from one state to another.\\" The Libertarian Youth Caucus called for Vohra's resignation. Multiple state Libertarian Party chapters demanded Vohra be relieved from his position, including the Libertarian Parties of Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. When asked if he personally would have sex with a 14-year-old, Vohra responded, \\"Probably not, but that's not the point. My personal life choices are mine, and I don't believe in forcing them on others.\\" On February 2, 2018, members of the LNC voted on whether or not to suspend Vohra from his position. The vote failed a two-thirds majority, and in response, prominent Libertarian activist Larry Sharpe resigned from his position in the Committee as Region 8 Alternate. On March 6, 2018, he was criticized for a satirical article that started with ‚ÄúListen, guys, rapists are good people who sometimes do things we may individually disagree with...\\", and ended with \\"See how insane that sounds? When people are doing something evil, we need to stop it, not inexplicably pander to it.‚Äù In April 2018, a new motion to suspend Vohra was brought to the LNC, prompted by new comments by Vohra: \\"Bad idea: school shootings. Good idea: school board shootings.\\" Vohra dismissed the comments as a joke, and apologized on Facebook. The motion failed in a deciding vote by Nicholas Sarwark. In June 2018, he drew criticism for appearing on the podcast of neo- Nazi Christopher Cantwell. In defense of this appearance, Vohra stated; \\"I'll take a racist who opposes government schools over a public school teacher who endorses them any day. If I have to pick between racism and welfarism, I'll pick racism in a second.\\" On July 3, 2018, Vohra lost his re-election bid to be vice-chair of the LP to Alex Merced. However, on the same day, he announced that he will seek the Libertarian Party's nomination for president in 2020.

Two obituaries of two men, both named Hamilton Fish, were printed on the front page of a newspaper from January 16, 1936. Hamilton Fish (aka Albert Fish) had been a serial killer while Hamilton Fish II had been a statesman. The latter was a descendant of 18th century politician Alexander Hamilton, who was killed in a duel by Aaron Burr; a large part of the film was shot on location at the Morris‚ÄìJumel Mansion where Burr once lived. The film also portrays one of the first known psychics, The White Crow, aka Leonora Piper.

Important remains of prehistoric people were discovered on the site - some of the oldest examples in the world, outside of Africa, of virtually anatomically modern human beings. These were discovered on the ledge just outside the cave, where 18 layers from the Middle Paleolithic era were identified. The interior of the cave contains layers ranging from the Neolithic era to the Bronze age. Excavations of the site began in 1932, by Moshe Stekelis and Ren√© Victor Neuville, but were interrupted due to a collapse. In 1936, during the Arab rebellion in Palestine, the British blew up the cave because it was being used as a hideout by gangs associated with the rebels. Excavations were renewed in 1965, by Bernard Vandermeersch, Ofer Bar-Yosef, then continued, intermittently, until 1979. Among the finds on the site are stoves, stone tools belonging to the Mousterian culture, and also human and animal bones, which attest to the fact that the cave had been used both for residence and as a burial site. The remains of 15 human skeletons were discovered on site, in a Mousterian archaeological context. Seven of them are skeletons of adults and the rest - of children. The high proportion of children skeletons is unique among Middle Palaeolithic sites, and it led researchers to look for signs of trauma or disease that might have led to their premature deaths. One child, Qafzeh 12, of around 3 years of age, by modern reference standards, had abnormalities indicating hydrocephalus. Five of these skeletons were found buried in an orderly fashion in the cave's floor, of which 2 were found with deer horns lying in their hands. The site was dated to circa 92,000 BP, using Thermoluminescence. Human remains founded in the cave were preserved at the Institut de pal√©ontologie humaine (IPH) de Paris and the largest part of Neville‚Äôs lithic series was preserved at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. One such burial is of a 10 year old boy from the earliest of the Middle Paleolithic layers, who was buried in a rectangular grave carved out of the bedrock, with his arms folded alongside his body and his hands placed on either side of his neck. Deer horns were laid on his hands, probably constituting one of the offerings put in the grave. The boy's skull bears signs of a head trauma that had probably been the cause of death. According to K. Kris Hirst, bones and bone fragments found in the cave belong to at least 27 people. Remains of Qafzeh 9 and 10 are completely pristine. An additional important find was the remains of ochre that were found on human bones, and, also, 71 pieces of ochre that were associated with burial practices, which indicates that ceremonial funerary rites that included symbolic acts which held special meaning had already been common around 100,000 years ago. Ochre was used for body dyeing and ornamentation. It was also used during the burial of a brain damaged child that was found in the cave. Red, black and yellow ochre-painted seashells were found around the cave.  Stone tools  The stone tools discovered at the site - side scrapers, disc cores and points - were of the Levallois-Mousterian type. These tools are often associated with Neanderthal settlements. Animal remains of horse, woodland-adapted red deer, rhinoceros, fallow deer, wild ox and gazelle, land snails were also found at the site stand for Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic period.

She entered politics after practicing medicine for 27 years, serving as Vice-Mayor of Beijing, Chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He Luli is the daughter of He Siyuan, the Kuomintang mayor of Beijing who negotiated the peaceful surrender of the city to the Communist Party of China near the end of the Chinese Civil War. Early life The He family in 1947: He Siyuan and wife He Yiwen, daughters He Luli (left) and He Lumei (right), and sons He Lilu and He Yili He Luli was born in June 1934 in Jinan, Shandong, China. Her father He Siyuan was the French- educated education minister of Shandong Province, and her mother was a Frenchwoman who adopted the Chinese name He Yiwen (). He Luli had two older brothers and a younger sister. After Japan invaded China in 1937, He Siyuan led a guerrilla operation in Shandong to fight the enemy. He sent his wife and four children to live in the British concession in Tianjin. After the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, Japan occupied the British concession and Yiwen moved the family home to Tianjin's Italian concession. On 31 December, the Italian authorities arrested Yiwen and the children and handed them to the Japanese, who held them as hostages and demanded He Siyuan's surrender. He rejected the demand, condemned Japan and Italy's breach of international law through diplomatic channels, and held Italian missionaries in China as a bargaining chip. Japan eventually relented and released the family. After the end of World War II, He Siyuan served as Mayor of Beijing (then known as Beiping). During the ensuing Chinese Civil War, he negotiated with the Communists for the peaceful surrender of Beiping. To prevent the surrender, Chiang Kai-shek sent agents to assassinate him. In the early morning of 18 January 1949, two bombs exploded in the He residence, killing Luli's 12-year- old sister Lumei () and gravely injuring her mother. The rest of the family were also wounded. The Juntong agent who planted the bombs, Colonel Duan Yunpeng, was captured in 1954 and executed in 1967. Career After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, He Luli studied medicine at Beijing Medical University (now Peking University Health Science Center) from 1952 to 1957. Starting in 1957, she worked as a doctor for 27 years at Beijing Children's Hospital, Xicheng District Children's Hospital, and Beijing No. 2 Hospital. He Luli entered politics in 1984, when she was appointed Deputy Mayor of Xicheng District of Beijing. She joined the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) in April 1986. She was promoted to Deputy Mayor of Beijing in 1988, and served in that position until 1996. She also concurrently served as President of the Beijing Red Cross Society. In 1993 she was elected Vice President of the All-China Women's Federation. In 1996 she was elected Chairwoman of the RCCK, replacing Li Peiyao, who had been murdered. She was reelected twice in 1997 and 2002, serving until 2007. She also became Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in March 1996. In March 1998, she was elected Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. She was reelected in March 2003, serving until 2008. In addition, she was a member of the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee in 1997 and the Macao SAR Preparatory Committee in 1999.

History Kabataang Makabayan originated from the Students' Cultural Association of UP (SCAUP) in the University of the Philippines and was initially organized as the youth arm of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 by Jose Maria Sison, Nilo Tayag and others. Sison envisioned the youth group as revolutionaries who would establish a country led by the working class instead of oligarchic politicians. It was established on November 30, 1964, Bonifacio Day, to emphasize the continuity of Andres Bonifacio's 1896 Philippine Revolution. Nationalist Senator Lorenzo Ta√±ada gave the closing speech at the KM's first national congress and was a consultant and honorary member. When Sison re-established the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1968 as a consequence of the First Great Rectification Movement, the New People's Army (NPA) was organized as its military wing; Kabataang Makabayan then became the NPA's youth arm.

She was one of the most popular celebrities in Ecuador during her lifetime. Bermeo was able to become an icon of Ecuadorian culture internationally. Over the course of her career, she released five studio albums. Early life and education Sharon la Hechicera was born Edith Rosario Bermeo Cisneros in Guayaquil, Ecuador on 28 March 1974, but she spent her childhood in the city of Dur√°n. Her nickname at home was \\"Charo\\" or \\"Charito,\\" but it morphed into \\"Sharon\\" as the pronunciation of the letter n at the end of either was added and gradually became more prominent. Bermeo took to calling herself Sharon Bermeo, but chose to take the stage name \\"Sharon la Hechicera,\\" or \\"Sharon the Sorceress,\\" in reference to her favorite TV show, the American sitcom Bewitched. From a young age, Bermeo took an interest in music. At eight years of age, she won an inter-school festival with her performances of the songs Fox incaico and Los Andes. She was also selected to be a starting member of the C.S. Emelec sports club's football team. Bermeo studied Communication sciences at the University of Guayaquil's Faculty of Social Communication for five years, providing for herself by working as a kindergarten assistant teacher or selling . Career During her university studies, Bermeo imagined herself as La Hechicera and dreamed of a music career as the character, but her mother forbade it. However, with the money Bermeo had saved, she was able to record and release her first album, Corazon Valiente (Fearless Heart), in 1998. Before this, she was a member of Los Sorceras, an opera group, but decided to go solo. Bermeo would be one of the pioneers of the technocumbia genre and created its dress style, experimenting with the high boots and short skirts that would be adopted by all other technocumbia groups within Ecuador and abroad. In 2003, Bermeo released the album Hechizo latino (Latin spell), recorded in Argentina and containing the themes of the telenovela La Hechicera under the label. Two years later she released Ragga con La Hechicera (Raggae with The Sorceress), becoming the first solo reggaeton musician in Ecuador, then created the technocumbia group Leche y Chocolate in 2005 as well. In 2010, she released the single Poco a poco (Piece by piece).

It is one of several organisms known to cause the fish disease scuticociliatosis and is considered an economically significant pathogen of farmed fish. M. avidus is believed to be the cause of a 2017 die-off of fish and sharks in the San Francisco Bay.  Taxonomy  M. avidus is a scuticociliate first described in 1964. It was discovered during a study originally aimed at investigating viruses of marine mammals, and was isolated from the bodies of seahorses collected from waters near Miami, Florida. The name of the genus refers to the University of Miami, where the first studies of the ciliate were performed, and the specific name avidus refers to its \\"greedy feeding habits\\". The name Philasterides dicentrarchi was originally applied to a similar ciliate identified as an infectious parasite in Mediterranean sea bass, but is now recognized as a junior synonym of M. avidus. However, a recent study suggests they may in fact be distinct species. The molecular phylogeny of scuticociliates is an active area of research. Morphology M. avidus cells are oval-shaped with a relatively pointed anterior end and a contractile vacuole toward the rounded posterior end of the cell. The cells feature several kineties, or rows of cilia along the major axis of the cell body, and a single caudal cilium. Descriptions vary on the number of kineties per cell, from as few as 10 to as many as 14. Each cell possesses one macronucleus and one micronucleus. The original 1964 description emphasized the significance of the morphology of the buccal apparatus and specialized oral cilia in differentiating among related ciliates. Descriptions of these features differ subtly among one another and may differentiate M. avidus from closely related species. The life cycle of M. avidus has been described and includes at least 3 stages: 1) Microstome, which mainly feeds on bacteria; 2) Macrostome, a voracious stage with a larger oral cavity which feeds on host tissues or other protozoans; and 3) tomite, a non-feeding, starvation-induced, smaller, dispersal stage. The intricate sequence in the morphological microstome to macrostome transformation of M. avidus has been described. Ecological significance Scuticociliates are free-living marine microorganisms that can function as opportunistic or facultative parasites. M. avidus infects a broad range of teleost species, as well as other groups of marine organisms such as seahorses, sharks, and crustaceans. It is one of the best characterized of the group of scuticoliciates known to cause the fish disease scuticociliatosis, in which histophagous (tissue-eating) ciliates consume the blood, skin, and eventually internal organs of infected fish. The disease has an especially high mortality rate among flatfish, possibly due to their sedentary lifestyle involving high levels of skin contact between individuals. In one comparative study, M. avidus infections spread further within host fish and had a significantly higher mortality rate than did similar scuticociliates. Infections caused by M. avidus have been described in wild fish populations and in aquaculture, where it is an economically significant pathogen. The species is believed to be responsible for a widely reported 2017 scuticociliatosis outbreak on the coast of Northern California, which saw thousands of dead fish and leopard sharks found in the San Francisco Bay. It is unclear what triggers free-living M. avidus to initiate infection. Experimental infections under laboratory conditions have produced varying results on the mechanism of infection; results in different conditions and with different host species vary in whether free-living ciliates can infect healthy fish or require an abraded or damaged skin surface. Protease enzymes are commonly expressed by infectious parasites that damage host tissue, and are believed to play a role in M. avidus infections. Transformation in M. avidus has been shown to be induced by a prey derived soluble factor, although its exact identity is unknown.

Marcus Iallius or Jallius Bassus was a Roman senator, general, and literary figure who held several offices in the imperial service during the mid-second century AD. He was suffect consul around the year 159.G√©za Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 73. Bassus is known primarily from inscriptions. His full name was Marcus Iallius Bassus Fabius Valerianus. Bassus was from Alba Helviorum (modern Joyeuse, Ard√®che), where two inscriptions record his cursus honorum., . These inscriptions give his father's name as Marcus; he might be the Marcus Iallius Bassus who was buried at Alba Helviorum.. He was probably closely related to the Quintus Iallius Bassus who was consul in 158., . Bassus' senatorial career began with his adlection inter tribunicios, that is as having held the office of plebeian tribune. After his accession to praetor, he was commissioned legatus, or commander of a legion, but its name was not preserved on either inscription; G√©za Alf√∂ldy dates his command from around the year 153 to 156, and suggests that the unknown legion could be either Legio I Adiutrix or Legio X Gemina.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 302. Then Bassus was governor of Pannonia Inferior, which Alf√∂ldy dates from around the year 156 to 159.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 251. His consulate followed. His senatorial career as an ex-consul encompasses more than the average number of offices. First Bassus held the post of curator operum locorumque publicorum et aedium sacrum, which Alf√∂ldy dates to the year 161.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 290. Then he was appointed governor of Moesia Inferior; Alf√∂ldy dates his office to the year 162.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 232. Bassus was then made one of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius' comites, an inner circle of advisors, during the Parthian War. Upon the resolution of that conflict, Bassus was appointed governor of Pannonia Superior; Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure in that province from around 166 to 169.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 237.

She was therefore one of the few women among the Early Birds of Aviation. In addition she became a proponent of flight safety.Chicago Tribune article on the Early Birds She later became supervisor of a machine shop.Early Aviators site  Early Life and First Marriage  Hodge was born in Omaha, Nebraska on August 2, 1892. She was educated at the Brownell-Talbot School (then Brownell Hall) before moving to Oakland, California with her family. They appear to have settled in Oakland by roughly 1909, when she married Ralph Newbre. In June 1916, Hodge filed for divorce, claiming Newbre had been unfaithful. A July article mentions her living with her father, and she seems to have reclaimed her maiden name. However, it appears that they may have reconciled: a 1919 article refers to the Newbres as husband and wife, and the book Before Amelia: Women Pilots in the Early Days of Aviation seems to imply that they stayed together until Ralph Newbre's death in the 1930s.  Aviator  Hodge and her twin sister, Florence \\"Dot\\" Hodge, took flying lessons together at Silas Christofferson's school in Redwood City, California, after being initially rejected due to their gender. Their instructor was aviator Frank Bryant, who taught them to fly on a Curtiss-type biplane. A San Francisco Examiner profile written in July 1916 described Helen as \\"the more venturesome of the couple\\". Their father, J.B. Hodge, reportedly disapproved of them learning to fly, but \\"accepted the situation philosophically.\\"Hodge in Los Gatos, California in 1919 Hodge at the Redwood City aviation school in 1916 Hodge trained at the Christofferson school for six months. During one flight while Hodge was at an altitude of 1500 feet, her plane's motor mount broke, causing the motor to come loose. Hodge managed to land safely, \\"much to the surprise of even her teachers.\\" Hodge's first independent flight was made over San Francisco Bay on August 19, 1916, and she received her pilot's license on November 12, 1916. At the time, she planned to become an exhibition flyer. Though she did perform several exhibition flights for the Christofferson school, most of her flights appear to have been simply for her own pleasure. Hodge was the eleventh female pilot in the United States to receive her license, and possibly the last American woman to become a licensed pilot before the start of World War I. During the war, she was a flight instructor for American cadets.  Later Life and Death  Hodge married Frank Harris in 1937 after moving to Los Angeles. There, she opened a machine shop specializing in airplane tools. She supervised a crew of twenty men and fourteen women, and could operate machinery herself as needed. Frank Harris had passed away by 1950. Hodge died in Pomona, California, in 1967.

Later the Provincial Government allocated further fund of 0.49 million for the construction of boundary wall, residential quarters, guest house, storage and other facilities in the museum. History Dir museum is based on history of Dir which is most important both historically and culturally and the history goes back to the 2nd millennium BC. The evidence of the history was gained by the excavation of numerous burials of Aryans at Timergara and other places, dating from 6th to 18th century BC.Then they were followed by the Achaemenid Empire, and the Achaemenid were expel by the invasion of Alexander in 327 BC, and faced a great trouble in conquering the local population. After that Greek historians have paid great tributes to the population. The Greeks were followed by the Gandharan Civilization and achieved a great fame, and have most significant period there by leaving of the monumental remains of the Buddhist stupas and monasteries, a few of which are present at museum. History of Dir Dir have an important position as a center of Gandhara Art. The Gandhara defined by the Pilgrims and historians \\"(the land of fragrance and beauty)\\", because this area have around the most important places, like the Indus River at the west and Kabul River at north which included the valleys of Peshawar, Swat, Dir and Bajaur, and Taxila Valley at the east in Punjab, and not only in Pakistan but extending westwards to Hadda and Bamiyan in Afghanistan. Therefore the region of Dir is filled with the remains of the Gandharan Civilization.

She was the first female chef in Italy to win that level of accolade, and only the fourth ever. Career Born near Nice, France, Annie F√©olde's parents ran a hotel. Her father came from this background, whereas her mother's family were farmers. Upon completing secondary school, F√©olde left home and moved to Marseille, where she worked for La Poste, and was then transferred to Paris. She began to travel further to improve her language skills, first to London where she lived with a family to look after their Labrador Retriever. She hoped to repeat the same situation in Florence, Italy, as she had in London, but the family there had agreed to house two women and the other one got there first, leaving F√©olde without anywhere to live upon arrival. She started working at a local restaurant instead in order to cover her living costs. This meant that she couldn't afford to go to an Italian language school as planned, but instead learnt the language from interacting with customers. She met sommelier and wine collector Giorgio Pinchiorri a year later in 1970. Together they opened Enoteca Pinchiorri, with F√©olde as head chef. They grew the restaurant from a wine bar serving snacks to a full restaurant serving hot food by 1974. She appeared on Italian television for the first time at the request of food critic Edoardo Raspelli, who inspired her to develop a modern take on Tuscan cuisine. She won her first Michelin star in 1981 at Enoteca Pinchiorri; the duo only found out when Pinchiorri bought a copy of that year's Michelin Guide from a newsagent. The second star came the following year, and the third in 1992. This made F√©olde the first female chef in Italy to win three Michelin stars, and only the fourth woman ever. The same year, arsonists set fire to the wine cellar at the restaurant. Following an assessment of the damage, F√©olde convinced Pinchiorri to keep the restaurant open and not shut down permanently.

Over the next few decades, an English-language school and a French-language school were both operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Montreal. In the 1952, the English-language school was renamed the Montreal Seventh-day Adventist School, and the school was located at the Westmount Seventh-day Adventist Church. Enrollment was low at this time, with only nine students in attendance in 1963. The school frequently moved during this era, occupying nine different sites before settling on its current campus, in the Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce neighbourhood of Montreal. In 1979, the school was renamed The Adventist School of Montreal (West). By this time the school's fortunes had begun to turn, and enrollment reached 73. The school also added a high school program at this time. In 1994, the school was named Greaves Adventist Academy, in honour of Sylvia Greaves, who joined the school in 1963 as its only teacher, and at the time of her retirement in 1985 was its principal. In 2008, Greaves expanded by adding a satellite school at a second campus: Greaves Adventist Academy - Sartigan Campus. This second school offers grades K-7 education in both English and French.

This population has declined over decades. Results of morphologic and genetic research failed to find evidence for subspecific differentiation. This population is also referred to as the \\"American jaguar\\" and \\"Central American jaguar\\".  Taxonomic history  Illustration of a western Mexican jaguar Initially, a number of jaguar subspecies were described: * The taxonomic name Panthera onca goldmani (Mearns, 1901) was proposed as ranging from the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico, in the north, to Belize and Honduras in the south. * Panthera onca hernandesii (Mearns, 1901) was proposed as native to Mexico and the United States of America. * Panthera onca veraecruscis (Nelson and Goldman, 1933) was proposed as ranging from Tabasco in Mexico to Texas in the United States. * Panthera onca arizonensis (Goldman, 1932) was proposed with a range from Sonora in Mexico, to the southwestern part of United States, before 1939. * Panthera onca centralis (Mearns, 1901) was proposed for Central America.Baker, Taxonomy, pp. 5‚Äì7. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock did not find evidence for morphological distinction between P. o. hernandesii, P. o. centralis and P. o. arizonensis and considered them one subspecies. Recent tests failed to establish evidence for different subspecies of the jaguar.  Evolution  The modern jaguar is thought to have descended from a pantherine ancestor in Asia that crossed the Beringian land bridge into North America during the Early Pleistocene. From North America, it spread to Central and South America. The ancestral jaguar in North America is referred to as Panthera onca augusta.  Characteristics  Unlike jaguars in South America, jaguars in Central or North America are fairly small. Those in the Chamela- Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the Mexican Pacific coast weigh just about , similar in weight as female cougars. was the average for six males in Belize, making them similar to South American females in Venezuela.  Ecology and behaviour  In northeastern Mexico, jaguars co-occur with cougars. Both are foremost active at night and prey on white-tailed deer, collared peccary and cattle calves. Other sympatric predators in the region include the grizzly bear and American black bear. There is evidence that El Jefe preyed on an American black bear. In July 2018, in the Central American section of the Audubon Zoo in the US city of New Orleans, Louisiana, a 3-year-old male called 'Valerio' escaped from its enclosure, which had a roof in poor condition. It killed four alpacas, an emu and a fox, and injured two other alpacas and a fox, before being captured about an hour after its escape was notified. The killings were apparently the result of a territorial dispute. Its behaviour was not deemed to be abnormal for its species.  Habitat and distribution  In North America, the jaguar ranges from the southern part of the United States in the north, to the southern part of Central America in the south. Recently, jaguars of Mexican origin have been spotted in Arizona. = United States of America = In 1799, Thomas Jefferson recorded the jaguar as an animal of the Americas. There are multiple zoological reports of jaguars in California, two as far north as Monterey in 1814 (Langsdorff) and 1826 (Beechey). The coastal Diegue√±o (Kumeyaay people) of San Diego and Cahuilla Indians of Palm Springs had words for jaguar and the cats persisted there until about 1860. The only recorded description of an active jaguar den with breeding adults and kittens in the United States was in the Tehachapi Mountains of California, prior to 1860. In 1843, Rufus Sage, an explorer and experienced observer recorded jaguar present on the headwaters of the North Platte River north of Longs Peak in Colorado. Cabot's 1544 map has a drawing of jaguar ranging over the Pennsylvania and Ohio valleys. Historically, the jaguar was recorded in far eastern Texas, and the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico. However, since the 1940s, the jaguar has been limited to the southern parts of these states. Although less reliable than zoological records, Native American artefacts with possible jaguar motifs range from the Pacific Northwest to Pennsylvania and Florida. By the late 1960s, jaguars were thought to have been eliminated in the United States. A female was shot by a hunter in Arizona's White Mountains in 1963. Arizona outlawed jaguar hunting in 1969, but by then no females remained and over the next 25 years only two male jaguars were found (and killed) in Arizona. Then in 1996, Warner Glenn, a rancher and hunting guide from Douglas, Arizona, came across a jaguar in the Peloncillo Mountains and became a researcher on jaguars, placing webcams which recorded four more Arizona jaguars. No jaguars sighted in Arizona in the last 15 years had been seen since 2006. Then, in 2009, a male jaguar named Macho B died shortly after being radio-collared by Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) officials in 2009. In the Macho B incident, a former AGFD subcontractor pleaded guilty to violating the endangered species act for trapping the cat and a Game and Fish employee was fired for lying to federal investigators. In 2011, a male jaguar weighing was photographed near Cochise in southern Arizona by a hunter after being treed by his dogs (the animal left the scene unharmed). A second 2011 sighting of an Arizona jaguar was reported by a Homeland Security border pilot in June 2011, and conservation researchers sighted two jaguars within of the border between Mexico and the United States in 2010. In September 2012, a jaguar was photographed in the Santa Rita Mountains of Arizona, the second such sighting in this region in two years. This jaguar has been photographed numerous times over the past nine months through June 2013. On 3 February 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity released a video of this jaguar ‚Äì now named El Jefe (Spanish for \\"The Boss\\") ‚Äì roaming the Santa Rita Mountains, about south of downtown Tucson. El Jefe is the fourth jaguar sighted in the Madrean Sky Islands in southern Arizona and New Mexico, over the last 20 years. On 16 November 2016, a jaguar was spotted in the Dos Cabezas Mountains of Arizona, from the Mexican border, the farthest north one of these animals has been spotted in many decades. It is the seventh jaguar to be confirmed in the Southwest since 1996. On 1 December 2016, another male jaguar was photographed on Fort Huachuca also in Arizona. In February 2017, authorities revealed that a third jaguar had been photographed in November 2016, by the Bureau of Land Management in the Dos Cabezas Mountains, also in Arizona, some north of the border with Mexico. The only picture obtained allowed experts to determine this is a different individual, but it does not reveal its gender.  Conservation  Legal action by the Center for Biological Diversity led to federal listing of the cat on the endangered species list in 1997. However, on January 7, 2008, George W. Bush appointee H. Dale Hall, Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), signed a recommendation to abandon jaguar recovery as a federal goal under the Endangered Species Act. Critics, including the Center of Biological Diversity and New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, were concerned the jaguar was being sacrificed for the government's new border fence, which is to be built along many of the cat's typical crossings between the United States and Mexico. In 2010, however, the Obama Administration reversed the policy of the Bush Administration, and pledged to protect \\"critical habitat\\" and draft a recovery plan for the species. The USFWS was ultimately ordered by the court to develop a jaguar recovery plan and designate critical habitat for the cats. On 20 August 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico ‚Äî an area larger than Rhode Island ‚Äî as critical jaguar habitat. On 4 March 2014 Federal wildlife officials set aside nearly 1,200 square miles along the U.S.-Mexico border as habitat essential for the conservation of the jaguar. The reservation includes parts of Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties in Arizona and Hidalgo County in New Mexico. In September 2015, El Jefe was photographed via camera trap and analysis of his spots confirms that he has been in southeastern Arizona ( south of Tucson) since 2011. Jaguars have been present in this region every year since 1997. El Jefe and other males may have originated from a breeding population in Sonora, Mexico, to the south of Tucson. = Northern Jaguar Project = The Northern Jaguar Project is a conservation effort on behalf of the jaguar that is headed by an Arizona-based organization of the same name, in conjunction with Mexico's Naturalia. It is focused on protecting the jaguars living near the border between the United States and Mexico. The core of the project is the Northern Jaguar Reserve. The project began in 2003 with the purchase of the 10,000 acre Los Pavos Ranch in northern Mexico, just south of the border. In 2008 it was expanded to more than double its size when Rancho Zetasora was acquired. Both ranches are remote, difficult to access, and relatively untouched, making them perfect habitat, not just for jaguars, but for many other species as well. The Northern Jaguar Project is the \\"northernmost location where jaguars, mountain lions, bobcats, and ocelots are all found in the same vicinity\\", and the park also features a variety of floral habitats as well. The project is also focused on efforts to create a stable jaguar population in Northwestern Mexico. However, its long term aspirations include a return of the jaguar to the Southwestern United States. The potential for such a re-introduction is deemed high, since as much as 30% of Arizona alone is considered to be a suitable habitat for the jaguar.  Threats  San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge is close to the proposed border barrier, and since the proposed project would cut through a migration corridor for the jaguar between Mexico and the USA, it may interfere with the migration of Mexican jaguars to the USA, not withstanding other animals.

Catalogued as IVPP V20284, it was found in a layer of the Yixian Formation dating from the Aptian. It consists of an almost complete and associated skeleton with skull, compressed on a plate. It preserves feather remains at the neck. About forty gastroliths have been preserved. It represents an adult individual. The specimen was acquired by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. The piece was prepared by Li Dahang. In 2015 the type species Dingavis longimaxilla was named and described by Jingmai O'Connor, Wang Min and Hu Han. The generic name combines the name of Ding Wenjiang, the \\"Father of Chinese Geology\\", with a Latin avis, \\"bird\\". The specific name is derived from the Latin longus, \\"long\\", and maxilla.

The Constitution of Jordan of 1952 affirmed Islam as the state religion, but it did not state that Islam is the source of legislation. Jordanian penal code has been influenced by the French Penal Code of 1810. Historical background Jordanian law is influenced by Ottoman law. Until 1918, the Kingdom of Jordan was part of the Ottoman Empire and its legal system consisted of Shari'a courts whose decisions were based on the four schools of Islamic law (called madhhab). These four madhabib are: Hanafi Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali. While secular courts have been established under the Jordanian government in modern times, areas of personal status still fall within the jurisdiction of religious shari'a courts. Tribes were very important in Jordan and the tribes had varied legal traditions. During the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman legal system, the Ottoman Mecelle was introduced to Jordan. The 1917 Ottoman Family Code forms the basis of modern Jordanian personal status laws. Modern era The first Constitution of Jordan was adopted in 1948. This started the process of creating a national legal system in the Post-Ottoman period. Both the 1948 and 1952 constitutions of Jordan affirm that Islam is the state religion. The first Jordanian Law of Family Rights was enacted in 1947; it was replaced by the Law of Family Rights 1951. In 1952 the Jordanian Law of Personal Status was enacted. The first modern Shari'a courts were established in Jordan in 1951. These courts are based on the Hanafi school, but Jordanian laws about women draw on Maliki law. Under the 1952 Constitution shari'a courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters regarding the \\"personal status\\" of Muslims, including marriage, divorce, guardianship and inheritance. Shari'a courts also exercise jurisdiction over Muslim religious endowments (call waqfs, \\"purely religious affairs\\" and the reconciliation of blood feuds through blood money (called diyah). In cases concerning blood feuds the shari'a courts have exclusive jurisdiction if both parties involved are Muslim. In cases where one party is Muslim and the other non-Muslim, the shari'a courts will have jurisdiction only if the non-Muslim party agrees to trial before a shari'a court. Court system =Religious courts= Shari'a courts only have jurisdiction over personal matters, including areas of family law like marriage or divorce, child custody, adoption, and inheritance matters. Islamic religious courts only have jurisdiction over Muslims. Christians have separate religious councils for most matters. Inheritance laws are a special case which are administered through the religious courts of the family's religion, but governed by Shari'a principles in all cases. The shari'a court system has both courts of first instance and courts of appeal. The High Court of Justice has appellate jurisdiction over the lower appeal courts. Shari'a court judges are selected from among the ulama. Criminal law Jordanian criminal law is based on the Ottoman Law of 1858, which in turn is based upon the French Penal Code of 1810. In 1960 Jordan issued Criminal Law no. 16. This law was strongly influenced by the Lebanese Criminal Law of 1943, which borrowed provisions from the French Penal Code regarding penalties for crimes committed against women (art 562). After amendments were passed to article 98 of the penal code in 2017, perpetrators of honor crimes can no longer receive lenient sentences. However, a loophole still exists in article 340 that allows lenient sentences for the murder of a spouse found red-handedly committing adultery. Personal Status law The Personal Status law is the family law applies to all disputes involving Muslims and the children of Muslim fathers. Many Jordanian Christians voluntarily accept the jurisdiction of the Personal Status law in matters regarding inheritances. The legal age of marriage has been increased to 18, but at the chief justice's discretion this may be lowered to 15. All Jordanian Muslims are required to be married under Islamic law. Article 19 of the Personal Status law allows women to place conditions on their marriage contracts, within certain limitations. As most women are not aware of this right, it is rarely used in practice. Women's rights advocates suggest that a list of possible conditions attached to the contract would serve to inform women of their rights under Jordanian law. The Jordanian government has elected to adhere to the Maliki school in some matters, which has restricted women's marriage rights. Hanafi law, which is the dominant influence in Jordan, does not require the consent of a male guardian for a woman to marry. However, under the law applied in Jordan a woman can not marry without the permission of either a Shari'a judge or a male guardian. The Personal Status law does not allow women to have guardianship over children, though this would be allowed under Islamic legal principles. In Jordan, only fathers may be the guardian or welaya. A \\"guardian\\" is a person appointed under law to act on behalf of a minor or other person who does not have full legal capacity. Any female dependents under 40, who have not been previously married, are subject to lose their rights to financial maintenance if they \\"rebel\\" against their guardian. Influence in the Occupied Palestinian territories Israeli occupation forces accepted that the West Bank would be governed under the law that was in effect before June 5, 1967 with the condition that \\"security enactments take precedence over all law, even if they do not explicitly repeal it.\\" Although passed after 1967, the Jordanian Law of Personal Status (JLPS) of 1976 is applied by West Bank courts, The Shari'a courts of the West Bank and the Jordanian-administered Shari'a court in East Jerusalem are governed under Jordanian law, especially the Law of Shar'i Procedure of 1959. Included within the Shari'a courts jurisdiction are waqf (religious endowments), family law, personal status issues, and petitions for diya (monetary damages for murder or physical injuries). The Shar'a courts have jurisdiction over these matters where the parties are Muslim, or in cases where a non-Muslim party agrees to their jurisdiction.

According to archaeological studies conducted in 1972, the place has been inhabited since the prehistory, but the first fortress equipment dates from around 5th-6th centuries, when it represented a unit of the Early Byzantine defense system. The peak of fortress development was around 13-14 centuries during the Second Bulgarian Empire, when outer wall was erected. The wall acted as a barrier from the north, where the only entrance from the village of Bozhenitsa is situated. By the end of 14th century, the fortress served as the headquarters of boyar Ognen (Ognyan), a local governor (kephale) during the rule of Emperor Ivan Shishman (r. 1371‚Äì1395). One of the most notable points of interest is a 10 meter deep water cistern, as well as the cave chapel inside the fortress. A trove of silver coins, dating from the reign of Ivan Shishman, was uncovered near the gates at the depth of 0.2-1.5 m. Hundreds of arrow and spear heads, as well as skeletons of soldiers, were unburied near the walls. They testify the fight between sevast Ognyan and the Turks around 1395. In 1966 the medieval fortress was declared as an site of national significance.

Dardess, published by University of California Press. Its main subject is Taihe (T'ai-ho) County, Jiangxi (Kiangsi) in the Ming Dynasty period. The book discusses Taihe County's social network as well as the relationship with the Chinese central government and the network's disintegration. Jerry Dennerline of Amherst College described it as a \\"history of a devolving network of literati elite families in T'ai-ho and their culturally and politically most visible members.\\"Dennerline, p. 1294. Cynthia Brokaw wrote that the ebbing of the relationship between the central government and Taihe is the main subject of the book.Brokaw, p. 140. Dardess chose to use Taihe County as the subject of the book because of the large number of educated persons there, and because of their significant participation in national politics,Brook, p. 1052. not because Taihe was typical of any manner. Harriet T. Zurndorfer of Leiden University stated that the book both analyzed historical documents and provided an answer for how Taihe responded to the demands of its era.Zurndorfer, p. 630. Background Morris Rossabi of City University of New York described Dardess as \\"one of the most distinguished historians of traditional China\\".Rossabi, p. 187. Sources used included veritable records of the court and genealogical records. Many sources about Taihe survived due to the prominence of Taihe people in the Ming governments. Dardess used a lot of collected works, or wenji.Dunstan, p. 598. Comments discussing paintings, letters, and poems were used as sources for Part I of the book.Farmer, p. 162. Edward L. Farmer of the University of Minnesota wrote that Dardess \\"is keenly aware of the limits of his sources.\\" He stated that the elite often did not write about the lower social classes, so his records had no information about them.Rossabi, p. 188. In regards to the official birth statistics showing the birth ratios as 180 male to 100 female, Dardess concluded that much of the skew is due to records not reporting female births and that infanticide targeting baby girls made up to 10% of the gender skew. Contents The book has three parts: \\"The Setting,\\" \\"The Pressures of Change,\\" and \\"T'ai-ho Literati in the Wider World of Ming China.\\" The first outlines the geographical layout of the county, including the farming operations and the structure of the county seat, as well as the decline in the cultural importance of the county landscapes; originally Taihe elites made works about their own landscapes, but later they made works about Suzhou instead.Karlitz, p. 87. Zurndorfer stated \\"the description of the T'ai-ho landscape incorporates the writing processes that give the landscape both meaning and a sense of power.\\"Zurndorfer, p. 636. The second discusses the sociological elements, including the rural-oriented class structure, as well as the organizations of families and the hiring of government employees. The Taihe officials chose not to become involved in the affairs of wider China as the family associations were replaced by lineage organizations, which acquired large amounts of land; since Taihe elites focused on their locally developed organizations, this distanced Taihe from the wider country. The people of Taihe County saw a perceived decline in the morality of the persons prominent in the economy of Taihe and asked for intervention from the central government.Karlitz, p. 88. Chapter 5 discusses how people gained employment in the government and their career trajectories.Brook, p. 1053. Catherine Carlitz of the University of Pittsburgh wrote that it \\"is probably the clearest overview in English of routes into the Ming bureaucracy.\\"Carlitz, p. 86. Farmer stated that the information on the decline in birthrates and resulting downward mobility among the upper class of Taihe is \\"Perhaps most interesting to readers of [the Journal of Interdisciplinary History]\\". The third discusses how the distancing of relations from the wider country affected the academic culture of Taihe. There were four distinct trends which weakened the academic fabric of Taihe that occurred in the Ming Dynasty.Brokaw, p. 140-141. Chu Hung-lam of Academia Sinica wrote that \\"For the student of Ming political and intellectual history, part 3 of this book is especially informative.\\"Chu, p. 405. Reception Zurndorfer stated that the book can assist both general readers and specialists and that \\"raises a number of historiographical issues that should, I hope, create debate between those scholars who see the relevance of situating the results of highly erudite sinological research into the broader stream of historical writing, and those who do not.\\"Zurndorfer, p. 637. Dennerline wrote that Dardess \\"is a great storyteller[...]to be thanked for his attention to the careful selection and translation of literati words.\\"Dennerline, p. 1295. He concluded that it is \\"a stunningly detailed moving picture of one part of China, inextricably linked both to the Ming's imperial center and its broadly flowing cultural streams as the developments we seek to understand occurred.\\" Timothy Brook of the University of Toronto wrote that the book is \\"local history at its best\\" and \\"a careful reconstruction of the first two centuries of the Ming period\\". Chu wrote that the book was \\"splendid account of changes in the social fabric of Tai-ho County from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, as well as shifts in human preoccupations during this period\\"Chu, p. 402. that \\"The research in this book is remarkable\\".Chu, p. 403. He stated the discourse on Yang Shih- ch'i and Lo Ch'in-shun were \\"illuminating\\". Chu also praised the newly discovered material about Hu Chih, Ouyang Te, and Yin Chih. He argued that a Chinese glossary would have helped, and he stated there were some mistakes in translation and with Chinese, but \\"such mistakes have not done much harm to the main argument of the book.\\" Helen Dunstan wrote in Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies that Dardess had \\"acumen in bringing the interest of seemingly obscure topics to the attention of the sinological community\\" and that he \\"has put Taihe onto the historical map\\". Dunstan criticized the \\"elite studies perspective\\" which limited his finding \\"obscure\\" facts and she suggested including \\"an acknowledgement of the possibility of there having been rich and interesting local colour in the lives of ordinary Taihe people would have made for a more balanced ending to an otherwise fine book.\\"Dunstan, p. 599. Farmer stated \\"Dardess has drawn brilliantly on writings of one county's elite to sketch the contours of change during four centuries.\\" Rossabi wrote that the book is \\"a readable and authoritative analysis\\" and that it \\"will offer an invaluable means of understanding Ming China\\". Romeyn Taylor of the University of Minnesota described it as an \\"engagingly written monograph\\", adding that the lack of Chinese characters in the index and in the main body \\"may prove an inconvenience to some readers.\\"Taylor, p. 435.

Background  The Baltic Sea proved a difficult theatre of operation for submarines as experienced by Soviets during the Soviet submarine Baltic Sea campaign in 1942 and during the failed operation in 1943. The German command dispatched the following units in Kotka from the end of June to operate against the local Soviet shipping in the Gulf: U-481, U-748, U-1193, U-242, U-250, U-348, U-370, U-475, U-479, U-679, U-717, U-745, U-1001.http://kotisivut.fonet.fi/~aromaa/Navygallery/Submarines/badewanne- boats.htm  Main campaign  German operations until Moscow Armistice when Finland joined Side with Allies.https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/search.php On 15 July 1944, U-679 was attacked by small Soviet boats: during a gunnery battle, the motor torpedo boat TK-57 suffered damages and two of her torpedoes barely missed the submarine. U-679 fled under cover of Finnish ground artillery. On 18 July 1944, U-479 damaged the Soviet submarine chaser MO-304 (later repaired). On 28 July 1944, U-475 damaged the Soviet submarine chaser MO-107 On 30 July 1944, U-481 attacked a group of small Soviet minesweepers, sinking KT-804 and KT-807 while KT-806 was damaged. On the same day U-250 sunk the Soviet submarine chaser MO-105 but was then chased by other units until she sunk by depth charges launched by MO-103. 6 crewmember of U-250, including the captain, were captured by Soviet and the submarine sunk at low depth: Soviet divers worked to collect intelligence despite Axis attempts to prevent it (with mines, depth-charging the wreck and artillery shelling). Despite the efforts, Soviets managed to raise and recover the wreck, acquiring secret documents, an ENIGMA machine and the new acoustic G7es torpedo, gaining the interest of the Royal Navy that asked (and failed) to obtain one of the torpedoes. On 31 July 1944, U-379 sunk the Soviet submarine chaser MO-101. On 25 August 1944, U-242 sunk the Soviet survey vessel KKO-2 (600 tons) that was lost together the towed barge VRD-96 Del'fin (500 tons.

The loss of U-250 was particularly important for the technology and intelligence obtained by the Soviets.

Background Talismanic is a \\"photogenic\\" dark bay horse with a large white blaze and four white stockings. He was bred by Darley Stud, which purchased his sire Medaglia d'Oro in 2009. Medaglia d'Oro was the most successful performer on the dirt of El Prado, a son of Sadler's Wells, with major wins including the Travers Stakes, Whitney Handicap and Donn Handicap. As a sire, Medaglia d'Oro is best known for his American runners on the dirt, including champions Rachel Alexandra and Songbird, but has also had success with turf performers in Australia and Europe. Talismanic's dam Magic Mission is a stakes-winning daughter of Machiavellian. She descends from the outstanding mare Highclere, winner of the 1000 Guineas and Prix de Diane. Other members of this family include Deep Impact, Nayef, Nashwan and Unfuwain. Talismanic is owned by Godolphin, the racing arm of Darley Stud. He was trained by Andr√© Fabre and regularly ridden by Mickael Barzalona. Racing career Talismanic made his debut on 15 July 2015 at Deauville, finishing fifth in a maiden race over 1200 metres. He improved to finish second at Fontainebleau on 15 September, then broke his maiden with a seven-length victory at Compi√®gne over 2200 metres. Talismanic made his first start as a three-year-old on 2 March 2016 at Saint-Cloud in the listed Prix Maurice Caittault, finishing second. He returned on 16 May to win the Prix de l'Avre at a distance of 2400 metres by lengths. This encouraged Fabre to enter him in the Prix du Jockey-Club at Chantilly on 16 June, where he finished a creditable fourth to Almanzor. He next started in the Grand Prix de Paris on 14 July, in which he finished fifth but was beaten by only lengths. He returned to the winner's enclosure in the listed Prix Turenne on 14 September before finishing a well-beaten eleventh in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. =2017: four-year-old season= Talismanic began his four-year-old campaign on 17 March 2017 with a second-place finish in the listed Prix de la Porte de Madrid. He then went off as favourite in the Prix Lord Seymour on 17 April over a distance of 2400m. He set a slow early pace then accelerated about 300m from the finish line to win comfortably. In his next starts, he finished second in both the Prix d'H√©douville and Grand Prix de Chantilly. On 17 July, Talismanic earned his first Group win in the Prix Maurice de Nieuil on firm going at Saint-Cloud, in which he set a course record for 2800m of 2m 58.40. He was held up well behind the early leaders then displayed an impressive turn of foot in the straight to win. Fabre then considered entering him in the Sword Dancer Stakes at Saratoga in America, but arrangements fell through. He instead finished a fast-finishing third on heavy going in the Prix Foy behind Dschingis Secret and Cloth of Stars. Despite Talismanic's limited success at the highest level of racing, Fabre felt confident enough in the colt's ability to ship him to California for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Del Mar on 4 November. \\"I thought it would suit him because of his breeding, because of his balance, because of his mind and because of his ability\\", said Fabre. \\"He's a better horse than you've seen but difficult to place, which is why he went for longer-distance races.\\" Handicappers considered him to be a good longshot option in an excellent field that included defending champion Highland Reel and multiple graded/group one stakes winners such as Beach Patrol, Oscar Performance and Seventh Heaven. Talismanic raced a few lengths behind the early pace set by Oscar Performance, with Beach Patrol and Highland Reel tracking in second and third respectively. Around the final turn, Beach Patrol moved to the lead but Talismanic then started his drive and pulled away to win by half a length. Joe Osborne of Godolphin credited Fabre for the win. \\"The man is a living legend\\", he said. \\"He's just a master trainer and trained this horse perfectly. So, it's just a great result for us by our stallion, and bred by us and everything. So it just ticks all the boxes.\\" Talismanic finished his four-year-old campaign on 10 December in the Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin. He tracked a few lengths behind the early pace set by Helene Charisma followed by Highland Reel, who took command at the top of the straight. Talismanic then made a strong move to close to within a half length before Highland Reel responded and drew off to win by lengths. =2018: five-year-old season= Talismanic at the 2018 Breeders' Cup Talismanic made his first start of 2018 on 6 March over Chantilly's Fibresand all-weather surface in the Darshaan Stakes at a distance of 1,900m. He tracked the early pace until they entered the stretch, at which time Talismanic took control of the race. Cloth of Stars, the runner-up in the 2017 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, finished second. Fabre used the race as a prep for Talismanic's next scheduled start, the Dubai World Cup, in which Talismanic finished a disappointing ninth. Fabre then gave Talismanic a \\"short holiday\\" before resuming training for the Prix Gontaut- Biron at Deauville on 15 August. On a good-to-soft turf course, he settled into fourth place during the early running, then took command with a furlong and a half remaining in the race. Eased near the wire, he still won by two lengths over Subway Dancer. Talismanic was entered in the Prix Foy on 16 September, in which he tracked the early pace before taking the lead in the homestretch. He could not match the closing speed of Waldgeist and finished lengths behind, just holding off Cloth of Stars for second. He then finished 13th behind Enable in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 7 October. Returning to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf on 3 November, he had a poor trip and finished sixth. Retirement On November 16, Godolphin announced that Talismanic had been retired. He entered stud in 2019 at Darley Japan for a fee of 1.8M Yen. Pedigree Talismanic is inbred 4S x 4D to Northern Dancer, meaning this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Both of her parents, Leslie John and Iris Trump (born Iris Butler), were social workers. After attending Stockton Sixth Form College, she went on to study medicine at Downing College, Cambridge, graduating as MB BCh in 1988. She later spent three years as a genetics researcher at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital under the supervision of Professor Rajesh V. Thakker, where she searched for the specific genetic defect in X-linked hypophosphataemia and worked with a group that attempted to map the first draft of the human genome. She was awarded a Doctor of Medicine for her research in 1996. In 1995, Trump returned to Cambridge, where she undertook specialist training in clinical genetics while researching X-linked retinoschisis. She eventually identified the gene defect that causes the disease, but made the discovery only after a competing team. As a consultant and senior lecturer in genetics at Addenbrooke's Hospital, she specialised in genetic disorders affecting the eye, including X-linked congenital stationary night blindness and oculocutaneous albinism. She left Cambridge for Manchester in 2003 to take up a chair in human molecular genetics. In Manchester, she continued her research on genetics of the eye, but also developed an interest in genetic causes of deafness.

The charge of Captain general of the Japan's trip was officially attributed by the governor of Portuguese India as a reward for services rendered. The large ships involved in this trade were referred to as the nau do trato, the silver ships, China's ships, and became known among the Japanese as Kurofune (black ships), a term that came to be used to name all Western ships that supplied in Japan during the Edo period. A Portuguese Black Ship in Nagasaki. Japanese Nanban art screen, XVII century Upon arriving in Japan in 1543, Portuguese merchants and adventurers engaged in a profitable trade on the island of Kyushu, on their own ships and Chinese reeds, without a stable port. Because of a ban on the relations between China and Japan, they acted as intermediaries. In 1550, the importance of this trade led to the creation of an annual trip under the monopoly of the Portuguese Crown. To this end, a chief captain was appointed. This was a coveted position assigned by the official authorities as a reward for services rendered. The right to carry on the \\"Japan voyage\\" was donated by the local Crown entities such as the city of Macau, Kochi, Malacca. Later, it was auctioned in Goa to the highest bidder. Given the long distance between Goa and Japan, the route initially departed from Malacca. After several attempts to create an intermediate stop in China, in 1554 Leonel de Sousa, the chief captain of Japan's voyage, reached an agreement with Canton authorities to legalize the Portuguese trade, on condition of paying specially stipulated customs duties.DIFFIE, SHAFER, WINIUS, Bailey Wallys, Boyd C., George Davison, \\"Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580\\", p.389 From 1557, the Portuguese achieved the official establishment in Macau. The city became integrated in a triangular trade that finished in Japan. Then, in 1570, after an agreement with the local daimy≈ç, they founded the city of Nagasaki. The ship sailed from Goa in April or May, loaded with fabrics, glass and glass objects, Flanders watches and Portuguese wines.

He is regarded as one of the most prominent post-war contemporary Polish poets. In 2015, he was awarded the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award as a recognition for his poetry works.  Life and works  He was born on 28 June 1943 in St. Valentin, Austria. After World War II, he moved to Poland, where he graduated from Marie Curie High School No. 2 in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski. He further studied Polish philology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ. He made his literary debut in 1964 in Pozna≈Ñ's literary club Od nowa, where he publicly read out one of his untitled poems. His first poem was published in 1966 (WczasowstƒÖpienie) in a literary magazine Pomorze. In 1968, he wrote Pƒôd pogoni, pƒôd ucieczki (\\"The Impulse to Pursue, the Impulse to Flee\\"), which one year later appeared in his first book of poetry Akt urodzenia (\\"The Birth Certificate\\"). He also published articles in an emigration weekly Wiadomo≈õci (\\"The News\\"). In the 1970s and 1980s, he was actively involved in the opposition movement against communist authorities of the Polish People's Republic. In 1971‚Äì1973 he worked at the editorial office of the Krak√≥w-based Student magazine where he met many prominent members of the generation of the Polish New Wave (1968‚Äì1976) including Adam Zagajewski and Stanis≈Çaw Bara≈Ñczak. He was the signatory of Letter of 59, which was a reaction of Polish intellectuals against the undemocratic changes in the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic. As a direct consequence of this, his works were officially banned between 1976‚Äì1980. He collaborated with Workers' Defense Committee and in the period of 1977‚Äì1981, he published articles in Zapis magazine. In 1980, he took part in a hunger strike in St. Christopher's Church in Podkowa Le≈õna as an act of solidarity with the detained political dissidents Dariusz Kobzdej and Miros≈Çaw Chojecki. He published numerous texts and articles in opposition magazines such as Solidarno≈õci Wielkopolski (\\"Greater Poland Solidarity\\"), Obserwator Wielkopolski (\\"Greater Poland's Observer\\") and Bez Debitu (\\"Without Debit\\"). He also published his works in Zeszyty Literackie (\\"Literary Notebooks\\"). In 1988, he co-founded wydawnictwo a5 publishing house in Pozna≈Ñ, which specialized in the publication of poetry books. Since 1991, he has been running a publishing company together with his wife Krystyna. Nowadays, Krynicki is seen as one of the foremost representatives of contemporary Polish poetry alongside Adam Zagajewski and Ewa Lipska. In 2015, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Learning.  Themes  His early poems contain a wealth of poetic devices and evoke gloomy imagery which presents reality as \\"a nightmare of chaos, emptiness and nothingness\\". The all-pervasive feeling of oppression and hostility characteristic of his works in this period can be interpreted in political, ethical and metaphysical aspects. Krynicki's approach to poetry at that time \\"concentrated on language in order to discern the falsehoods perpetrated in language by the totalitarian ideology. The goal was to escape from the lies of communist new-speak\\". His later works represent a radical shift from complex, Baroque poems to short, simple, miniature poems that evolved from \\"an imperative of internal self-perfection, cleansing the world of falsehood, and refusing to submit to various concepts of nothingness\\". Their aim was to inspire the reader to contemplate the world and to encourage empathy.

Averbakh was a powerful figure in Russian cultural circles until Josif Stalin ordered RAPP to cease its activities, in 1932.  Family and early career  Leopold Averbakh was born to Jewish parents in 1903 in Saratov, though most of his family links were in Nizhny Novgorod. His father, Leonid, owned a small steamship on the Volga. Aged only 14 at the time of the Bolshevik revolution, he had exceptionally good family links with the new regime. His mother was the sister of Yakov Sverdlov and of Zinovy Sverdlov, who became the adopted son of Maxim Gorky. He was also related to Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich. His sister, Ida, married Genrikh Yagoda, future head of the NKVD. He played a prominent role in the Bolshevik youth movement in his teens, and by the age of 19, he was editor of the literary journal Moldaya gvardiya ('Young Guard'), and a leading member of the All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (VAPP), the forerunner of RAPP. He was one of three representatives of VAPP who signed an agreement in 1923 with the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky promising that their respective organisations would co-operate to \\"steadfastly unmask bourgeois-gentry and pseudo-sympathetic literary groups\\" and to promote \\"class artistry\\". Andy McSmith, Fear and the Muse Kept Watch, The Russian Masters - from Akhmatova and Pasternak to Shostakovich and Eisenstein - Under Stalin (the New Press, New York, 2015) p 45. One of the 'bourgeois' writers they targeted was Mikhail Bulgakov, whom Averbakh denounced in September 1924 as a writer \\"who doesn't pretend to disguise himself as a fellow traveller.\\"McSmith, Fear and the Muse p55  Head of RAPP  Late in 1925, the Soviet communist party's ruling triumvirate of Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev split. Illarion Vardin, effective leader of VAPP, joined the Zinoviev faction. Averbakh and most of VAPP's younger members broke with him and founded RAPP, as a kind of literary wing of the Stalinist faction, though they never sought or received Stalin's formal endorsement. Averbakh was RAPP's unchallenged leader for the whole of its existence. He wrote extensively - \\"a prolific critic who hoped to apply Karl Marx‚Äôs understanding of historical materialism to literary production, Averbakh‚Äôs theoretical contribution to Soviet literary scholarship cannot be negated.\\"  Personality and Reputation  Averbakh was the first from the generation who were too young to have taken part in revolutionary activity before 1917 to achieve prominence under communist rule. Some of his contemporaries, such as Mikhail Suslov, still held high office in the 1980s, whereas Averbakh's career peaked 50 years earlier. He was an effective organiser, but had a bad reputation. The French writer, Victor Serge, who knew Averbakh for many years, described him as \\"a young Soviet careerist possessed of an extraordinary talent for the bureaucratic callings. Less than thirty, he had the hairless head of a young senior official, the verbal fluency of a Congress demagogue, and the dominating, false-sincere eyes of a manipulator of meetings.\\"Victor Serge, Memoirs of a Revolutionary (translated by Peter Sedgwick, Writers' & Readers' Co-operative, London, 1984) p264. According to a fellow member of RAPP, Anna Karavayeva: \\"Someone once spoke of Leopold Averbakh as a harsh, yet knowledgeable, man. A publicist, an agitator, he wanted to organize everything according to a designated ‚Äòproletarian base,‚Äô as he explained. Correctly acknowledging that there was a class war in literature, Averbakh, in my opinion, presented it very narrowly, not wanting to comprehend the specifics.\\"  His Treatment of Eminent Writers  Averbakh's influence reached its peak in 1929, when he orchestrated the public campaigns against the writers Yevgeny Zamyatin, who was driven into exile, and Boris Pilnyak, and the Old Bolshevik and critic, Aleksandr Voronsky, founder of the literary journal, Krasnaya Nov. Reviewing a short story by Andrei Platonov in 1929, Averbakh warned: \\"There is ambiguity in it...our era does not tolerate any ambiguity.\\"McSmith, Fear and the Muse p48 When Nadezhda Mandelstam challenged him to explain how he could denounce her husband's poetry without having read it, he replied \\"that there is no such thing as art or culture in the abstract, but only 'bourgeois art' and 'proletarian art'.\\"Nadezhda Mandelstam Hope Against Hope, A Memoir (Collins & Harvill, London 1971) p 164 By contrast, Averbakh went to pains to cultivate Russia's most famous living writer, Maxim Gorky, after being introduced to him by Yagoda. He spent the summer of 1931 as a house guest in Gorky's home in Sorrento, on a mission to persuade Gorky to return permanently to Russia. On his return, he reported to Yagoda that he was \\"proud and happy\\" to have succeeded.  Dissolution of RAPP  On 23 April 1932, Stalin ordered suddenly and unexpectedly RAPP, and all other literary clubs and movements to disband and merge into the newly formed Soviet Writers' Union. It was immediately understood that this move was intended to destroy Averbakh's power base. When Nadezha Mandlestam visited Herzen House, in Leningrad, the day after the announcement, she found two eminent writers, Nikolai Tikhonov and Pyotr Pavlenko drinking wine to celebrate Averbakh's downfall. When she protested: \\"I thought you were a friend of Averbakh\\" - Pavlenko replied: \\"The war in literature has entered a new phase.\\" Averbakh's fall may have been Stalin's way of striking at his powerful brother-in-law, Yagoda, but also seems to have been brought about by his own over confidence and lack of deference. As early as 1929, Stalin complained in a letter to his deputy, Vyacheslav Molotov, about certain young communists, including Averbakh, who treated the party as a \\"discussion club\\" where they could \\"review policy\\" instead of awaiting instructions.Lars T. Lih, Oleg V. Naumov and Oleg V. Khlevniuk (editors) Stalin's Letters to Molotov (Yale U.P., New Haven 1995) p 162  Later career and arrest  Most of Averbakh's former colleagues in RAPP, with the notable exception of the playwright Vladimir Kirshon, deserted him after this public humiliation, but he continued to enjoy the protection of Yagoda, and of Maxim Gorky. In 1935, Gorky, Averbakh and the NKVD officer Semyon Firin, the deputy head of Gulag, co-edited a book lauding the construction of the White Sea-Baltic Canal by convict labour. Gorky's death and Yagoda's downfall left him unprotected. He was arrested in April 1937, and shot on 14 August 1937, along with Kirshon, Firin and others.

PSBs are made of materials that are not easily degradable. The extensive disposal of PSBs is putting stringent pressure on the very limited landfill capacity, thereby causing severe waste problems in Hong Kong. On 7 July 2009, the Government of Hong Kong initiated the first Mandatory Producer Responsibility Scheme (MPRS) under the Producer Product Eco-Responsibility Ordinance. Registered retailers are bound to charge consumers 50 cents as an environmental levy for each plastic bag taken. The levy scheme aims to generate direct economic disincentives and encourage consumers to refrain from using PSBs indiscriminately. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a habit of \\"Bring your Own Bag\\" (BYOB) within society. The full implementation of PSB charging came into effect on 1 April 2015. All retailers are required to collect not less than 0.50 for each plastic bag distributed. To streamline the compliance mechanism and enhance the deterrent effect, a fixed-penalty notice of 2,000 was imposed on retailers who fail to comply with the legislation.  History  = First phase implementation = In 2005, it was roughly estimated that in the territory over 8 billion PSBs were disposed of annually at landfills, which suggested an average disposal of over three PSBs per person each day, accounting for 11 per cent of the municipal solid waste disposed in the territory.Environmental Protection Department (2005). A Policy Framework for the Management of Municipal Solid Waste Consequently, the Council for Sustainable Development proposed that the government should introduce a legislation for MPRS.Council for Sustainable Development (2005). Making Choice for Our Future. Report on the Engagement Process for a First Sustainable Development Strategy MPRS emphasises the sharing of \\"eco-responsibility\\", and aims to provide economic incentives for citizens to change their wasteful habits. Since PSBs are made of non-degradable material and will permanently occupy landfills' capacity, promoting BYOB is seen to be the most effective solution to alleviate the environmental problem. A comprehensive working schedule was subsequently formed. In 2006, the Product Eco-Responsibility Bill was introduced to the Legislative Council, providing a legal framework for MPRS. With the Bill in place, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) further put forward the legislation on PSB Charging in 2007. The registered retailers covered by the first phase implementation were predominately chain operators, including convenience stores, supermarkets, cosmetics and medicare (the retail category).Environmental Protection Department (2011). Consultation Document on the Extension of the Environmental Levy Scheme on Plastic Shopping Bags = Full implementation = First phase of the levy scheme has achieved preliminary success, yet the overall result was incomprehensive. Firstly, the scheme only covered 3,000 registered retail outlets, and the PSB disposal originated from other non-registered retailers had increased by 6.7% since the first phase implementation. Secondly, EPD estimated that Hong Kong people's daily usage of PSB was still substantially higher than other overseas developed economies. From the figure gathered in 2010, Hong Kong has around 60,000 retail outlets, in which over 98% are operated by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In order to achieve a more profound outcome, EPD extended the scope of the levy scheme to cover all retail sales of goods regardless of their business scale and business nature.  What is the levy scheme?  = Scope of levy = The levy scheme has now expanded to cover more than 100,000 retail outlets, including both retail and service businesses.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. The Scope. Retail outlets are broadly categorised into four business groups: (i) retailers selling foodstuff; (ii) retailers selling non-foodstuff; (iii) retailers selling foodstuff and non-foodstuff such as department stores; and (iv) service businesses with sales of goods. = The PSB charge = Sellers of goods by retail should charge customers no less than 50 cents for each PSB, or for product with prepackaged pack of 10 or more PSBs, irrespective of whether the PSBs are distributed directly or indirectly for the promotion of goods, or in connection with the sales.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. The Charge. The seller must not offer any rebate or discount to the customer with the effect of directly offsetting the PSB charge or any part of that amount.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. Obligations of the Seller. The 50 cents charge was generally considered to be a moderate levy which could provide incentives for consumeres to reduce the use of PSBs, but not exceeding the level of public acceptance. = Bags subject to the charge = In order to promote the green habit of BYOB, extensive forms of PSBs are covered under the second phase of the levy scheme, including all bags that are made wholly or partly of plastic regardless of whether there is a carrying device.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. Bags Subject to Charge. The types of shopping bags listed below are subject to the Charge: Plastic bags Plastic bags with flat-tops, handle, handle hole, perforated line for tearing out handle hole, carrying string or strap, and any other devices attached to the bag. Paper bags Paper bags with plastic lamination, plastic components, plastic handles and plastic accessories. Non-woven bags Non-woven bags, also known as environmental bags, which are made of plastic. = Exemption arrangements = The following types of PSBs are exempted from PSB Charging. Bag used for food hygiene reasons Due to food hygiene concerns, PSBs that carry only foodstuff (i.e. food, drink or medicine) without packaging or not in airtight packaging will not be charged.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. Exemption Arrangements. In order to separate the condensation of water vapour from other goods, PSBs which carry frozen or chilled foodstuff are also exempted. Bags used for packaging (1) Sealed bag for prepackaging This exemption covers PSBs that are used for prepackaging and have been sealed before they are delivered to retailers. However, additional plastic bags for the prepackaged production will be charged. (2) Plastic bag forming part of the good The Charge does not apply if the PSBs are (i) designed specifically for containing the goods; (ii) holding perishable goods; (iii) containing goods in liquid form or goods that are in liquid; and (iv) printed with information on how to consume or use the goods. Bags provided with the services PSBs that are distributed by retailers as part of the service tendered, and without involving the retail sales of goods are not subject to Charge. = Penalty = If a retailer is found to have committed an offence by failing to comply with the levy scheme, the EPD officers may issue a fixed penalty notice requiring the offender to pay a fixed amount of $2,000. For breaches of serious nature, the EPD may initiate prosecution against the offender, who is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $100,000 on the first occasion, and $200,000 on each subsequent occasion.Environmental Protection Department. (2015). Full Implementation of the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. Penalty.  Consultation  = Prior to the first phase implementation = Plastic bags manufacturers The Hong Kong Plastic Bags Manufacturers' Association opposed to the proposed environmental levy, alleging that PSBs were more environmentally friendly than other single- use carriers such as paper bags. Besides, the levy scheme was unnecessary since PSBs were habitually reused by the public.Environmental Protection Department. (2007). Public Consultation Report on the Proposal on An Environmental Levy on Plastic Shopping Bags. Retailers The Hong Kong Retail Management Association raised objections to the levy scheme, contending that chain stores were being unfairly targeted under the proposal. In fact, these retailers had done the most to encourage citizens to reduce the use of PSB. The effectiveness of the proposal was also questionable due to its limited coverage, and consumers could easily resort to other free sources of PSBs. Legislative Council In the meetings held by the Legco Panel on Environmental Affairs, the vast majority of political parties and deputations backed the principle of \\"polluter pays\\". However, some Legco members argued that the Charge should be lowered to 10 to 20 cents in order to reduce its impact on the impoverished. Besides, the government should reinforce the voluntary efforts on PSB reduction before introducing the levy. There were also concerns as to whether the levy constituted another form of Goods and Services Tax, causing adverse effects on the trade sector. General public With reference to the public opinion survey conducted in 2007 by the Center of Communication Research of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, among the 1,102 telephone interviews conducted, only 66% of the respondents supported the introduction of an environmental tax on PSBs. Immediately before the first phase implementation, the Public Opinion Programme of the University of Hong Kong conducted another three-stage survey to gauge public opinion. The feedbacks were largely positive. Around 80% of all the respondents considered that the tax was effective in reducing the use of PSBs, and the majority of them opined that a 50 cent charge would not add to their financial burden.Public Opinion Programme, The University of Hong Kong. (2010). Opinion Survey on Plastic Bag Tax. In the third stage survey, two-thirds of the respondents even urged for an extension of PSB tax to all retail shops. = Prior to the full implementation = Plastic bags manufacturers In 2011, the Hong Kong Plastic Bags Manufacturers' Association demanded the government to withdraw the levy scheme, as the association alleged that non-woven bags and rubbish bags were treated as alternatives of PSBs, causing an overall increase of plastic materials used in producing plastic carriers. As an alternative, the association lobbied the government to support the development of eco-friendly biodegradable PSBs.Hong Kong Plastic Bags Manufacturers' Association. (2011, July 15). Plastic bags levy scheme has been implemented for 2 years, the number of non-woven bags and the use of plastic materials increase by 96% and 27% respectively [Press release (ËÜ†Ë¢ãÂæµË≤ªÂØ¶ÊñΩÂÖ©Âπ¥Âæå ‰∏çÁπîÂ∏ÉË¢ãÊï∏ÈáèÊÄ•Âçá 96%ÔºåËÜ†ÊñôÊï∏ÈáèÂçáÈÅî 27%).] Retailers In contrast with the first phase implementation, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association welcomed the expansion of the levy scheme.Hong Kong Retail Management Association. (2013, June 1). Positions on the Extension of the Environmental Levy Scheme on Plastic Shopping Bags of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association. (Â∞±Êì¥Â§ßÂ°ëËÜ†Ë≥ºÁâ©Ë¢ãÁí∞‰øùÂæµË≤ªË®àÂäÉ Êì¥Â§ßÂ°ëËÜ†Ë≥ºÁâ©Ë¢ãÁí∞‰øùÂæµË≤ªË®àÂäÉÁöÑÊÑèË¶ã) In particular, the association supported the second phase amendment as it allowed the retailers to retain the PSB Charge without remitting them to the government. This would prevent SMEs from incurring extra administrative costs. General public On 17 May 2011, the EPD released the consultation document \\"Extension of the Environmental Levy Scheme on Plastic Shopping Bags\\". The consultation focused on five main aspects: (i) the expansion of the Scheme; (ii) the coverage of retailers; (iii) the exemption for food hygiene purpose; (iv) the regulation of flat-top bags; and (v) handling of the collected charges. The then Secretary for the Environment Edward Yau announced that amongst the 1,000 public feedbacks received by the EPD, the majority acknowledged the success of the first phase implementation, and their opinion on issues (i) to (v) were largely in line with the proposed particulars of the full implementation.Zhou, M.Y. & Leung, S.Y. (2011, August 17).More than half of the respondents support the expansion of the levy scheme. (Â§öÊï∏ÊîØÊåÅÊì¥ËÜ†Ë¢ãÂæµË≤ªÁØÑÂúç) Sing Tao Daily.  Progress, effectiveness and limitations  = First phase implementation = PSB disposal at landfills Two landfill surveys were conducted by the EPD in mid-2009 and mid-2010. According to the survey results, there was a significant 75% of decrease of PSB disposal in mid-2010 than in mid-2009. The EPD estimated that these registered retail categories were accountable for 65% of the pre-levy PSB distribution, and the overall reduction in PSB usage could be as high as 90%. Nonetheless, Hong Kong people still disposed of 1.7 PSBs per person per day. Taking Ireland as a comparator, each person disposed of only 0.9 PSB daily even before the introduction of an environmental tax.Environmental Protection Department. (2007). Overseas Experience on Plastic Shopping Bag Reduction. Opinion survey With reference to the telephone survey conducted by the Central Policy Unit, more than 75% of the interviewers did not take PSBs when shopping at a registered outlet. Besides, around 80% of respondents reckoned that they have developed the habit of BYOB. A major concern was raised by the Hong Kong Plastic Bags Manufacturers' Association. It was found that the use of non-woven bags and rubbish bags had surged by 96% and 63% respectively. As a result, the overall plastic materials used by the industry has escalated by 27% when compared to the post-2009 figure. Unlike non-woven bags, rubbish bags could not be reused and would end up being piled up at landfills. = Full implementation = PSB disposal at landfills Annual disposal surveys were conducted at landfills and Refuse Transfer Stations (RTS). In order to study the full year disposal figures of PSBs after the second phase implementation, the EPD randomly elected 282 waste samples from landfills and RTS between October and December 2015. Broadly speaking, PSB landfill disposal has reduced by 25% after the extension of PSB Charging (i.e. from approximately 5.24 billion in 2014 to about 3.93 billion in 2015).Environmental Protection Department. (2016). Survey Findings on the Impacts of Plastic Shopping Bag Charging. (1) Retail categories As most of the retail outlets are covered by the first phase legislation, the total PSB disposal was estimated to have reduced by only 35%, and such reduction was mainly driven by retail outlets falling outside the scope of the original legislation. (2) Non-food-related retail categories The non-food-related retail categories achieved the most compelling results. The reduction of PSB disposal ranged from 34% for fashion and footwear shops to approximately 83% for newspaper and magazine outlets. (3) Food-related retail categories Most of the products within the food-related retail categories fell within the food hygiene exemption. Hence, the outcome was insignificant. In particular, for cooked food outlets, the disposal rate remained more or less the same before and after the second phase implementation. Nevertheless, it is observed that there was a 20% decrease of PSB disposal from bakeries and cake shops, mainly because more sellers are aware of not using multiple-layer wrapping bags for bakery items. Opinion survey Telephone surveys were carried out between February and Mary 2016. Around 1,000 interviewers gave feedbacks on their behavioural change subsequent to the full implementation of the levy scheme. The outcome was generally positive. Amongst the respondents, 85% of them opined that non-compliance of the Scheme was uncommon, where 79% of them comprehend that the full implementation of PSB could further enhance their habit of BYOB. Enforcement actions Since 1 May 2015, officers have started to take law enforcement actions against non-complying retailers and no longer given them verbal warnings. By the end of April 2017, 406 fixed penalty notices were issued. However, only 15 prosecutions were made against retailers.Ejinsight. (2017, 8 15). A-1 Bakery slapped HK$5,000 fine for offering free plastic bags. In July 2017, Greeners Action, a Hong Kong-based Non-Profit Organisation conducted an undercover operation to inspect 100 retail outlets, and it was found that more than half of them distributed PSBs to customers for free.South China Morning Post. (2016, 7 14). Half of Hong Kong retailers flout plastic bag levy in investigation by green group. Lenient law enforcement could be regarded as a hindrance to streamline compliance.  Promotion  = Events = District briefings The EPD held district briefings in civic centres and community halls to raise the public's awareness of the levy scheme.Environmental Protection Department. (2014). Full implementation of the PSB Charging. District briefings are effective platforms to address the public's concerns and collect their opinion directly on the PSB charges, the scope of implementation and the exemption arrangements. Educational visits After the full implementation, the EPD officers paid educational visits to SMEs and wet markets. Since these retailers had relatively less administrative capability to fulfill the statutory requirements, and a fixed penalty notice was newly imposed on law offenders, officers recognised the importance of reminding sellers of their obligations. = Publicity materials = Information leaflets and materials As distinguished from usual publicity materials, leaflets introducing the levy scheme were designed to carry multi- languages including Tagalog, Indonesian and Thai, so that foreign domestic helpers, one of the targeted participants of PSB Charging, could understand the messages.Environment Bureau. (2009). Press Release: Environmental levy on plastic shopping bags to start from July 7. Advertisements Bus-Body and Tram- Body advertising, television and radio announcements were means used by the government to alert citizens about the commencement of the levy scheme.Environmental Protection Department. (2014). Full implementation of the PSB Charging.  Overseas experience: alternatives to the levy scheme  Overseas jurisdictions have adopted different types of PSB reduction measures. These collective experiences may serve as valuable inputs for modifying Hong Kong's model. = Environmental levy at the manufacturing and import level = Denmark In 1994, Denmark imposed a green tax on plastic bags. Manufacturers and importers of PSBs are required to pay a tax based on PSBs' weight, where retailers would buy PSBs at tax-loaded prices. This creates direct economic incentives for retailers to distribute PSBs tentatively. As retailers are not bound to pass on the tax to customers and charge them for PSBs, the levy would normally not raise the financial cost to consumers. After the introduction of levy, the distribution of PSBs has decreased by 60%. Nonetheless, the figure rebounded substantially as the tax rate has remained unchanged since 1998. = Ban on PSBs = United States After failed attempts to introduce an environmental levy and meet PSB reduction targets by signing voluntary agreements with major supermarkets, San Francisco City Government passed a legislation to ban the use of PSBs in 2005, mandating the use of recyclable paper bags or compostable PSBs at retails. After this successful initiative, there was a trend in the United States to ban the use of PSBs. It was reported that over 132 cities and counties in 18 states introduced similar arrangements.Do Plastic Bag Bans Work? (2015). Scientific American In 2015, California City Government announced its statewide ban on PSBs in grocery stores, pharmacies and supermarkets. Liquor stores and small food retailers also joined the scheme in the following year. It was estimated that there was an 89% decrease of plastic bags litter in the storm drain system, and 60% in the creeks and rivers. Australia The Australian government also moved from adopting a voluntary approach to a total ban of PSBs. In 2003, a Code of Practice for the Management of Plastic Bags was signed between the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) and the Australian Retailers Association. However, the targets on reduction of PSB disposal and recycling rate were barely met. EPHC therefore issued a public consultation document and received positive feedbacks that supported a complete ban on PSBs. By 2017, every state in Australia has banned or promised to ban lightweight plastic bags.  Future development  It is repeatedly reported that Hong Kong consumers are gradually used to paying the 50 cents levy. In light of such situation, introducing a total ban on PSBs may be an alternative to propagate the idea of BYOB in the community and reduce PSB disposal. The government is also advised to encourage retailers to donate the proceeds of the PSB Charge to environmental purposes. Alternatively, the government may consider collecting the Charge from sellers and depositing such amount in an \\"environmental fund\\" for waste reduction campaigns.

It resulted in the publication of the Report on the work of the Horn Scientific Expedition to Central Australia in four volumes from 1896 to 1897. During this expedition, Winnecke was responsible for the theft of a major repository of Aboriginal sacred objects in Central Australia, helped by an Aboriginal guide who was later killed by local elders for his crime in leading Winnecke to their hiding place. The objects were subsequently interpreted with the assistance of another guide, the sometime police tracker and Aboriginal resistance identity Arrarbi. When removing the objects he left 'a number of tomahawks, large knives and other things in their place, sufficient commercially to make the transaction an equitable exchange'.

Resistance to workplace gender diversity  Researchers have observed some men will resist gender diversity under certain conditions; the researchers presented men in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) with information that diversity initiatives will effectively increase female representation, which led to resistance among men who believed there is legitimacy to men best- representing STEM (i.e. prototypicality legitimacy) and those who also had concerns about losing the ability to best represent STEM (prototypicality threat). = Popular examples = In 2017, attention was given to the technology industry in light of James Damore's document \\"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\\", which went viral as a prominent example of perceived \\"anti- diversity\\" attitudes. The document says Google's current diversity initiatives discriminate against dominant group members (i.e. Whites and males) and foster tension within the organization. In 2016, it was reported that Intel's CEO was threatened in response to his diversity efforts, and Facebook's CEO faced challenges with what he considered the malicious behavior of his employees replacing a \\"black lives matter\\" message with an \\"all lives matter\\" message. Scholars and other commentators have also highlighted media-covered examples of resistance to diversity outside of technology, including a Texaco racial discrimination suit in which top-level executives were accused of creating a hostile climate for their diverse employees and were recorded on tape using racial slurs, and the Southern Company racial discrimination lawsuit that included popularized reports of nooses displayed in the facilities.  Possible explanations  = General processes of resisting diversity = Some scholars propose that resistance to diversity can generally be understood to be a result of evolved cognitive processes that impact relations between different groups in society. They point to a disconnect between the once- adaptive way humans evolved sensitivity to group differences (e.g. \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" tribal boundaries) and some current social environments that contain unprecedented levels of diversity. They propose resistance to diversity may stem from the conflict between automatic social categorization and modern heterogeneous social environments. = Identity threats = As companies attempt to grow diverse workforces and train them to work harmoniously, research suggests minority group progress may induce a threat response from those in the majority group. Researchers Major and Kaiser argue these types of diversity initiatives jeopardize status hierarchies and that this status instability produces threat, even within well-meaning, \\"prodiversity\\" progressives. Racial progress has been shown to negatively impact Whites' self-worth; Whites may buffer this impact by perceiving anti-white bias (i.e. racial discounting). Similarly, researchers have observed increases in social identity threat among men who discuss the instability of men's high status (i.e. changing gender-status relations) with women's. Another possible threat- related mechanism that could underlie resistance to diversity is prototypicality threat, or the threat that one's sub-group will no longer best represent the broader, superordinate group. = Feelings of exclusion = Although multicultural ideology is commonly used in workplaces, research suggests White individuals may associate multiculturalism with exclusion and may not readily associate multiculturalism with conceptions of the self. This program of research also found the degree to which Whites feel included, relative to minorities, can help explain racial differences in diversity endorsement. Plaut et al suggest socially contextualized cues to inclusion or exclusion can meaningfully impact resistance to diversity. In response to the association between multiculturalism and feelings of exclusion among members of dominant groups, scholars have called for the use of All-Inclusive Multiculturalism (AIM), or multiculturalism that explicitly includes the dominant group. These researchers noted that whether non-minorities are included or excluded in an article about multiculturalism can implicitly influence their inclusionary associations with the ideology. = Problems with diversity efforts = Commentators and scholars have speculated that diversity training may itself be creating backlash because employees may feel uncomfortable in training environments or resent being told what to do. When examining the sources of resistance to diversity efforts, researchers have said organizations often use negative, legal-focused deterrents within bias training, designate diversity training as mandatory, and associated the training with corrective action for \\"problem groups\\". Consistent with this thinking, researchers documented evidence of a \\"counter-response\\" (i.e. rebellion/defiance) when administering brochures or priming participants with controlling conceptualizations of prejudice-reduction, compared with autonomy- supporting conceptualizations. The controlling conceptualizations focused on the need to reduce prejudice and comply with norms of non-prejudice, whereas the autonomy-supporting conceptualizations focused on drawing attention to the choice and personal value involved in non-prejudice. Finding negative outcomes associated with the controlling conditions, they said common organizational efforts to reduce prejudice via control may be unintentionally increasing resistance.  Research-based strategies for addressing the resistance  Research on resistance to diversity has revealed implications and suggestions for those hoping to address potential, current, or possible resistance. = General strategies = * Encouraging managers to engage in pro-diversity activities may be more effective and result in less resistance than efforts that limit their discretion. * To avoid unintentionally alienating key stakeholders in gender diversity, leaders in the study of gender initiatives have recommended cultivating allied male support for organizational change.Prime, J., & Moss-Racusin, C. A. (2009). Engaging men in gender initiatives: What change agents need to know. New York, NY: Catalyst. * In the context of prejudice reduction, it may be helpful to avoid putting pressure on individuals that limits their autonomy. It may also be better to facilitate the development of people's perceived values and benefits relating to \\"non- prejudice\\", via tailored information and organized discussions. = Framing strategies= * Research suggests focusing on equality as something to strive for (i.e. a moral ideal) rather than focusing on avoiding inequality (i.e. a moral obligation), may raise Whites' support for policies that aim to increase the representation of disadvantaged groups (i.e. affirmative action). * If a multicultural-based ideology is in use, scholars have recommended emphasizing the benefits for all groups, making the ideology inclusive to members of both majority and minority groups. * Whites have been shown to report increased positive attitudes towards hypothetical diversity programs when the programs are framed as diversity management (i.e. for business reasons), rather than affirmative action. * Some research recommends broadly framing diversity- training content. * To address the potential for dominant group members (i.e. Whites or males) to feel threatened by the possibility of losing the claim to best represent the broader organization or industry (i.e. prototypicality threat), researchers have proposed reframing the broader category (e.g. STEM) as more complex (e.g. defined by diversity) may help reduce susceptibility to prototypicality threat * There is evidence White Americans who identify strongly with their racial/ethnic groups may respond more positively to multiculturalism if it is framed as a learning opportunity rather than as a set of policies.

It was first described by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1803. Description The gall is a smooth, globular or spindle-shaped swelling, usually on a twig or stem and contains larvae or pupae in up to fifty separate chambers. The galls are usually 10‚Äì40 mm long and about 10 mm wide and the larvae feed on the pith inside the gall. The gall, does not contain frass, and occasionally occurs on the petiole, midrib, or side veins of a leaf. The larva are pale orange or reddish, over-winter in the gall and pupate in the spring. In Britain the gall is widespread and common and is found on creeping willow (Salix repens), eared willow (S. aurita), grey willow (S. cinerea) and goat willow (S. caprea). Correct identification of the host plant is necessary; the similar looking gall on purple willow (S. purpurea) is Rabdophaga degeerii. Elsewhere the gall has been recorded on mountain willow (S. arbuscula), weeping willow (S. babylonica), European violet willow (S. daphnoides), olive willow (S. elaeagnos), S. excelsa, S. glabra and dark-leaved willow (S. myrsinites).

The statue, made of gilt wood, was originally one of the two attendant Bodhisattva figures that flanked a central Shakyamuni or Amitabha Buddha statue. It is believed that this Bodhisattva was the left attendant Bodhisattva of the triad. The tall ornate crown, oblong face and drapery with cascading folds of the statue indicate that the statue was probably produced in a Buddhist sculpture school in South Jeolla province, Korea. This statue was granted to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Mary and Jackson Berke Foundation in 2015.  Description This elaborate statue depicts an image of a Bodhisattva. Bodhisattvas are considered as compassionate, enlightened beings who are destined to be the protectors of their followers in Mahayana Buddhism. Also Bodhisattvas are the beings who are qualified to attain the enlightenment. Made of gilt wood, this statue was created in the mid-17th century AD, during Korean peninsula‚Äôs Joseon dynasty period. The features of the statue such as the tall ornate crown, oblong face and cascading folds of the drapery indicate that this statue was likely to produced by an esteemed school of Buddhist monk sculptors led by Ingyun (active during 1615‚Äì1663 AD) for a Buddhist temple in South Jeolla province, Korea. This area was then an important centre of Korean Buddhism. A decorative element in the shape of flames can be seen in the crown. This statue measures 51.4 cm in height, 35.6 cm in width and 36.2 in depth. From base to the flame statue measures 54.6 cm in height. The statue, which was originally in the Mary Griggs Berke Collection, was later given to Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, United States by Mary and Jackson Berke Foundation in 2015. This statue has been exhibited four times in the Metropolitan Museum of Art before and after it was granted to the museum.

He was also known as one of the founders of the Fameck Arabic Film Festival (Festival du Film Arabe de Fameck). After he died on 14 December 2016, the Deputy Mayor of Fameck Michel Liebgott as well as many other personalities of the region and the local residents paid tribute to his life work. The influences of his contributions to the community and society had reached several communes of France, including Fameck, Uckange and Florange. Biography =Early life= As a son of a Catholic mother and a Communist father who worked as a shoemaker, Mario Giubilei was born on 30 December 1941 in Nocera Umbra, Perugia, Italy, and grew up in Aumetz, Lorraine, France. In 1962, he performed his military service and was sent to Algeria for 6 months during the Algerian War. =Priesthood= On 29 June 1967, Mario Giubilei was ordained a Catholic priest in the Metz Cathedral (Cath√©drale Saint √âtienne de Metz) by the Bishop of Metz, Monseigneur Paul-Joseph Schmitt. In 1972, after serving in Fameck and Uckange for nearly 5 years, he decided to become a worker-priest and started to work in a factory in Florange. The employers dismissed him as soon as they discovered that he was a priest. Later, he chose a different path of unionism for the right to housing and living environment care. In 1982, he was employed as the concierge by the Social Centre of Fameck (Cit√© Sociale de Fameck) to which he had already belonged when it was founded in 1975. On 18 February 1987, he created the organization called \\"Train of the Nations\\" (Train des Nations, also known as \\"Train de la Tol√©rance\\") that offered various trips to the youngsters, bringing 680 children with 120 chaperones to Paris firstly, and later to B√¢le, Venice, Bruxelles, Barcelona, London, the Netherlands, Monaco and so forth. Through this project, there were around 16,000 children in total who had the opportunity to leave the ghetto and explore the world. 3 years later, he and Ren√© Cahen founded the Fameck Arabic Film Festival for which he invited the local artist Jean Scuderi (Scud) to collaborate on the poster design afterwards. The Festival so far has still taken place in October every year. After retiring in 2004, Mario Giubilei was officially decorated with the recognition medal by the Algerian authorities for his work with the Algerian community and his effort to develop the Arab culture. He died on 14 December 2016. References Further reading * Lucie Bouvarel. \\"Mario Giubilei, ce h√©ros\\". Le R√©publicain Lorrain. 21 October 2009. * \\"CARTE BLANCHE √Ä... Mario Giubilei\\".

She is most well known for her oral research and books on Apache Native American tribes, particularly Indeh: An Apache Odessey. In 1981, she received the Saddleman's Award, \\"the Oscar of western writing\\" for Indeh: An Apache Odessey. Life Katherine Evelyn Daly Ball was born on 14 March 1890 in Kentucky. She was born to Samuel Richard and Gazelle (Gibbs) Daly; Daly was the first female doctor in Kansas. Her family moved to a cattle ranch in Kansas when she was young. She began reading at the age of four, and by the age of twelve, was bored with traditional education. She began teaching in Kansas schools by the age of sixteen. Ball was known as a tomboy and even coached a junior high school boys basketball team. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in education at Kansas State Teachers College of Pittsburg in 1918 and became a teacher. Ball graduated with an Master of Arts in education from Kansas State University in 1934. During the Dust Bowl, she taught English at a junior college in Dodge City, Kansas. During World War II, she worked at oil refineries as a chemist in Hobbs, New Mexico. She was married to Joseph P. Ball, who was a captain of the Kansas National Guard, but he died in World War I. She purchased Hermosa Inn, then called La Casa Hermosa from artist Lon Megargee, operating a dude ranch there, but she later gave it up because it was too much work to maintain and it prevented her from having time to write. Ball spent most of her career teaching, eventually settling in Ruidoso, New Mexico. She purchased property near Nob Hill in Ruidoso. To make a living, she ran an antique store from her home and constructed and leased apartments on her property. She wrote articles from the observations she made and stories she heard. In New Mexico, she became interested in Native Americans and the American West. She began researching them in the 1940s and interviewed southwestern pioneers and Apaches at a time when there was no academic interest in those subjects or oral histories in general. She had the opportunity to interview descendants and relatives of Geronimo, Victorio, Nana, and Juh. She used shorthand to take notes from the interviews to prevent intimidating interviewees with video and tape recording. She would read them back to her interviewees to correct errors or ask more questions. She is well known for seeking out and sharing the Apache point of view of encounters with colonizers. In 1967, the Folklore Society of New Mexico presented a plaque to J. Frank Dobie, N. Howard Thorp, and Ball at Zimmerman Library at the University of New Mexico. Ball was given an honorary doctorate by College of Artesia in 1972. In 1972, she edited a and created a book from a recovered manuscript by Lily Klasner. She published In the Days of Victorio: Recollections of a Warm Springs Apache in 1970 and Indeh: An Apache Odessy in 1980. Because of the strong relationship she gained with Apache member Daklugie (Geronimo's nephew and Juh's son), he gifted Ball his war club which he had hidden for 27 years as a POW and then recovered. She received the Golden Spur Award from the Western Writers of America in 1975 for the best non-fiction short story Buried Money, published in True West Magazine. She also won the Saddleman‚Äôs Award, \\"the Oscar of western writing\\" in 1981 for Indeh, an Apache Odyssey, a compilation of interviews with Apaches. Few women had received the Saddleman Award at that point in time and she considered receiving the award one of her proudest moments. The following year Ball was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame. Ball was a guest speaker in May 1978 for the World Business Council. On October 7, 1983, the United States Senate passed resolution S.Res.230 to commend Eve Ball. Ball died in Ruidoso, New Mexico, on 24 December 1984. She continued to write up until her death, despite losing her eyesight. Ball wrote countless stories and book manuscripts that were never published. Ball's mentee Lynda A. Sanchez wrote and compiled a photo essay about Ball called, Eve Ball, Woman Among Men in 2007. In 2009, The New Mexico Women's Forum placed a marker honoring Eve Ball along highway 380, in Lincoln County, New Mexico for \\"saving oral histories certain to be lost without her\\".

Her case was notable both for her youth and for the extended legal process that preceded her execution. Although her exact age is unknown, it is generally agreed that she is the youngest person to have been put to death in Missouri. Background Mary was originally owned by Abraham Brinker, who had settled in Potosi, Missouri, in the 1810s. She was described as \\"mulatto\\", though it is unclear if she had any genetic relation to the Brinker family.MTSU Center for Historic Preservation (December 2016), Snelson-Brinker House: Historic Structure Report, p. 7. Abraham was killed by Native Americans in 1833, and his slaves were inherited by his son John. His first child, Vienna Jane Brinker, was born on May 25, 1835, and Mary was tasked with babysitting her. In February 1837, the family and their slaves moved into what would become known as the Snelson-Brinker House, a single-story log cabin near Steelville.MTSU (2016), p. 6. Death of Vienna Brinker On May 14, 1837, the body of Vienna Brinker was discovered in a stream on the Brinker property. She had suffered blunt trauma to her right temple. John Brinker's wife Sarah had asked Mary to gather firewood, and she took Vienna with her. She later returned to the house without Vienna, and claimed not to know where she was. John Brinker gathered two of his neighbors, William Blackwell and Thomas Shirley, to help search for his daughter. They eventually followed Mary's footsteps down to the stream, where Shirley found her body. Some sources have speculated that Mary killed Vienna because her father was planning to sell her. Trials and execution After the discovery of the body, Mary was tied to a log by William Blackwell and threatened with a whipping. She subsequently admitted to throwing Vienna in the stream and then beating her body with a stick to stop it surfacing. She later made a similar confession to Simeon Frost, a local justice of the peace. Mary was charged with first-degree murder and placed in the Potosi jail. Her trial began on August 16, 1837, and she was provided with three court-appointed attorneys. She was found guilty two days later, and subsequently sentenced to be hanged at Steelville on September 30.MTSU (2016), p. 8. Mary appealed the verdict to the Missouri Supreme Court. The presiding judge, Mathias McGirk, reversed the decision of the Crawford County circuit court, citing numerous irregularities in both her indictment and the trial process. Mary was re-indicted and a new trial was scheduled. It was originally supposed to be held in Gasconade County, but was later shifted back to Crawford County. The second trial returned the same verdict as the first, and Mary was hanged at Steelville on August 11, 1838.The Courts, Crawford County Missouri History. Retrieved November 25, 2017. Contemporary newspapers reported Mary's age as either 13 or 14, while a later account in a history of Crawford County gave it as 16. The trial judge, James Evans, had instructed the jury to consider whether Mary was above the age of criminal responsibility (14), or whether she was below that age but \\"had sufficient mind to know what act would be a crime\\". In any case, Mary is generally considered to be the youngest person to have been executed by the state of Missouri.

She began her career at Maudsley Hospital and later headed the psychiatric department at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Early life Mildred Creak was born on 1 August 1898 in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, to Robert Brown Creak, a mill engineer, and Ellen (n√©e McCrossan). She attended Withington Girls' School and went on to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, transferring after a year to University College Hospital Medical School and graduating in 1923. Career After qualifying, Creak had difficulty securing a medical post because she was a woman. After 90 job applications, she was eventually hired as an assistant physician by The Retreat, a psychiatric hospital in York run by Quakers; she had become a Quaker at university. In 1929, she moved to Maudsley Hospital in London, where she began to expand the service for child and adolescent psychiatry. She was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1932 which enabled her to visit the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. On her return to London, she specialised through her research and clinical work in children's organic mental disorders: psychiatric problems including tics, chorea, compulsions, hysteria and compulsions caused by biological disease. Creak worked at Maudsley Hospital until 1939, when it was evacuated to Mill Hill. She stayed at Mill Hill until she joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1942. She worked in India in 1943‚Äì44, and achieved the rank of major in 1945. After the war, she joined Great Ormond Street Hospital as its first physician in charge of the department of psychological medicine. She was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians soon afterwards in 1949. In the early 1960s, she chaired a working party that established a set of diagnostic criteria for autism, then known as \\"schizophrenic syndrome of childhood\\", based partly on 100 patients Creak had treated. At a time when autism was thought to be caused by inadequate parenting, she proposed that it was primarily caused by genetic factors. A unit for autistic children in Perth, Western Australia, was subsequently named after Creak. Later life Creak retired in 1963. She developed Alzheimer's disease in the 1970s, and died from breast cancer on 25 August 1993 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.

Its plot is loosely based on the Hollywood movie Identity. At the 66th National Film Awards, the film won the award for Best Special Effects, and Best Make-up. Plot Shiva is a watchman and an aspiring scientist who is building a time machine to meet his parents whom he hasn't met for years, while Parvathy, a woman, suddenly shows up and claims that she is his future- self and has traveled back in time to prevent their parents' death, which she claims will occur in an hour. Nala is a down-on-his-luck man who applies to be a chef at a restaurant. While he does not even know how to cook, he just follows instructions in YouTube cooking videos to finish jobs given by the restaurant owner. While he's cooking, he befriends Nani, a goldfish and Chanti, a bonsai tree in the kitchen, which both surprisingly can even talk and he is the only human that can hear, understand and communicate with them. Radha is with her parents waiting for her partner, Krishnaveni \\"Krish,\\" however when Krish shows up, her parents are surprised to see that its a woman, and she and Radha are lesbian lovers. Radha's parents strongly object to Radha and Krish's relationship as they cannot accept same-sex marriage. However, Radha's parents are moved when Krish, a psychiatrist by profession, tells them that the Radha hates men due to horrific incidents she faced in her childhood, which later prompted to change her sexual orientation towards women. Moksha, an 8-year-old girl who works at her mother's restaurant and performs magic tricks to the customers. Yogi, an egoistic magician, visits her restaurant. He humiliates Moksha after watching her magic show but ends up being humiliated by someone claimed to be a magic master, who may actually be a soul. Mira, a waitress at a restaurant who is also a drug addict. She and her boyfriend Sugar are gearing up to loot a rich investor whom they expect to come to the restaurant soon. Mira accidentally finds a necklace inside a tree in the restaurant and wears it. She serves a regular customer Raghuram, whose wife, according to an old staff in the restaurant, was buried alive years ago under the tree where Mira found the necklace. Mira is frightened on seeing the ghost of Raghuram's wife. Kali prepares to shoot herself. She signs an organ donation document and a death note which reads, \\"I am going to conduct a mass murder, and I plead not guilty.\\" The above stories occur in parallel at the same restaurant. Sugar conducts his plan to loot the investor but fails when his partner Mira is scared by the ghost. On being neither caught nor suspected, he sits naturally, waiting for another chance. Later, Moksha plays a magic trick for Sugar's target. Seeing this as a distraction, Sugar attempts to steal the money but is caught by the investor. The frustrated Sugar takes Moksha as a hostage to go away, only to bump into Yogi, who messes with him with magic tricks. Sugar accidentally shoots Radha and attempts to run away, but is knocked down by Nala (encouraged by Nani) with a nearby stick. Krish and Radha's parents try to take Radha to the hospital, but Shiva and Parvathy stop them with Sugar's gun, saying that if anyone leaves, their parents will die. It is implied by Parvathy, the future Shiva, that she had travelled back to this time many times to save her parents, with the time machine Shiva builds in the future. However, she fails every time because someone finally makes a way out of the restaurant one way or the other.

Kali (played by Kajal Aggarwal), is the main protagonist who is suffering from multiple personality disorder, in the end of the film. MPD is a mental illness characterized by alternating between multiple personality states and memory loss. The concept of lesbianism portrayed in the film, became a wide talk, since Telugu films were subjected to strict censor formalities, while portraying lesbianism in films. Affair is the first Telugu film to portray lesbianism. However, it did not have a theatrical release, since the CBFC refused to approve the film. It was directly released on YouTube.The film was withdrawn and sent back to the Censor Board. But, later it was released uncut. The Supreme Court of India invalidated part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code making homosexuality legal in India on September 2018. In an interview with Haricharan Pudipeddi of Hindustan Times, Nithya Menen stated that \\"When Prashant pitched the character, I was absolutely excited. As artistes, we come across many stories but something like Awe doesn‚Äôt come often; it‚Äôs rare. I didn‚Äôt see it as a lesbian character. I accepted the offer because I thought it‚Äôd be exciting and challenging. I love doing different, edgy roles.\\"  Music  The film score and soundtrack is composed by newcomer Mark K Robin. Initially, the film features only one song titled \\"Theme of Awe\\" which was played in the opening and end credits of the film. The song was digitally released in YouTube and other streaming platforms on 9 February 2018, while it was launched at the Radio Mirchi FM Station in Hyderabad on 13 February 2018, in the presence of the film's cast and crew. Sung by Sharon, with lyrics written by Krishna Kanth, The Times of India stated that \\"The song is tailor made for the movie.\\" Lahari Music released the opening credits and ending credits video on 30 June and 1 July respectively, which features the theme song. Both the videos were released on two different YouTube channels.  Marketing  The pre-release event took place at B. R.

Neetishta Nyayapati, from The Times of India, rated 4 out of 5 stars, and stated that \\"Go watch this film if you‚Äôre looking for something definitely out of the box and fresh, ‚ÄòAwe‚Äô will not disappoint you.\\" The Indian Express gave it 4 stars stating that \\"Awe has high entertainment value, strong emotions, progressive characters, thrills, chills, comedy and some philosophy. Prasanth could have even made this film work without big actors or fancy sets in it.\\" Hindustan Times rated the film 5/5, summarising that the film is \\"technically brilliant\\". India Today rated 3 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"Awe has several astonishing moments only if you can look past the sequences that are not in sync with the story.\\" Behindwoods rated 3 out of 5, stating it as \\"a welcome trendsetter\\" Deccan Chronicle rated 4 out of 5 stars, and summarised that \\"The narration is slow and be careful‚Ä¶ If you do not understand the climax, you do not understand the film. The film‚Äôs key point is the last 15 minutes in which the director very cleverly reveals the connection between the characters. Prashanth Varma has tried something different here. People, who are on the lookout for a new genre cinema, should watch this film definitely.\\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"Awe certainly leaves you thinking ‚Äì about the film itself, and about what an exciting time it is in Telugu cinema, with so many rebels plotting these little coups against one of the country‚Äôs most deeply entrenched cinematic empires.\\" In a contrast review, Firstpost rated 3 out of 5 and stated that \\"The moment you figure out an answer, you will know whether Awe! is ‚ÄòAwesome‚Äô or ‚ÄòAwful‚Äô. The truth lies somewhere in between.\\" Indiaglitz rated 2.75/5, and gave a verdict: \\"AWE is a crafty anthology movie which relies too heavily on the strength of its climax. Too psychological, too poetic at times. The lengthiness of many scenes makes one say, 'It's more of the same'. Genre shifts were an oversold idea. The performances are praiseworthy. Technical departments put up a solid show.\\" Sify rated 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"Awe is psychological thriller of a traumatized woman told in episodic stories. There are many individual episodes that are strangely funny but the overall drama seems too far-fetched. The final twist in the tale is unconvincing. Second half is mostly bore.\\"  Legacy  Celebrities such as actors Rahul Ravindran, Anupama Parameswaran, Adivi Sesh, Vennela Kishore, Shashank, director Madhura Sreedhar Reddy, producer Shobu Yarlagadda and costume designer Neeraja Kona, praised Nani and Prashanth Varma for the latter's scripting and direction and the former's production values.

The project focuses on creating content regarding women's biographies, women's works, and women's issues. The project is named after the hyperlinks in existing Wikipedia articles that display in red to indicate that the linked article is missing.  History  Women in Red presentation by Roger Bamkin, Wikimania 2017 Women in Red was conceived by volunteer Wikipedia editor Roger Bamkin in 2015, and volunteer editor Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight joined forces soon thereafter. Bamkin had initially coined a name for the project, \\"Project XX\\", but that was quickly scuttled in favor of WikiProject Women in Red. After the project was up and running, volunteer editor Emily Temple-Wood signed on. Her specialty is adding a new Wikipedia article about a female scientist each time somebody harasses her about her volunteer editing efforts. At Wikimania 2016, in Esino Lario, Italy, Jimmy Wales, who co-founded Wikipedia in 2001, named Stephenson-Goodknight and Temple-Woods the Wikipedians of the Year, for the prior 12 months, for their effort to fill the gender chasm.  Methods  Rosie and Roger (appearing via Skype) announcing the formation of Women in Red during Wikimania 2015 in Mexico City. Button to showcase International Women's Day 2017 WiR edit-a-thons Women in Red conducts Wikipedia edit-a-thons in cities around the world, and continuously hosts a virtual one. The all-day in-person edit-a-thons are focused events conducted to train new contributors so that the Wikipedia gender gap can become narrower and include more content on notable women. Another goal is to increase the number of female editors. Though Wikipedia is \\"the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit\\", as at 2015 about only 10 percent of editors were women.Statistics based on Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia editor surveys 2011 (Nov. 2010-April 2011) and November 2011 (April ‚Äì October 2011) The Women in Red participants help to collate 150 work lists of red linked articles to make it easier to find and create the missing articles. , Women in Red volunteer editors added over 45,000 articles, and the percentage of tallied articles increased marginally to 16.8 percent of English-language biographies (from 15 percent in July 2015).
