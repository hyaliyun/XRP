These letters concerned Franklin's discoveries about the behavior of electricity based on experimentation and scientific studies. The book came in pamphlet form for the first three English editions. The last two editions were in a book volume with hard covers and a book spine. There were eleven European editions of the book: five English editions, three French editions, and a German, Italian and Latin edition. The publication was well received worldwide. It was considered America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The book came about through the activities of scientists at the Royal Society of London. Franklin sent letters to members of the Society about his experiments on electricity and the observations he had made. Most of these letters went to Peter Collinson. Some of these were read at the society's meetings. There was much interest shown, so some of them were sent to a printer to be published in a magazine. Public interest in Franklin's letters about electricity led the Society to gather together many of the letters to Collinson from Franklin over a two-year period and send them to the printer for publication. This first collection of letters was published in a ninety-page pamphlet in 1751. It was soon followed by other parts that were \\"Supplemental\\" to the existing edition and eventually a \\"New\\" publication was sold from the total of all the \\"Parts\\" produced. Each edition expanded by additional Franklin letters being added. It ultimately became a 496-page volume by 1769. The book inspired others to follow in Franklin's footsteps to do further in-depth research on electricity.  Background  Franklin's electrostatic machine display at Franklin Institute museum. Franklin was first attracted to the study of electricity when he saw the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment. Peter Collinson - a wealthy Quaker cloth merchant, a Fellow of the Royal Society and one of the founders of the Society of Antiquaries of London - donated (in 1746) a Leyden jar battery, a glass tube, and an account of new German experiments in electricity to the Library Company of Philadelphia (founded by Franklin). The account described how to make electricity from the glass tube. Franklin first experimented with static electricity in the middle of 1747, referring to it as \\"these new wonders.\\" In conducting his initial electrical research, Franklin made use of the unique battery and glass tube provided by Collinson. Thomas Penn, son of William Penn, made an electrostatic machine that supplemented Collinson's equipment. To these Franklin added an electrostatic generating machine of his own design that was more efficient than the one given to him by Penn. It was convenient because it was constructed with a handle, like that of a common grindstone, and turned by the operator. The simple mechanical machine mechanism then spun an axle that had mounted on it a glass sphere that rubbed on a cloth pad. The glass sphere bulb generated 'electric fire' (an electric charge) that was transferred through conductors to a Leyden jar capacitor that held the electric charge that was then used for experimentation. Franklin formed a research core team that consisted of Ebenezer Kinnersley, Thomas Hopkinson, and Philip Syng and developed the first scientific research laboratory in America. He repeated his experiments to obtain the same results and recorded this observation. In this process he showed that anyone could repeat and prove these results themselves of the electrical principle if they did the experiment he detailed. Franklin spent much time studying this new field of electricity, and from 1747 through 1750 sent many letters to Collinson on his findings. The book consists of a collection of these letters. The book came in pamphlet form for the first three editions. The last two editions were a book volume with hard covers. Franklin's letters explained his experiments and the observations he made from them. He sent these to Collinson to show that the equipment put into the hands of the group of men associated with Library Company of Philadelphia was being put to good use. William Watson, a scientist specializing in the study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed. Watson received in 1746 from Dr. John Mitchell a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson and read it to the Society on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted to the Society more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was grounded - the basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches. Watson turned over some of these Franklin letters to the local publisher Edward Cave, who had them printed in The Gentleman's Magazine in 1750. In April 1751 Cave printed in a publication more of the letters Collinson had received and they included corrections personally added by Franklin. This publication was titled, Experiments and Observations on Electricity, Made in Philadelphia in America by Mr. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and Communicated in several letters to Mr. P. Collinson of London, F.R.S (London). It was a 90-page pamphlet of 86 numbered pages. The pamphlet included an unsigned preface written by Dr. John Fothergill. This first publication of Experiments and Observations on Electricity sold for the expensive price of two shillings and sixpence British money, .  Contents  Typical letter in the book - July 27, 1750. Letter V in the first three English editions is Letter VI in fourth and fifth English editions. The eighteenth century book consists of a collection of letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device. There were five English editions to this book. The first three editions were not hard cover volumes, but rather just pamphlets with paper covers of collected letters of Franklin. They were carelessly put together when published. Each of these pamphlet editions had supplements of additional letters that were added later and then republished. The first publication of 1751 was supplemented in 1753 with 20 more pages and called Supplemental Experiments and Observations, Part II. It was numbered 89 to 109 and published by E. Cave. This was again supplemented with an additional 44 pages in 1754, numbered 110 to 154, and titled New Experiments and Observations, Part III. It was published by R. Cave, the son of E. Cave. The second edition published in 1754 was a reprint of parts I and II of the first edition. The third edition published in 1760, 1762, and 1764 was a reprint of all three parts of the first edition and numbered 1‚Äì154. In this first set of letters Franklin talked about electrical fire, later (1749) changing the terminology to electrical fluid. He wrote to Collinson on June 5, 1747, that his experiments showed that the electrical fire was a new element of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter. Franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles, but only temporarily groups them together so that they can be collected and held in a Leyden jar of water and metal. According to Franklin, one side of the Leyden jar had an accumulation of electrical fire, which he labeled as positive (plus), and the other side had a deficiency of electrical fire, labeled negative (minus). These losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially the modern law of charge conservation except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right, not just as a deficiency of positive charges. It is an important principle in modern science that explains the microphysics of the electrification of gross bodies. In these letters, Franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as plus, minus, positive, negative, charge, discharge, armature, electric shock, electrician, condenser, conductor, and battery. Leyden jar \\"electric battery\\" Franklin's first experiments explained in this first set of letters to Collinson that the Leyden jar, a type of capacitor, had equal and opposite charges on the inner and outer conductors. This was shown in illustrations in his book. The significant Franklin theory introduced to Collinson in a letter dated April 29, 1747, was the concept of the \\"dissectible condenser.\\" Today we call this distribution of charges in a device, a capacitor. He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material. In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side of it was a metal material (conducting matter). These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative). He observed that when the wire on the inside of the jar was electrised positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became electrised negatively in the same proportion. Franklin explained in these letters that in an experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself and not in the water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged he poured the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged. It turned out the electric force was not condensed in the water itself, as the new Leyden jar had no charge with this water from the first Leyden jar. Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle. It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this \\"force\\" of equal and opposite charges. Franklin further explains in these letters that the jar did not electrically balance itself, but a wire of some conducting material had to make contact from the inner conductor (plus) to the outer conductor (minus). This way Franklin observed the balancing and combining of the two different states of electricity in the \\"miraculous bottle.\\" In the later editions of the book Franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of Leyden jars that he termed \\"electrical battery\\" following the military term of the time of a \\"battery\\" being a group of cannons assembled together. Franklin assembled a number of parallel-plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were \\"armed\\" with a lead metal sheet on each side. He hooked them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge (balance) the battery when touched to both sides. Fourth edition volume increased to 496 pages. Had hard covers and additions to third edition. (Franklin's bifocal glasses shown on the book) The fourth edition, published in 1769, is the first complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that increased the number of pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his lightning rod invention, meteorological observations, human nature, worldwide population increase, waterspouts, experiments on amber, and information on his Pennsylvania fireplace invention. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was published in 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the Public Advertiser London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition. The fourth English edition, published in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on different parts of the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German \\"electric tube\\" with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.  Editions  Second edition 1754 of New Experiments of Part I and Part II There were eleven editions of Experiments and Observations on Electricity. There were five English editions, three French editions, and an edition each in German, Italian and Latin. The first three English editions were similar, but not identical, and consisted of two or three parts. Each of these separate parts were printed and sold individually as a pamphlet. Each had a slight title change (i.e. \\"New\\", \\"Supplemental\\") apparently to promote selling additional copies to people that had bought before. * English edition 1.1 printed April 1751 (pages #1 - 88) and sold by E. Cave at St. John's Gate. * English edition 1.2 printed 1753 (Supplemental Ex ...) and sold by E. Cave at St. John's Gate. * English edition 1.3 printed 1754 (New Experiments) and sold by D.

Reception in France  1752 French edition The French translation, published in 1752, contained an experiment suggesting that a long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud. In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity. Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod. In London it was repeated in Spital Square on July 20, 1752, and again in Chelmsford, Essex, on August 12, 1752. The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the kite experiment that he talked about in a letter to Collinson dated October 19, 1752. A man by the name of G. W. Richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing the kite experiment. Franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and the same. He also showed that this \\"electric fluid\\" was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in the sky. An iron rod could have the other end put into the ground to create a path for safe conduction of the high voltage electricity. Thus, a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits had been discovered. Franklin's lightning conductor invention, with its lightning rod uppermost point, became a model for the lightning-protection system used in America in the eighteenth century. King Louis XV honored Franklin after seeing some of the electrical experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean- Antoine Nollet (1700‚Äì1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it also served as a preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.  Legacy  All editions of the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first publication of it was done in the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century. Benjamin Franklin was given the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1753 in recognition of his work in electricity as reported in this book. He became a Fellow of the Society after his name was submitted the required ten times (one included the Society's president, Lord Macclesfield). Also he was given an honorary degree at the College of William and Mary in 1756 and elected into the French Academy of Science in 1772 because of this book. The theories that Franklin developed in the book formed the basis for subsequent research on electricity.

It was premiered at Los Angeles Film Festival on June 13, 2015.  Plot  After committing a number of crimes, including vehicular theft, Billy Wyatt is placed in a juvenile detention camp. He quickly befriends Nathan Stein, a sickly inmate, and due to his charisma and intelligence, earns the respect of several other inmates, including the feared Carlos and the hulking Jerome Timmons 'J.T.' Dye. However, his indifference and disrespect to those trying to rehabilitate him puts Billy into conflict with camp's director, Montgomery De La Cruz, and the abusive head guard, Conrad Sean Lewis. He also bonds with Tina Simms, a recovering drug addict who serves as the camp's nurse, and Emmit Till, the local sheriff, who appears to genuinely want to help him. Billy goes on to organize the camp's community construction project for the year, a drive-in movie theater. Following the completion of the theater, he is approached by Montgomery about being moved from manual labor to taking care of the director's personal belongings, including a prized automobile. To convince Billy to work for him, he brings up the death of Billy's father Philip in a vehicular accident, which Billy blames himself for. Montgomery discloses that he too lost his father under tragic circumstances. Seeing Billy in his new position causes most of the inmates to turn against him and Nathan is beaten and tied to a basketball post. Upon learning that Montgomery lied about his father's death, Billy beats him and accompanied by Nurse Simms, steals his car in an effort to transport Nathan to a hospital. Montgomery attempts to stop him from leaving, but Billy receives support from his fellow inmates and Conrad and Sheriff Till refuse to prevent his escape.

It was originally released on September 30, 2011 for Microsoft Windows. Later, Alchemist ported the game without the erotic content to the PlayStation Portable. Your Diary will be released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. The story revolves around Tomoki Nagamine, who has feelings for an upperclassman named Sayuki Ayase. Upon receiving a diary from the library manager, he is informed by Yua that all of his happiest memories will be recorded in the diary. The gameplay of Your Diary follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the four female main characters by the player character. The game ranked as the third best-selling bish≈çjo game at the time of its release. It received a manga adaptation which serialized in Hakusensha's Young Animal Island between volumes 19 and 24. Gameplay Average dialogue and narrative in Your Diary. Here, Tomoki is talking to Yua. Your Diary is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tomoki Nagamine. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Tomoki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Your Diary follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines in the original Windows release that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. In adult versions of the game, there are scenes depicting Tomoki and a given heroine having sex. Plot Story Your Diary main heroines from left to right: Y≈´hi, Sayuki, Kanade, and Yua.

Life Early years Andr√© Joseph Lef√®vre was born in Paris on 17 June 1869,BnF son of an engineer who was an inspector for the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est. He attended the Coll√®ge Chaptal and then the √âcole des Mines de Paris. He became the secretary of Alfred Joseph Naquet. In 1893 he worked for the candidacy of Ren√© Viviani as Deputy in the 5th arrondissement of Paris and began to write for the socialist journal La Petite R√©publique. He was elected Municipal Councillor of the Sorbonne district of Paris from 1895 to 1900, and was reelected in 1904. From 1907 to 1908 he was president of the Paris city council, and then was general counsel of the Seine. Deputy Lef√®vre ran successfully for election to the chamber of deputies on 24 April 1910 for the first district of Aix-en-Provence, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. He sat with the socialist republicans. On 3 November 1910 he was appointed Under Secretary of State for Finance in the second cabinet of Aristide Briand. He did little in this capacity and resigned on 3 February 1911. Lef√®vre was appointed General Counsel for Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne, and wrote for the Le Petit Proven√ßal. In the general elections of 26 April, 1914 Lef√®vre retained his seat and joined the Union r√©publicaine radicale et socialiste (Union of Radical and Socialist Republicans). With the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was made a temporary Military Engineer (2nd class) and spent the next four years studying the manufacture and use of explosives, munitions and rockets. On 3 September 1918 he filed a patent application for a \\"shell for firing against armor plating and resisting targets\\". In the election of 16 November, 1919 Lef√®vre was at the head of the Republican list and won reelection by an absolute majority. He joined the democratic republican left. He became vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies on 13 January 1920. Minister of War Lef√®vre was appointed Minister of War on 20 January 1920 in the first cabinet of Alexandre Millerand. The cabinet fell on 18 February 1920 but Lef√®vre retained his portfolio in the second Millerand cabinet from 18 February 1920 to 23 September 1920 and in the cabinet of Georges Leygues. On 9 June 1920 Lef√®vre told the Senate Committee on the Army of the imminent filing of a project to reorganize the recruitment and staffing of the French army. Most of the deputies and senators were in favor of reducing the length of service, but Lef√®vre saw that the Germans were not adhering to the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and wanted to retain two years of military service. In a meeting of 27 October 1920 the Superior Council of National Defense decided unanimously to reduce the term of military service to 18 months. Lef√®vre presented the project to the Council of Ministers who approved it on condition that parliament accepted two years of service for a transitional period. On 14 December 1920, when Lef√®vre was taking the waters at Vichy, the government submitted the bill on recruitment and reorganization of the army, reducing the number of divisions that could be immediately mobilized. Lef√®vre was deeply disappointed and worried by the reductions, and resigned from the cabinet on 16 December 1920. Last years Andr√© Lef√®vre was reappointed vice- president of the Chamber. He failed to be reelected in the 11 May 1924 general election. He died in Paris on 5 November 1929 at the age of 60. He had never married. He was a commander of the Legion of Honor.

Jeep train usually refers to a railway train hauled by jeeps with flanged rail wheels. World War II jeeps were converted from road vehicles into steel-wheeled rail switchers (shunters), light locomotives, or speeders (draisines).Nevington War Museum: USA - Jeep Variants - Railway Jeeps. (The phrase was also used for supply trains consisting of jeeps and for columns of jeeps linked together and pulled through bad ground by tractors. Not all primary sources will use this phrase in the same way.)  History   U.S.A.  US Demonstration run on a track at Eagle Farm Aerodrome in Brisbane, Australia on 30 June 1943: A Jeep fitted with rail wheels could easily pull 10 tons.Testing in Australia. Adapting automobiles as gasoline railcars is recorded as early as 1912 and early publicity on Jeeps mentioned their potential use as an inspection car. The USAAF in Australia used flanged- wheel jeeps as switchers in 1943, which led to testing as road-switchers for future operations in New Guinea. Perhaps the first large-scale use of jeep as locomotive was in the CBI theatre.Boyd Sinclair: Running On Time In a Timeless Land: An elephant can be a locomotive and a tiger sometimes stopped a train. Eleven days after the Normandy landing, jeep speeders were in use on the continent, surveying lines for use or repair. Postwar, jeep speeders were used as inspection cars, and jeep trains used for light service, including recreation. The Jeep train at Lewis and Clark Caverns claimed to be the shortest jeep railway. Over time, hi-rail vehicles pushed dedicated speeders out of railroads; civilian jeeps were often used.  Australia  In Borneo in 1945, Australian soldiers converted jeeps to run on rails in order to compensate for the lack of locomotives on a narrow gauge railway line.Australian War Memorial, Reference No OG3138.  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom used railworthy Jeeps during World War II especially in France, Germany, and Burma. Jeep trains were used extensively during the Malayan Emergency.  France  French forces used rail jeeps- \\"jeep draisines\\", including armored rail jeeps, in Indochina, and later in the Algerian war.  Loads and speeds  A jeep, designed to draw on the road, could pull much greater loads on rails thanks to the lower rolling resistance of rail vehicles. During Australian military operations in Borneo, Jeeps hauled goods wagons with a payload of four tons of sand.

It seeks to ensure the highest standards in the practice of occupational medicine, overseeing the continuing professional development and revalidation of its members. It is also focused on promoting and supporting health at work, with its mission statement being ‚Äòto drive improvement in the health of the working age population‚Äô. One way it achieves this goal is through partnerships with other medical bodies, such as the Safe, Effective, Quality Occupational Health Service accreditation scheme it runs with the Royal College of Physicians. The Faculty works closely with the UK Government advising on Occupational Medicine and improving workplace health. The Faculty is a member of the Council for Work and Health and The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.  History  The organisation was established in 1978 as a faculty of the Royal College of Physicians, becoming an independent body with its own governance, membership and finances in December 1992. Originally focused exclusively on the professional development of occupational physicians, the Faculty has since expanded its portfolio of qualifications to include a diplomas aimed at benchmarking the standards of occupational health provision in fields as diverse as general practice, aviation medicine and disability assessment medicine. Activities The Faculty is primarily responsible for education and training of medical doctors who work in occupational medicine in the UK. It devises and oversees the implementation of the Specialist Curriculum in Occupational Medicine, and administers over postgraduate training within the NHS, armed forces and industry. It also runs the MFOM Part 1 and Part 2 examinations which assess Specialty Registrars throughout their training, successful completion of which leads, in most cases, to entry onto the General Medical Council‚Äôs specialist register and the ability to use the postnominals MFOM. Election of Members of the Faculty to Fellowship (conferring the postnominals FFOM) is the Faculty‚Äôs way of recognising those who have made a particularly significant contribution to the practice of occupational medicine, or contributed significantly to the work of the Faculty. The faculty‚Äôs official journal is Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal which covers research in occupational and environmental medicine. Alongside this the Faculty produces a wide number of publications and guidance papers, including the highly influential Ethics Guidance for Occupational Health Practice, Guidance on Alcohol and Drug Misuse in the Workplace and Fitness for Work: The Medical Aspects, which now in its 5th edition. Governance The Faculty is governed by a Board of Trustees which is responsible for the strategic direction of the organisation and for its governance. The Board meets four times a year, and to reflect the geographical diversity of members two of these meetings are held at the Faculty offices in London, while the remainder take place in different locations across the UK. The faculty is registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR).

After winning his only race as a juvenile in 1991 he improved in the spring of the following year to finish third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and win both the Amethyst Stakes and the Gallinule Stakes. In June he recorded his biggest win when he defeated a very strong field in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Later that year he was placed in the Prix du Moulin, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Breeders' Cup Mile. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion in Australia. Background Brief Truce was a bay horse with a white star bred in Kentucky by his owners, the Moyglare Stud. He was one of the best horses sired by Irish River, the leading colt of his generation in France, whose wins included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix d'Ispahan, Prix Jacques Le Marois and Prix du Moulin. As a breeding stallion he sired several other major winners including Hatoof and Paradise Creek. Brief Truce's dam Falafel, won one minor race and was a daughter of Queen's Statute, an outstanding broodmare whose other descendants have included Awaasif, Lammtarra, Hector Protector, Bosra Sham and Pour Moi. The colt was sent to Europe where he was trained by Dermot Weld. He was ridden in all of his races by Mick Kinane. Racing career 1991: two-year-old season On his only appearance as a two-year- old, Brief Truce was one of eighteen juveniles to contest a maiden race over six furlongs at Fairyhouse on 9 November. He started the 7/4 favourite and won by two and a half lengths from the John Oxx-trained Polar Wind. 1992: three-year-old season Brief Truce began his second season in the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 18 April in which he finished second, beaten a neck by the Vincent O'Brien-trained Portico. Three weeks later he started favourite for the Listed Amethyst Stakes over the same course and distance and won by four lengths from the filly Tijara. On 16 May at the Curragh Brief Truce started at odds of 11/1 in a six-runners field for the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He finished third behind the English 2000 Guineas winner Rodrigo de Triano and Ezzoud, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. The colt was then stepped up in distance for the Gallinule Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 6 June and won by length from the Tommy Stack- trained Firing Line. Ten days after his win at the Curragh, Brief Truce was sent to England for the 147th running of the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and started a 25/1 outsider in an eight-runner field. Rodrigo de Triano and Ezzoud where among the leading contenders as well as the Diomed Stakes winner Zaahi, but the favourite for the race was Arazi, the outstanding two- year-old of 1991. The other runners were the Gimcrack Stakes winner River Falls, Casteddu (winner of a valuable sprint at Redcar) and the 100/1 outsider Beldi. Kinane positioned the colt, who was equipped with blinkers for the first time, in fourth place behind Zaahi in the early stages before switching left to make his challenge in the straight. He caught the leader in the final strides and won by a short head with Ezzoud in third. Rodrigo de Triano, who had made a threatening run down the centre of the track, finished fourth ahead of Arazi. On 6 September, Brief Truce was matched against older horses for the first time when he was sent to France for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting the 2.1/1 favourite he finished strongly but failed by a neck to overhaul the filly All At Sea with Hatoof two and a half lengths back in third. Three weeks later at Ascot, the colt started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes behind Selkirk, All At Sea and Marling. After being restrained in the early stages he made steady progress in the straight and finished second in rough race, two lengths behind the four-year-old Lahib. On his final appearance Brief Truce was sent to Florida to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Gulfstream Park on 31 October despite previous reports that he would be aimed at the Breeders' Cup Classic. He finished third of the fourteen runners, beaten three lengths and a neck by Lure and Paradise Creek. Stud record Brief Truce was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He stood in Ireland and Switzerland and was shuttled to Australia for the southern hemisphere breeding season. He had his greatest success in Australia where his best winners included Diatribe (Rosehill Guineas, Caulfield Cup), Red Oog (TJ Smith Stakes), True Jewels (Blue Diamond Stakes), General Truce (D.C. McKay Stakes) and True Glo (BRC Sprint). In 2012, at the age of 23, he was reported to be still covering mares at Independent Stallions in Victoria, which was also the home of his former rival Arazi. By September 2017 Brief Truce had been retired from stud duty and was enjoying retirement at Stockwell Stud. He died at Stockwell Stud in August 2018 at the age of 29; stud owner Mike Becker said \\"He was a great horse to work with and he taught a lot of young fellas who are now working at studs around the world what it is like to handle a stallion because if you didn't learn quick, he was going to teach you quick...He has gone well, and he has had a great life.\\"  Pedigree  References 1989 racehorse births Racehorses bred in Kentucky Racehorses trained in Ireland Thoroughbred family 22-b 2018 racehorse deaths ","title":"Brief Truce"},{"id":"47219810","text":"The February 2001 El Salvador earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.6 on 13 February at 14:22:05 UTC. The epicentre was 15 miles (30 km) E of San Salvador, El Salvador. At least 315 people were killed, 3,399 were injured, and extensive damage affected the area. Another 16,752 homes were damaged and 44,759 destroyed. The most severe damage occurred in the San Juan Tepezontes-San Vicente-Cojutepeque area, though it was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. Landslides occurred in many areas of El Salvador. Tectonic setting El Salvador lies above the convergent boundary where oceanic crust of the Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate at rate of about 72 mm per year along the Middle America Trench. This boundary is associated with earthquakes resulting from movement on the plate interface itself, such as the 7.7 1992 Nicaragua earthquake, and from faulting within both the overriding Caribbean Plate associated with the active volcanic belt, such as the destructive 1936 San Salvador earthquake, and the subducting Cocos Plate, such as the 1982 El Salvador earthquake. Earthquake The focal mechanism and depth of the earthquake are consistent with shallow strike-slip faulting in the Caribbean Plate, along the line of the active volcanic belt. The fault trend is confirmed by the distribution of aftershocks. Despite its magnitude and shallow focus, there are no indications of surface rupture for this earthquake. The earthquake occurred almost exactly a month after the major earthquake in January that affected the same area of the country. It remains unclear whether or not the two events are related in any way. Some previous earthquakes that were associated with the subduction zone were followed within a few years by shallow events. Examples include shallow earthquakes in 1917 and 1919 following a subduction event in 1915, and the shallow earthquake in 1936 following a subduction event in 1932. Damage The January earthquake had already caused considerable damage to buildings and left many people homeless. It had also triggered many landslides that were highly destructive. The February earthquake reactivated some of these landslides but also triggered new ones. 275,013 people were affected by the February earthquake of which 315 died and a further 3,399 were injured. The majority of the casualties were in the departments of Cuscatl√°n (165 dead, 1,372 injured), San Vicente (87 dead, 1,220 injured) and La Paz (58 dead, 806 injured). A total of 44,750 houses were destroyed and a further 16,752 houses, 83 public buildings, 111 schools, 97 churches 5 hospitals and 36 other health facilities were damaged.

She is most famous for being one of the first surface vessels recorded to have encountered a giant squid (Architeuthis). Until this time, giant squids were viewed as mythical creatures. Service history The Alecton, named after Alecto, one of the three Furies, was a paddle aviso (aviso √† roues de deuxi√®me classe, type Etoile modifi√©) laid down in 1859 at the La Seyne shipyard of the Soci√©t√© des Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterran√©e and launched in 1861. She had a length of 50.9 metres and a beam of 12.1 metres. Alecton was a paddle wheeler, powered by both a 120 hp steam engine and sails on two masts, had a crew of sixty-six and an armament of two light cannon. Her displacement was 570 tonnes. Alecton was first stationed at French Guiana and from 1868 onwards at Guadeloupe. She was decommissioned on 10 August 1883 and scrapped in 1884 at Lorient.http://dossiersmarine.free.fr/fs_av_A11.html Retrieved 3 August 2015 Giant squid encounter Reproduction of the original watercolour by officers of the Alecton On November 30, or November 17, 1861 the French corvette Alecton was, on its way to Cayenne, navigating near Tenerife, the largest and most populous island of the seven Canary Islands. As the ship neared the island the lookout on duty yelled to the crew below: ‚Äúa large body, partly submerged, on the surface.‚Äù The captain, commandeur Bouguer, had heard reports of giant squid but the scientific community disputed their existence. Mutilated, decomposed pieces of giant squid had surfaced, most notably off Zealand, Denmark in 1847, and another at The Skaw in 1854. Yet no one had ever captured or even seen a live specimen. Seeing his chance to capture the rare species, the captain ordered the ship to attack and harpoon the squid. Over the course of three hours the ship fired several shots, but the shells seemed to do little damage to the squid's rubbery body, estimated at five metres length. While it did react to the shots, it seemed undisturbed, diving and resurfacing close to the boat. Finally one of the crew was able to harpoon the squid and lasso a rope around its body. However, the weight was so great that when they tried to haul it aboard, the rope cut the body in two and they got only the tail end. Giant squid expert Clyde F. E. Roper says that Alectons skipper then called the whole thing off \\"lest the creature damage or injure the ship and the crew\\", but in an interview Roper laments \\"How dangerous is a giant squid full of cannon balls going to be?\\" Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea The Alecton encounter was the inspiration for the giant squids attacking the submarine in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, a classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne, published in 1870.

In the Faroe Islands, the Faroese language and the Danish language are the official languages, and both must be taught in schools. Danish should be used in court, but Faroese can be used in all other official places. The Greenlandic language is the official language in Greenland, and Greenland's Home Rule Act of 2009 does not require Danish to be taught or the use of Danish for official purposes. In accordance with Denmark's official monolingualism, all official documents and communications are in Danish. History Throughout much of its history, Denmark has been home to a population of Low German speakers in many of its towns, including the capital, Copenhagen. Rural settlers known as \\"potato Germans\\" and \\"beet Poles\\" also brought their own languages to Danish farms. During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Dutch was spoken among descendants of Dutch/Flemish settlers on the island of Amager (Drag√∏r, Store Magleby and Christianshavn). In its heyday, the Royal Danish Navy was largely manned by Norwegian speakers. Additionally, North Frisian was spoken on the North Frisian Islands. During the 19th century, German Jews brought the Yiddish language to Copenhagen and a few other towns, and in the early 20th century, an influx of Russian Jews gave this language a brief revival. However, subsequent generations of all these groups have overwhelmingly abandoned their ancestral languages and assimilated into the general population. Protection Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities entered into force in Denmark on 1 February 1998 while European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages entered into force on 1 January 2001. Languages German Knowledge of the German language in Denmark, 2005. North Schleswig Germans‚Äò language rights are protected by the Copenhagen-Bonn Declarations of 1955. Outside the minority area German is used by members of St. Peter's parish in Copenhagen. 24 German kindergartens and 18 German schools are maintained by the German School and Language Association. Although the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages stipulates the right of the German minority to use their own forms of geographical names, no steps have been taken in this direction. Greenlandic and Faeroese languages First-generation Greenlanders in Denmark and Faroese in Denmark tend to speak their own languages, rather than Danish. Romani In 2011 Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe recommended that the Danish authorities clarify the issue of the traditional presence of the Romani language in country. The authorities responded that they have reviewed multiple sources and tried also to obtain information by contacting universities in Scandinavia, but did not find any documentation in support of the traditional presence of the Romani language in Denmark. During the on-the-spot visit, the Committee of Experts met with a representative of the Romani People who argued that there are around 5,000 people still living in Denmark who might be considered descendants of ten Sinti families that came from Schleswig-Holstein in the 19th century.

(W 2R-1401) and the RCA Victor Record Club in 1961 with lyric sheets to help the listener join in with the singing. Spread over two records, the album consists of twenty-four medleys of 101 old songs (hence the album's title) in a sing-along format. (\\"Gang\\" is meant in the sense of a group of friends, not a street gang or work gang.) Bing Crosby sings on most of the tracks. Those that aren't are marked with an asterisk. The chorus and orchestra accompaniment, arranged and conducted by Jack Halloran, was pre-recorded with Crosby over-dubbing his vocals. This original double LP was also released as two separate albums under the titles, Join Bing in a Gang Song Sing Along in September 1961 and Join Bing and Sing Along-51 Good Time Songs in January 1962. The albums were released on CD in 2017 by Sepia Records. Selected tracks from the albums and from the earlier Join Bing and Sing Along record were later re-dubbed over a children's chorus, arranged and conducted by Jack Halloran, which was recorded on 17‚Äì19 May 1961. It was issued later to children's camps as \\"Sing Along With Bing\\". Reception Variety reviewed the album saying \\"Bing Crosby is slowly moving into Mitch Miller's territory.

History  The Night Owls always perform dressed in all-black to respect the tradition of the group's founding. In the midst of the polio epidemic of 1942, sixteen intrepid female students escaped from their quarantined dorms late one night and snuck into the library basement. There they sang and serenaded sick classmates with their dulcet tones.http://vsa.vassar.edu/orgs/nightowls  Performance History  The group performs many times throughout Vassar's academic year including at final concerts in December and May, local fundraisers, joint concerts with other Vassar and non-Vassar a cappella groups, and Vassar events. More information about gigs can be found on their website and Facebook page. In 1996 The Night Owls performed as the opening act for Hillary Clinton when she spoke at Vassar College. Following that performance the group was invited to sing at the inauguration of the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, in January 1997.

Featuring the vocals of American recording artist Eric Turner, it was made available for digital consumption on 14 July 2015 through Roton and Empire Music. The recording was written by Sebastian Barac, Carl Bjorsell, Marcel Botezan, Julimar J-Son Santos, Thomas Troelsen and Eric Turner, while production was handled by Bjorsell, Troelsen, Turner and Play & Win. A dance- pop track, \\"Bop Bop\\" was described as a departure from the singer's previous work. While music critics were favorable towards both Inna's and Turner's vocal delivery, the single was awarded with \\"Best Dance-Pop Song\\" at the 2015 Radio Rom√¢nia ActualitƒÉ»õi Awards gala. An accompanying music video for the recording‚Äîwhich was heavily aired on Romanian television‚Äîpremiered on Inna's YouTube channel on 13 July 2015, with it being shot by Dimitri Caceaune, John Perez and David Gal in Bucharest. Promoted by various live performances, \\"Bop Bop\\" reached number two on native Airplay 100, and position 94 on the Polish Airplay Top 100. Composition The recording was written by Sebastian Barac, Carl Bjorsell, Marcel Botezan, Julimar J-Son Santos, Thomas Troelsen and Eric Turner, while the production process was handled by Bjorsell, Troelsen, Turner and Play & Win. Musically, \\"Bop Bop\\" is a dance-pop track with a \\"coherent\\" production and \\"antrenant\\" beats. While Turner delivers vocals for the refrain‚Äîwhich almost entirely consists of the song's name‚ÄîInna is responsible for the strophes. Spanish LGTB website Grupo EGF stated that the rhythm of the recording is \\"danceable\\", further explaining that it incorporates a \\"retro air\\" and an \\"interesting mix of sounds\\". Hitfire saw \\"Bop Bop\\" as a departure from Inna's previous work. Echoing this thought, the singer confessed in an interview with Romanian radio station Kiss FM that; > It is a collaboration with one of my friends from the international music > industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys > from Play & Win.

Reception and accolades Upon its release, \\"Bop Bop\\" was met with good reviews from music critics. Jarom√≠r Koc of Czech music website Musicserver praised Turner's contribution to the song through his \\"unusually colored\\" voice. While Italian publication R&B; Junk's Olivio Umberto found that Inna changed her \\"formula\\" by not collaborating with a rapper but with another singer, Grupo EGF labelled \\"Bop Bop\\" as \\"contagious\\" and \\"mature\\", further acclaiming Turner's performance. Music website Hitfire wrote that the song's title is \\"simple\\", and went on praising the refrain and Inna's vocal delivery. The singer herself saw the single as \\"cheerful\\", \\"crazy\\" and \\"energetic\\". Commercially, \\"Bop Bop\\" debuted at number 64 on Romania's Airplay 100 on 26 July 2016, remaining her fourth charting song that week alongside \\"Mai stai\\" (position 47), \\"Diggy Down\\" (position 61) and \\"We Wanna\\" (position 76). Subsequently, the recording moved up 37 places to number 27 on the following week, and reached its peak position at number two on 11 October 2015. The single also reached number 94 on the Polish Airplay Top 100. Additionally, \\"Bop Bop\\" was awarded with \\"Best Dance-Pop Song\\" at the 2015 Radio Rom√¢nia ActualitƒÉ»õi Awards gala, where it was nominated alongside \\"C√¢nd vremea e rea\\" (2015) by Sore and \\"Falava\\" (2015) by Andra. Music video Background and release The music video for \\"Bop Bop\\" was teased on July 9, 2015, featuring a short sequence of Inna and six fellow backup dancer performing synchronized dance moves on a kind of stage or runway. While the dancers were dressed in black and white outfits, the singer sports a sparkling silver top. Three additional videos were released during July 2015 in which the track is played for the first time to unspecified citizens of Los Angeles and Inna's fellow Romanian stars; both videos captured extremely positive input, with some listeners predicting its success. The idea behind the visual was based on Inna's desire to create a \\"fashion\\" video, for which clothes were procured by international brands Marni, Givenchy, HBA HOOD by Air, Balmain, KTZ, Ashish, Pierre Hardy, and Romanian designers Cristina Savulescu and Madalina Dorobantu from Pas du Tout. The accompanying clip for the recording finally premiered on Inna's YouTube channel on 13 July 2015, being shot by Dimitri Caceaune, John Perez and David Gal in Bucharest, Romania; George Dascalescu served as its director of photography. The clip has no plot. Synopsis Inna (middle) and her backup dancers performing a synchronized choreography in the music video for \\"Bop Bop\\". The video opens with an old-fashioned TV being turned on, and displaying the word \\"BOP\\" on its screen. Following this, several photos of women are seen scattered on the floor of a dark-lightened room, which is then followed by Turner appearing to sing the first refrain of the song on the TV's display, wearing black sunglasses and a silver jacket; two fellow females are watching him. Inna is then shown singing to herself in front of a mirror, and subsequently makes appearance sporting an officer outfit consisting of a black hat and a tie. For the second refrain of \\"Bop Bop\\", the singer and her backup dancers are portrayed performing a synchronized choreography on a runaway. Following this, Inna appears wearing a yellow dress while standing on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, and she and her backup dancers are shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their bodies and picturing themselves. Reception and analysis While Musicserver was generally positive towards the music video, Tony Sokol from American music website KpopStarz called it a \\"scorcher\\" and Grupo EGF noticed Lesbian vibe. German website Hitfire labelled the outfits used during the clip \\"interesting\\", praised the performance of the background dancers, and called the video \\"recommendable\\". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own music website, described the visual as being \\"fashion involved\\", and particularly saw Inna's appearance as sexy and confident. Going on, Currinn further likened Turner's appearance on a TV screen to that of Pitbull's in Inna's \\"Good Time\\" (2014) and Flo Rida's in The Saturdays's \\"Higher\\" (2010), while being positive to the choreography although stating that it \\"isn't in depth enough\\". The music video peaked at number two on Media Forest's TV Airplay Chart. Note: Select '2015' and 'Week 40. Period: 28-09-15 04-10-15', and then click on 'Songs‚ÄìTV'.

He also contended twice for the WBA or Australian Middleweight World Boxing Title in February and April 1914 against Eddie McGoorty, and Jeff Smith. He won a very impressive fourteen of his fifteen career wins by knockout, and fought mostly on the U. S. West coast at the beginning and near the end of his career. Early career Bradley was born on March 3, 1884, in Inishowen, County Donegal, Ireland. He had seven fights in the San Francisco area between 1909 and 1911. In five of his early fights from the spring of 1909 until 1910, he knocked out Willie Carter, Morris Lowenstein, C. F. Clark, and Billy Grupp in the San Francisco area. These were likely short four round bouts as reflected in Bradley's BoxRec record. Longer bouts were less common in California during this period. Continuing to fight in the San Francisco area, BoxRec had him matched with Buck Crouse, Rufus Williams, Frank Mayfield, and Sailor Bert Bowers. In 1912, he defeated Maurice Flemming, Bill Yank Rudd, and Frenchman Jean Audouy mostly by knockout in Sydney, Australia in full feature bouts scheduled for twenty rounds. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote of his November 2, 1912 with Audouy, that when Audouy \\"dropped to his hands and knees\\" fairly early in the eighth round without receiving a blow, the referee ruled a disqualification, conforming with the articles of the fight. It is important to note that Bradley had landed a blow to Audouy's jaw which staggered him earlier in the round, though he had not fallen. Such incidents probably added to Bradley's reputation as a powerful hitter. One article wrote of Bradley, that \\"Those swings...were dreadful things to contemplate, and when one landed, there was hardly ever a mistake--the full count followed. And unlike the average fighter, he could not pull a punch: he could not stall.\\"\\"Boxing, Pat Bradley Wins\\", Sydney Morning Herald, p. 6, Sydney, Australia, 4 November 1912 In 1913 he knocked out both Jean Audouy, and Charlie Godfrey in feature fights scheduled for twenty rounds in Sydney Stadium in Sydney. Mid career, world welter and middleweight titles On March 19, 1913, he defeated Jack Clarke in a bout which the World Boxing Association later recognized as a World Welterweight Title match at Sydney Stadium in Sydney, Australia in a twelve of twenty round TKO. This championship may have only been recognized in Australia and possibly Great Britain at the time. In September and October 1913, he defeated Jerry Jerome in Sydney, Australia in an eight round knockout, followed by losing to Dave Smith in a twenty round points decision in Sydney Stadium on October 25, 1913. According to Wiki's List of Welterweight Boxing Champions, Bradley lost the WBA recognized Welterweight World Title when he lost to Smith. He had defended it at least twice, first against Sid Stagg on May 10, 1913 and again in his knockout of Jerry Jerome in October. In February and April 1913, he contended for the WBA World Middleweight title, against the 5' 10\\" American Wisconsin based boxer, Eddie McGoorty on February 7, 1914, again in Sydney Stadium. He lost the twenty round \\"Australian version\\" of the World Middleweight Title, according to the Sydney Morning Herald in a round points decision with both boxers weighing in at just under the 160 pound Middleweight weight limit. The Omaha Daily bee, as likely did many other American papers wrote of Bradley's February 7 loss to McGorty in only brief coverage, and took no note of the bout being a World Middleweight Title bout of any kind.\\"M'Goorty Wins Decision Over Bradley\\", Omaha Daily Bee, p.55, Omaha, Nebraska, 8 February 1914. Bradley again fought for the \\"Australian version\\" of the World Welterweight title on April 13, 1914 against Jeff Smith, losing more decisively by knockout in the sixteenth round of twenty rounds, also in Sydney Stadium in New South Wales, Australia. Bradley continued to fight in Australia through February 1916. He returned to the United States, fighting in Reno, Nevada against Anton LeGrave on July 4, 1917. On July 13, 1917, he defeated Frank Barrieau taking the Pacific Coast Middleweight Title in four rounds at the large Dreamland Rink in San Francisco where he had fought earlier in his career before his fights in Sydney, Australia. He continued to fight on the American West Coast through at least August 1920 when he lost to Army Welch on August 18, 1920, in a second round TKO at Liberty Park in Seattle, Washington.

The \\"Dumont Resolution\\" passed by the Chamber of Deputies in 1917 called for security after World War I (1914‚Äì18) to be based on the armed forces of France and her allies, and also for the establishment of a society of nations. Dumont was again Minister of Finance in 1930, and was Minister of the Navy in 1931‚Äì32. He initiated construction of the battleship Dunkerque as part of a naval expansion program. Dumont came from a family of peasant winemakers from the Jura, and did much to promote development of that region as president of the Jura Departmental Council from 1921 to 1939. Life Early years Charles Dumont was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on 31 August 1867. His family came from Jura, and had been peasant winemakers in Brainans, near Poligny, for three centuries. His father worked in the Posts department and had been assigned to a position in Ajaccio. Charles Dumont was well educated. He completed his secondary education at the Lyc√©e Henri-IV, then went to the Sorbonne where he earned a Bachelor of Science and then a degree in Law. He became involved in politics as a student, and became general secretary of an anti-Boulangist committee. In 1891 he began to teach secondary school, first at the lyc√©e of Puy, then of Bourges and finally at Lons-le- Saunier. He wrote two books in this period, one on the Bulgarian issue and one on the fight against anarchist and pacifist propaganda. He became a Freemason. Deputy Dumont was elected deputy for the district of Poligny, Jura, on 22 May 1898 and joined the Radical group. He was reelected in April‚ÄìMay 1902 and 6‚Äì20 May 1906. He took a socialist position in favor of the strikes of 1904 and 1909, and in support of workers' pensions. Article four of the proposed 1905 law for the separation of church and state allowed for creation of associations culturelles, mainly composed of lay Catholics, which would inherit properties such as churches and presbyteries. In April 1905 Dumont and Maurice Allard, who was also from the Left, objected to article four since they wanted to sever any connections between the Church of Rome and the associations culturelles. Dumont was interested in fiscal matters throughout his political career. He was general rapporteur for the 1910 budget. He was reelected in April‚ÄìMay 1910, and on 2 March 1911 was appointed Minister of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs in the cabinet of Ernest Monis, holding office until 27 June 1911. Dumont was made Minister of Finance in the cabinet of Louis Barthou formed on 22 March 1913. In October‚ÄìNovember 1913 Dumont, Barthou, Foreign Affairs minister St√©phen Pichon and General Joseph Joffre were involved in finalizing an agreement with the Russian premier Count Vladimir Kokovtsov for a railway loan. At the last moment the negotiations stalled when Joffre said the protocol must have a supplement that said the railways would be built to the plan agreed by the Chiefs of the General Staffs of France and Russia, which the Tsar had approved at the start of September. Kokovtsov did not know of this plan, and was unable to agree. With a looming threat of war, Dumont lost office on 2 December 1913 over a dispute about whether pensions should be immune when a loan to the Treasury was required in the event of an emergency. Dumont retained his seat in the general elections of April‚ÄìMay 1914. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was the delegate of the Budget Committee for verification of war material. In this role he undertook numerous missions to the front lines. His influential but confidential reports were not published until after the war. During a debate in June 1917 over France's post-war goals, Dumont came up with a resolution that reasserted France's claim to Alsace-Lorraine and the requirement for German reparations, then defined a compromise position between those who looked to international organizations for peacekeeping and those who preferred more traditional means. The resolution said, The \\"Dumont Resolution\\" passed by 467 votes to 52, with 39 socialists voting in favor and 47 against. Despite the government commitment to the Dumont Resolution, the SFIO (socialist) deputies continued to agitate for establishment of a society of nations. Dumont was reelected deputy for Poligny on the Republican Union list in the general elections of 16 November 1919. In April 1920 he was again general rapporteur of the budget bill. Provincial politics Dumont was elected councilor for Jura in 1913. He was president of the General Council of Jura from 1921 to 1939. He tried to improve the organization of tourism in the region, and to make it more accessible through a major highway through Poligny and the col de la Faucille. On 9 March 1914 he was named administrator of the Central Society of provincial banks (Soci√©t√© centrale des banques de province, SCBP), and on 19 March 1914 President of the SCBP, holding this position until 23 March 1922, when he and eight administrators resigned. Senator Dumont was elected Senator on 6 January 1924 to replace St√©phen Pichon, who had retired. He sat with the Democratic Left in the Senate, and twice was general rapporteur of the budget. He was appointed Minister of Finance in the first cabinet of Camille Chautemps from 21 February to 2 March 1930. He was Minister of the Navy in three successive cabinets of Pierre Laval from 27 January 1931 to 20 February 1932. He presided over a naval expansion, and initiated construction of the battleship Dunkerque. At one time Dumont was president of the Franco- Japanese bank. Charles Dumont died of a heart attack in Meulan, Seine-et-Oise, on 22 April 1939 at the age of 72.

It carries Covered Bridge Road across Kenduskeag Stream in the southern part of the rural community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history Kenduskeag Stream flows southeast across the rural town of Corinth en route to the Penobscot River at Bangor. The Robyville area of the town was for many years the site of sawmills, possibly dating to the community's early settlement in the late 18th century. It is unknown how many bridges may have stood at or near this location prior to the construction of this bridge in 1876. The Robyville Bridge is oriented roughly north-south across the stream. It is a single-span structure long, with a portal clearance of and a total structure height of . It is set on abutments fashioned out of large rough-cut granite blocks; the southern abutment has been reinforced in the 20th century with concrete. The bridge's trusses are a modified Howe truss, in which the king posts near the center of the span have been doubled, and some of the cross braces have also been doubled. Crossbeams join the trusses below the roadbed, which is built out of stringers that parallel the bed, planking running side to side, and a pair of spaced wheel runways. The bridge's walls are clad in wooden shingles, and its roof is covered in asphalt shingles. The bridge is open to traffic, and received major rehabilitation in 1984.

Smith (1896 ‚Äì June 30, 1940) was an American Texas blues musician, who had a short lived recording session with Vocalion Records. Little is known about his life, although he was a busking street musician in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. He was believed to have been born sometime between 1880 and 1890. Smith played at parties, juke joints, and fish fries. In a two-year period, from 1930 to 1931 he made close to twenty recordings. Among the songs he recorded was his trademark song, \\"Howlin Wolf Blues\\".

The content is a mix of anecdotes, travelogue, historical essays, journalism and memoir, with stories set in various parts of Europe which Pla visited. An English translation by Peter Bush was published by Archipelago Books in 2015. Reception Kirkus Reviews wrote in 2015: \\"Moving around the capitals of Europe in a time of depression and unremitting melancholy, Pla often serves up small moments of perhaps unintentional brilliance[.] ... About all that's missing from this sprawling narrative of vignettes and sharp aper√ßus is a sense of the author, who sometimes remains hidden; a circumstantial introduction, especially addressing Pla's politics in that most political of times, would have been very useful. Students of Orwell's journalism and of Kapuscinski will be glad to discover Pla, whose melancholy resembles that of his contemporary Stefan Zweig‚Äîand for some of the same reasons.\\" The same year, Michael Euade of Catalonia Today wrote that \\"Pla's portraits are sharp, but not cruel: in part, because he does not except himself.\\" Euade continued: \\"In his piece on Italian painting, Pla urges his readers to throw away the 'pamphlets that only distort your vision ‚Äì however handy or abstruse they might be‚Ä¶ Set out to see things firsthand, be curious: that's the way to travel.'

Built in 1922 as a restaurant, the building is now home to the Johnson Hall Museum, a privately run museum of Americana. The building, a rare survivor in the area of automobile-related tourist accommodations from the 1920s, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Johnson Hall Museum is located on the east side of US Route 1 in northeastern Wells, opposite Harrisecket Road. A semi-circular drive provides access to the low-slung single-story building. It has a broad low-pitch roof with a cross-gable configuration, which extends over a wraparound porch supported by Tuscan columns. A porte-cochere with gable roof projects from the front. The gables of the roof have deep eaves, with large Craftsman-style brackets. The main entrance is at the center of the front facade, flanked by columns and topped by a fanlight and bracketed cornice. The interior is divided into a waiting room with offices and bathrooms to the sides, and a large dining room. Elsie Klingman Libby operated a restaurant of some sort, probably out of a 19th- century house, at this site until it was destroyed by fire in 1922. She quickly rebuilt, constructing this building to house her establishment. She operated the tea room until 1942, when declining tourism due to World War II brought about its demise. Its guests notably included Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who visited in 1932 while campaigning for president. The building now houses the Johnson Hall Museum but its future is uncertain. The museum's founder, William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Johnson, died in 2014, and most of the museum's contents were auctioned off in 2015.

It was written by Zafar Mairaj, directed by Kamran Qureshi and produced by Iram Qureshi. Meharun Nisa is said to be based on a true story. The main character in the story is Meharun, who was abandoned as a baby. Born to a prostitute, she struggles to shake the stigma associated with the circumstances of her birth. The film was broadcast in 2004 on Indus TV Network in Pakistan & UAE and in 2005 on Zee TV UK & United States as part of film series 'Maa Aur Mamta', which consisted of 13 films including Meharun Nisa. Plot While purchasing groceries in the market Yousuf's servant, Qadir (Akbar Subhani), overhears that a newborn baby (Hareem Qureshi) has been abandoned in the midst of piles of rubbish in the market. He hears that the baby has been left there as it is the child of a prostitute, and that such a child is left there every one or two months. He is told that it would have been better to have buried the baby, instead of leaving it for the animals. Qadir takes the baby to the home of rich man Yousuf, (Talat Hussain). Zainab (Bushra Ansari), Yousuf's maid, asks Qadir why he brought an 'illegal' baby to Yousuf's home. Qadir reminds Zainab about what Yousuf said when they found a dead baby in the drain. Yousuf had said that no baby is illegal and that only the actions of prostitutes who threw babies away should be seen as illegal. Zainab decides to bring the baby home and name her Meharun Nisa. Her husband Rajab Ali (Taj Niazi), a nasty, idle drunkard, questions Zainab about why she brought the baby to his home when they already had two children, Vikky (Humayun Bin Rather) and Rabia (Uzma Akhter Khanji). Zainab tries to appease him by telling him that Yousuf will bear the baby's expenses and that he does not have to worry about having less money to buy alcohol. English documentary filmmakers hear of Meharun's story and a documentary about her is made and aired on BBC. On watching that documentary, Alina (Samina Kamal), who lives in England, decides to visit Pakistan and ask Zainab if she and her husband can adopt the baby. Zainab was attached to Meharun, but she agrees in order to give Meharun a better future. Alina and her husband then bring the baby to England. Seventeen years later, Meharun Nisa (Sara Loren) grows up and comes across the documentary. For the first time, she understands what happened in her past. She goes to Pakistan to meet Zainab, the lady who cared for her.

It was released as a single on MGM Records in 1956. Background By all accounts, Audrey Williams had no sense of time as a singer, but she nonetheless sang with her husband at his personal appearances and on his Mother's Best Flour radio shows. Early Williams band member R.D. Norred later recalled, \\"Audrey couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, and the more she practiced, the worse she got.\\" Williams was painfully aware of his wife's limitations as a vocalist but indulged her ambitions anyway, allowing her to sing and arranging recording sessions for her. Louisiana Hayride producer Horace Logan told Williams biographer Colin Escott that he would have never allowed her onstage but claimed Hank told him, \\"Logan, I've got to let her sing. I've got to live with the woman.\\" Hank had gotten Audrey a deal with Decca but, after quickly recognizing her lack of singing talent, the label dropped her, and in March 1951 he persuaded his producer Fred Rose to cut them singing some duets of spiritual material. Recording and composition \\"A Home in Heaven\\" was a song that Williams had kicked around in one guise or another for five years; a version had been included on a set of demos sent to Columbia in 1946 and it resurfaced again later under the title \\"Are You Building a Temple in Heaven?\\" Hank and Audrey were backed on the session by Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Howard Watts or Ernie Newton (bass). Largely due to Audrey's tuneless singing, Rose refused to release it, but MGM - desperate for new material after Hank's death in 1953 - released the song in 1956 with another duet, \\"The Pale Horse and His Rider,\\" as the B-side. Colin Escott observes, \\"Once again, Hank and Audrey's domestic disharmony seemed to find its extension on disc as she tried for supremacy on every note.\\" References ;Sources * 1956 singles Hank Williams songs 1951 songs Song recordings produced by Fred Rose (songwriter) Songs written by Hank Williams MGM Records singles ","title":"A Home in Heaven"},{"id":"47220708","text":"Orphans of the Sahara is a three-part documentary series, produced by Al Jazeera, and aired on January 2014.

Posen is the Ford International Professor of Political Science and director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Grand strategy Posen defines grand strategy as \\"a state's 'theory about how to produce security for itself.'\\" Summary Posen describes the current debate about American grand strategy as being between two main philosophies: liberal hegemony and restraint. The first half of the book addresses liberal hegemony. Liberal hegemony is defined as \\"an activist grand strategy that aims to assertively maintain U.S. dominance and the 'unipolar moment' in the service of liberalism and national security,\\" Posen argues that liberal hegemony is the grand strategy that the United States has followed since the end of the Cold War and that it has been a failure, calling it \\"unnecessary, counterproductive, costly, and wasteful.\\" In the second half of the book, Posen explains why restraint would be a better grand strategy to follow than liberal hegemony. He details what the strategy would look like and what sort of military would be needed to achieve this. Reception Reviewer William Ruger, writing in The American Conservative, called the book the \\"defining treatise\\" for supporters of restraint.

The two-story, fourteen-room log cabin is located near the Limberlost Swamp on the outskirts of Geneva in Adams County, Indiana. Stratton-Porter designed the Queen Anne-style rustic home with the help of an architect. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Stratton-Porter, who began her literary career in 1900, used the cabin as the base for her field research, natural history collecting, writing projects, and photographic work. She wrote The Song of the Cardinal (1903) and researched Moths of the Limberlost (1912) while living at the cabin. Stratton-Porter also used the Limberlost area as the setting for three novels: Freckles (1904) and A Girl of the Limberlost (1909) and Laddie (1913). History Gene Stratton-Porter, her husband, Charles Dorwin Porter, and their daughter Jeannette, moved from Decatur to Geneva, Indiana, after Jeanette's birth in 1887. Construction began on their new, two-story home at 200 East Sixth Avenue in Geneva in 1894. Stratton-Porter designed the home, which was described as \\"the most pretentious dwelling in the Geneva area,\\" with the help of an architect.Long, p. 132. The cabin was completed in 1895, the same year that she began to write and publish her first magazine articles. The Porters named their new home Limberlost Cabin in reference to its location near the Limberlost Swamp, in Adams and Jay Counties, where Stratton-Porter found the inspiration for her writing. Stratton-Porter lived in the cabin at Geneva with her husband and daughter for eighteen years and referred to their large, fourteen-room home as \\"the cabin.\\" Between 1888 and 1910, the area's wetlands at the Limberlost Swamp were drained to reclaim the land for commercial and agricultural development. By 1912 the work to drain the wetlands for cultivation was complete and the natural habitat of the wildlife that Stratton-Porter documented in her books was destroyed. As a result of the development, Stratton-Porter decided to relocate. In 1914 Stratton-Porter and her family moved from the Limberlost Cabin to a new cabin that she called Wildflower Woods at Sylvan Lake near Rome City in Noble County, Indiana, about from Geneva.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 334. Charles Porter continued to live at Limberlost Cabin and commuted to Sylvan Lake on the weekends. The Porters sold the property in Geneva in 1923.Bennett, ed., p. 9. The Limberlost Conservation Association of Geneva donated the Limberlost Cabin to the State of Indiana in 1947. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates the state historic site as a historic house museum. Some of Stratton-Porter's possessions are on display in the cabin, including her collection of mounted moths, household furnishings, and other memorabilia. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.Morrow, Nature's Storyteller, p. 159. The site is open to the public and includes the Limberlost Cabin, a carriage house, and a visitor center. Guided tours of the cabin are available.Morrow, Nature's Storyteller, pp. 159‚Äì61. Description Working with an architect, Stratton-Porter designed a two-story, fourteen-room home for her family in the late 1890s. The home was inspired by the Forestry Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which the Porters visited in 1893.Bennett, ed., pp. 5 and 8. The two-story, Queen Anne-style home has a Wisconsin white cedar-log exterior and features California redwood shingles on the upper story. The front facade features a single-story wraparound porch with log pillars across the front and east side. The fourteen-room home includes a wood-framed interior with red oak panels in the entrance hall, dining room, and library. The first floor also contains a kitchen, two bedrooms, a music room, a small conservatory, and a full bathroom (which Stratton-Porter also used as a photographic darkroom). The second floor included four large rooms. The home also featured seven fireplaces, large windows, and white oak floors. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographsLong, pp. 131‚Äì34.Morrow, Nature's Storyteller, p. 47. A cedar-log barn/carriage house was erected behind the home. The property also included a yard filled with fruit trees, vines, and bushes, as well as a large flower garden.Long, p. 134. Significance The Limberlost Cabin, in addition to serving as the Porters' residence, was Stratton-Porter's base for her field research, natural history collecting, writing projects, and photographic work.Bennett, ed., p. 8. While residing in Geneva, Stratton-Porter spent much of her time exploring, observing nature, sketching, and making photographs at the Limberlost Swamp. The cabin is also where she began writing her literary career at the age of thirty-six. Stratton-Porter used her fictional writings to educate readers about birding and nature while interlacing the stories with romance and moral lessons. Her popularity was so high during World War I that \\"reprints of the novel were said to have littered the trenches.\\" Stratton-Porter's first published article appeared in Recreation magazine in 1900 when she was living at Limberlost Cabin. She also wrote her first novel, The Song of the Cardinal (1903), while living there. Stratton-Porter used the nearby swamp for research for her natural history book, Moths of the Limberlost (1912), as well. In addition, the area was the setting for three of her popular novels: Freckles (1904), A Girl of the Limberlost (1909) and Laddie (1913). While a resident of Geneva, Stratton-Porter became known as \\"The Bird Lady\\" and \\"The Lady of the Limberlost\\" to her friends and readers.

Under Davis, Stafford was the State Senate President Pro Tempore. Descended from two prominent families, Stafford was the fifth of eight children of Leroy Augustus Stafford, Jr. (1869-1923), an Alexandria native and a graduate of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. His grandfather, also named Leroy Augustus Stafford, was a general for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War who was mortally wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness. His uncle, David Theophilus Stafford, was a four- term Rapides Parish sheriff from 1888 to 1904. Stafford's mother, the former Bertha Moore Hyams (1870-1959), was a granddaughter of Louisiana Civil War Governor Thomas Overton Moore. The youngest of Stafford's siblings, Thomas Overton Moore Stafford (1905-1973), was an uncle by marriage of the late U.S. Representative Harold B. McSween of Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded. Grove Stafford and his wife, the former Emily Gaiennie (1903-1974), had four children, Alexandria attorney Grove \\"Red\\" Stafford, Jr.; Emily Stafford Brame McNeely (1926-1997); Martha \\"Patti\\" Daniel, and George Mason Graham Stafford. Stafford, Jr. (1928-2017), a Republican, graduated from Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and was a partner in the Alexandria firm Stafford, Stewart & Potter, formerly Stafford & Pitts. He served on the Louisiana Board of Ethics and the Louisiana Association of Defense Counsel, of which he was the president in 1981. Emily McNeely was first married to Frank Thebault Brame, Jr. (1919-1992) of Alexandria, the nephew of Scott Miller Brame (1881-1947), for whom the Scott M. Brame Middle School in Alexandria is named. Emily's second husband was the Crowley physician, Thomas Ludlow McNeely, Jr., a native of Colfax in Grant Parish, a graduate of the LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, and a two-term member of the Crowley City Council, who died on his ninetieth birthday on October 26, 2016. Stafford's namesake grandson, Grove Stafford Brame, the sixth of seven children of Frank and Emily Brame, was a Dr Pepper executive in Dallas and Houston, who died in July 2017 at the age of fifty-nine in Boerne, west of San Antonio, Texas. Stafford was succeeded in the state Senate in 1948 by C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs and the return of Earl Kemp Long to the governorship. He subsequently served on the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors in the administration of Long's second successor, Robert F. Kennon. He was a defendant in the appeal of a suit brought forth from 1953 to 1955 against LSU by the African-American civil rights attorney A. P. Tureaud of New Orleans. Stafford died in Alexandria at the age of seventy-eight and is interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Pineville, alongside his wife.

It lies at an elevation 4806 feet in the New York Mountains. History Manvel A mining magnate from Denver, Isaac G. Blake, in April 1892, with an interest in the silver mines in Sagamore Canyon in the New York Mountains, built the Needles Reduction Company mill, in the town of Needles and then in December 1892 began building the Nevada Southern Railway, toward those silver mines and the gold mining town of Vanderbilt from the Santa Fe Railroad station at Goffs, completing it to a rail camp with a post office, named Manvel, then later built it some miles on up nearer the mines, to a rail camp named Summit which was renamed Manvel when the post office relocated there, in July 1893. Vredenburgh, L.M.; Shumway, G.L.; Hartill, R.D. (1981), Desert Fever, an overview of mining in the California Desert, living West Press: Canoga Park, CA Manvel was the nearest railhead for nearby mining camps, including Vanderbilt, Goodsprings, Crescent, and Montgomery. However Blake's silver mines, mill and railroad empire was bankrupted by the crash of 1893 and tied up in litigation until after 1907. The gold mines at Vanderbilt and those discovered to the east at Searchlight, Nevada in the later 1890s, helped to sustain Manvel. Manvel supported a flour, grain, and lumber dealer, a general store, a hotel, a blacksmith, the post office, and a stage line running to Montgomery in 1898 and a school district in January 1900. In early 1902, the Nevada Southern completed a 15-mile extension into the Ivanpah Valley, to a new railhead at Ivanpah, to serve as the shipping point for the nearby Copper World Mine.Hensher, Alan, 2005, The Historical Mining Towns of the Eastern Mojave Desert in Robert E. Reynolds editor, Old Ores, Mining History in the Eastern Mojave Desert: California State University, Desert Studies Consortium and LSA Associates, Inc. pp. 22-27 At Searchlight, as production steadily increased, Manvel as its main rail shipping point for Searchlight, had a depot, telegraph office, a freight- forwarding house, and an agency of Wells, Fargo & Company. T. A. Brown, the co-founder of the Brown-Gosney Company store, largest in town, organized a telephone system; started several freight lines and a stage line; and opened branches in several nearby camps and towns. Barnwell In early 1905, the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad was completed. The line passed only 20 miles from Searchlight and 15 miles from the Copper World Mine. With this competition in early 1907, the Santa F√© railroad completed a 23-mile extension to Searchlight, the Barnwell and Searchlight Railway. To prevent confusion with a town in Texas, Manvel was renamed Barnwell. The rail line was finished just as Searchlight‚Äôs production began to plunge. A depression followed in October. When blue pieces of scrip were introduced in Barnwell as money, families began to leave. In September 1908, a fire destroyed most of Barnwell‚Äôs business district, including the depot and the Brown-Gosney Company‚Äôs store. The depot never reopened and the Brown-Gosney Company which had earlier moved its headquarters to Searchlight, closed its store in Barnwell in February, 1910 and the town had another fire in May. After production at Searchlight fell drastically in 1911, T. A. Brown moved his family away in 1912. The railroad closed its agency in 1914. The post office was discontinued in April, 1915. The school district was abolished in 1918. All train service was discontinued in late 1923, and the rails were torn up.

Anabolic steroids were ranked 19th in dependence, 9th in physical harm, and 15th in social harm. Research data indicates that steroids affect the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter systems of the brain.Dopinglinkki > Anabolic steroids induce long-term changes in the brain In an animal study, male rats developed a conditioned place preference to testosterone injections into the nucleus accumbens, an effect blocked by dopamine antagonists, which suggests that androgen reinforcement is mediated by the brain. Moreover, testosterone appears to act through the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common substrate for drugs of abuse. Nonetheless, androgen reinforcement is not comparable to that of cocaine, nicotine, or heroin. Instead, testosterone resembles other mild reinforcers, such as caffeine, or benzodiazepines. The potential for androgen addiction remains to be determined. Anabolic steroids are not psychoactive and cannot be detected by stimuli devices like a pupilometer which makes them hard to spot as a source of neuropsychological imbalances in some AAS users. Abuse potential The Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM IV) and the International Classification of Diseases, Volume 10 (ICD 10) differ in the way they regard Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids' (AAS) potential for producing dependence. DSM IV regards AAS as potentially dependence producing. ICD 10 however regards them as non-dependence producing. Anabolic steroids are not physically addictive but users can develop a psychological dependence on the physical result. Diagnostic Statistical Manual For DSM-IV, anabolic- androgenic steroid dependency is found in the ‚Äúother substance-related disorder‚Äù (which includes inhalants, anabolic steroids, medications) section and can be coded, depending on which diagnostic criteria are met.  International Classification of Diseases  ICD‚Äì10 criteria for dependence include experience of at least three of the following during the past year: * a strong desire to take steroids * difficulty in controlling use * withdrawal syndrome when use is reduced * evidence of tolerance * neglect of other interests and persistent use despite harmful consequences However, the following ICD-10-CM Index entries contain back-references to ICD-10-CM F55.3: *Abuse hormones F55.5 steroids F55.5 drug NEC (non-dependent) F19.10 *hormones F55.5 *steroids F55.5 non-psychoactive substance NEC F55.8 *hormones F55.5 *steroids F55.5 ICD-10 goes on to state that ‚Äúalthough it is usually clear that the patient has a strong motivation to take the substance, there is no development of dependence or withdrawal symptoms as in the case of the psychoactive substances.‚Äù National Institute on Drug Abuse The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) says that \\"even though anabolic steroids do not cause the same high as other drugs, steroids are reinforcing and can lead to addiction. Studies have shown that animals will self-administer steroids when given the opportunity, just as they do with other addictive drugs. People may persist in abusing steroids despite physical problems and negative effects on social relationships, reflecting these drugs‚Äô addictive potential. Also, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drug; another indication of addiction. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking them, including mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, insomnia, reduced sex drive, and steroid cravings, all of which may contribute to continued abuse. One of the most dangerous withdrawal symptoms is depression. When depression is persistent, it can sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts. Research has found that some steroid abusers turn to other drugs such as opioids to counteract the negative effects of steroids.\\" Causes and treatment Male anabolic-androgenic steroid abusers often have a troubled social background. Childhood trauma 25% of male weightlifters reported memories of childhood physical or sexual abuse in an interview. Anabolic steroids are sometimes used by people with muscle dysmorphia (a very specific type of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)) as a defense mechanism. Yohimbine, while considered something of a flop as a supplement for failing to increase testosterone levels as had at first been suspected, has at higher doses been discovered to be useful in facilitating recall of traumatic memories during post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment that can be used in conjunction with exposure therapy. Illicit use by groups Criminals Anabolic steroid use has been associated with an antisocial lifestyle involving various types of criminality. Governments =Law enforcement= Steroid abuse among law enforcement is considered a problem by some. \\"It's a big problem, and from the number of cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're in the middle of an active investigation into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers,\\" says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that ‚ÄúAnabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\\". It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom \\"are using criminals to buy steroids and abuse their power for sexual gratification\\" which he claims to be a top risk factor for police corruption. Sports =Professional wrestling= Following the resurgence oF Bill Graham, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry. The Committee investigated WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), asking for documentation of their companies' drug policies. WWE CEO and Chairman, Linda and Vince McMahon respectively, both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers‚Äîroughly 40 percent‚Äîhad tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for steroids.documents = Students =  Middle school  According to a 1998 study, 2.7% of middle school students admitted to taking steroids. 2% of non-users indicated they would use them in the future. http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/5/e6.short Anabolic steroid use by male and female middle school students by Faigenbaum et al References Androgens and anabolic steroids Substance abuse ","title":"Anabolic-androgenic steroids abuse"},{"id":"47221683","text":"Geneva Downtown Commercial Historic District is a national historic district located at Geneva, Adams County, Indiana, USA.

Shortly after the programme began, there were improvements reported in several areas of care. This included reductions in the number of cases of bloodstream infections associated with central lines, ventilator-acquired pneumonia and the length of time patients were staying in intensive care. As the end of the first phase of the programme was reached in 2012, it was clear that good progress had been made towards the overall aim of reducing mortality by 15 per cent and adverse events by 30 per cent.

He was also a writer and literary editor. Life Thalheim was born in Chemnitz, in the southern part of what was then central Germany. His father was a public official. He successfully undertook his school final exams in 1943 and in 1943/44 performed substitute national service by working as a teacher in Carinthia. He also undertook a period of study involving German literature, history pedagogy and philosophy at Freiburg university in the south-west of the country, where his teachers included Walter Rehm and Martin Heidegger. Despite a serious eye- sight defect, in 1944 he had to work in a Chemnitz munitions factory. He was then sent to work at the secret rocket research facility at Peenem√ºnde where he remained till the first part of 1945. At the end of the war he was captured in Leipzig and spent time as a prisoner of war, held by the U.S. Army and then by the French army. He was released in 1946 and returned to Chemnitz. The slaughter of war had left the country with a desperate shortage of teachers, and in order to address this a \\"New Teacher\\" accelerated on-the-job training scheme had been established. Thalheim qualified through the scheme between 1946 and 1948 and obtained a post at a secondary school, teaching German and History. In 1948 he relocated the short distance to Leipzig where till 1951 he resumed his university level education, at the same time working as a teacher at one of the that the authorities had set up in what had been, since May 1945, administered as the Soviet occupation zone in what had been Germany. After a brief spell working for the national higher education secretariat in Berlin, between 1951 and 1957 Thalheim lived and worked in Weimar. Initially he was employed at the as a senior research assistant to Gerhard Scholz. In 1954 he received his doctorate for a dissertation on Griechenlandbild by the eighteenth century Hellenist scholar Winckelmann. From 1954 he and Louis F√ºrnberg jointly produced the , which quickly became a respected literary journal. The focus of the journal, which appeared four times each year was the Weimar classicist movement. F√ºrnberg died young in 1957: Thalheim remained the journal's publishing editor till 1963.

Meanwhile he obtained his own habilitation (qualification ) in 1961 for work on Friedrich Schiller. At the end of 1964 Thalheim accepted an offer to switch to the (East) German Academy of Sciences nearby. There he became Director of the Institute for German Language and Literature. However, he remained at The Academy only till 1968, due to internal reforms within the institution. From 1967 he was working on research for an Encyclopaedia for a Marxist History of Literature, and was chairman of the project's editorial collective. Work on the project, which dealt with German writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, would last till 1979, although the volumes of the Encyclopaedia started to appear in 1973. After retiring in 1989, Hans-G√ºnther Thalheim continued to live in Berlin. Work Although Thalheim's career embraced a wide spectrum of literary research, his speciality remained the eighteenth century, and in particular the Sturm und Drang phase of the German classicist movement. At the heart of that was almost fifty years of work on Friedrich Schiller, whose work had been the basis for his habilitation dissertation in 1961, but he also made major contributions on Winckelmann, Goethe and Kleist. His literary approach was enriched by insights into historical context: his linguistic and stylistic analyses included reflections on the political and social contradictions of the periods in which works were created.

He graduated in 2002 with a BFA from Cooper Union School of Art in New York City. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Pictures of Brock‚Äôs work were shown in W Magazine. The New York Times wrote a short piece about a show he was in. A picture of his arts was used as an example by Bloomberg News. ArtForum wrote a brief piece about his work. Cultured Magazine and Interview Magazine wrote about him. Reviews and reception Brock first creates relatively conventional large abstract paintings, which one commentator describes as \\"happy\\". These are then \\"negated and disenchanted\\" by a long process including adding layers, scraping, puncturing, and slicing. The results of this process are what Brock exhibits. He also incorporates fragments of such canvasses into the surfaces of other works. W Magazine wrote that Brock was \\"... best known for his unorthodox approach to abstract painting, in which he creates frenetic, gestural images and then renders them unrecognizable with the help of a razor blade and a power sander.\\" Marina Cashdan wrote: \\"His studio is an ecosystem‚Äîand an efficient one‚Äîin which the artist‚Äôs methodical and ritualistic process makes for a consistent upcycling of materials across the space: when he spray-paints, he uses a canvas as the drop cloth; that canvas becomes the start of a painting; and that painting has two fates: one sliding door is going under the razor and the industrial sander, before being coated with layers of pigments and primed, sanded, and primed, a process repeated until the desired effect is reached; the other fate is to be martyred into chips or dust.\\" Stephan Cox, in Hunted Projects: In Dialogue wrote: \\"What‚Äôs fascinating is that Brock‚Äôs works are the product of an artist who aims to demystify the gesture in painting through creating rituals that in effect eradicate the didactic artist-viewer scenario. Brock doesn‚Äôt aim to create works that are easily read as being a by-product of an artist‚Äôs expression; Brock has created a set of rituals, a rolling of dice, where he, in effect has his actions directed for him. This could be through the number of brush strokes to apply or the number of cuts to make, in all, his intuitive approach to painting is not present or discernible to the viewer.\\" References External links * 1980 births Living people American contemporary artists Casualist artists Cooper Union alumni ","title":"Kadar Brock"},{"id":"47221838","text":"The Sikorsky S-37 was an American twin-engine aircraft built by the Sikorsky Manufacturing Corporation. Both examples of the series were completed in 1927. The S-37 was specifically designed to compete for the Orteig Prize and would be the last land based fixed-wing aircraft Sikorsky would produce. Design The S-37 was a two bay sesquiplane using parallel interplane struts and bracing wires. Based on the S-35 its construction was very similar, an all metal fuselage and main wing made of Duralumin and covered with fabric. The empennage featured a triple tail with the rudders placed in the slipstream of each engine and a center vertical stabilizer that was adjustable from a lever in the cockpit. The first S-37 was initially powered by Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9A Jupiter engines with the main fuel tanks located in the fairings behind each engine. A small two-cylinder hand-started auxiliary power unit mounted in the fuselage below the cockpit generated compressed air used to start the main engines. Main wheel brakes were hydraulically controlled with differential braking. The nose of the fuselage was hinged and concealed an opening wide by tall that could be used for baggage or an auxiliary fuel tank.  Operational history After the S-35 crashed and was destroyed in September 1926, Sikorsky built the first S-37 registered as X1283 for Rene Fonck to make another attempt at a non-stop Atlantic crossing and win the Orteig Prize. The aircraft was designed specifically for the transatlantic flight and was completed in the spring of 1927. Christened Ville de Paris, flight testing revealed it had sufficient payload and range to make the flight. When Charles Lindbergh won the Orteig prize the planned attempt was abandoned and the S-37 was converted into a passenger airliner for commercial use. The Jupiter engines were exchanged for Pratt & Whitney Hornets, then Fonck's sponsors sold it to American International Airways of Argentina where it was renamed the Southern Star and re-registered as R1283. During its delivery flight on 30 June 1929, it became the first commercial transport to cross the high Andes mountains between Buenos Aires and Santiago carrying a payload of including eight people. Sometime afterward the aircraft was acquired by Pan American World Airways, and in 1930 was scrapped.VS-37B bomber with Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet engines Late in 1927 Sikorsky formed a brief partnership with Consolidated Aircraft to produce the second S-37. Initially designated the S-37-2 and registered X3698 or NX3698 this aircraft had slightly better performance than the first version and was designed as a bomber for the United States Army Air Corps. Later called the VS-37B Guardian, it was equipped with Pratt & Whitney Hornet engines and a redesigned tail that eliminated the adjustable center vertical stabilizer and increased the size of the rudders. The Army Air Corps performed flight testing at Wilbur Wright Field under the designation XP-496 but the aircraft failed to meet Army requirements and was rejected. In 1929 it was converted into a passenger commercial ship with Jupiter engines installed then sold to New York, Rio and Buenos Aries Airlines. In 1934 this aircraft, now registered as NR942M, was rebuilt and fitted with pontoons for a \\"Round- the-World\\" flight eastbound from Chicago to Chicago. As the flight approached Cleveland one of the engines caught fire and the crew made an emergency landing on Lake Erie. After repairs the flight continued but later crashed in the north Atlantic Ocean.

It was named in honour of Edward, the Prince of Wales and the eldest son of Queen Victoria. The historic Prince's Rink hosted the first thirty-eight St. John's senior hockey league championships (Boyle Trophy) and the first seven all-Newfoundland hockey championships (Herder Memorial Trophy) before the building was destroyed by fire on November 28, 1941. Construction On December 11, 1898 the foundation for the rink was laid near the old Newfoundland Railway terminus at Fort William on the west side of Factory Lane between Plymouth Road and Forest Road (sandwich between curling rink and Queen's College). The land was previously owned by the Reid Newfoundland Railway. Robert G. Reid Sr. deeded the land in exchange for shares of equal value in the new rink management company. The Rink followed the size and design of the Montagnard Rink built in 1898 at Montreal. Two Reid Railway engineers, Fred Angel and W.H. Murray, drew up the plans for the new rink. The wooden structure was built by Campbell and Company and Horwood Lumber Company and was completed in less than two months. Planks recovered from a ship wreck were steamed, curved and bolted to form the dome roof. Opening The rink opened on Saturday January 28, 1899 with 200 and First Hockey Game The first hockey match played on the new rink's ice surface was a game arranged by the newly founded city hockey league between native Canadians and native Newfoundlanders on February 1, 1899.http://collections.mun.ca/cdm/compoundobject/collection/telegram18/id/51413/rec/5942 Ownership In the summer of 1933 the owners stated that the 30-year-old rink would not open the following winter and subsequently put the rink up for sale. The Guards Athletic Association of St. John's purchased the rink and hired Arthur Johnson as manager. In 1937 a new company, the Arena Rink Company Limited, was formed and took ownership of the rink and retained Arthur Johnson as manager. The major shareholders were two influential St. John's Businessmen, Chesley Crosbie and Chesley A. Pippy. They changed the name of the rink to 'the Arena'. Newfoundland's First Artificial Ice The Arena Rink Company installed an ice-making plant shortly after taking ownership to lengthen the hockey and skating season. In August 1937 Newfoundland's first artificial ice surface was tested. Rink Managers Over the 42 years of operation there were five rink managers: James P. Fox (1899), Frank Donnelly, Charles Bulley, P. E. 'Neddy' Outerbridge, Arthur Johnson (1933-1941) November 1941 Fire On Friday November 28, 1941 the Arena was catering to a private skating party that included military personnel. At 7:20 pm fire broke out in the boiler room and very quickly the wooden structure was completely engulfed in flames. A spectacular blaze lit the city on a night with a mandatory wartime blackout. The primary ice arena in St. John's and the adjacent curling rink burned to the ground. Site Today The site of the former rink is now an office tower at 10 Fort William Place.

Construction and commissioning PCS-1457, planned as PC-1457, was reclassified PCS in April 1943 and laid down by Ballard Marine Railway Company, Seattle, Washington on 23 May 1943. The vessel was launched on 6 September 1943 sponsored by Miss Patricia McQuire and on 26 February 1944 commissioned as USS PCS-1457 sailing for the Pacific war zone after shakedown and training.

Pacific wartime operations PCS-1457 supported the recapture of the Marianas, specifically Guam and Tinian landings with surveys before and after the invasion. After the Marianas operations the ship conducted general surveys in the Pacific until February 1945 when she conducted pre invasion surveys at Iwo Jima followed by surveys as the island was being secured. Charts resulting from surveys were printed on board with a survey team from that ship erecting a reference navigational signal atop Mount Suribachi. On 20 March 1945, PCS-1457 was reclassified as a Hydrographic Survey Ship (AGS-10) and four days later was renamed John Blish. The survey vessel continued more routine survey work until the invasion of Okinawa where she again supported landings with hydrographic work. The ship earned 4 battle stars for World War II service. Post war John Blish was reclassified as a Coastal Surveying Ship (AGSC-10) on 27 July 1946 and conducted coastal surveys on the West Coast of the United States until sailing for New York and decommissioning on 22 August 1949.

History  The company was created in 1902 from the consolidation of several other companies: Southern Ohio Traction, Miamisburg and Germantown Traction, and two street railroads. These companies were all controlled by the Pomeroy-Mandelbaum syndicate. The company owned the line from Cincinnati to Dayton (including the Germantown branch), plus of street railways in Hamilton. Financial difficulties led that syndicate to sell the company to a rival syndicate, controlled by Randal Morgan, W. Kesley Schoepf, and Hugh J. McGowan.

Life Catherine Teresa Murray, appears to have been from County Wicklow, was the daughter of a P. Murray. Little is known of her life, but it has been assumed that she is the wife of George James Cookson (1805-1838), a member of the Bengal Artillery, whom she married on 8 June 1832. Her husband died of smallpox on 20 January 1838. Artistic work The work that she is known for is Flowers Drawn and Painted in India, which was published around 1835. Cookson wrote and illustrated the volume, and it is her only known work. The volume contains 31 botanical drawings of indigenous Indian plants. The plates are hand-coloured lithographs. The bound album was presented to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Library by Queen Elizabeth II on the opening of the new Herbarium and Library building in 1964.

Stossel (September 10, 1941 ‚Äî September 29, 2019) was an American physician-researcher, the discoverer of gelsolin, inventor of BioAegis technology estate, and Professor of Medicine Emeritus, Harvard Medical School and American Cancer Society Clinical Research Professor Emeritus. He was Chief Scientific Advisor to BioAegis Therapeutics Inc., a clinical stage biotech company developing a unique non-immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory with potential to address a wide range of infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases. He is the holder of more than 50 patents and author of more than 300 papers, studies and reviews. He was also a member of The National Academy of Sciences, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Medicine, Past Editor-in-Chief of Current Opinion in Hematology and Past Editor of Journal of Clinical Investigation, Past President of the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Investigation. Education and career Stossel earned a BA degree summa cum laude from Princeton University and an MD degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School. He completed internship and residency in internal medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was a staff associate at the National Heart Institute after which he received training in hematology at Boston Children‚Äôs and Peter Bent Brigham Hospitals. He was chief of hematology-oncology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1976 ‚Äì 1991, head of experimental medicine at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital (1991-1998), co- director of hematology (1998-2006) and translational medicine (2011-2014) at that institution. He served on the scientific advisory boards of Biogen, Inc (1997-2002), Dyax, Inc (1991-2001) and has been a director of Velico Medical Inc since 2000. He was president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and of the American Society of Hematology), served on the Lasker Awards‚Äô Jury and as editor in chief of The Journal of Clinical Investigation and of Current Opinion in Hematology. Currently he is a member of the scientific advisory board of The Forsyth Dental Institute and a trustee of the American Council on Science and Health. Scientific contributions Stossel‚Äôs research encompassed wide-ranging studies of white blood cell structure function in health and disease but predominantly focused on the molecular mechanism of how cells move and change shape. This research led to the discovery of two important cellular proteins, filamin and gelsolin, that regulate the assembly of actin. Gelsolin is also an abundant extracellular protein that circulates in blood plasma, and Stossel established that it is a component of innate immunity that promotes host antimicrobial activity and prevents the potentially lethal dissemination of inflammation. His company, BioAegis Therapeutics, is conducting clinical trials to assess the potential of plasma gelsolin therapy in a wide variety of infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases. BioAegis Therapeutics Tom Stossel was co-founder and chief scientific advisor to BioAegis, a clinical stage company focused on developing therapies for infectious, inflammatory and degenerative diseases through a portfolio built around plasma gelsolin technology and therapeutics. The Company is commercializing recent scientific discoveries that harness the body‚Äôs innate defense system to prevent serious outcomes. BioAegis‚Äô platform of opportunities exploits the multifunctional role of Plasma Gelsolin (‚ÄúpGSN‚Äù), a highly conserved, endogenous human protein. pGSN is a master regulator‚Äîa key immune modulator that balances the inflammatory process to prevent the spread of excess inflammation while simultaneously enhancing antimicrobial defense. It is a unique anti-inflammatory without immunosuppressive properties.In August 2019, BioAegis successfully completed a Phase 1b/2a Community Acquired Pneumonia clinical. Based on abundant pre- clinical efficacy evidence and the outcome of the clinical trial, BioAegis is now raising funding to launch a phase 2b trial in severe pneumonia designed to demonstrate definitively that plasma gelsolin repletion reduces morbidity and mortality. \\"The decades of research on how cells crawl that I undertook, subsidized by peoples' tax money, were very productive, affording me grants, publications and peer recognition. But, it didn't deliver on the motive claimed for doing it -- It hasn‚Äôt saved a single life! Today my goal and my passion is to translate the exciting scientific discoveries into products that will save lives and extend quality of life for patients. Treatment of patients suffering from infectious, injurious and degenerative disease with plasma gelsolin treatment promises to deliver the meaningful result of my life‚Äôs work.\\"' August 2019 Publications Stossel was the author of almost 300 publications, including co-authoring two textbooks, Haematology: A Pathophysiological Approach (1984) and Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology (1997) and the consumer book Pharmaphobia: How the Conflict of Interest Myth Undermines American Medical Innovation (2015).  Policy work Stossel wrote extensively on policy issues related to medical research and on the relationships between academic researchers, physicians and the medical products industry. His articles and Op Eds have appeared in many publications including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The Boston Globe. His book, Pharmaphobia. How the Conflict of Interest Myth Undermines American Medical Innovation was published by Rowman and Littlefield in 2015. He was a senior fellow of The Manhattan Institute (2008-2009) and a visiting scholar of the American Enterprise Institute (2014-2017).Stossel has been supportive of industry ethics since 1987, when he joined the scientific advisory board of Biogen. He was also critical of the Affordable Care Act rule known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requiring all companies that sell medical products to the government to disclose on a public website anything they give to physicians that is valued above $10.
