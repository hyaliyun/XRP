Upon irradiation with ultraviolet light, diazirines form reactive carbenes, which can insert into C-H, N-H, and O-H bonds. Hence, diazirines have grown in popularity as small photo-reactive crosslinking reagents. They are often used in photoaffinity labeling studies to observe a variety of interactions, including ligand- receptor, ligand-enzyme, protein-protein, and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Synthesis A number of methods exist in the literature for the preparation of diazirines, which begin from a variety of reagents. = Synthesis from ketones = Generally, synthetic schemes that begin with ketones involve conversion of the ketone with the desired substituents to diaziridines. These diaziridenes are then subsequently oxidized to form the desired diazirines. Diaziridines can be prepared from ketones by oximation, followed by tosylation (or mesylation), and then finally by treatment with ammonia. Generally, oximation reactions are performed by reacting the ketone with hydroxylammonium chloride under heat in the presence of a base such as pyridine. Subsequent tosylation or mesylation of the alpha substituted oxygen with tosyl or mesyl chloride in the presence of base yields the tosyl or mesyl oxime. The final treatment of the tosyl or mesyl oxime with ammonia produces the diaziridine. Generic diaziridine synthesis by oximation, tosylation, and treatment with ammonia. Diaziridines can be also produced directly by the reaction of ketones with ammonia in the presence of an aminating agent such as a monochloramine or hydroxyl amine O-sulfonic acid. Diaziridines can be oxidized to diazirines by a number of methods. These include oxidation by chromium based reagents such as the Jones oxidation, oxidation by iodine and triethylamine, oxidation by silver oxide, oxidation by oxalyl chloride, or even electrochemical oxidation on a platinum-titanium anode. Jones oxidation of a generic diaziridine to a diazirine. = Synthesis by Graham reaction = Diazirines can be alternatively formed in a one-pot process using the Graham reaction. In these schemes, amidines can be directly converted to diazirines by hypohalite oxidation. This reaction yields a halogenated diazirine, which can further be modified. The Graham reaction as a method of diazirine synthesis, where X = Cl or Br. The resulting aforementioned halodiazirine can undergo an exchange reaction to further functionalize the diazirene. In these reactions, anion nucleophiles, such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride or methoxytetra-n-butylammonium, can replace the halogen substituents yielding a fluorodiazirine or methoxydiazirine respectively. The diazirine exchange reaction using various anions and the counterion tetra-n-butylammonium.  Chemistry  Upon irradiation with UV light, diazirines form reactive carbene species. The carbene may exist in the singlet form, in which the two free electrons occupy the same orbital, or the triplet form, with two unpaired electrons in different orbitals. centre = Triplet vs singlet carbene products = The substituents on the diazirine affect which carbene species is generated upon irradiation and subsequent photolytic cleavage. Diazirine substituents that are electron donating in nature can donate electron density to the empty p-orbital of the carbene that will be formed, and hence can stabilize the singlet state. For example, phenyldiazirine produces phenylcarbene in the singlet carbene state whereas p-nitrophenylchlorodiazirine or trifluorophenyldiazirine produce the respective triplet carbene products. Electron donating substituents can also encourage photoisomerization to the linear diazo compound, rather than the singlet carbene, and hence these compounds are unfavorable for use in biological assays. On the other hand, trifluoroaryldiazirines in particular show favorable stability and photolytic qualities and are most commonly used in biological applications. centreCarbenes produced from diazirines are quickly quenched by reaction with water molecules, and hence yields for photoreactive crosslinking assays are often low. Yet, as this feature minimizes unspecific labeling, it is actually an advantage of using diazirines.  Use in photoreactive crosslinking  Diazirines are often used as photoreactive crosslinking reagents, as the reactive carbenes they form upon irradiation with UV light can insert into C-H, N-H, and O-H bonds. This results in proximity dependent labeling of other species with the diazirine containing compound. Diazirines are often preferred to other photoreactive crosslinking reagents due to their smaller size, longer irradiation wavelength, short period of irradiation required, and stability in the presence of various nucleophiles, and in both acidic and basic conditions. Benzophenones, which form reactive triplet carbonyl species upon irradiation, often require long periods of irradiation which can result in non-specific labeling, and moreover are often inert to various polar solvents. Aryl azides require a low wavelength of irradiation, which can damage the biological macromolecules under investigation. = Examples in receptor labeling studies = Diazirines are widely used in receptor labeling studies. This is because diazirine-containing analogs of various ligands can be synthesized and incubated with their respective receptors, and then subsequently exposed to light to produce reactive carbenes. The carbene will covalently bond to residues in the binding site of the receptor. The carbene compound may include a bioorthogonal tag or handle by which the protein of interest can be isolated. The protein can then be digested and sequenced by mass spectrometry in order to identify which residues the carbene containing ligand is bound to, and hence the identity of the binding site in the receptor. Examples of diazirines used in receptor labeling studies include: * The discovery of a brassinosteroid receptor for brassinosteroid plant hormones by Kinoshita et al. Researchers used a plant hormone analog with a diazirine crosslinking moiety and a biotin tag for isolation to identity the new receptor. This study led to a number of similar studies conducted with regards to other plant hormones. 308x308px * The discovery of novel non-CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptors using anandamide analog probes containing a diazirine group by Balas et al. * The binding cavity of the hypnotic agent propofol in the GABAA receptor using a diazirine containing propofol analog.thumb = Examples in enzyme-substrate studies = In a manner analogous to receptor labeling, diazirine containing compounds that are analogs of natural substrates have also been used to identify binding pockets of enzymes. Examples include: * The synthesis of a diazirine containing analog of etoposide, a widely used cancer drug targeting topoisomerase II, which holds promise for the identification of the etoposide binding site.thumb * The discovery that caprolactam-type gamma-secretase inhibitors target the SPP subunit of the gamma-secretase, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. = Examples in nucleic acid studies = Diazirines have been used in photoaffinity labeling experiments involving nucleic acids as well. Examples include: * Incorporation of a diazirine moiety on a nucleoside sugar in a DNA polymer to investigate interactions between the minor groove of DNA and DNA polymerases. thumb * Incorporation of a diazirine moiety on a nucleoside base in a DNA polymer to investigate the mode of DNA repair by proteins.thumb Diazirines have also been used to study protein lipid interactions, for example the interaction of various sphingolipids with proteins in vivo.

Lasser,https://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/profile/karen- lasser/ a medical doctor and researcher, and their two daughters. Critical/Biographical Writing and Literary Translations Shrayer has authored, co-authored, edited, or co-edited more than fifteen books in English and Russian. He has translated into English poetry and prose by over forty authors, many of them Jewish-Russian writers, including four books of fiction by his father, David Shrayer-Petrov, which he edited and cotranslated: Jonah and Sarah, Autumn in Yalta, Dinner with Stalin, and Doctor Levitin. A noted scholar of Vladimir Nabokov, Ivan Bunin, Jewish-Russian literature, Russian Jewry, and Soviet literature of the Shoah, Shrayer has published extensively on √©migr√© culture and various aspects of multilingual and multicultural identities in 19th and 20th century literature. His book \\"Russian Poet-Soviet Jew\\" (2000) was the first study focused on Jewish literary identity in the early Soviet decades. With his father, Shrayer coauthored the first book about the avant-garde poet Genrikh Sapgir. For the two-volume Anthology of Jewish- Russian Literature: Two Centuries of a Dual Identity in Prose and Poetry, 1801-2001, which showcases over 130 authors, Shrayer received the National Jewish Book Award in the Eastern European Studies category in 2007. In 2012 Shrayer was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for his research on Jewish poets and witnesses to the Shoah‚Äîa topic he investigated in his book I SAW IT: Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah (2013) and in recent articles. His book With or Without it: The Prospect for Russia's Jews, examines Russia's dwindling yet still vibrant Jewish community. In 2018 he published another anthology, Voices of Jewish-Russian Literature, to feature over 80 authors. Literary career Unlike most representatives of the so- called \\"new wave\\" of Russian-American writing, Maxim D. Shrayer had written and published extensively in his native Russian prior to having made a transition to writing prose predominantly in English.http://odessareview.com/reflections-translingual-writer/ He continues to write literary prose in both languages and to co-author translations of his English-language works into Russian. His career has been described as one of a \\"translingual\\" writer. Shrayer began to write poetry and prose in his native Russian at the age of eighteen and subsequently contributed it to Russian- language magazine abroad and in the former USSR. His Russian-language poetry has been gathered in three collections. At Brown University Shrayer majored in comparative literature and literary translation and studied fiction writing with John Hawkes. Around 1995, the year when he received a Ph.D. in Russian literature from Yale University, Shrayer switched to creative prose mainly in English. His stories, essays and memoirs, have since appeared in American, Canadian, and British magazines, among them Agni, Kenyon Review, Southwest Review, and Tablet Magazine. Shrayer's works have been translated into Russian, Japanese, German, Croatian, Italian, Chinese, Slovak and other languages. Shrayer quickly transitioned to writing prose in Engish, but it took him overthirty years to write his first book of poetryin English. Shrayer's literary memoir \\"Waiting for America: A Story of Emigration\\" appeared in 2007 as the first literary book in the English language to capture the experience of Soviet Jewish emigres and former refuseniks waiting in Italy en route to the New World.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A26S5YdBEMc Of Waiting for America Sam Coale wrote in The Providence Journal that \\"[t]he glory of this book lies in Shrayer's sinuous, neo-Proustian prose, beautifully fluid and perceptive with its luminous shocks of recognition, landscapes, descriptions and asides‚Ä¶Tales and teller mesmerize and delight.\\"Sam Coale.

Rev. of Yom Kippur in Amsterdam. Booklist 15 September 2009. Shrayer's literary exploration of the lives of Russian immigrants continued with his book A Russian Immigrant: Three Novellas. With A Russian Immigrant, Shrayer reaffirms his commitment to writing about the lives of Russian (Soviet) Jews abroad. In the words of Debra Lawless, \\"Shrayer poses many profound questions about what it means to be an immigrant carrying 'the baggage of memory' in his new book A Russian Immigrant: Three Novellas.\\"https://capecodchronicle.com/en/5432/features/4796/Local-Authors-To- Speak-Sign-Books-Local-authors.htm In 2020 Shrayer, initially in response to the election-year politics, and later to COVID-19, Shrayer wrote a series of poems in Engish, which appeared as a book, Of Politics and Pandemics: Songs of a Russian Immigrant.

The book was written by est graduate Luke Rhinehart. Rhinehart is the pen name of writer George Cockcroft. The book was endorsed by Erhard, and includes a foreword by him. Its contents attempts to replicate the experience of the est training, with the reader being put in the place of a participant in the course. The end of the book includes a comparison by the author between Erhard's methodologies to Zen, The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda, and to Rhinehart's own views from The Dice Man. Reception to the book was mixed. There were reviews in Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, and The New York Times Book Review. An article about Erhard and est in the religious journal Quarterly Review placed the book among \\"the most accessible sources about est\\". Professor Walter A. Effross of the American University Washington College of Law cites The Book of est in an article in the Buffalo Law Review analyzing the control of new age movements over their intellectual property. Background Werner Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg), originally from Pennsylvania, migrated to California. He was a former salesman, training manager and executive in the encyclopedia business. He created the Erhard Seminars Training (est) course in 1971. est was a four-day, 60-hour self-help program given to groups of 250 people at a time. The program was very intensive: each day would contain 15‚Äì20 hours of instruction. During the training, est personnel utilized specialized terms to convey key concepts, and participants agreed to certain rules which remained in effect for the duration of the course. Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes. By 1977 over 100,000 people completed the est training, including public figures and mental health professionals. Est was controversial. It had its critics and proponents. Werner Erhard and Associates repackaged the course as \\"The Forum\\", a seminar focused on \\"goal-oriented breakthroughs\\". By 1988, approximately one million people had taken some form of the trainings. A group of his associates formed the company Landmark Education in 1991.Landmark Education Corporation: Selling a Paradigm Shift\\", Harvard Business School Publishing, Boston, MA, Karen Hopper and Mikelle Fisher Eastley, 9-898-081, p.1, Rev. April 22, 1998 In 2013 they renamed it Landmark Worldwide LLC. Landmark fully purchased from Erhard the intellectual property in the Forum and other courses by 2002. Publication The book was first published in 1976 in a hardcover format by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, and a paperback edition was released later in the same year. It was published in German in 1983 by Hugendubel. In November 2008, Luke Rhinehart, in association with Joe Vitale and Mark J. Ryan, re-released The Book of est as an E-book. Contents The Book of est includes a one-page foreword by Werner Erhard. Erhard writes in the foreword that Rhinehart's book \\"brilliantly ... communicates clearly to the reader both a sense of being in the training room and the spirit of what takes place there.\\" Erhard's foreword notes: \\"although this book dramatizes the highlights of the training and attempts to give you the vicarious experience of being at a training, this is a book, and the est experience cannot result from reading any book\\". With Erhard's endorsement, Rhinehart attempts to replicate the \\"transformation\\" experience from est. The book imparts the message that the participant's life \\"doesn't work\\", and that after two weekends the individual will come to understand how to \\"win\\". The book presents a fictional dramatization of the est training. Punctuation style usage, including exclamation points and boldface type, bring the reader's attention to key items in the text. Rhinehart describes the est training as a form of participatory theatre, writing: \\"Seeing the trainer as a master actor ... permits us to evaluate his acts and words more intelligently than if we misinterpret him as being a scholar or scientist giving a lecture.\\" In an analysis of how to approach the est training, Rhinehart comments that \\"It might best be described, if it can be described at all, as theater‚Äîas living theater, participatory theater, encounter theater. Once we begin to see est in these terms, much that fails to fit the scheme of therapy or religion or science begins to make sense.\\" In Rhinehart's fictional account of the training, the est course leader begins with the instruction: \\"Let me make one thing clear. I don't want any of you to believe a thing I'm saying. Get that. Don't believe me. Just listen.\\" The est trainer explains that the course techniques are used because \\"Werner has found that they work.\\" When one of the est participants asks why the instructor says certain statements during the course, the instructor responds: \\"I'm saying them because Werner has found that the trainer's saying them works.\\" The concluding portion of the book includes a comparison of Werner Erhard's methodologies to Zen, The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda, and to Rhinehart's views from The Dice Man. Drawing a parallel to the \\"controlled folly\\" described in Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Rhinehart argues that in almost all cases, enlightenment is linked to humor: \\"One can rarely have an enlightenment experience except under the impact of nonsense ... Every time we laugh we are in a way experiencing a mini enlightenment, a tiny letting go of some attachment to some bit of belief or sense. Full enlightenment, in these terms, is accepting what is, which leads to experiencing fully whatever one is experiencing.\\" Rhinehart comments that those who have taken part in the est training feel the need for a sense of community: \\"Most graduates indicate that the value of the seminar series depends not so much on its ostensible data content or on the processes introduced, but on the sharing on an intimate basis with others.\\" He notes that some of the graduates of the est training \\"treat him [Erhard] with the love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers\\". He likens Erhard's relationship to his staff members to the way in which a guru interacts with disciples: \\"[It is] the essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being (usually a guru or a spiritual teacher) attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader.\\" Rhinehart argues that est \\"may be seen as in many ways the culmination to date of the 'Easternization of America', a process that first became notable in the late fifties and early sixties\\". Critical reception James Charney notes in his review of the book for Library Journal, \\"Questions of effectiveness or possible harm are hardly considered.\\" Charney characterizes the problem of the book and its subject matter as a \\"kind of with-it diffuseness which disallows any intelligent understanding on principle\\". In a review of the book for The New York Times Book Review, Zane Berzins was critical of the work, commenting: \\"There isn't much to be said for the book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination.\\" A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review characterizes it as, \\"Not a book, really. A verbatim transcription of one of Werner Erhard's weekend sessions in $250 doublethink.\\" Kirkus Reviews criticizes the author for not engaging in any judgmental analysis of the est training methodology. The review concludes, \\"at least the reader finally has an opportunity to see what an estian seminar is, with vomit bags, circuitous logic, pathetic interplay between overbearing trainer and angst-ridden trainee, and all.\\" In an article about Erhard and est for the religious journal Quarterly Review, Florida International University assistant religious studies professor Robert R. Hann places the book among \\"the most accessible sources about est\\". Hann comments that since the book has been \\"reviewed by Erhard and carries his statement of support for the author\\", it \\"can therefore be presumed to be, if not 'canonical,' then at least not significantly at odds with the perspective of est itself.\\" Professor Walter A. Effross of the American University Washington College of Law cites The Book of est along with Adelaide Bry's est: 60 Hours That Transform Your Life, in an article in the Buffalo Law Review analyzing the control of new age movements over their intellectual property. Effross notes that the copyright page of The Book of est gives a notice that: \\"material based in part on unpublished lectures created and copyrighted by Werner Erhard and used by the author with his permission. No material created and copyrighted by Werner Erhard may be used or disseminated in any medium or language without his prior written authorization.\\" Effross comments on the potential loss of control over his material that Erhard may have invited due to endorsing these books about his methodology: \\"...because it enabled commentators to make 'fair use' of the disclosed information, it was not helpful for ... Werner Erhard, the founder of est, to endorse a first-person account of an est training, even one which provided only simulations of est's 'processes,' or guided meditations. (However, the publicity [Erhard's organization] achieved from such exposure during crucial periods of ... expansion may have been seen as justifying the intellectual property risk.)\\"  See also  *Getting It: The Psychology of est * Human Potential Movement * Large Group Awareness Training * New age ReferencesFurther reading * ;Book reviews External links Werner Erhard: Books and Articles, as cited on official Werner Erhard homepage 1976 non-fiction books 1983 non-fiction books 2008 non-fiction books Werner Erhard Human Potential Movement New Age books Personal development Self-help books American non-fiction books ","title":"The Book of est"},{"id":"23814278","text":"Tibrewal is a family name of people originating from Rajasthan, India.

Description OpenBitTorrent's initiative to provide a free, stable service with no ties to indexing sites or even hosting torrent files has been a public success and it has spawned several copies with almost identical services. OpenBitTorrent has been suspected of being a part of, or a side project of, The Pirate Bay, because it was observed early on that both sites used the same trackers. The OpenBitTorrent project has countered by stating that the sites merely shared a tracker cluster operated by DCP Networks and Fredrik Neij during a startup period (February through August 2009). On 22 May 2010, the OpenBitTorrent tracker was shut down. This was a result of a case against The Pirate Bay by many major Hollywood studios. Later the tracker came back online. OpenBitTorrent is powered by the opentracker software. The Pirate Bay also used the opentracker software, before they shut down their own tracker. From 16 July to 2 August 2012, OpenBitTorrent went offline protesting the lack of adoption of a protocol improvement by the makers of uTorrent, that was proposed by Pirate Bay co-founder Fredrik Neij. As a result of the protest, many people had trouble downloading files on BitTorrent. From 5 December to 30 December 2014, the OpenBitTorrent website and tracker was unreachable, this may have been linked to the arrest of Pirate Bay co-founder Fredrik Neij. On 5 May 2015, the OpenBitTorrent tracker was back online although the website still did not display the tracker address.

Schwartz, Bernard, The Burger Court: counter-revolution or confirmation?, Oxford University Press US, 1998, , page 10 state constitutions, treaty and customary international law, legislation enacted by Congress and state legislatures, and state referenda and citizen's initiatives. The Federal Government has, through a ratified constitution, guaranteed unalienable rights to its citizens and (to some degree) non- citizens. These rights have evolved over time through constitutional amendments, legislation, and judicial precedent. Along with the rights themselves, the portion of the population granted these rights has expanded over time. Within the United States, federal courts have jurisdiction over international human rights laws. The United States is generally given high to fair marks on human rights. The Freedom in the World index (whose publisher Freedom House receives substantial funding from the US government), for example, lists the United States in the highest category for human freedom in civil and political rights, with 86 out of 100 points, and The CIRI Human Rights Data Project places the US 38th overall in human rights. The United States also has a high degree of press freedom, with the 2017 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House labeling the level of press freedom in the United States as \\"free\\" and ranking it 33rd (tied with Slovenia) out of the 199 countries analyzed. Despite the fair to high rankings in reports on human rights, the United States also receives significant international criticism for its human rights record.

History In 1776, Thomas Jefferson proposed a philosophy of human rights inherent to all people in the Declaration of Independence, asserting that \\"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" Historian Joseph J. Ellis calls the Declaration \\"the most quoted statement of human rights in recorded history\\". The first human rights organization in the Thirteen Colonies of British America, dedicated to the abolition of slavery, was formed by Anthony Benezet in 1775. A year later, the Declaration of Independence announced that the Thirteen Colonies regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire. The Declaration stated \\"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\\", echoing John Locke's phrase \\"life, liberty, and property\\".Declaration of Independence This view of human liberties, which originated from the European Enlightenment, postulates that fundamental rights are not granted by a divine or supernatural being to monarchs who then grant them to subjects, but are granted by a divine or supernatural being to each man (but not woman) and are inalienable and inherent. After the Revolutionary War, the former thirteen colonies went through a pre-government phase of more than a decade, with much debate about the form of government they would have. The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787 through ratification at a national convention and conventions in the colonies, created a republic that guaranteed several rights and civil liberties. However, it did not extend voting rights in the United States beyond white male property owners (about 6% of the population). The Constitution referred to \\"Persons\\", not \\"Men\\" as was used in the Declaration of Independence. It also omitted any reference to terms such as a \\"Creator\\" or \\"God\\" and any authority derived or divined therefrom, and allowed \\"affirmation\\" in lieu of an \\"oath\\" if preferred.See, e.g., The Constitution guaranteed rights and provided that they belonged to all Persons (presumably meaning men and women, and perhaps children, although the developmental distinction between children and adults poses issues and has been the subject of subsequent amendments, as discussed below). Some of this conceptualization may have arisen from the significant Quaker segment of the population in the colonies, especially in the Delaware Valley, and their religious views that all human beings, regardless of sex, age, race, or other characteristics, had the same Inner light. Quaker and Quaker-derived views would have informed the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, including the direct influence of some of the Framers of the Constitution, such as John Dickinson and Thomas Mifflin, who were either Quakers themselves or came from regions which were either founded or heavily populated by Quakers.See, e.g., Dickinson, Mifflin and other Framers who objected to slavery were outvoted on that question, however, and the original Constitution sanctioned slavery (although it was not based on either the race or any other characteristic of the slave) and, through the Three-Fifths Compromise, it counted slaves (who were not defined by race) as three-fifths of a Person for purposes of distribution of taxes and representation in the House of Representatives (although the slaves themselves were discriminated against in voting for such representatives). As the new Constitution took effect in practice, concerns about individual liberties and the concentration of power at the federal level, gave rise to the amendment of the Constitution through the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. However, this had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after its ratification. Courts and legislatures also began to vary in the interpretation of \\"Person\\", with some jurisdictions narrowing the meaning of \\"Person\\" to cover only people with property, only men, or only white men. For example, although women had been voting in some states, such as New Jersey, since the founding of the United States, and prior to that in the colonial era, other states denied them the vote. In 1756 Lydia Chapin Taft voted, casting a vote in the local town hall meeting in place of her deceased husband. In 1777 women lost the right to exercise their vote in New York, in 1780 women lost the right to exercise their vote in Massachusetts, and in 1784 women lost the right to exercise their vote in New Hampshire. From 1775 until 1807, the state constitution in New Jersey permitted all persons worth over fifty pounds (about $7,800 adjusted for inflation, with the election laws referring to the voters as \\"he or she\\") to vote; provided they had this property, free black men and single women regardless of race therefore had the vote until 1807, but not married women, who could have no independent claim to ownership of fifty pounds (anything they owned or earned belonged to their husbands by the Common law of Coverture). In 1790, the law was revised to specifically include women, but in 1807 the law was again revised to exclude them, an unconstitutional act since the state constitution specifically made any such change dependent on the general suffrage. See Women's suffrage in the United States. Through the doctrine of coverture, many states also denied married women the right to own property in their own name, although most allowed single women (widowed, divorced or never married) the \\"Person\\" status of men, sometimes pursuant to the common law concept of a femme sole. Over the years, a variety of claimants sought to assert that discrimination against women in voting, in property ownership, in occupational license, and other matters was unconstitutional given the Constitution's use of the term \\"Person\\", but the all-male courts did not give this fair hearing. See, e.g., Bradwell v. Illinois. In the 1860s, after decades of conflict over southern states' continued practice of slavery, and northern states' outlawing it, the Civil War was fought, and in its aftermath the Constitution was amended to prohibit slavery and to prohibit states' denying rights granted in the Constitution. Among these amendments was the Fourteenth Amendment, which included an Equal Protection Clause which seemed to clarify that courts and states were prohibited in narrowing the meaning of \\"Persons\\". After the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted, Susan B. Anthony, buttressed by the equal protection language, voted. She was prosecuted for this, however, and ran into an all-male court ruling that women were not \\"Persons\\"; the court levied a fine but it was never collected. Martin Luther King Jr. at the 1963 Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C Fifty years later, in 1920, the Constitution was amended again, with the Nineteenth Amendment to definitively prohibit discrimination against women's suffrage. In the 1970s, the Burger Court made a series of rulings clarifying that discrimination against women in the status of being Persons violated the Constitution and acknowledged that previous court rulings to the contrary had been Sui generis and an abuse of power. The most often cited of these is Reed v. Reed, which held that any discrimination against either sex in the rights associated with Person status must meet a strict scrutiny standard. The 1970s also saw the adoption of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of age, for Persons 18 years old and over, in voting. Other attempts to address the developmental distinction between children and adults in Person status and rights have been addressed mostly by the Supreme Court, with the Court recognizing in 2012, in Miller v. Alabama a political and biological principle that children are different from adults. In 1945 the members of the United Nations organization completed the drafting of its founding text ‚Äì the United Nations charter: The USA played a significant role in this process. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee was chaired by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who was known for her human rights advocacy. Similarly, for the United States government and its citizens, much remained uncertain about the future impact, force, and reach of international human rights. Eventually the United States had not yet developed a policy approach regarding whether or not it would recognize international human rights within a domestic context. Certainly there were already some domestic political attempts, as for example President Truman's Committee on Civil rights, which authored a report in 1947 initializing the possibility to apply the UN charter in order to combat racial discrimination in the US. Now that the United States had successfully adopted the UDHR, obviously it seemed like human rights would play a leading part in domestic law within the US. Still there was harsh controversy over the question whether to apply international law on the inner-land-basis. William H. Fitzpatrick won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1951 for his editorials that repeatedly warned against international human rights overthrowing the supreme law of the land. Indeed, Fitzpatrick's concerns and motivations ‚Äì as well as those of his readers ‚Äì stood for the longstanding, bitter social and political struggles that divided much of the United States at the time, keeping in mind that in the 1940s and 1950s racial divisions, political exclusion, and gender inequalities were basic facts of American social life. However, today there is little worry in the United States about the effect that human rights might have on its domestic law. Over the past few decades, the United States government has often held itself up as a strong supporter of human rights in the international arena. Nonetheless, in the view of the government human rights are still an international rather than a domestic phenomenon ‚Äì representing more of choice than obligation. Having today overcome many of the inequalities from more than half a dozen decades before, still the United States is in violation of the Declaration, in as much that \\"everyone has the right to leave any country\\" because the government may prevent the entry and exit of anyone from the United States for foreign policy, national security, or child support rearage reasons by revoking their passport.See Haig v. Agee, Passport Act of 1926, and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 The United States is also in violation of the United Nations' human rights Convention on the Rights of the Child which requires both parents to have a relationship with the child. Conflict between the human rights of the child and those of a mother or father who wishes to leave the country without paying child support or doing the personal work of child care for his child can be considered to be a question of negative and positive rights. Legal framework Original page of the United States Constitution =Domestic legal protection structure= According to Human Rights: The Essential Reference, \\"the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights.\\" The Constitution recognizes a number of inalienable human rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to a fair trial by jury. Constitutional amendments have been enacted as the needs of the society evolved. The Ninth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment recognized that not all human rights were enumerated in the original United States Constitution. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are examples of human rights that were enumerated by Congress well after the Constitution's writing. The scope of the legal protections of human rights afforded by the US government is defined by case law, particularly by the precedent of the Supreme Court of the United States. Within the federal government, the debate about what may or may not be an emerging human right is held in two forums: the United States Congress, which may enumerate these; and the Supreme Court, which may articulate rights that the law does not spell out. Additionally, individual states, through court action or legislation, have often protected human rights not recognized at federal level. For example, Massachusetts was the first of several states to recognize same sex marriage. =Effect of international treaties= In the context of human rights and treaties that recognize or create individual rights, U.S. constitutional law makes a distinction between self-executing and non-self-executing treaties. Non-self- executing treaties, which ascribe rights that under the constitution may be assigned by law, require legislative action to execute the contract (treaty) before it becomes a part of domestic law.Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314-15 (1829) U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice Marshall writing: \\"Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a contract, when either of the parties engages to perform a particular act, the treaty addresses itself to the political, not the judicial department, and the legislature must execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.\\" at 314, cited in Martin _International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law_ et al. There are also cases that explicitly require legislative approval according to the Constitution, such as cases that could commit the U.S. to declare war or appropriate funds. Treaties regarding human rights, which create a duty to refrain from acting in a particular manner or confer specific rights, are generally held to be self-executing, requiring no further legislative action. In cases where legislative bodies refuse to recognize otherwise self-executing treaties by declaring them to be non-self-executing in an act of legislative non-recognition, constitutional scholars argue that such acts violate the separation of powersin cases of controversy, the judiciary, not Congress, has the authority under Article III to apply treaty law to cases before the court. This is a key provision in cases where the Congress declares a human rights treaty to be non-self-executing, for example, by contending it does not add anything to human rights under U.S. domestic law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one such case, which, while ratified after more than two decades of inaction, was done so with reservations, understandings, and declarations.Martin, F. _International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law_. Cambridge University Press. 2006. p. 221 and following. , Under the principle of pacta sunt servanda, a country may not invoke provisions of its domestic laws or constitution as justification for failure to comply with its international law obligations. Therefore, if a human rights treaty has been ratified by the U.S. but is not considered self-executing, or has not yet been implemented by legislation, it is nonetheless binding on the U.S. government as a matter of international law. Equality=Racial= Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among the guests behind him is Martin Luther King Jr. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\\"McWhirter, Darien A.m Equal Protection, Oryx Press, 1995, page 1 In addition, Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the denial of a citizen of the right to vote based on that citizen's \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\\". The United States has enacted comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the workplace in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (CRA). The CRA is perhaps the most prominent civil rights legislation enacted in modern times, has served as a model for subsequent anti- discrimination laws and has greatly expanded civil rights protections in a wide variety of settings.Capozzi, Irene Y., The Civil Rights Act: background, statutes and primer, Nova Publishers, 2006, , page 6 The 1991 provision created recourse for victims of such discrimination for punitive damages and full back pay. In addition to individual civil recourse, the United States possesses anti-discrimination government enforcement bodies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Beginning in 1965, the United States also began a program of affirmative action that not only obliges employers not to discriminate, but requires them to provide preferences for groups protected under the Civil Rights Act to increase their numbers where they are judged to be underrepresented. Such affirmative action programs are also applied in college admissions. The United States also prohibits the imposition of any \\"... voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure ... to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color,\\" which prevents the use of grandfather clauses, literacy tests, poll taxes and white primaries. Abolitionist Anthony Benezet and others formed the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. This image was used as a symbol for their cause.Benezet also stated that \\"Liberty is the right of every human creature, as soon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of the right which he derives from the law of nature.\\" Grimm, Robert T., Anthony Benezet (1716‚Äì1784), Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , pages 26-28 Prior to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, slavery was legal in some states of the United States until 1865.Vorenberg, Michael, Final Freedom: The Civil War, the Abolition of Slavery, and the Thirteenth Amendment, Cambridge University Press, 2001, page 1 Influenced by the principles of the Religious Society of Friends, Anthony Benezet formed the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1775, believing that all ethnic groups were considered equal and human slavery was incompatible with Christian beliefs. Benezet extended the recognition of human rights to Native Americans and argued for a peaceful solution to the violence between Native and European Americans. Benjamin Franklin became the president of Benezet's abolition society in the late 18th century. In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted to permit what was termed Separate but equal treatment of minorities until the United States Supreme Court overturned this interpretation in 1954, which consequently overturned Jim Crow laws.Brown v. Board of Education, 98 F. Supp. 797 (August 3, 1951). Native Americans did not have citizenship rights until the Dawes Act of 1887 and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. Following the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama was sworn in as the first African-American president of the United States on January 20, 2009. In his Inaugural Address, President Obama stated \\"A man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath ... So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled\\". =Gender= U.S. women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote, February 1913 The Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the states and the federal government from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's sex.Nineteenth Amendment, CRS/LII Annotated Constitution While this does not necessarily guarantee all women the right to vote, as suffrage qualifications are determined by individual states, it does mean that states' suffrage qualifications may not prevent women from voting due to their gender. The United States has enacted comprehensive CRA legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender in the workplace.Gould, William B., Agenda for Reform: The Future of Employment Relationships and the Law< MIT Press, 1996, , page 27 The 1991 provision created recourse for discrimination victims for punitive damages and full back pay. In addition to individual civil recourse, the United States possesses anti-discrimination government enforcement bodies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Beginning in 1965, the United States also began a program of affirmative action that not only obliges employers not to discriminate, but also requires them to provide preferences for groups protected under the CRA to increase their numbers where they are judged to be underrepresented.James W. Russell, Double standard: social policy in Europe and the United States, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006, , pages 147-150 Such affirmative action programs are also applied in college admissions. The United States has legally defined sexual harassment in the workplace.Zippel, Kathrina, Sexual Harassment and Transnational Relations: Why Those Concerned With German-American Relations Should Care, American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 2002, page 6 Because sexual harassment is therefore a Civil Rights violation, individual legal rights of those harassed in the workplace are strong in the United States.Employment Discrimination Law Under Title VII, Oxford University Press US, 2008, The Selective Service System does not require women to register for a possible military draft. Men are required to sign up for the Selective Service System however. =Disability= The United States has adopted antidiscrimination legislation for people with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).Midgley, James, and Michelle Livermore, The Handbook of Social Policy, SAGE, 2008, , page 448 The ADA reflected a dramatic shift toward the employment of persons with disabilities to enhance the labor force participation of qualified persons with disabilities and to reduce their dependence on government entitlement programs. Blanck, Peter David and David L. Braddock, The Americans with Disabilities Act and the emerging workforce: employment of people with mental retardation, AAMR, 1998, , page 3 The ADA amends the CRA and permits plaintiffs to recover punitive damages.Capozzi, Irene Y., The Civil Rights Act: background, statutes and primer, Nova Publishers, 2006, , page 60-61 The ADA has been instrumental in the evolution of disability discrimination law in the United States. Although ADA Title I was found to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has extended the protection to people with Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).Jones, Nancy Lee, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): overview, regulations and interpretations, Nova Publishers, 2003, , pages 7-13 Federal benefits such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are often administratively viewed in the United States as being primarily or near-exclusively the entitlement only of impoverished U.S. people with disabilities, and not applicable to those with disabilities who make significantly above-poverty level income. This is proven in practice by the general fact that in the U.S., a disabled person on SSI without significant employment income who is suddenly employed, with a salary or wage at or above the living wage threshold, often discovers that government benefits they were previously entitled to have ceased, because supposedly the new job \\"invalidates\\" the need for this assistance. However, the Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (the ABLE Act) amended Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts (ABLE accounts) for qualified expenses, and with these accounts (each person may have only one account) people with disabilities who have a condition that occurred before age 26 can save up to $100,000 without risking eligibility for Social Security and other government programs. They can also keep their Medicaid coverage no matter how much money they accrue in their ABLE account. Under current gift-tax limitations as of 2014, as much as $14,000 could be deposited annually. However, each state must put regulations in place so that financial institutions can make the ABLE accounts available, and there is no guarantee a particular state will do so. SSI benefits also require frequent reviews to \\"prove\\" the person is still disabled, and require the disabled person to be diligent about returning paperwork and reporting any income they make, raising concerns that it is unfair to people with disabilities, especially those with mental disabilities who are often unaware of how to navigate the complex bureaucracy needed to not lose their benefits, a situation not dissimilar to probation. The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world to have this particular approach to disability assistance programming. These factors make it so that disabled people are in some senses second class citizens. =LGBTQ= United States Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson laying flowers at a makeshift memorial outside of the Pulse nightclub on the third month anniversary of the Orlando nightclub shooting on September 12, 2016 The United States federal government voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favor of A/RES/57/214, A/RES/59/197, abstained A/RES/61/173, A/RES/63/182 A/RES/65/208, A/RES/67/168, and in favor of A/RES/69/182. The United States federal government also voted in favor of the United Nations Human Rights Council A/HRC/RES/17/19. The United States federal government signed the United Nations 2006 and 2008 Joint Statements. The United States federal government voted in the United Nations Security Council in favor of SC/12399. =Intersex= Intersex people in the United States have significant gaps in protections for physical integrity and bodily autonomy, particularly in protection from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and violence, and protection from discrimination. Actions by intersex civil society organizations aim to eliminate harmful practices, promote social acceptance, and equality. In recent years, intersex activists have also secured some forms of legal recognition. =Privacy= Privacy is not explicitly stated in the United States Constitution. In the Griswold v. Connecticut case, the Supreme Court ruled that it is implied in the Constitution. In the Roe v. Wade case, the Supreme Court used privacy rights to overturn most laws against abortion in the United States. In the Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health case, the Supreme Court held that the patient had a right of privacy to terminate medical treatment. In Gonzales v. Oregon, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Controlled Substances Act can not prohibit physician-assisted suicide allowed by the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of criminalizing oral and anal sex in the Bowers v. Hardwick decision; however, it overturned the decision in the Lawrence v. Texas case and established the protection to sexual privacy. =Accused= The United States maintains a presumption of innocence in legal procedures. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with the rights of criminal suspects. Later the protection was extended to civil cases as wellMcCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U.S. 34 (1924) In the Gideon v. Wainwright case, the Supreme Court requires that indigent criminal defendants who are unable to afford their own attorney be provided counsel at trial. Since the Miranda v. Arizona case, the United States requires police departments to inform arrested persons of their rights, which is later called Miranda warning and typically begins with \\"You have the right to remain silent.\\" Freedoms=Freedom of religion= The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the establishment of a national religion by Congress or the preference of one religion over another. The clause was used to limit school praying, beginning with Engel v. Vitale, which ruled government-led prayer unconstitutional. Wallace v. Jaffree banned moments of silence allocated for praying. The Supreme Court also ruled clergy- led prayer at public high school graduations unconstitutional with Lee v. Weisman. The free exercise clause guarantees the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court's Lemon v. Kurtzman decision established the \\"Lemon test\\" exception, which details the requirements for legislation concerning religion. In the Employment Division v. Smith decision, the Supreme Court maintained a \\"neutral law of general applicability\\" can be used to limit religion exercises. In the City of Boerne v. Flores decision, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was struck down as exceeding congressional power; however, the decision's effect is limited by the Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal decision, which requires states to express compelling interest in prohibiting illegal drug use in religious practices. =Freedom of expression= The Four Freedoms are derived from the 1941 State of the Union Address by United States President Franklin Roosevelt delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. The theme was incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations and appears in the preamble of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. The United States is a constitutional republic based on founding documents that restrict the power of government and preserve the liberty of the people. The freedom of expression (including speech, media, and public assembly) is an important right and is given special protection, as declared by the First Amendment of the constitution. According to Supreme Court precedent, the federal and lower governments may not apply prior restraint to expression, with certain exceptions, such as national security and obscenity. Legal limits on expression include: *Solicitation, fraud, specific threats of violence, or disclosure of classified information *Advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government through speech or publication, or organizing political parties that advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government (the Smith Act) *Civil offenses involving defamation, fraud, or workplace harassment *Copyright violations *Federal Communications Commission rules governing the use of broadcast media *Crimes involving sexual obscenity in pornography and text-only erotic stories. *Ordinances requiring mass demonstrations on public property to register in advance. *The use of free speech zones and protest free zones. *Military censorship of blogs written by military personnel claiming some include sensitive information ineligible for release. Some critics view military officials as trying to suppress dissent from troops in the field. The US Constitution specifically limits the human rights of active duty members, and this constitutional authority is used to limit speech rights by members in this and in other ways. Some laws remain controversial due to concerns that they infringe on freedom of expression. These include the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. In two high-profile cases, grand juries have decided that Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper and New York Times reporter Judith Miller must reveal their sources in cases involving CIA leaks. Time magazine exhausted its legal appeals, and Mr. Cooper eventually agreed to testify. Miller was jailed for 85 days before cooperating. U.S. District Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that the First Amendment does not insulate Time magazine reporters from a requirement to testify before a criminal grand jury that's conducting the investigation into the possible illegal disclosure of classified information. Approximately 30,000 government employees and contractors are currently employed to monitor telephone calls and other communications. In November 2013, leaked documents revealed that the government and some large corporations had censored many blogs and news articles using existing surveillance programs. Right to peaceably assemble Although Americans enjoy the freedom to peacefully protest, protesters are arrested, beaten, mistreated, jailed or fired upon which resulted in lawsuits or criminal prosecutions. Protesters have also been arrested for protesting outside of designated \\"free speech zones\\". At the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, over 1,700 protesters were arrested. On May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on protesting students at Kent State University, killing four students. Investigators determined that 28 Guardsmen fired 61 to 67 shots. The Justice Department concluded that the Guardsmen were not in danger and that their claim that they fired in self-defense was untrue. The nearest student was almost 100 yards away at the time of the shooting. Guards involved in the shooting were indicted. Eight of the guardsmen were indicted by a grand jury. The guardsmen claimed to have fired in self-defense, a claim that was generally accepted by the criminal justice system. In 1974 U.S. District Judge Frank Battisti dismissed charges against all eight on the basis that the prosecution's case was too weak to warrant a trial. Civil actions were also attempted against the guardsmen, the State of Ohio, and the president of Kent State. The federal court civil action for wrongful death and injury, brought by the victims and their families against Governor Rhodes, the President of Kent State, and the National Guardsmen, resulted in unanimous verdicts for all defendants on all claims after an eleven-week trial. The judgment on those verdicts was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the ground that the federal trial judge had mishandled an out-of-court threat against a juror. On remand, the civil case was settled in return for payment of a total of $675,000 to all plaintiffs by the State of OhioNeil, Martha, \\"Joseph Kelner, attorney who sued sitting Ohio governor over Kent State slayings, is dead at 98\\", ABAJournal, March 8, 2013. Retrieved 2013-03-09. On July 24, 2020, the United Nations human rights office urged U.S. security forces to limit their use of force against peaceful protesters and journalists, as clashes between federal agents and demonstrators continue in Portland, Ore. =Freedom of movement= As per ¬ß 707(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979,, United States passports are required to enter and exit the country, and as per the Passport Act of 1926 and Haig v. Agee, the Presidential administration may deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons at any time. Perhaps the most notable example of enforcement of this ability was the 1948 denial of a passport to U.S. Representative Leo Isacson, who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece, a Communist front organization, because of the group's role in opposing the Greek government in the Greek Civil War.Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), at 302 The United States prevents U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba, citing national security reasons, as part of an embargo against Cuba that has been condemned as an illegal act by the United Nations General Assembly. The current exception to the ban on travel to the island, permitted since April 2009, has been an easing of travel restrictions for Cuban-Americans visiting their relatives. Restrictions continue to remain in place for the rest of the American populace.Padgett, Tim. \\"Will Obama Open Up All U.S. Travel to Cuba?\\" Time Magazine. April 14, 2009. Retrieved April 14, 2009. On June 30, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of ten people who are either U.S. citizens or legal residents of the U.S., challenging the constitutionality of the government's \\"no-fly\\" list. The plaintiffs have not been told why they are on the list. Five of the plaintiffs have been stranded abroad. It is estimated that the \\"no-fly\\" list contained about 8,000 names at the time of the lawsuit. The Secretary of State can deny a passport to anyone imprisoned, on parole, or on supervised release for a conviction for international drug trafficking or sex tourism, or to anyone who is behind on their child support payments. The following case precedents are typically incorrectly cited in defense of unencumbered travel within the United States: \\"The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common fundamental right of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived.\\" Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 337 Ill. 200; 169 N.E. 22 (1929). \\"The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a common law right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" Thompson v. Smith, Supreme Court of Virginia, 155 Va. 367; 154 S.E. 579; (1930). \\"Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to move from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the 14th amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution.\\" Schactman v. Dulles, 225 F.2d 938; 96 U.S. App. D.C. 287 (1955). \\"The right to travel is a well-established common right that does not owe its existence to the federal government. It is recognized by the courts as a natural right.\\" Schactman v. Dulles 225 F.2d 938; 96 U.S. App. D.C. 287 (1955) at 941. \\"The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\\" Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116, 125 (1958). Federal courts have ruled that a person does not have the right to drive an automobile, it is a privilege. =Freedom of association= Freedom of association is the right of individuals to come together in groups for political action or to pursue common interests. Freedom of association in the U.S. is restricted by the Smith Act, which bans political parties that advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government. Between 1956 and 1971, the FBI attempted to \\"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize\\" left-wing and indigenous groups through the COINTELPRO program. In 2008, the Maryland State Police admitted that they had added the names of Iraq War protesters and death penalty opponents to a terrorist database. They also admitted that other \\"protest groups\\" were added to the terrorist database, but did not specify which groups. It was also discovered that undercover troopers used aliases to infiltrate organizational meetings, rallies and group e-mail lists. Police admitted there was \\"no evidence whatsoever of any involvement in violent crime\\" by those classified as terrorists. =Right of revolution= The right of revolution is the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests, and is a traditional assumption in American political thought. The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the American revolutionaries in the run up to the American Revolution. The political tract Common Sense used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the British Empire, as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the Declaration of Independence of the United States, when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King George III. As the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were \\"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\" and could alter or abolish government \\"destructive\\" of those rights. =National security exceptions= The United States government has declared martial law, suspended (or claimed exceptions to) some rights on national security grounds, typically in wartime and conflicts such as the United States Civil War,Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies. Clinton Rossiter. 2002. Page X. Cold War or the War against Terror. 70,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were legally interned during World War II under Executive Order 9066. In some instances the federal courts have allowed these exceptions, while in others the courts have decided that the national security interest was insufficient. Presidents Lincoln, Wilson, and F.D. Roosevelt ignored such judicial decisions. Historical restrictions Sedition laws have sometimes placed restrictions on freedom of expression. The Alien and Sedition Acts, passed by President John Adams during an undeclared naval conflict with France, allowed the government to punish \\"false\\" statements about the government and to deport \\"dangerous\\" immigrants. The Federalist Party used these acts to harass many supporters of the Democratic-Republican Party. While Woodrow Wilson was president, broad legislation called the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 were passed during World War I. Thousands were jailed for violations of these laws, which prohibited criticizing conscription and the government, or sending literature through the US Mail doing the same. Most prominently it led to the conviction of Socialist Party of America Presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs for speaking out against US participation in World War I and conscription. Debs received ten years in prison, and ran for president a third time while in prison (on December 25, 1921, his sentence was commuted by President Warren G. Harding, releasing Debs early). Numerous conscientious objectors to conscription were also jailed, with a few dying due to mistreatment. In the post-war Palmer Raids, foreign-born dissidents were arrested in the thousands without legal warrants, and deported for their political beliefs. Presidents have claimed the power to imprison summarily, under military jurisdiction, those suspected of being combatants for states or groups at war against the United States. Abraham Lincoln invoked this power in the American Civil War to imprison Maryland secessionists. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that only Congress could suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and the government released the detainees. During World War II, the United States interned thousands of Japanese-Americans on alleged fears that Japan might use them as saboteurs-the US Supreme Court upheld this policy. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids unreasonable search and seizure without a warrant, but some administrations have claimed exceptions to this rule to investigate alleged conspiracies against the government. During the Cold War, the Federal Bureau of Investigation established COINTELPRO to infiltrate and disrupt left- wing organizations, including those that supported the rights of black Americans. National security, as well as other concerns like unemployment, has sometimes led the United States to toughen its generally liberal immigration policy. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 all but banned Chinese immigrants, who were accused of crowding out American workers. Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative The federal government has set up a data collection and storage network that keeps a wide variety of data on tens of thousands of Americans who have not been accused of committing a crime. Operated primarily under the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the program is known as the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative or SAR. Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement or by private citizens are forwarded to the program, and profiles are constructed of the persons under suspicion.

Labor rights in the United States have been linked to basic constitutional rights.NWI Right to Organize Comporting with the notion of creating an economy based upon highly skilled and high wage labor employed in a capital-intensive dynamic growth economy, the United States enacted laws mandating the right to a safe workplace, workers compensation, Unemployment insurance, fair labor standards, collective bargaining rights, Social Security, prohibiting child labor and guaranteeing a minimum wage. During the 19th and 20th centuries, safer conditions and workers' rights were gradually mandated by law, but this trend has reversed to some extent towards pro- business policies since the 1980s.A Curriculum of United States Labor History for Teachers In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act recognized and protected \\"the rights of most workers in the private sector to organize labor unions, to engage in collective bargaining, and to take part in strikes and other forms of concerted activity in support of their demands.\\" However, many states hold to the principle of at-will employment, which says an employee can be fired for any or no reason, without warning and without recourse, unless violation of State or Federal civil rights laws can be proven. In 2011, 11.8% of U.S. workers were members of labor unions with 37% of public sector (government) workers in unions while only 6.9% of private sector workers were union members. , U.S. workers worked longer hours on average than any other industrialized country, having surpassed Japan. Info published in 2007 showed U.S. workers rank high in terms of production. , the United States' maternity leave policy is distinct from other industrialized countries for its relative scarcity of benefits. The length of protected maternity leave ranks 20th out of the 21 high-income countries. Moreover, most foreign wealthy nations provide some form of wage compensation for the leave of absence; the United States is the only one of these 21 countries that does not offer such paid leave. In 2014, the United States received a poor grade of \\"4\\" on the ITUC's Global Rights Index, which ranks the worst places in the world for workers' rights, with \\"1\\" being the best and \\"5\\" the worst.Ishaan Tharoor (May 20, 2014).

In 2015, the United States and Papua New Guinea were reported to be the only countries in the world that did not guarantee paid maternal leave by law. Health care The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, states that \\"everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one's family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care.\\" In addition, the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association require medical doctors to respect the human rights of the patient, including that of providing medical treatment when it is needed. Americans' rights in health care are regulated by the US Patients' Bill of Rights. Unlike most other industrialized nations, the United States does not offer most of its citizens subsidized health care. The United States Medicaid program provides subsidized coverage to some categories of individuals and families with low incomes and resources, including children, pregnant women, and very low-income people with disabilities (higher-earning people with disabilities do not qualify for Medicaid, although they do qualify for Medicare). However, according to Medicaid's own documents, \\"the Medicaid program does not provide health care services, even for very poor people, unless they are in one of the designated eligibility groups.\\" Nonetheless, some states offer subsidized health insurance to broader populations. Coverage is subsidized for persons age 65 and over, or who meet other special criteria through Medicare. Every person with a permanent disability, both young and old, is inherently entitled to Medicare health benefits ‚Äî a fact not all disabled US citizens are aware of. However, just like every other Medicare recipient, a disabled person finds that his or her Medicare benefits only cover up to 80% of what the insurer considers reasonable charges in the U.S. medical system, and that the other 20% plus the difference in the reasonable amount and the actual charge must be paid by other means (typically supplemental, privately held insurance plans, or cash out of the person's own pocket). Therefore, even the Medicare program is not truly national health insurance or universal health care the way most of the rest of the industrialized world understands it. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986, an unfunded mandate, mandates that no person may ever be denied emergency services regardless of ability to pay, citizenship, or immigration status. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act has been criticized by the American College of Emergency Physicians as an unfunded mandate.American College of Emergency Physicians Fact Sheet: EMTALA . Retrieved November 1, 2007. 46.6 million residents, or 15.9 percent, were without health insurance coverage in 2005. This number includes about 10 million non-citizens, millions more who are eligible for Medicaid but never applied, and 18 million with annual household incomes above $50,000. According to a study led by the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, uninsured children who are hospitalized are 60% more likely to die than children who are covered by health insurance. Justice system The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth amendments to the United States Constitution (each part of what is known as the Bill of Rights), as well as the Fourteenth amendment, ensure that criminal defendants have significant procedural rights. The Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation of due process rights adds these constitutional protections to the state and local levels of law enforcement. The United States also possesses a system of judicial review over government action.Lieberman, Jethro Koller, A practical companion to the Constitution: how the Supreme Court has ruled on issues from abortion to zoning, University of California Press, 1999, , page 6 =Punishment=Death penalty Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 28 states, the federal government, and the military. , there have been 1,517 executions in the United States since 1976 (when the death penalty was reinstated after it had been effectively invalidated as a punishment by a 1972 Supreme Court ruling). The United States is one of 55 countries worldwide that uses the death penalty, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution. Among the 56 countries categorized as 'Very high' on the Human Development Index, it is one of only 12 that retain the death penalty (the others being Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Belarus, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, and Taiwan). Among the world's most economically and politically powerful countries, it is one of the few who utilize capital punishment. In 2011, for instance, it was the only country in the G8 that carried out executions, and was among only three countries in the G20 (along with China and Saudi Arabia) that carried out executions. Of the 56 members states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United States and Belarus were the only two that carried out executions in 2011.Death sentences and executions in 2011 Amnesty International March 2012 The vast majority of executions are carried out by state governments, largely as a result of the political structure of the United States, which is a federal republic in which most crimes are prosecuted by state governments rather than the federal government. Capital punishment is heavily concentrated among several states, with Texas overwhelmingly leading in number of executions at 569 between 1976 and 2020, followed by Virginia with 113 executions, and Oklahoma with 112. The disparity is particularly stark when broken down by county: since 1976, only 2% of counties have been responsible for more than half of all executions. As of January 25, 2008, the death penalty has been abolished in the District of Columbia and fourteen states, mainly in the Northeast and Midwest. The death penalty has a complex legal history. While modern critics have challenged capital punishment on grounds that it violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on the use of \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\", the United States Supreme Court has held that it does not. At the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, societal moral standards did not hold the death penalty was \\"cruel and unusual\\", so it was used throughout early American history. However, the death penalty was temporarily halted by the Supreme Court on eight amendment grounds from 1972 to 1976. In 1958, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Trop v. Dulles that the eight amendment \\"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency\\". This opened the way to the 1972 US Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia , which found that the imposition of the death penalty at the states' discretion constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, with the Court stating that the death penalty had been applied in a \\"harsh, freakish, and arbitrary\\" manner. This ruling was preceded by the Supreme Court of California's ruling in California v. Anderson 64 Cal.2d 633, 414 P.2d 366 (Cal. 1972), which classified capital punishment as cruel and unusual and outlawed the use of capital punishment in California (however, this was reversed the same year through a ballot initiative, Proposition 17). However, the death penalty was ultimately reinstated nationally in 1976 after the US Supreme Court rulings Gregg v. Georgia, , Jurek v. Texas, , and Proffitt v. Florida, . Further refinements have been made to death penalty since then, with a ruling on March 1, 2005, by the Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons prohibiting the execution of people who committed their crimes when they were under the age of 18 (between 1990 and 2005, Amnesty International recorded 19 executions in the United States for crime committed by a juvenile). Furthermore, it has been argued that the United States may be in violation of international law in its use of the death penalty. In 1998, the UN special rapporteur recommended to a committee of the UN General Assembly that the United States be found to be in violation of Article 6 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in regards to the death penalty, and called for an immediate capital punishment moratorium. The recommendation of the special rapporteur, however, is not legally binding under international law and in this case the UN did not act upon the lawyer's recommendation. Capital punishment is controversial. Death penalty opponents consider it \\"inhumane\\", criticize it for its irreversibility, and assert that it is ineffective as a deterrent against crime, pointing to several studies which show it has little deterring effect on crime (though this point is controversial as studies have conflicted in their conclusions on the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrant). Human rights organizations have been particularly critical of it, with Amnesty International, for example, stating that \\"the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights.\\" Notably, the European Union, in accordance with its official policy of attempting to achieve global abolition of the death penalty, has been vocal in its criticism of the death penalty in the US and has submitted amicus curiae briefs in a number of important US court cases related to capital punishment. The American Bar Association also sponsors a project aimed at abolishing the death penalty in the United States, criticizing the US's execution of minors and the mentally disabled and arguing that the US fails to adequately protect the rights of the innocent. Some opponents criticize the over-representation of blacks on death row as evidence of the unequal racial application of the death penalty. This over- representation is not limited to capital offenses‚Äîin 1992, at a time when blacks account for 12% of the US population, about 34% of prison inmates were from this group. The extent of racism in this is, however, disputed‚Äîblack people also commit crimes at a rate disproportionate to their representation in the population and over half of homicides where the race of the offender is known were perpetuated by black people. In McCleskey v. Kemp, it was alleged the capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2003, Amnesty International reported those who kill whites are more likely to be executed than those who kill blacks, citing that of the 845 people executed since 1977 80 percent were put to death for killing whites and 13 percent were executed for killing blacks, even though blacks and whites are murdered in almost equal numbers. Solitary confinement The United Nations estimates there are about 80,000 prisoners in solitary confinement in the U.S., 12,000 of whom are in California. The use of solitary confinement has drawn criticism and is increasingly viewed as a form of torture because of the psychological harm it causes. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. M√©ndez, has requested that the United States stop holding prisoners in solitary confinement, as \\"it often causes mental and physical suffering or humiliation, amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if the resulting pain or sufferings are severe, solitary confinement even amounts to torture.\\" In a severe example, Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox, two prisoners at the Angola prison in Louisiana, have each spent more than 40 years in solitary confinement. Sex offender registries Human Rights Watch has twice said that there are human right issues created by the current sex offender registry laws, and that they believe that what they call the burden of being publicly listed as a sex offender, combined with what they call \\"onerous restrictions placed on former offenders and their family members\\" are serious human rights issues. They have criticized what they call over-breadth of the registration requirement which tends to treat all offenders the same regardless of the nature of the offense and without accounting the risk of future re-offending, and the application of such laws to juvenile offenders, consensual teenage sex, prostitution and exposing one self as prank. ACLU and reformist group RSOL have joined the critique saying that measures against sex offenders go too far and that current legislation is breaking constitutional rights of former offenders. Both organizations have been successfully challenging current laws in courts. By way of comparison, European Court of Human Rights has found that indefinite placement to United Kingdom sex offender registry, which is not made available to general public, is incompatible with offenders right to privacy if the person has no right of review. Several other countries have followed examples set by the US in creating and publishing sex offender registries with similar policies, most notably the United Kingdom and Australia. Those two countries have also been criticized for these actions. =Prison system= International and domestic human rights groups, civil rights organizations, and social critics have criticized The United States for violating fundamental human rights through the use of disproportionately heavy penalties compared to many other countries, overly long prison sentences, over-reliance on police control, excessive control of individual behavior, and societal control of disadvantaged groups through a harsh police and criminal justice system.Amnesty International, Human Rights in United States of America, Amnesty International Human Rights Watch, for instance, has argued that \\"the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities, and saps the strength of the nation as a whole.\\" The United States has been criticized for its large prison population, with more than 2.2 million people in prisons or jails. It has the world's highest incarceration rate, imprisoning roughly 1 out of every 136 Americans (737 per 100,000 people) and disproportionately imprisoning racial minorities and those from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds.\\"One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections\\" , Pew Research Center, released March 2, 2009 In particular, The United States has been criticized for incarcerating a large number of non-violent and victim-less offenders. Half of all persons incarcerated under State jurisdiction were convicted of non-violent offenses and 20 percent for drug offenses, mostly the possession of cannabis. Marijuana legalization and decriminalization is seen as a step of progress in decreasing the prison population. Other non-violent offenses which carry extremely long prison sentences in the United States include fraud and other acts of corruption, offenses relating to child pornography, and contempt of court. The United States also has a high rate of youth imprisonment, with many held in the same prisons as adults. According to The National Council on Crime and Delinquency, since 1990 the incarceration of youth in adult jails has increased 208%.[The Consequences Aren't Minor, The Impact of Trying Youth as Adults and Strategies for Reform - A Campaign for Youth Justice Report March 2007 pg 7.] They found that juveniles were often incarcerated awaiting trial for up to two years, subjected to the same treatment as adult inmates, and were at greater risk of assault, abuse, or death. The length of prison sentences in the United States is widely criticized in other countries and is believed to be the biggest contributor to the country's large prison population. The length of the average prison sentences in the United States tends to exceed those in other developed countries. The United States is currently the country with the most life sentences, most of which are life without parole (LWOP). Mandatory minimum sentences and three-strikes laws are probably the largest contributors to the country's frequency of life imprisonment. It is estimated that 35% of federal US prisoners are older than age 60, many of whom were younger than 30 at the time of sentencing. The US also has a large number of foreign nationals in US prisons, with 21% of all federal inmates in 2017 being non-citizens or non-nationals. Additionally, the US Justice Department rarely approves extraditions of foreign prisoners to their home countries, and most are deported after serving their sentences rather than before their trials. This is seen as a huge contributor to prison overcrowding, especially in California, Arizona, and Texas. This goes hand-in- hand with the US immigration policies, which have also been criticized by human rights groups. Tolerance of serious sexual abuse and rape in United States prisons is also an area of concern to human rights watchers. Human Rights Watch, for instance, raised concerns with prisoner rape and medical care for inmates. In a survey of 1,788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by Prison Journal, about 21% claimed they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity during their incarceration and 7% claimed that they had been raped in their current facility. The United States has also been widely criticized for its attitude towards parole and incarceration alternatives. There is no parole in the federal prison system, which has drawn international outrage from human rights groups and is believed to be a major contributor to prison overcrowding. In addition, 16 states have no parole in their prison systems. Parole is rarely granted where it is allowed, and the United States is the only country that currently has juveniles serving life sentences without parole. The United States has also been heavily criticized for having few or no alternatives to incarceration. Probation, fines, and community service are extremely rarely issued instead of prison time. =Police brutality= In a 1999 report, Amnesty International said it had \\"documented patterns of ill-treatment across the U.S., including police beatings, unjustified shootings and the use of dangerous restraint techniques.\\" According to a 1998 Human Rights Watch report, incidents of police use of excessive force had occurred in cities throughout the U.S., and this behavior goes largely unchecked. An article in USA Today reports that in 2006, 96% of cases referred to the U.S. Justice Department for prosecution by investigative agencies were declined. In 2005, 98% were declined. In 2001, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government is unable or unwilling to collect statistics showing the precise number of people killed by the police or the prevalence of the use of excessive force. Since 1999, at least 148 people have died in the United States and Canada after being shocked with Tasers by police officers, according to a 2005 ACLU report. In one case, a handcuffed suspect was tasered nine times by a police officer before dying, and six of those taserings occurred within less than three minutes. The officer was fired and faced the possibility of criminal charges. On June 2, 2020, George Floyd's official post-mortem report declared the cause of death as asphyxia (lack of oxygen) due to a compression on his neck and back. It also found that the death was a homicide, a statement from the family's legal team said. On June 23, 2020, a report from the University of Chicago Law School claimed that law enforcement policies in the police departments of 20 largest cities in the United States failed to meet even basic standards under international human rights guidelines. The law enforcement forces are authorized to commit ‚Äòstate- sanctioned violence‚Äô without significant reform. The use of strip searches and cavity searches by law enforcement agencies and in the prison system has raised human rights concerns. The practice of taking an arrested person on a perp walk, often handcuffed, through a public place at some point after the arrest, creating an opportunity for the media to take photographs and video of the event has raised civil and human rights concerns. =Racial discrimination= Human rights organizations, civil rights groups, academics, journalists, and other critics have argued that the US justice system exhibits racial biases that harm minority groups, particularly African Americans. There are significant racial disparities among the United States prison population, with black individuals making up 38.2% of the federal prison population in 2020 despite accounting for only 13.4% of the total population. Studies have also found that black people, as well as other minority groups, are shot and killed by the police at higher rates than white people, tend to receive harsher punishments than white people, are more likely to be charged for drug crimes despite consuming drugs at similar rates as white people, are (along with Native American/Alaska Native men and women, and Latino men) at higher lifetime risk of being killed by police than white people, are more likely to be stopped by police while driving, and are more likely to be arrested during a police stop. As the Sentencing Project said in their report to the United Nations: > African Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested; once > arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once convicted, they are > more likely to experience lengthy prison sentences. The cause of this is disputed. There is a widespread belief among the American public that racial discrimination by the police is a persistent problem, and many academics and journalists assert that systemic racism, as well as a number of factors like concentrated poverty and higher rates of substandard housing (which has also led to greater rates of lead poisoning among African Americans) that they argue arise out of past racial segregation or other forms of historical oppression, contribute to the racial disparities. Some‚Äîparticularly conservative political commentators‚Äîhowever, allege that the disparities arise primarily out of greater rates of criminal activity among black people, and point to studies that have found little evidence that anti- black racism causes disparities in altercations with the police. =Procedural concerns= There have been a number of criticisms over certain legal procedures. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Human Rights Watch have, for instance, argued that there exists a \\"trial penalty\\"‚Äîa penalty for electing to go to trial that arises from the significant discrepancy between the punishment a defendant would receive by waiving the right to trial and accepting a plea bargain and the punishment they might receive at trial‚Äîwhich they argue abridges the right to trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. There has also been significant criticism over the qualified immunity legal doctrine, which grants government officials‚Äîincluding police officers‚Äîsignificant immunity from civil suits. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Critics have argued that qualified immunity makes it excessively difficult to sue public officials for misconduct, including civil rights violations, which they further argue enables police brutality. With regards to the procedures of police departments, there has been criticism over hiring practices. Despite safeguards in place around recruitment, some police departments have hired officers who may have histories of poor performance or misconduct in other departments, an issue known as hiring \\"gypsy cops\\". Inhumane treatment and torture of captured non-U.S. citizens The US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation. International and U.S. law prohibits torture and other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of any person in custody in all circumstances, especially in a state of armed conflict. However, the United States Government has categorized a large number of people as unlawful combatants, a classification which denies the privileges of prisoner of war (POW) designation of the Geneva Conventions.ICRC official statement: The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism , January 1, 2011 Certain practices of the United States military and Central Intelligence Agency have been widely condemned domestically and internationally as torture. A fierce debate regarding non-standard interrogation techniques\\"Non-standard interrogation techniques\\" are alleged to have at times included: Extended forced maintenance of \\"stress positions\\" such as standing or squatting; psychological tricks and \\"mind games\\"; sensory deprivation; exposure to loud music and noises; extended exposure to flashing lights; prolonged solitary confinement; denigration of religion; withholding of food, drink, or medical care; withholding of hygienic care or toilet facilities; prolonged hooding; forced injections of unknown substances; sleep deprivation; magneto-cranial stimulation resulting in mental confusion; threats of bodily harm; threats of rendition to torture-friendly states or Guant√°namo; threats of rape or sodomy; threats of harm to family members; threats of imminent execution; prolonged constraint in contorted positions (including strappado, or \\"Palestinian hanging\\"); facial smearing of real or simulated feces, urine, menstrual blood, or semen; sexual humiliation; beatings, often requiring surgery or resulting in permanent physical or mental disability; release or threat of release to attack dogs, both muzzled or un-muzzled; near-suffocation or asphyxiation via multiple detainment hoods, plastic bags, water-soaked towels or blankets, duct tape, or ligatures; gassing and chemical spraying resulting in unconsciousness; confinement in small chambers too small to fully stand or recline; underwater immersion just short of drowning (i.e. dunking); and extended exposure to extreme temperatures below freezing or above 120 ¬∞F (48 ¬∞C). exists within the U.S. civilian and military intelligence community, with no general consensus as to what practices under what conditions are acceptable. Abuse of prisoners is considered a crime in the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice. According to a January 2006 Human Rights First report, there were 45 suspected or confirmed homicides while in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan; \\"Certainly 8, as many as 12, people were tortured to death.\\" =Abu Ghraib prison abuse= Detainee handcuffed in the nude to a bed with a pair of panties covering his face. In 2004, photos showing humiliation and abuse of prisoners were leaked from Abu Ghraib prison, causing a political and media scandal in the US. Forced humiliation of the detainees included, but was not limited to: forced nudity; rape; human piling of nude detainees; masturbation; eating food out of toilets; crawling on hands and knees while American soldiers sat on their backs, sometimes requiring them to bark like dogs; and hooking up electrical wires to fingers, toes, and penises. Bertrand Ramcharan, the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that while the removal of Saddam Hussein represented \\"a major contribution to human rights in Iraq\\" and that the United States had condemned the conduct at Abu Ghraib and pledged to bring violators to justice, \\"willful killing, torture and inhuman treatment\\" represented a grave breach of international law and \\"might be designated as war crimes by a competent tribunal\\". In addition to the acts of humiliation, there were more violent claims, such as American soldiers sodomizing detainees (including an event involving an underage boy), an incident in which a phosphoric light was broken and the chemicals poured on a detainee, repeated beatings, and threats of death. Six military personnel were charged with prisoner abuse in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. The harshest sentence was handed out to Charles Graner, who received a 10-year sentence to be served in a military prison and a demotion to private; the other offenders received lesser sentences. In their report The Road to Abu Ghraib, Human Rights Watch states: > The [Bush] administration effectively sought to re-write the Geneva > Conventions of 1949 to eviscerate many of their most important protections. > These include the rights of all detainees in an armed conflict to be free > from humiliating and degrading treatment, as well as from torture and other > forms of coercive interrogation...[M]ethods included holding detainees in > painful stress positions, depriving them of sleep and light for prolonged > periods, exposing them to extremes of heat, cold, noise and light, hooding, > and depriving them of all clothing...Concern for the basic rights of persons > taken into custody in Afghanistan and Iraq did not factor into the Bush > administration's agenda. The administration largely dismissed expressions of > concern for their treatment, from both within the government and without. =Enhanced interrogation and waterboarding= On February 6, 2008, the CIA director General Michael Hayden stated that the CIA had used waterboarding on three prisoners during 2002 and 2003, namely Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Abu Zubayda and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The June 21, 2004, issue of Newsweek stated that the Bybee memo, a 2002 legal memorandum drafted by former OLC lawyer John Yoo that described what sort of interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the Bush administration would consider legal, was \\"... prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive, Abu Zubaydah, who had turned uncooperative ... and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W. Bush's chief counsel, Alberto Gonzales, along with Defense Department general counsel William Haynes and David Addington, Vice President Dick Cheney's counsel, who discussed specific interrogation techniques,\\" citing \\"a source familiar with the discussions.\\" Amongst the methods they found acceptable was waterboarding. In November 2005, ABC News reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding, along with five other \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\", against suspected members of al Qaeda. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, stated on the subject of waterboarding \\"I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture,\\" and that violators of the UN Convention Against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction. Bent S√∏rensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture has said: > It's a clear-cut case: Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled > as torture. It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to > the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) defines an act of > torture. First, when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion, in > addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme > fear of death.

Bush be prosecuted. Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, concurred by stating, in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, that he believes waterboarding violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.Violating international law Army Official: Yes, Waterboarding Breaks International Law By Paul Kiel, Talking Points Memo, February 27, 2008 The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and United Nations War Crimes Commission both defined waterboarding as ill-treatment and torture in the aftermath of World War II.CBS News \\"McCain: Japanese Hanged For Waterboarding\\", CBS News, 29 November 2007. Retrieved 9 November 2010. The CIA director testified that waterboarding has not been used since 2003.White House defends waterboarding; CIA chief uncertain, Associated Press, February 7, 2008 In April 2009, the Obama administration released four memos in which government lawyers from the Bush administration approved tough interrogation methods used against 28 terror suspects. The rough tactics range from waterboarding (simulated drowning) to keeping suspects naked and denying them solid food. These memos were accompanied by the Justice Department's release of four Bush-era legal opinions covering (in graphic and extensive detail) the interrogation of 14 high-value terror detainees using harsh techniques beyond waterboarding. These additional techniques include keeping detainees in a painful standing position for long periods (Used often, once for 180 hours), using a plastic neck collar to slam detainees into walls, keeping the detainee's cell cold for long periods, beating and kicking the detainee, insects placed in a confinement box (the suspect had a fear of insects), sleep-deprivation, prolonged shackling, and threats to a detainee's family. One of the memos also authorized a method for combining multiple techniques. Details from the memos also included the number of times that techniques such as waterboarding were used. A footnote said that one detainee was waterboarded 83 times in one month, while another was waterboarded 183 times in a month. This may have gone beyond even what was allowed by the CIA's own directives, which limit waterboarding to 12 times a day.

The group has suggested this activity was a violation of the standards set by the Nuremberg Trials. =Guant√°namo Bay= The United States maintains a detention center at its military base at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba where enemy combatants of the war on terror are held. The detention center has been the source of various controversies regarding the legality of the center and the treatment of detainees.In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases, 355 F.Supp.2d 443 (D.D.C. 2005). Amnesty International has called the situation \\"a human rights scandal\\" in a series of reports. 775 detainees have been brought to Guant√°namo. Of these, many have been released without charge. The United States assumed territorial control over Guant√°namo Bay under the 1903 Cuban‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Relations, which granted the United States a perpetual lease of the area. United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control, maintains \\"de facto\\" sovereignty over this territory, while Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory. The current government of Cuba regards the U.S. presence in Guant√°namo as illegal and insists the Cuban-American Treaty was obtained by threat of force in violation of international law.De Zayas, Alfred. (2003.) The Status of Guant√°namo Bay and the Status of the Detainees. A delegation of UN Special Rapporteurs to Guantanamo Bay claimed that interrogation techniques used in the detention center amount to degrading treatment in violation of the ICCPR and the Convention Against Torture.ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS Situation of detainees at Guant√°namo Bay Report of the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Leila Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt In 2005, Amnesty International expressed alarm at the erosion in civil liberties since the 9/11 attacks. According to Amnesty International: > The Guant√°namo Bay detention camp has become a symbol of the United States > administration's refusal to put human rights and the rule of law at the > heart of its response to the atrocities of September 11, 2001. It has become > synonymous with the United States executive's pursuit of unfettered power, > and has become firmly associated with the systematic denial of human dignity > and resort to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that has marked the > U.S.'s detentions and interrogations in the \\"war on terror\\". Amnesty International also condemned the Guant√°namo facility as \\"... the gulag of our times,\\" which raised heated conversation in the United States. The purported legal status of \\"unlawful combatants\\" in those nations currently holding detainees under that name has been the subject of criticism by other nations and international human rights institutions including Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC, in response to the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, published a paper on the subject.The legal situation of unlawful/unprivileged combatants (IRRC March 2003 Vol.85 No 849). See Unlawful combatant. HRW cites two sergeants and a captain accusing U.S. troops of torturing prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, former Republican governor Mike Huckabee, for example, has stated that the conditions in Guant√°namo are better than most U.S. prisons. The U.S. government argues that even if detainees were entitled to POW status, they would not have the right to lawyers, access to the courts to challenge their detention, or the opportunity to be released prior to the end of hostilities‚Äîand that nothing in the Third Geneva Convention provides POWs such rights, and POWs in past wars‚Äîsuch as Japanese prisoners of war in World War II‚Äîhave generally not been given these rights. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld on June 29, 2006, that they were entitled to the minimal protections listed under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Following this, on July 7, 2006, the Department of Defense issued an internal memo stating that prisoners would in the future be entitled to protection under Common Article 3. =Extraordinary rendition= thumb300pxright Sources: Amnesty International[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL30/003/2006/en Rendition' and secret detention: A global system of human rights violations\\"], Amnesty International, January 1, 2006 Human Rights Watch In a process known as extraordinary rendition, foreign nationals have been captured and abducted outside of the United States and transferred to secret US-administered detention facilities, sometimes being held incommunicado for months or years. According to The New Yorker, \\"The most common destinations for rendered suspects are Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and Jordan, all of which have been cited for human-rights violations by the State Department, and are known to torture suspects.\\" Notable cases In November 2001, Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Konduz, Afghanistan, amongst hundreds of surrendering Taliban fighters and was transferred into U.S. custody. The U.S. government alleged that Hamdi was there fighting for the Taliban, while Hamdi, through his father, has claimed that he was merely there as a relief worker and was mistakenly captured. Hamdi was transferred into CIA custody and transferred to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, but when it was discovered that he was a U.S. citizen, he was transferred to naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia and then he was transferred brig in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bush Administration identified him as an unlawful combatant and denied him access to an attorney or the court system, despite his Fifth Amendment right to due process. In 2002 Hamdi's father filed a habeas corpus petition, the Judge ruled in Hamdi's favor and required he be allowed a public defender; however, on appeal the decision was reversed. In 2004, in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld the U.S. Supreme court reversed the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition and ruled detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge. In December 2004, Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen, was apprehended by Macedonian authorities when traveling to Skopje because his name was similar to Khalid al-Masri, an alleged mentor to the al-Qaeda Hamburg cell. After being held in a motel in Macedonia for over three weeks he was transferred to the CIA and extradited to Afghanistan. While held in Afghanistan, El-Masri claims he was sodomized, beaten, and repeatedly interrogated about alleged terrorist ties. After being in custody for five months, Condoleezza Rice learned of his detention and ordered his release. El- Masri was released at night on a desolate road in Albania, without apology or funds to return home. He was intercepted by Albanian guards, who believed he was a terrorist due to his haggard and unkept appearance. He was subsequently reunited with his wife who had returned to her family in Lebanon with their children because she thought her husband had abandoned them. Using isotope analysis, scientists at the Bavarian archive for geology in Munich analyzed his hair and verified that he was malnourished during his disappearance.Georg Mascolo, Holger Stark: The US Stands Accused of Kidnapping. SPIEGEL ONLINE, February 14, 2005 In 2007, U.S. President Bush signed an Executive order banning the use of torture in the CIA's interrogation program. According to the Human Rights Watch report (September 2012) the United States government during the U.S. President Bush republican administration \\"waterboarding\\" tortured opponents of Muammar Gaddafi during interrogations, then transferred them to mistreatment in Libya.US: Torture and Rendition to Gaddafi's Libya Human Rights Watch September 6, 2012Delivered Into Enemy Hands US-Led Abuse and Rendition of Opponents to Gaddafi's Libya Human Rights Watch 2012 President Barack Obama has denied water torture.HRW: USA k√§ytti vesikidutusta libyalaisiin yle September 6, 2012 Unethical human experimentation in the United States Well-known cases include: * Albert Kligman's dermatology experiments * Greenberg v.

It also publishes yearly \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.\\" In 2006 the United States created a \\"Human Rights Defenders Fund\\" and \\"Freedom Awards.\\" The \\"Ambassadorial Roundtable Series\\", created in 2006, are informal discussions between newly confirmed U.S. Ambassadors and human rights and democracy non-governmental organizations. The United States also support democracy and human rights through several other tools. The \\"Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award\\" recognizes the exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies posted abroad. *In 2006 the award went to Joshua Morris of the embassy in Mauritania who recognized necessary democracy and human rights improvements in Mauritania and made democracy promotion one of his primary responsibilities. He persuaded the Government of Mauritania to re-open voter registration lists to an additional 85,000 citizens, which includes a significant number of Afro-Mauritanian minority individuals. He also organized and managed the largest youth-focused democracy project in Mauritania in 5 years. *Nathaniel Jensen of the embassy in Vietnam was runner- up. He successfully advanced the human rights agenda on several fronts, including organizing the resumption of a bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, pushing for the release of Vietnam's prisoners of concern, and dedicating himself to improving religion freedom in northern Vietnam. Under legislation by congress, the United States declared that countries utilizing child soldiers may no longer be eligible for US military assistance, in an attempt to end this practice. =Treaties ratified= :See also International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - United States The U.S. has signed and ratified the following human rights treaties: * International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (ratified with 5 reservations, 5 understandings, and 4 declarations.) * Optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict * International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination * Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment * Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees * Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography Non-binding documents voted for: * Universal Declaration of Human Rights =International Bill of Rights= :See also International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - United States The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) are the legal treaties that enshrine the rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Together, and along with the first and second optional protocols of the ICCPR they constitute the International bill of rights The US has not ratified the ICESCR or either of the optional protocols of the ICCPR. The US's ratification of the ICCPR was done with five reservations ‚Äì or limits ‚Äì on the treaty, 5 understandings and 4 declarations. Among these is the rejection of sections of the treaty that prohibit capital punishment.OHCHR Reservations and declarations on ratificatons America'S Problem With Human Rights Included in the Senate's ratification was the declaration that \\"the provisions of Article 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing\\",138 Cong. Rec. S4781-84 (1992) and in a Senate Executive Report stated that the declaration was meant to \\"clarify that the Covenant will not create a private cause of action in U.S. Courts.\\"S. Exec. Rep. No. 102-23 (1992) This way of ratifying the treaty was criticized as incompatible with the Supremacy Clause by Louis Henkin.Louis Henkin, U.S. Ratification of Human Rights Treaties: The Ghost of Senator Bricker, 89 Am. J. Int'l L. 341, 346 (1995) As a reservation that is \\"incompatible with the object and purpose\\" of a treaty is void as a matter of international law, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 19, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (entered into force January 27, 1980) (specifying conditions under which signatory States can offer \\"reservations\\"), there is some issue as to whether the non-self-execution declaration is even legal under domestic law. At any rate, the United States is but a signatory in name only. =International Criminal Court= The U.S. has not ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was drafted for prosecuting individuals above the authority of national courts in the event of accusations of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crime of aggression. Nations that have accepted the Rome Statute can defer to the jurisdiction of the ICC or must surrender their jurisdiction when ordered. The US rejected the Rome Statute after its attempts to include the nation of origin as a party in international proceedings failed, and after certain requests were not met, including recognition of gender issues, \\"rigorous\\" qualifications for judges, viable definitions of crimes, protection of national security information that might be sought by the court, and jurisdiction of the UN Security Council to halt court proceedings in special cases. Since the passage of the statute, the US has actively encouraged nations around the world to sign \\"bilateral immunity agreements\\" prohibiting the surrender of US personnel before the ICC and actively attempted to undermine the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The US Congress also passed a law, American Service-Members' Protection Act (ASPA) authorizing the use of military force to free any US personnel that are brought before the court rather than its own court system.Human Rights Watch, \\"U.S.: 'Hague Invasion Act' Becomes Law.\\" August 3, 2002. Retrieved January 8, 2007.John Sutherland, \\"Who are America's real enemies?\\" The Guardian, July 8, 2002. Retrieved January 8, 2007. Human Rights Watch criticized the United States for removing itself from the Statute. Judge Richard Goldstone, the first chief prosecutor at The Hague war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, echoed these sentiments saying: > I think it is a very backwards step. It is unprecedented which I think to an > extent smacks of pettiness in the sense that it is not going to affect in > any way the establishment of the international criminal court ... The US > have really isolated themselves and are putting themselves into bed with the > likes of China, the Yemen and other undemocratic countries. While the US has maintained that it will \\"bring to justice those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,\\" even though the U.S.A. has supported many genocides, for example the Indonesian genocide in the 1960s; its primary objections to the Rome Statute have revolved around the issues of jurisdiction and process. A US ambassador for War Crimes Issues to the UN Security Council said to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that because the Rome Statute requires only one nation to submit to the ICC, and that this nation can be the country in which an alleged crime was committed rather than defendant's country of origin, U.S. military personnel and US foreign peaceworkers in more than 100 countries could be tried in international court without the consent of the US. The ambassador states that \\"most atrocities are committed internally and most internal conflicts are between warring parties of the same nationality, the worst offenders of international humanitarian law can choose never to join the treaty and be fully insulated from its reach absent a Security Council referral. Yet multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the court's jurisdiction even if the country of the individual peacekeeper has not joined the treaty.\\" =Other treaties not signed or signed but not ratified= Where the signature is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, the signature does not establish the consent to be bound. However, it is a means of authentication and expresses the willingness of the signatory state to continue the treaty-making process. The signature qualifies the signatory state to proceed to ratification, acceptance or approval. It also creates an obligation to refrain, in good faith, from acts that would defeat the object and the purpose of the treaty.Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations 1986 Article 18. The U.S. has not ratified the following international human rights treaties: * First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) * Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty * Optional Protocol to CEDAW * Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture * Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) * Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (1954) * Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961) * International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families The US has signed but not ratified the following treaties: * Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) * Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) *International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights *Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Non-binding documents voted against: * Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in September 2007.Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples =Inter-American human rights system= The US is a signatory to the 1948 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and has signed but not ratified the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights. It is a member of Inter-American Convention on the Granting of Political Rights to Women (1948). It does not accept the adjudicatory jurisdiction of the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The US has not ratified any of the other regional human rights treaties of the Organization of American States, which include: * Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty (1990) * Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights * Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture (1985) * Inter- American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994) * Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons (1994) * Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities =Coverage of violations in the media= Studies have found that the New York Times coverage of worldwide human rights violations is seriously biased, predominantly focusing on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations. Amnesty International's Secretary General Irene Khan explains, \\"If we focus on the U.S. it's because we believe that the U.S. is a country whose enormous influence and power has to be used constructively ... When countries like the U.S. are seen to undermine or ignore human rights, it sends a very powerful message to others.\\" Further assessments The Polity data series generated by the Political Instability Task Force, a U.S. government research project funded by the CIA, rating regime and authority characteristics, covering the years 1800-2018, has given the US 10 points out of 10 for the years 1871-1966 and 1974-2015. The US score declined to 8 in 2016, 2017, and 2018. According to the Economist Magazine's Democracy Index (2016), the US ranks 21 out of 167 nations. In 2016 and 2017, the United States is classified as a \\"Flawed Democracy\\" by Democracy Index and received a score of 8.24 out of 10.00 with respect to civil liberties. This is the first time the United States has been downgraded from a \\"Full Democracy\\" to a \\"Flawed Democracy\\" since The Economist began publishing the Democracy Index report. According to the annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, due to wartime restrictions the United States was ranked 45th from the top in 2018 (out of 180). According to the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, which was published by Transparency International, the United States was ranked 22nd from the top least corrupt in 2018 (out of 180). According to the annual Privacy International index of 2007, the United States was ranked an \\"endemic surveillance society\\", scoring only 1.5 out of 5 privacy points. According to the annual Democracy Matrix, which is published by the University of W√ºrzburg, the US was a \\"working democracy\\" in 2019, which is the highest category in that index, although it is the third-lowest ranking country in that category (36th overall). According to the Gallup International Millennium Survey, the United States ranked 23rd in citizens' perception of human rights observance when its citizens were asked, \\"In general, do you think that human rights are being fully respected, partially respected or are they not being respected at all in your country?\\" Other issues In the aftermath of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, criticism by some groups commenting on human rights issues was made regarding the recovery and reconstruction issues26\\\\. The Committee, while taking note of the various rules and regulations prohibiting discrimination in the provision of disaster relief and emergency assistance, remains concerned about information that poor people and in particular African-Americans, were disadvantaged by the rescue and evacuation plans implemented when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States of America, and continue to be disadvantaged under the reconstruction plans. (articles 6 and 26) The State party should review its practices and policies to ensure the full implementation of its obligation to protect life and of the prohibition of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, as well as of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, in the areas of disaster prevention and preparedness, emergency assistance and relief measures. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it should increase its efforts to ensure that the rights of poor people and in particular African-Americans, are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and health care. The Committee wishes to be informed about the results of the inquiries into the alleged failure to evacuate prisoners at the Parish prison, as well as the allegations that New Orleans residents were not permitted by law enforcement officials to cross the Greater New Orleans Bridge to Gretna, Louisiana.

The United States was elected in 2009 to sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which the U.S. State Department had previously asserted had lost its credibility by its prior stances and lack of safeguards against severe human rights violators taking a seat. In 2006 and 2007, the UNHCR and Martin Scheinin were critical of the United States regard permitting executions by lethal injection, housing children in adult jails, subjecting prisoners to prolonged isolation in supermax prisons, using enhanced interrogation techniques and domestic poverty gaps.

At the end of the film there is the charming moment when one of the heroes looks at the sky, doesn't believe that this era has ended, looks at the moon and instead of seeing the crescent, sees the hammer and sickle.

First Book 1772‚Äì1842'] Life Charlotta Alml√∂f was the daughter of Christian Fredrik Ficker, a musician at the Kungliga Hovkapellet, and Johanna Charlotta Widerberg, and the sister of the opera singer Mathilda Gelhaar. =Career= Charlotta Alml√∂f was enrolled in Dramatens elevskola in 1830, made her debut at the Royal Dramatic Theatre on 23 September 1831, and was contracted as a premier actress there from 1834 to 1856. She married her mentor the actor Nils Alml√∂f in 1839, and became known under the name Alml√∂f. Alml√∂f was described as beautiful and graceful and became popular within in the role of coquettish girls and flirtatious ladies within the fashionable genre of French salon comedies, and to some extent seen as the successor of Charlotta Eriksson. She was very popular among the audience, which made her a star of the theater. In 1843, she was given a salary of 1333 riksdaler, which made her to a member of the elite of the theater staff.

The film was released on July 24, 2009 on video on demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21, 2009. Plot Lance Clayton (Robin Williams) is a single father and high school English teacher who dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is a sex-obsessed, underachieving misanthrope who is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. Kyle's poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal (Geoff Pierson), who advises Lance to transfer Kyle to a special-needs school. One night, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom. To salvage his son's dignity, Lance stages Kyle's death as a suicide. He hangs Kyle in a closet and posts a fake suicide note on his body. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings. Enjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a postmortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew, Kyle's sole friend, finds Kyle's suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle's honor. At the library dedication, Lance feels imperative guilt for exploiting his son's death for his own benefit as well as hatred towards feigning their fondness for Kyle. While giving a speech, Lance decides he can no longer continue the charade and confesses to everyone that Kyle's death was accidental, and that he wrote the suicide note and journal. Lance is ostracized by all except Andrew, who knew that Lance wrote the journal, but nevertheless enjoyed Lance's writing, and he encourages Lance to keep writing. The two happily watch a zombie movie at Lance's home with his neighbor Bonnie.

It was first introduced in conjunction with the term empathic inference, which was presented by psychologists William Ickes and William Tooke in 1988. Since then research on empathic accuracy has explored its relationship with the concepts of affect sharing and mentalizing. In order to accurately infer another's psychological state, one must be able to both share that state (affect sharing), and understand cognitively how to label that state (mentalizing). Neuroscience research has shown that brain activation associated with empathic accuracy overlaps with both the areas responsible for affect sharing and mentalizing. Empathic accuracy is an important aspect of what William Ickes has called \\"everyday mind reading\\". Understanding the states of others is extremely important to successful social interaction, and the costs of failing in this task can be high, as seen in the social difficulties people with autism spectrum disorders face. Empathic accuracy has been linked to positive peer relationship outcomes and overall healthy adjustment for adolescents. In adult relationships, empathic accuracy correlates with stable romantic relationships. History=Rogerian view= In 1951, Carl Rogers published Client-Centered Therapy, the work he is most known for, and created three guidelines that psychologists should follow when in a therapeutic session with a client. These general rules are to have unconditional positive regard, empathy, and genuineness. Roger's core goal for implementing these rules was to have the client actualize his or her own inherent potentialities, which is termed self-actualization. But, according to Rogers, self-actualization could not be accomplished until the need for positive regard, positive self-regard, and having a self-concept were gained, so having empathy as one of the main guidelines in therapy helps to move the client towards self-actualization. Empathy in Rogers's client-centered therapy is to better understand the client and his or her issues. This relates to empathic accuracy because Rogers's intent was not to simply make the client feel as if being pitied upon, but for the psychologist to be in tune with the client's needs and perspectives. To do so, the psychologist must be an accurate \\"reader\\". =Social psychology= Empathic accuracy became an active topic of social psychological research in the 1990s. Social psychology has explored in particular how empathic accuracy relates to the concept of empathy in general. Social psychologists posit two main theories for how people empathize with others: simulation theory and theory theory. In the simulation theory of empathy, we understand another by putting ourselves in that other's state, or simulating their experience. Theory theory is more cognitive in that we find meaning in other's behaviors and contextual cues, and put these together to construct an idea of what that person's internal mental state is like. Empathic accuracy in fact requires both processes; simulation theory correlates with the affect sharing aspect of empathic accuracy, while theory theory relates to one's ability to effectively mentalize about that shared affect. =Neuroscience= Medial and lateral view of the PFC Neuroscience research has further solidified the shared roles of simulation theory and theory theory in driving empathic accuracy. Neuroscience work on empathy has focused on two main neural networks: the mirror system and the mentalizing system. The mirror system, which involves the bilateral posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobule, is a more automatic form of shared mental representation, and so corresponds with simulation theory. The mentalizing system involves various areas dependent upon task demands but converges in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The fact that these systems rely on separate neural regions is important because this means they be activated at the same time. Recent work on empathic accuracy has shown this concurrent activation, proving that empathic accuracy involves both processes. It follows as well that the difficulty of the task would differentially activate the two networks; more basic tasks such as simple emotion recognition through facial expression correlates with greater activation of the mirror system, while tasks that require more complex social judgments to assess another's state activates the mentalizing system to a greater degree. = Measurement = William Ickes and colleagues developed a method to measure the accuracy of a perceiver's inferences about the content of a target person's reported thoughts and feelings. In this method, the perceiver is asked to view a videotaped interaction that was previously recorded. The videotape is paused for the perceiver at each of the points at which a target person on the videotape had reported having a specific thought or feeling, and the perceiver's task to write down the inferred content of each thought or feeling. Because the researchers have a list of the actual thoughts and feelings that the target person reported at the various \\"stop points\\", they can compare the content of each inferred thought or feeling with the actual thought or feeling and assess the level of the perceiver's empathic accuracy. This method has been adapted for neuroscience research by including fMRI scanning of participants while watching videos of others. Participants then report perceived emotional states of the recorded individual while in the scanner, so that researchers can measure brain activity during the empathic accuracy task. In research on psychotherapy, audio and videotapes are sometimes used to record the sessions of a patient and therapist, which allows expert judges rate the \\"empathic responsivity\\" or empathic accuracy of the therapist towards the patient.  Research =Social psychology= Social psychology research has focused on how empathic accuracy affects interpersonal relationships, and how people differ in empathic accuracy ability. Closeness has been shown to improve empathic accuracy; in a study of friends, for example, men were better at reading their friends' emotional states than those of strangers. In romantic relationships, empathic accuracy is higher when couples feel stable in their relationships than not, suggesting that people may be motivated to inaccurately interpret partners' states when they feel threatened, such as when evaluating whether a partner is physically attracted to someone else. In healthy relationships, empathic accuracy is linked to better instrumental social support, meaning that partners who are more accurate at inferring partners' states are better at providing tangible, concrete supports such as material goods or financial assistance. Work on empathic inaccuracy and aggression toward spouses has shown that men who are more likely to be aggressive toward their wives are also less accurate at reading emotional states of women who they do not know and more likely to inaccurately label those women's states as critical or rejecting, suggesting a basic cognitive bias within these men. Research looking explicitly at partners has found the same trend, with men who have acted violently toward their partners performing poorly when identifying their partners' emotional states. Research looking at gender differences overall has been mixed, with effects mainly showing up when participants are made aware of gender-role expectations and the fact that empathy is being measured. These findings suggest that, at a basic level, men and women are no different in empathic accuracy skill, but social norms can impact men's performance. Furthermore, research conducted in 2001 with opposite-gender couples found significant differences between genders: women were better at reading their partner's emotions. These differences, however, were dramatically diminished when the couples were told that they would receive money for each emotion they correctly identified in their partner. Men and women are very similar, according to these results, in terms of skill, but differ in terms of motivation to be empathetic. =Social neuroscience= As previously explained, social neuroscience has been instrumental in locating regions of the brain correlated with empathic accuracy, which has helped clarify the debate regarding simulation theory and theory-theory. Other research in social neuroscience has explored processes that may affect empathic accuracy both behaviorally and in the brain. For example, a recent study looked at the relationship between oxytocin and empathic accuracy. Oxytocin, known for its role in regulating prosocial behavior, was found to improve the empathic accuracy of individuals who scored higher on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), meaning that increased levels of oxytocin helped people with poorer social skills but not those who were already socially skilled. Neuroscience methods have also been used to explore how compassion meditation relates to empathic accuracy. Compassion meditation, also referred to as MettƒÅ or loving-kindness meditation, is a type of Buddhist practice in which the meditator actively focuses on increasing empathic feelings and compassion toward others. When study participants were trained in an eight- week course designed to teach compassion mediation, they were found to be more empathically accurate than controls and showed corresponding increased brain activation in areas related to empathic accuracy, particularly the mentalizing system. Deficits Certain conditions can cause impairments in empathic accuracy. Alexithymia, which involves difficulty with labeling one's own emotional states, is linked with empathic inaccuracy. When considering the importance of the mirror system in empathic accuracy this deficit makes sense, as people who have difficulty recognizing their own emotions likely would show less brain activation in those regions, which are also used in recognizing others' emotions. Indeed, alexithymic individuals show decreased activation of the mirror system when presented with images of others. Deficits in empathic accuracy have also been found in individuals on the autism spectrum. As stated, higher AQ scores correlate with lower empathic accuracy in normal populations. Similar findings have been found in clinical populations, with those on the autism spectrum experiencing greater difficulty with empathic accuracy tasks. Further reading An early summary of the research on empathic accuracy can be found in an edited volume titled Empathic Accuracy (1997). A more recent summary is available in a single-author book titled Everyday Mind Reading: Understanding What Other People Think and Feel (2009). For a discussion of the mirror system as it pertains to empathy and empathic accuracy, Marco Iacoboni has written a book entitled, Mirroring People: The Science of Empathy and How We Connect with Others (2009).

History  Sipsmith was established in London in 2009. The first copper-pot based distillery to start up in London in 189 years, it is one of only four gin distilleries located in London. The Beefeater Gin Distillery (established by the John Burrough's Company in 1863), Thames Distillers, Sacred Microdistillery, The London Distillery Company and Sipsmith are the only remaining licensed distilleries in the nation's capital. Sipsmith was launched by Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, respectively former Fuller's and Diageo employees and Jared Brown, who is also Sipsmith's Master Distiller. A drinks and spirits historian and publisher, he has developed spirits in Sweden, Norway, Vietnam, and in the US over the past 12 years. The Sipsmith still was designed and produced by the German still manufacturers Christian Carl. Named \\"Prudence\\", this copper pot still has a capacity of . Prudence is the subject of their iconic swan neck copper still labelling, created alongside their visual identity and brand by Perry Haydn Taylor's agency, big fish, before Sipsmith was started. On 16 December 2016 it was announced that Beam Suntory had taken a controlling stake in Sipsmith for an undisclosed sum, but that Sam Galsworthy, Fairfax Hall and Jared Brown would be staying on to lead the distillery. In December 2016, Sipsmith was acquired by Japanese Beam Suntory, a subsidiary of Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd, for ¬£50 million. In May 2017, Sipsmith partnered with the secret London culinary boutique Gingerline to create an ¬´immersive gin dinner¬ª.  Activities  The Sipsmith distillery is situated on a residential street in West London on the site of a former microbrewery, later the offices of beer hunter Michael Jackson. Sipsmith's first two spirits are a Barley Vodka and a London Dry Gin. These are produced in small batches of fewer than 300 bottles, from an English Barley mash that is created off-site. Each batch is made in a traditional manner with three cuts: the Head or foreshot is discarded; the Heart or core of the distillation run is retained; and the Tail or feints is discarded. The Heart of the distillation is diluted to its final bottling strength with Lydwell Spring water, one of the sources of the River Thames in the Cotswolds. Products *Sipsmith London Dry Gin (41.6% ABV): A classic London dry style gin, it uses 10 botanicals in its maceration: Juniper berries, Coriander Seed, Angelica Root, Liquorice Root, Orris Root, Ground Almond, Cassia Bark, Cinnamon, Orange Peel and Lemon Peel. *Sipsmith Sipping Vodka (40% ABV): An unfiltered and unsweetened wheat vodka, the spirit derives its flavour from its essential grain base. *Sipsmith Sloe Gin (29% ABV): released in October 2010 *Sipsmith London Cup (29% ABV): a type of fruit cups released in August 2011 *Sipsmith Damson Vodka (28% ABV): released in 2010 *Sipsmith VJOP (57.7% ABV): 'Very Junipery Over Proof' In 2015, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Singapore Sling, Sipsmith partnered with Raffles Hotels & Resorts to create a brand-made gin, the Raffles 1915 Gin.

The first Special Envoy was Gregg Rickman, who was sworn in on May 22, 2006 and served until the end of the George W. Bush administration. Hannah Rosenthal served in the post under the Obama administration from November 23, 2009 to October 5, 2012. Rosenthal was praised for formalizing the office's work and criteria, and for her personal involvement against anti-Semitic acts globally, however she also criticism from her predecessor, Rickman, and early on from Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, for including Muslim community leaders in joint activities against religious hatred. Rosenthal was succeeded on an interim basis by an acting Special Envoy, career diplomat Michael Kozak, who had previously served as U.S. ambassador to Belarus. Kozak served in that role until Ira Forman, the former executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, was sworn in as Special Envoy on May 20, 2013; he served until Obama's term in office ended in January 2017. In June 2017, five months into the new Trump administration, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cast doubt on whether the post of Special Envoy would be filled during Trump's presidency. Members of the House and Senate publicly expressed concern that the position was unfilled and called for Trump to make an appointment, at the same time calling on Trump to fill the vacant position of White House Jewish Liaison. Congressional concern over the vacancy continued to grow throughout 2018 and early 2019.

Life and work  He had been organist in Turnov and Rovensko pod Troskami (where he was also cantor) from 1668 and in Dobrovice, near Mlad√° Boleslav, in 1679‚Äì1680. During his tenure at Vy≈°ehrad he may have taken a pilgrimage to Rome and sometime in the early eighteenth century he lived a prayerful and hermit-like existence at Waldstein Castle near Turnov. His magnum opus is Cappella Regia Musicalis (Prague, 1693), containing 772 pieces, which was almost certainly the fruit of his 12-plus years as a provincial cantor. The publication coincides with his appointment as organist at Vy≈°ehrad in Prague, though he may have been in the city for some time before that. Cappella Regia Musicalis is a massive collection of hymns, sacred and festive songs, and all manner of musical settings of almost all central parts of the Roman Catholic liturgy, all printed primarily in the Czech language. It is difficult to tell just how much of the collection was composed by Holan himself (though it is clear that many other composers are represented), and some of the songs and other pieces are clearly much older, such as the anonymous fifteenth century Czech settings of the Passion. Curiously, the collection also contains many earlier Protestant and even Hussite songs, making it something of a survey of Czech sacred song to date. Unlike most other Czech hymnals, many pieces in Holan's collection also included basso continuo and even obbligato instruments such as violins, viols, and trumpets. Another curious feature of this rather amazing publication is that no two surviving copies are alike, leading to suspicions that they may have been made-to-order. It would seem that Johann Heinrich Schmelzer was familiar with it, since a (greatly expanded) German-language version of one of the pieces circulated under his name. Sections of Cappella Regia Musicalis were continually copied and reprinted throughout the ensuing centuries and, in some quarters, have been the basis for many Czech hymnals.

As president of the Hoboken City Council, she became acting mayor after incumbent Peter Cammarano's resignation on July 31, 2009 following his arrest on corruption charges. Zimmer is the first female mayor of Hoboken. She was first elected mayor in a special election for the balance of Cammarano's term on November 6, 2009 and was re-elected mayor for another four-year term in November 2013. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, she was ranked #3, #4 and #5, respectively, on The Hudson Reporter's list of the 50 most influential people in Hudson County. Early life Dawn Zimmer was born in Towson, Maryland, and raised in Laconia, New Hampshire. She is of German and Irish descent. She attended public schools and graduated cum laude in 1990 from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in history. Early career Zimmer taught English at a private language school in Japan from 1990 to 1993.

She has also worked as a family portrait photographer and as marketing director for her husband's jewelry business. She and her family moved to Hoboken from New York City in September 2002. Political career=Early civic work= Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack, May 18, 2010 Zimmer became involved in civic life in Hoboken in 2006 when she joined the Southwest Parks Coalition Steering Committee to advocate for more park space in southwest Hoboken's 4th Ward. She also served as a board member of the Kaplan Cooperative Preschool and as secretary of the Parent Teacher Student Organization for the Elysian Charter School. In 2007, she ran for Hoboken City Council in the 4th Ward against incumbent Christopher Campos. In the first election in May, neither candidate reached 50 percent, necessitating a runoff election. Zimmer outpolled Campos in the June runoff by eight votes, but Campos challenged the results, charging that absentee ballots were improperly handled. Zimmer in turn charged that Campos had received votes from non-residents. A second runoff was called in November, with Zimmer defeating Campos by a margin of 1,070 votes to 956. In October 2007, Zimmer, as Hoboken's 4th Ward Councilwoman, supported a voter referendum to create an Open Space Trust Fund. Originally this fund could have been used to pay maintenance on existing parks but Councilwoman Zimmer and other Councilpeople voted to ensure that it would only be used for the acquisition of new space and the maintenance of new space. =Hoboken Mayor= Zimmer ran for Mayor of Hoboken in 2009. She lost to Peter Cammarano in the June runoff by 161 votes. On July 1, when Cammarano was sworn in as mayor, the City Council unanimously elected Zimmer as Council President. On July 23, 2009, Cammarano was arrested by the FBI as part of a major corruption and international money laundering conspiracy probe known as Operation Bid Rig. Cammarano was charged with accepting $25,000 in cash bribes from an undercover cooperating witness. The same witness approached Zimmer's campaign staff and was unsuccessful in setting up a meeting. She joined other local officials in calling for Cammarano's resignation. On July 31, 2009, Cammarano resigned from office, and Zimmer was immediately sworn in as acting mayor. On November 3, 2009, she won a special election to fill the rest of Cammarano's mayoral term. In the special election, Zimmer faced six opponents: City Councilwoman Beth Mason, businessman Frank Raia, former Hoboken Municipal Court judge Kimberly Glatt, Hoboken Republican Club co-founder Nathan Brinkman, management consultant Everton A. Wilson, and former corrections officer Patricia Waiters. She finished with 43% of the vote, with Mason in second place with 23% and Raia in third place with 18%. As it was a special election, no runoff was required. Zimmer was sworn in as mayor on November 6, 2009, giving up her City Council seat. In 2008, Hoboken City had come under State Supervision due to an 11.7 million dollar budget deficit. By the end of her first term, Hoboken had a balanced budget, had cut taxes by 12%, and the city's bond rating had gone from BBB- to AA+, the second highest S&P; rating.

Relationship with Governor Christie In May 2010 Zimmer invited Governor Christie to speak in Hoboken in his first of a series of town hall meetings throughout the state supporting the 2% tax levy cap. She supported the property tax cap as the part of a package of legislation that includes changes to the arbitration process, shared services and the disciplinary process. \\"There is nothing partisan about being smart and responsible with money entrusted [to us] by our citizens\\", Zimmer said. That September Christie was invited back to the city to speak at Elysian Charter School about his education reform agenda and the role of charter schools. Zimmer, whose two children attend Elysian Charter School, echoed concerns on the feasibility of funding charter schools, in light of the lack of state aid for facility-related expenses.

His 1944 research showed that largescale, especially industrial, farm structures in one community were associated with adverse community conditions. Smaller-scale, owner-operated farms in the other community, were associated with more vibrant, diverse economies and with higher standards of living.

During World War II, the group's predecessor unit, the 98th Bombardment Group was a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomb group that fought in North Africa and Italy. Two of its members, Colonel John R. (Killer) Kane and First Lieutenant Donald Pucket were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in combat. The group flew a total of 417 missions, earning a total of 15 battle streamers as well as two Presidential Unit Citations. In the postwar era, the 98th Bombardment Group was one of the first United States Army Air Forces units assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 July 1947, prior to the establishment of the USAF. Equipped with low-hour Boeing B-29 Superfortress World War II aircraft, it was deployed to Far East Air Force in 1950 and flew combat missions over North Korea early in the Korean War. The group was inactivated in 1952 when the parent wing adopted the Tri-Deputate organization and assigned all of the group's squadrons directly to the wing. It was reactivated in 1987 as the 98th Air Refueling Group, Heavy; as an Air Force Reserve associate unit of the 434th Air Refueling Wing. History : See 98th Range Wing for related history and lineage =World War II= B-24 of the 98th Bombardment Group The 98th trained for bombardment missions with Consolidated B-24 Liberators during the first half of 1942. The group was alerted and departed for the Middle East on 15 July 1942, arriving in Palestine in late July 1942. The 98th was initially assigned to the USMEAF (United States Middle East Air Force). However, the USMEAF was dissolved on 12 November 1942. At that time, the 98th came under Ninth Air Force. It flew its first mission to Mersa Matruh, Libya on 1 August 1942, with the aircraft being serviced by Royal Air Force personnel until 98th maintenance personnel arrived in mid-August 1942. It supported the British Eighth Army in its westward advance from Egypt into Libya and Tunisia. It bombed shipping and harbor installations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Crete, and Greece to cut enemy supply lines to Africa and to prepare for the Allied invasion of Italy. The 98th earned a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for action against the enemy in the Middle East, North Africa, and Sicily from August 1942 to August 1943. It received a second DUC for participation in a low-level bombing raid on enemy-held oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania, on 1 August 1943. On this raid, of 47 B-24s launched, only 21 returned safely. One crashed on takeoff with the loss of all crewmembers except two. Six aborted before reaching the target. Seventeen went down in enemy territory. Two went down at sea. The Group Commander, Col. John R. (Killer) Kane was awarded the Medal of Honor for his leadership. The 98th was under the command of the Twelfth Air Force in September and October 1943. From 1 November 1943 it was under the Fifteenth Air Force and moved to Italy. It flew many long-range missions to France, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania to bomb enemy heavy industries, airdromes, harbors, oil fields, and communication centers. On another raid on Ploesti on 9 July 1944, Lt. Donald Pucket sacrificed his life trying to save three of his crewmembers who could not or would not bail out of their doomed B-24. Donald Pucket was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his sacrifice. In the summer of 1944, the 98th participated in the invasion of southern France, assisted in the Soviet advance into the Balkans, and supported the partisans and guerrillas in Yugoslavia and neighboring countries. It flew a total of 417 missions and earned a total of 15 battle streamers as well as two Presidential Unit Citations. The group returned to the United States as the war was ending in Europe, where it trained in preparation for movement to the Pacific Theater. It was re-designated the 98th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy and equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, but the war with Japan ended before redeployment. The 98th was inactivated as a group on 10 November 1945. However, its 343rd, 344th, and 345th Squadrons were reassigned to other B-29 groups. The 343d Squadron was assigned to the 40th Bombardment Group at March Air Force Base, California and inactivated on 27 November 1946. The 344th was assigned to the 444th Bombardment Group at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona and inactivated on 1 October 1946. The 345th was assigned to the 462nd Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida and inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Postwar era and Korean War= Martin-Omaha B-29-50-MO Superfortress 44-86340, 98th Bomb Group The 98th was reactivated on 1 July 1947 and equipped with B-29 Superfortresses at Spokane Army Air Field, Washington. In 1948, it carried out a 90-day deployment to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. During this period, the 98th lost two B-29s; and a Douglas C-54 Skymaster returning to the USA with 98th personnel ditched in the Pacific. ANother 90 day deployment was conducted in the summer of 1949 to RAF Sculthorpe, England. During the training phase of the years 1947‚Äì1950, the 98th recorded six B-29 losses. During the deployment to England, the 98th practiced high level (35,000 ft) bombing missions on the German Island of Helgoland. The aircraft were challenged by RAF and USAF fighters. The gunners were evaluated on gun camera film. The bombardiers were rated on their performance as well as were other air crew members. As a result of the exercise, the 98th was rated very highly and combat ready. In early 1950, the 98th was alerted for permanent change of stations to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico. However, before the move was completed, the Korean War broke out and the 98th arrived at Yokota Air Base, Japan in the first week of August 1950, and was placed under the operational control of the Far East Air Forces Bomber Command (Provisional). The first planes arrived at Yokota on 5 August 1950. It flew its first combat mission on 7 August, striking marshalling yards at Pyongyang, capital of North Korea. The Group attacked enemy communication lines and supported United Nations ground forces during the war. Targets included rail facilities, oil centers, bridges, roads, troop concentrations, airfields, and military installations. The last mission was There were 34 known losses. It became an administrative unit in 1951 when its operational squadrons were assigned directly to the wing as a result of the SAC dual deputate reorganization. =Reserve refueling operations= The unit was reactivated in the Air Force Reserve on 1 October 1987 as the 98th Air Refueling Group, Heavy at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana with McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender aircraft. It consisted of the 78th Air Refueling Squadron and the 98th Consolidated Maintenance Squadron under the command of the 452d Air Refueling Wing at March Air Force Base. On 12‚Äì14 May 1989, the group was tasked to support USAF transport aircraft airlifting troops into Panama, which was the prelude to Operation Just Cause. In early August 1990 aircraft and crews of the 98th again were called on to support operations in the Gulf War. Following that operation, the 98th was involved with President Bush‚Äôs code name Sinbad, a secret plan to monitor drug trafficking in South America. Yet again the 98th flew mercy missions into Mogadishu, Somalia delivering 491,610 pounds of supplies to try to alleviate the humanitarian disaster. Still operating in Operation Southern Watch the group flew missions along the southern border of Iraq in January 1993 until inactivated on 30 September 1994. =Nevada range= It was redesignated the 98th Operations Group and reactivated in October 2001, supporting the 98th Range Wing in its operations at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. It is now a non-flying unit that commands two squadrons with 55 military and civil service personnel and has functional responsibility for approximately 300 contract personnel. It prioritizes and schedules all range activities for all range users, provides ground control intercept operations, flight-following safety deconfliction, simulated threat command and control operations, communications, data link operations, and range access control. It also assists test customers by coordinating support activities, and coordinates airspace issues with military and federal agencies. The 98th Operations Support Squadron is the scheduling, command and control and project support authority for NTTR operations. The Weapons and Tactics Flight provides qualified ground control intercept and Link 16 operations for more than 5,000 test and training sorties per year on the NTTR. The Current Operations Flight is responsible for range scheduling, range monitoring and advisory control (Blackjack), and provides a comprehensive debrief tool for combat air forces aircrews. The Operations Plans Flight coordinates all exercise, test and experimentation customer assistance. The 98th Range Squadron is responsible for technical support of NTTR Air Force, joint and multinational aircrew training. The Communications Flight provides small computer hardware and software support and all communications. The Operations and Maintenance Flight provides operation, maintenance and deployment of threat systems, mission control and debriefing systems, time-space-position indicator/scoring systems and Roulette (Red Forces Command and Control). The Engineering Flight conducts research, engineers, develops and manages hardware and software projects.

This organization's purpose is to enhance rural Canada by providing specialized and personalized financial services to farming operations, including family farms. Although once exclusively a farm lender, FCC is now also organized to provide funding to enterprises that are closely related or dependent on farming. Its small and medium business focus is shown by its average loan disbursement of $163,649 (as of March 2014). History and governance FCC was established in 1959, under the Farm Credit Act, at that time solely to provide loans to farmers. It succeeded the Canadian Farm Loan Board, which had been in operation since 1929. On April 2, 1993, Parliament passed the Farm Credit Corporation Act which then allowed the organization to expand beyond straightforward farm loans ‚Äì to finance on-farm diversification projects and value-added agricultural operations beyond the \\"farm gate\\". In June 2001, the Farm Credit Canada Act changed FCC's name to Farm Credit Canada or Financement agricole Canada (FAC) in French. In October 2008, Farm Credit Canada was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc, and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine. Later that month, Farm Credit Canada was named one of Saskatchewan's Top Employers, which was announced by the Saskatoon StarPhoenix and Regina Leader-Post newspapers. In December 2008, Farm Credit Canada was named one of Report on Business Magazine's Top 50 Employers in Canada featured in The Globe and Mail newspaper.

F√∂rra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First Book 1772‚Äì1842']  Life  Fanny Westerdahl was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 21 February 1817. She was the daughter of a concert conductor at the Hovkapellet. She was enrolled as a student at the Dramatens elevskola in 1828. =Career= Fanny Westerdahl was engaged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1829 (at age 12) and made her proper debut in 1831, as \\"Carolina\\" in Baschan in Suresne. In 1836, she was contracted as a premier actress. In the beginning of her career, she was considered to have in some extent replaced Sara Torsslow on the royal stage. Fanny Westerdahl was described as beautiful, with a good technique in managing her voice in both speaking and lyric drama, a quick and skillful mimic, and a good comprehension of the character of her roles. In 1849, she was referred to as the only one of the actresses of the royal stage truly suited for \\"great drama\\" and praised her for her natural warmth and \\"mild passion\\". She took her profession seriously, and made a study trip to Paris to study the French theater in 1838. A known incident was told of her improvisation skill on stage. During a performance in which she played a bandit, she was to shot her co-actor Georg Dahlqvist, but when the gun did not work as it should, she hit him with it, which caused him to faint for real. When he came to, he commented: \\"You are sublime!\\" Fanny Westerdahl was a dramatic actress, but as was common at the time when the royal opera and theater where both placed under the same management as the \\"royal theaters\\", singers and actors where allowed and expected to be available for both genres providing they had the ability, and Westerdahl is known to have occasionally performed an operatic part, such as when she replaced Elisabeth Fr√∂sslind in Cendrillon. Westerdahl belonged to the elite of dramatic actors on the Swedish stage of her time. Her position was illustrated by her salary: in 1843, she had a salary of 1400 riksdaler, which was only marginally less than the stars Emilie H√∂gquist and Nils Alml√∂f (who had 1600) and the same amount as the Ballet master of Royal Swedish Ballet, Anders Selinder. By 1858, Westerdahl was considered an example of the outdated old recitative way of acting. When she wished to play one of her old heroine parts, she was told: \\"Madam is too old!\\" At this point, she was described as overweight, a drunk and with a frivolous mouth, but talented in comedy, and she was recommended by August Bournonville as an example of good instinct and fantasy in contrast to mere education. Fanny Westerdahl formally retired with a pension in 1862, but was active as a guest actor for several years afterwards. Her best known roles include: \\"Louise\\" in Kabal and K√§rlek, \\"Johanna af Montfaucon\\" or \\"Griselda\\", Amalia in R√∂fvarbandet, and \\"Katarina M√•nsdotter\\" in Erik XIV. Her singing roles include \\"Cendrillon\\" and \\"Papagena\\" in Trollfl√∂yten, and \\"Bettly\\" in Alphyddan.  Private life  Fanny Westerdahl married the actor Carl Edvard Hjortsberg (son of Lars Hjortsberg) in 1847, and divorced him in 1849. After her divorce, she called herself Mrs Westerdahl. Fanny Westerdahl died in Stockholm, on 27 March 1873.  References  * Georg Nordensvan: Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare.

Moore, The Crisis of Indian Unity 1917-1940, p.289. Haig remained a staunch critic of the Mahatma's policy of attacking British rule while at the same time negotiating with the government. In his position as Home Member on the Council he was responsible for overseeing Civil Martial Law. On 5 December 1934 he succeeded the Labour supporter, Sir Malcolm Hailey at Allahabad as the new governor of United Provinces. They feared a reaction against a Swarajist Party success at the polls would spark rioting and violence against landlords. Family Harry was born at 43 Kensington Gardens, Kensington, London to Henry Alexander Haig, a City merchant, and his wife Agnes Catherine Pollock. His family were wealthy upper-middle class that originated in trade from Scotland. Harry was educated at Winchester College. He won a scholarship to go up to New College, Oxford in 1900. Two years later he took a second in Mods (classical moderations) and after four years at Oxford he achieved a first in Literae humaniores. That autumn 1904 he was third place in the national examinations for the Indian Civil Service (ICS). He was appointed to the officer cadre of United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) then considered the most senior civil service province in British India. He returned to England, but on 25 August 1908 he married Violet May, daughter of Joseph Deas of the Indian Civil Service. In 1910 he was appointed to be an Under-secretary to the government of United Provinces, yet only for two years. Career Haig liked India, and so resolved to remain there during World War One. He joined the Indian Army Reserves Corps of officers. In 1920 he resumed a civil service career in finance. Appointed a deputy secretary in the department of the Government of India. Now at the heart of Indian power, he was soon promoted to be Secretary to the Fiscal Commission, where he had a knowledge and understanding of taxation. The government in London was attempting to make savings by imposing more of the financial burden upon India for its own service upkeep. In 1923 he was attached to the Royal Commission on surperior civil services. Two years later he became private secretary to the new Liberal Viceroy, the Marquess of Reading. In 1926 he was appointed secretary of the home department in India. His record of service, fifteen years at the top of the Indian service was only equalled by Sir Malcolm Hailey. Haig became expert in policing and home affairs. He was resolved to prevent Gandhi's non-cooperation movement from breaking up British rule, and yet knew how alarmist tactics could ignite an orgy of violence. Recommending a new Intelligence-led police operation to track rebels, Gandhi made a personal plea to end the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) feared for its rigorous methods of arrest and detention. By 1933 the civil disobedience movement had calmed down, its leaders in prison or disarmed. Gandhi was sentenced to six years in prison. In 1929 Haig was instrumental in the defeat of the Communist-inspired Meerut Conspiracy Case case, in which violent revolutionaries aimed to disrupt Congress peaceful demonstrations, yet they were far from that, as Haig found out from the Nainital proceedings in his capacity as Secretary to the government.Devendra Singh, Meerut Conspiracy Case and Communist Movement in India 1929-35, (Research India, 1990), pp.37, 41, 51. Leaving the British India leaders to cajole Gandhi into attending the Second Round Table Conference in London. Haig attended both conferences in 1930-31. he was in the chair of the committee that expanded the jurisdiction of the North-West Frontier Province with full governor and provincial legislature powers. Emergency powers were in full operation throughout India invoking martial law in a region where many Muslims and Sikhs joined the British Indian Army. When Sir James Crerar retired in 1932 he was asked to become home member on Lord Willingdon's Council and appointed Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire. Haig encouraged the London drafters of Government of India bill in 1934 to make special constituency reserved seats in the North-West for Muslims and the other minorities that predominated in the province. He recognised the security and safety issues by pursuance of a dual policy during the negotiations with Gandhi-Dr. Ambedkar.Collected Writings Mahatma Gandhi, p.51. At once the home department deployed a tough policy of detention against the Congress while being on the telegraph hotline to London in conversation with the cabinet. Gandhi was an old man incapable of defeating the British forces, so they were happy for the policy to be to decline his position.Haig note, 15 November 1933 in D.A. Low, Civil Martial Law, p.186. Gandhi would later praise Haig's \\"rearguard action\\" which was conducted with firmness but fairness. Britain pursued a managed withdrawal from the 1930s onwards, offering concessions for \\"responsive government\\" within the Imperial federation. Haig had long worked with Hailey, becoming well acquainted with the United Provinces; he succeeded a mentor as governor at Allahabad on 6 December 1934.Leader 7 December 1934. The Government of India Act 1935 was bitterly opposed by Conservatives, and Haig was fearful that Indians would become uncontrollable. In 1937 Congress won a landslide election victory. G B Pant was appointed President but resigned when the new Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, a less tolerant aristocrat refused. on the home member's advice, to release the last of the political prisoners. Haig remained courteous and was thanked by the Congress, but it could be the end of his career in India. Chatari tried to form his own government, but failed when even his own brother refused a post in the new cabinet.M. Reza Khan, Liaquat Ali Khan (OUP, 2003) p.59. In October 1939, war already declared police arrested a gang of Khaksars. They were taken to Bulandshahr district jail where five were shot dead and twenty wounded. The British security were on red alert during wartime, but Justice Hunter of Allahabad was appointed to investigate. Haig was sanguine about the situation in a secret report to the Viceroy Lord Linlithgow, that is said to vindicate surrender of arms.N.Yousaf, Pakisatns Freedom & Allama Mashriqi: Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrick movement period (AMZ Publications, 2004), p.77. When war broke out in Europe he returned to England. In 1940 he was appointed Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence in Manchester.Obituary, The Times, 18 June 1956. Haig was an Anglican, and regularly attended church. He was appointed Chairman of the Indian Church Aid Association under the diocesan control of his brother-in-law, Bishop Eyre Chatterton. He became an active member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. In 1952 he was invited to the silver jubilee of Agra University in the province he once governed.

The difference can be described heuristically as follows: For a manifold \\\\Lambda to be normally hyperbolic we are allowed to assume that the dynamics of \\\\Lambda itself is neutral compared with the dynamics nearby, which is not allowed for a hyperbolic set. NHIMs were introduced by Neil Fenichel in 1972. In this and subsequent papers, Fenichel proves that NHIMs possess stable and unstable manifolds and more importantly, NHIMs and their stable and unstable manifolds persist under small perturbations. Thus, in problems involving perturbation theory, invariant manifolds exist with certain hyperbolicity properties, which can in turn be used to obtain qualitative information about a dynamical system.A.

Examples include research and development, education, infrastructure, and marketing and promotion programs. The GSSE can be expressed in monetary terms or as a percentage of the total support to agriculture (percentage GSSE). The OECD Description The concept of transfers presumes both a source and a recipient. The indicators identify three economic groups: taxpayers (government), consumers and agricultural producers; the latter are considered both as individual entrepreneurs and collectively. The arrows represent the flow of transfers from one group to another arising from policy measures that support agriculture. An important distinction between the indicators is made on the basis of the recipient of the transfer. * Producer Support Estimate (PSE) represents transfers to producers individually. These transfers require that an individual farmer takes actions to produce goods or services, to use factors of production, or to be defined as an eligible farming enterprise or farmer, to receive the transfer. * General Service Support Estimate (GSSE) includes transfers to producers collectively, i.e. services that benefit agriculture but whose initial incidence is not at the level of individual farmers. * Consumer Support Estimate (CSE) captures the value of transfers to consumers. The CSE is almost always negative because transfers from consumers due to market price support policies outweigh any consumption subsidies from taxpayers that might be provided to consumers. * Total Support Estimate (TSE) represents the sum of all three components, adjusting for double-counting given that some market price transfers are accounted for in both the PSE and CSE. http://www.oecd.org/agriculture/agriculturalpoliciesandsupport/43411396.pdf See also *Producer support estimate (PSE) *Consumer support estimate (CSE) *Total support estimate (TSE).

The largest (both in terms of scale and quantity) and best-known topographic series is the 7.5-minute, 1:24,000 scale, quadrangle, a non-metric scale virtually unique to the United States. Each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude spaced 7.5 minutes apart. Nearly 57,000 individual maps in this series cover the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, U.S. territories, and areas of Alaska near Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Prudhoe Bay. The area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians. At lower latitudes, near 30¬∞ north, a 7.5-minute quadrangle contains an area of about . At 49¬∞ north latitude, are contained within a quadrangle of that size. As a unique non-metric map scale, the 1:24,000 scale naturally requires a separate and specialized romer scale for plotting map positions. In recent years, budget constraints have forced the USGS to rely on donations of time by civilian volunteers in an attempt to update its 7.5-minute topographic map series, and USGS stated outright in 2000 that the program was to be phased out in favor of The National Map (not to be confused with the National Atlas of the United States produced by the Department of the Interior, one of whose bureaus is USGS). An older series of maps, the 15-minute series, was once used to map the contiguous 48 states at a scale of 1:62,500, but was discontinued some time ago for maps covering the continental United States. Each map was bounded by two parallels and two meridians spaced 15 minutes apart‚Äîthe same area covered by four maps in the 7.5-minute series. The 15-minute series, at a scale of 1:63,360 (one inch representing one mile), remains the primary topographic quadrangle for the state of Alaska (and only for that particular state). Nearly 3,000 maps cover 97% of the state. The United States remains virtually the only developed country in the world without a standardized civilian topographic map series in the standard 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 metric scales, making coordination difficult in border regions (the U.S. military does issue 1:50,000 scale topo maps of the continental United States, though only for use by members of its defense forces). The next-smallest topographic series, in terms of scale, is the 1:100,000 series. These maps are bounded by two lines of longitude and two lines of latitude. However, in this series, the lines of latitude are spaced 30 minutes apart and the lines of longitude are spaced 60 minutes, which is the source of another name for these maps; the 30 x 60-minute quadrangle series. Each of these quadrangles covers the area contained within 32 maps in the 7.5-minute series. The 1:100,000 scale series is unusual in that it employs the Metric system primarily. One centimeter on the map represents one kilometer of distance on the ground. Contour intervals, spot elevations, and horizontal distances are also specified in meters. The final regular quadrangle series produced by the USGS is the 1:250,000 scale topographic series. Each of these quadrangles in the conterminous United States measures 1 degree of latitude by 2 degrees of longitude. This series was produced by the U.S. Army Map Service in the 1950s, prior to the maps in the larger-scale series, and consists of 489 sheets, each covering an area ranging from at 30¬∞ north to at 49¬∞ north. Hawaii is mapped at this scale in quadrangles measuring 1¬∞ by 1¬∞. USGS topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods, including the graticule measurements of longitude and latitude, the township and section method within the Public Land Survey System, and cartesian coordinates in both the State Plane Coordinate System and the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system. Other specialty maps have been produced by the USGS at a variety of scales. These include county maps, maps of special interest areas, such as the national parks, and areas of scientific interest. A number of Internet sites have made these maps available on the web for affordable commercial and professional use. Because works of the U.S. government are in the public domain, it is also possible to find many of these maps for free at various locations on the Internet. Georeferenced map images are available from the USGS as digital raster graphics (DRGs) in addition to digital data sets based on USGS maps, notably digital line graphs (DLGs) and digital elevation models (DEMs). In 2015, the USGS unveiled the topoView website, a new way to view their entire digitized collection of over 178,000 maps from 1884 to 2006. The site is an interactive map of the United States that allows users to search or move around the map to find the USGS collection of maps for a specific area. Users may then view the maps in great detail and download them if desired. The National Map and U.S. Topo In 2008 the USGS abandoned traditional methods of surveying, revising, and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks. Today's U.S. Topo quadrangle (1:24,000) maps are mass-produced, using automated and semiautomated processes, with cartographic content supplied from the National GIS Database. In the two years from June 2009 to May 2011, the USGS produced nearly 40,000 maps, more than 80 maps per work day. Only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map, mostly on text placement and final inspection; there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details. While much less expensive to compile and produce, the revised digital U.S. topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo survey and field checks. As the digital databases were not designed for producing general purpose maps, data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates. Man-made features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database, and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps, including windmills, mines and mineshafts, water tanks, fence lines, survey marks, parks, recreational trails, buildings, boundaries, pipelines, telephone lines, power transmission lines, and even railroads. Additionally, the digital map's use of existing software may not properly integrate different feature classes or prioritize and organize text in areas of crowded features, obscuring important geographic details. As a result, some have noted that the U.S. Topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945 to 1992. = USGS Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility = The Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility (HIF) has four sections within its organizational structure; the Field Services Section which includes the warehouse, repair shop, and Engineering Unit; the Testing Section which includes the Hydraulic Laboratory, testing chambers, and Water Quality Laboratory; the Information Technology Section which includes computer support and the Drafting Unit; and the Administrative Section. The HIF was given national responsibility for the design, testing, evaluation, repair, calibration, warehousing, and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation. Distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program. The HIF supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities. The HIF warehouse provides hydrologic instruments, equipment, and supplies for USGS as well as Other Federal Agencies (OFA) and USGS Cooperators. The HIF also tests, evaluates, repairs, calibrates, and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments. The HIF Hydraulic Laboratory facilities include a towing tank, jet tank, pipe flow facility, and tilting flume. In addition, the HIF provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks. The Engineering Group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently, be more accurate, and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation. HIF works directly with vendors to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the USGS. For instrument needs not currently met by a vendor, the Engineering Group designs, tests, and issues contracts to have HIF designed equipment made. Sometimes HIF will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass-produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone.

Most publications are available for inter-library loan within the United States. Under the Organic Act, which provided for the formation of the USGS, the library was given extra copies of all USGS publications when published to be used in exchange with other domestic and foreign geological agencies, making the acquisition of the USGS Library collection one of the most cost efficient libraries in the U.S. government. USGS publications are available for purchase at USGS Store. Many USGS published reports are available to view and access on-line from the USGS Publications Warehouse, while many USGS publications are now available online via the USGS Publications Warehouse. Many older USGS publications have been scanned and digitized by such services as Google Books and the Hathi Trust and Internet Archive. An online search will quickly reveal if a digital version is available. All USGS publications are public domain.  History  Prompted by a report from the National Academy of Sciences, the USGS was created, by a last-minute amendment, to an act of Congress on March 3, 1879. It was charged with the \\"classification of the public lands, and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain\\". This task was driven by the need to inventory the vast lands added to the United States by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848. The legislation also provided that the Hayden, Powell, and Wheeler surveys be discontinued as of June 30, 1879. Clarence King, the first director of USGS, assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies. After a short tenure, King was succeeded in the director's chair by John Wesley Powell. =List of USGS directors= Clarence King, first director of the USGS * 1879‚Äì1881 Clarence King * 1881‚Äì1894 John Wesley Powell * 1894‚Äì1907 Charles Doolittle Walcott * 1907‚Äì1930 George Otis Smith * 1930‚Äì1943 Walter Curran Mendenhall * 1943‚Äì1956 William Embry Wrather * 1956‚Äì1965 Thomas Brennan Nolan * 1965‚Äì1971 William Thomas Pecora * 1971‚Äì1978 Vincent Ellis McKelvey * 1978‚Äì1981 Henry William Menard * 1981‚Äì1993 Dallas Lynn Peck * 1994‚Äì1997 Gordon P.

The station was to be in the Laurence Harbor section of Old Bridge, New Jersey. The station was first proposed in the 1980s, although no progress was made until August 2001, when the transportation officials said the official station could be constructed within several years. After several years of proposals, along with the passing of a high opposer in 2003, the station came up once again in 2008. That year, the proposed Metropark South was brought back to the Old Bridge council by developer Michael Alfieri. His proposal also brought up the plans for new residential homes, commercial businesses along with the new station. The proposal was conditionally accepted in November of that year. As of 2009, there is no forward on the actual station being constructed.  History = 1985 proposal and 2001 proposal = The location of Laurence Harbor in Middlesex County and New Jersey The idea for a station in Laurence Harbor was first proposed by developer in Michael Alfieri in 1985. His original proposal in the community was to create and constructed a so-called \\"Metropark South\\", to consist of residential homes, commercial businesses, and a brand-new train station. The proposal received approval, but only the residential portion of the proposal was ever built. This residential area, consisting of high-class townhouses, is known as \\"Bridgepointe\\". In August 2001, several years after the partially constructed project was started, the staff at New Jersey Transit proposed the design and construction of a station at Laurence Harbor near Exit 120 on the Garden State Parkway, which would serve the North Jersey Coast Line. At that time, the tracks passed through Laurence Harbor between the South Amboy and Aberdeen- Matawan stations. A spokesperson from New Jersey Transit reported that the state is working with Old Bridge Township (where Laurence Harbor is a part) to make preliminary designs. The costs for the designs began around $300,000 (2001 USD) for a two-year study. The station was proposed to relieve major congestion on four of the major state highways in the community including Route 18, Route 34, Route 35, and U.S. Route 9. Old Bridge's mayor, Barbara Cannon, gave full support for the new station, who previously passed a unanimous resolution for the proposal. The township also reported that this would help qualify Old Bridge as a city and receive more state funding. A week later, the figures for a brand-new station at Laurence Harbor were released, saying the station would take five years to construct, with costs ranging from $25 million-$30 million (2001 USD) of funding from the state of New Jersey and the federal government. The station would also relieve the busy Aberdeen- Matawan station, which at the time hosted about 3,500 commuters daily. Most of the city council and mayor supported the deal, except for councilman Joseph Hoff. Hoff believed the train station was a good idea, but there were a number of outstanding issues before plans for one could go forward. Hoff stated that the additional truck traffic and the safety of the pedestrians in the area were also a concern. These concerns would also get worse when the Atrium II office complex would be completed on the western side of Exit 120. Another major issue was the traffic congestion at Exit 120 itself, which at rush hour was \\"atrocious\\". By November 2002, the station had not received any studies on the general location were not conducted by New Jersey Transit. Although the proposal still had support by the community, several citizens, including Joseph Hoff, were still questioning it. Hoff cited that New Jersey Transit has not put any interest forward and would just end up becoming another parking lot rather than a tax revenue. He reported however, that if residential homes and commercial businesses were constructed, it would be beneficial to Laurence Harbor. The other issue that Hoff maintained, was that it would risk the lives of children heading to and from Laurence Harbor Memorial School by affecting the traffic in the area. = 2008 proposal = After the 2002 report by Joseph Hoff, the township councilman in opposition to the Laurence Harbor train station, the 74-year-old politician himself died on November 20, 2003. The proposal for the new train station began to wane for sometime, until 2005, when Aliferi, the designer and constructor of \\"Bridgepointe\\" returned to the township board. This time Aliferi proposed the continuation of construction for the two decade-old project, with several community groups either opposing the plan, or raising concerns. The proposal was to include a seven-story hotel, 83 single-family homes, two parking garages and of retail space. The local highway, Laurence Parkway, would also receive improvements to better handle the new development. Concerns were also raised by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the agency that governs the Garden State Parkway, about the effects on the off-ramp for Exit 120. On February 8, 2006, the Old Bridge Township Council turned over on a 7-0 vote for the new development. Aliferi sued the township, taking the case to the New Jersey Superior Court. A judge sided with Aliferi, citing that the developer can bring the proposal back to the council. On February 21, 2007, the proposal was rejected again, partially citing that Aliferi has no interest in building the hotel or the offices. On November 17, 2008, Aliferi returned yet again to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction to begin with a condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi would also have to return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.

The Fund was notable for being the first time that mandatory money (in the form of a mandatory annual transfer to USDA from the U.S. Treasury) was provided for research programs, which traditionally receive discretionary funds as provided annually by Congressional appropriators. One-third of the fund was designated for competitive agricultural research grants, one-third for rural development projects, and one-third for either research or rural development, at the Secretary‚Äôs discretion. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) authorized the U.S. Treasury to transfer $100 million annually to the Fund for 3 years, but a recision reduced that to $80 million. The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 (P.L.105-185) extended the authority for the program through FY2003 with an annual transfer to USDA of $60 million.

It was affiliated originally with the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and later the United Methodist Church. It began as an elementary school and ended its days as a four-year college. Portrait of Susan Ann Bennett of Richmond, Kentucky History Susan Ann \\"Sue\\" Bennett (1843‚Äì1891) was a social activist and Southern Methodist church leader from Richmond, Kentucky. When the Woman's Department of Church Extension was created by the Southern Methodist General Conference in 1886, Sue Bennett was appointed the Corresponding Secretary from Kentucky. She studied the region in eastern Kentucky and found that there were several counties there without churches of any denomination and a desperate need for schools. In 1890 the General Conference established the Woman's Parsonage and Home Mission Society as a department of the Board of Church Extension. As an appointed member of the Society's Central Committee, Sue Bennett began the work to establish a school in the southeastern Kentucky mountains. She died before her work was finished. Her younger sister, Isabel \\"Belle\\" Harris Bennett (1852-1922) took her place on the Central Committee and, appointed as the Superintendent of Mountain Work, began the process of establishing the school. Belle H. Bennett recruited Reverend John J. Dickey who had already established an academy in Jackson, Kentucky (later Lees College). Together with the Board of Missions General Secretary Walter Russell Lambuth, they petitioned local businesses and organizations for support. They were first offered a site in Manchester, but this plan fell through - then the citizens of London agreed to put $20,000 for a site and building for a school. This was matched by a $20,000 pledge from the Woman's Pasonage and Home Mission Society for its maintenance. Rev. Dickey worked with the leaders in London to purchase a campus of twenty-two acreas. He then sold his school in Jackson and moved to London to manage the establishment of the new school. Sue Bennett Memorial School circa 1898 On June 25, 1896, Belle Harris Bennett held a dedication ceremony for the school building's cornerstone which was blessed by Bishop E.R. Hendrix. Rev. Dickey had already recruited 75 students and a faculty of three; and, because the new building was not yet ready, the Sue Bennett Memorial School opened on January 2, 1897, in a rented building in London (formerly the Laurel County Seminary). Five months later, the school had enrolled 210 students. The new building was finally finished in the fall of 1897. It cost $12,000 and could take as many as 300 students. Belle Harris Bennett hired Professor James C. Lewis, a graduate of Bristol University in England, as Principal. He and his wife worked at the school for 19 years. Bennett continued with fundraising: they built eight cottages on campus (each with a mother or older sister as housekeeper) and first a dormitory for girls (named in honor of Miss Lucinda Helm, an early proponent of women missionary work). Next, they constructed the Ellen Burdette Home which served as the principal's house. The Memorial Hall (a dormitory for boys) was funded by the Twentieth Century Educational Campaign of the Church. The school offered elementary classes which by 1901 served as a Model Laboratory for students to learn how to teach when they returned to their own communities. High school classes included traditional curricula as well as music and business classes. When Kentucky required the establishment of high schools in every county, in 1910 Laurel County used the Sue Bennett Memorial School, furnishing one additional teacher. In 1922 the school became a junior college, and its name was changed to Sue Bennett College. In 1932 it received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. A new president, Paul Bunnell, was elected in the fall of 1991 who added four new sports programs for the following season: football, men's soccer, women's volleyball and cross country. The athletic programs, which were to be hosted off-campus, were projected to add 50 students to campus without increasing administrative costs, but the enrollment growth never came. Additionally, the new president pushed to begin a four-year business degree program. Other programs, such as social service, paralegal, nursing, secretarial services, law enforcement and education, were also proposed. Closing Finances remained unstable at the college for years. By the mid-1990s, the $2 million debt load was being used to cover student financial aid. Vendors were complaining about bills not being paid, followed by complaints from faculty that retirement benefits withheld from their salaries were not being paid. In June 1997, its accreditation was recommended for removal due to a lack of educational resources, technology and guidelines, an unclear institutional purpose and poor finances. It was formally stripped on September 22. On October 6, the United States Department of Education imposed an emergency action against Sue Bennett College, issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate the institution from participation in the federal student financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The college requested a hearing to appeal that proceeding. The appeal was based on SBC's pending litigation versus the Eastern District of Kentucky to have the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reinstate its accreditation. However, Judge Richard I. Slippen rejected SBC's request, and thus the possibility of continued federal financial assistance was dead. The United Methodist Daily News issued this statement in December: :After 101 years of educating students, United Methodist-related Sue Bennett College in London, Ky, closed its doors Nov. 26, the end of the fall semester. The college was stripped of its accreditation Sept. 22 by Southern Association of Colleges and Schools because of ongoing financial and administrative problems. The school was notified in June that the association had recommended its removal from its list of approved members. The trustees appealed the decision and diligently worked to save the school - including launching a fund-raising campaign - but the appeal was not successful. Without accreditation, no federal or state funds were available to Sue Bennett students and the State of Kentucky withdrew the school's license to teach effective Nov. 26. Several of the school's programs and many of the school's students were absorbed by nearby Union College in Barbourville, Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia and Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg. In addition, the University of the Cumberlands also serves as the official custodian for the academic records of Sue Bennett College. =Redevelopment= Southern side of the Sue Bennett Memorial School Building in 2014London-native Jim Hayes, the eldest son of former president Earl Hayes, acquired the former Sue Bennett campus in early 2014. The campus at the time was being used for by Laurel County Adult Education, Sunrise Children's Services, and Connect Church, and one of the dormitories was reused as an apartment complex. Hayes‚Äô goals were to reuse the Administration Building for an antique store, and for an alumni suite, clear out Helm Hall of its dormitory supplies, and secure the Belle Bennett Auditorium. Hayes also planned to lease the swimming pool in the Scoville Building to the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad for $1 per year.

A member of a distinguished Warwickshire family, son of Sir George Throckmorton and his wife Catherine Vaux (daughter of Nicholas Vaux and Elizabeth FitzHugh) and the brother of the influential diplomat Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and Robert Throckmorton and cousin of Henry VIII's last Queen, Catherine Parr, Throckmorton sat in nine Parliaments between 1542 and 1572, representing Warwick four times and Warwickshire twice as well as three other scattered boroughs (Devizes, Sudbury and West Looe). He also had a successful military record, and was appointed Constable of Kenilworth Castle in 1553, a post he held until his death. He acquired the estate of Haseley in Warwickshire in 1554 from his uncle, who had himself acquired it from the Crown after the attainder of its previous owner, the Duke of Northumberland. He also enhanced his fortune through successful trading, and was a founder member of the Muscovy Company. Throckmorton was a reliable but moderate Protestant, although one of his brothers remained a Catholic, which cast a shadow of doubt over Clement's allegiances, and he himself was loyal to Queen Mary while she was on the throne. However, his son, Job, was later one of the most active lay supporters of the Puritan opposition, and was deeply involved in the publication of the Marprelate Tracts.

The current dean of the school is Professor Gillian Douglas. History Law has been taught at King's College London since 1831. It was originally taught within the Senior Department. In 1839, teaching transferred to the Department of General Literature and Science in response to the need for a greater differentiation of the syllabus for students of the Senior Department at the King's. Law became part of a broad faculty of subjects and classes that provided a core liberal syllabus in the arts and sciences available to all students of King's. From 1893, it was known as the Division of Laws and Economics under the Faculty of Arts. The Faculty of Laws was founded in 1909 and became known as the School of Law in 1991. The school took its current name in 2012 in recognition of Hong Kong businessman Sir Dickson Poon, who made a gift of ¬£20 million to the school. It is thought to be the largest-ever donation to a British or European law faculty at the time. The school is in the heart of legal London. It was previously housed in a row of buildings adjacent to the Strand and Embankment along the River Thames. On 7 December 2009, it was announced that the school would relocate to the East Wing of Somerset House, a prominent example of neo-classical architecture, designed by Sir William Chambers in the late eighteenth century on the site of an earlier Tudor palace. Negotiations for the new lease are said to have taken some 180 years. In February 2012, the refurbished East Wing was officially opened by the patron of the college, Queen Elizabeth II. The first dean of the school was David Caron, formerly of the University of California, Berkeley. Caron's appointment followed the renaming of the school and its new focus on transnational law. The school is also one of the ten international law schools that are members of the Center for Transnational Legal Studies (CTLS). Caron describes the typical graduate of the school as \\"a transnational, global, lawyer with [...] roots in the historic tradition of the English common law that has influenced, and in turn been influenced by, much of the world, and in the more recent tradition of European Union law. They 'think global' because we teach them with a transnational perspective.\\" Education The Maughan Library on Chancery Lane, across from the Law Society and the Royal Courts of Justice, houses the school's law library. The school provides legal instruction at undergraduate and graduate levels. It offers a three-year undergraduate LLB programme. Candidates are required to take the National Admissions Test for Law (LNAT) as part of the admissions process. In addition to the three-year undergraduate LLB, the school offers a number of joint programmes with partner institutions around the world including the United States (Columbia University), France (Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne), Germany (Humboldt University), Hong Kong (University of Hong Kong), and Australia (Monash University). The school offers a four-year LLB in law with transnational legal studies as part of its work with the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies. In 2012, the school saw the admission of its first cohort for its LLB in philosophy, politics, and law, a four-year multi- disciplinary degree that will build on the work of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Philosophy, Politics & Law. The school also offers Ivy-League style scholarships based on academic merit awarded to students who demonstrate academic excellence, outstanding potential, and life ambition. Graduate programmes include full-time and part-time LLM and MA programmes, as well as distance-learning courses for legal practitioners. Since 2007 the school has conferred its own Master of Laws (LLM) degree, having previously been a contributor to the University of London intercollegiate programme. Those who study for the degree may elect to take a specialisation in one of several of the school's strengths, including international commercial law, international financial law and European Union law. The school also offers a dual degree with ESSEC Business School in France and the Global School of Law in Lisbon. The school offers a full-time graduate research programme leading to the award of the PhD in law. The school has 80 doctoral researchers. The school has hosted the annual International Graduate Legal Research Conference since 2007. The Graduate Legal Research Society arranges educational and social events for the doctoral researcher community and liaises with school management on behalf of the community. Finally, the school is one of six constituent law faculties within the University of London - along with those of University College London, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University London, the School of Oriental & African Studies and Birkbeck, University of London - that collectively oversee and examine an intercollegiate LLB offered by distance learning and awarded by the university at large through its University of London Worldwide scheme. One of the largest legal education programs by enrollment globally, it lays claim to being the oldest LLB program grounded in the law of England & Wales with roots dating to the 1890's. Research The school is host to research projects funded by the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the European Commission. The school includes various research centres and groups which serve as focal points for research activity. These include the Centre of European Law, established in 1974, the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, established in 1978, and the Centre of British Constitutional Law and History, established in 1988. In 2013, the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy & Law was established following a ¬£7 million gift from Mark Yeoh (LLB graduate) and his family. The school has undertaken significant investment in the field of transnational law in recent years and has established an Institute of Transnational Law led by Peer Zumbansen. Publications The school publishes the scholarly King's Law Journal, as well as the King's Student Law Review. The Centre of European Law publishes a paper series, Working Papers in European Law. The International State Crime Initiative publishes a range of reports, commentaries, and other materials on state crime. The faculty at the school are regular authors of monographs, scholarly treatises and articles, and contributions to periodicals.

The house is notable because of its remodelling in 1907 by Frank Lloyd Wright. It was the centerpiece of the Fabyans country estate, which they named Riverbank. The Kane County Forest Preserve District of Illinois purchased the majority of the Fabyan estate in 1939, and operated the Fabyan's home as a museum off and on beginning in 1940. In 1995 Preservation Partners of the Fox Valley was enlisted to operate the site and developed the Fabyan Villa Museum into a Fabyan historic home museum, where photographs, the Fabyans' personal artifact collections, and a limited number of original furnishings, as well as the Riverbank story are shared with the public. Fabyan country estate, Riverbank George Fabyan was a millionaire businessman who had a thirst for knowledge. Inheritance from his tycoon-father's textile business, Bliss, Fabyan & Co. provided the financial foundation from which the Colonel and his wife, Nelle, established their legacy. Riverbank, their estate on the Fox River in Geneva, Illinois spanned approximately and featured, among other things, a Japanese Garden, private zoo, Roman-style swimming pool, greenhouses, gardens, grottoes, a lighthouse, a Dutch-style windmill, a country club, a small farm and a scientific laboratory complex. The mid-1800s farmhouse that the Fabyans acquired in 1905 was dubbed by them, The Villa. In 1907, the farmhouse was extensively redesigned by Wright, who added a south wing, three verandas, and large eaves to achieve a cruciform modestly Prairie- style country house. Other hallmarks of Wright's organic architecture found in the Fabyan Villa are geometric window motifs, 'light screens' (bands of windows), string-coursing, open floor plan, and wood-spindle screening. In 1910, the Fabyans hired Taro Otsuka to design a Japanese-style garden below the villa. The one-acre garden was developed over the next several years, and from 1918 on, maintained by Susumu Kobayashi, a Japanese immigrant gardener. Japanese gardens were popular amongst the upper class, and it was a well-known attraction throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Although neglected for decades after the Fabyans, the Fabyan Japanese Garden was renovated beginning in 1974, and today contains restored and replicated original elements including a pond, waterfall, moon bridge, oversized lantern, and teahouse. In 1914, the Fabyans purchased a windmill located on a farm near what is now Elmhurst, Illinois and had it relocated to the east bank of the Fox River across from the Villa on acreage acquired that same year. The Fabyan Windmill is unique due to the bakery it houses that according to legend, was used to bake bread for the Fabyans' pet bears. During war-time rationing, the Windmill was used to grind grain for the surrounding community; a deed that was later honored by means of a U.S. postal stamp. Riverbank Laboratories Between 1912 and 1922, Fabyan created Riverbank Laboratories, the first privately owned research facility in the United States. In fact, the National Security Agency has recognized Riverbank Laboratories as the birthplace of cryptology and has honored Fabyan for his associated services to the United States' government. Nearly all American military World War I cryptography was done at Fabyan's laboratories, where Elizabeth Wells Gallup and her staff of assistants, including Elizebeth Friedman and William F. Friedman, had spent several years honing cryptology skills and methodology searching for proof of Sir Francis Bacon's authorship of Shakespeare's plays using Bacon's own ciphers. This site also contained George's and Nelle's private library and museum. In 1918, Fabyan built the first reverberation chamber in the US for Harvard physicist Wallace Clement Sabine, the pioneer researcher in architectural acoustics. The acoustic laboratory is still in use today as a testing facility. ReferencesBibliography * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion. University Of Chicago Press, 2006, (S.129).

The group is currently composed of founder members Blixa Bargeld (lead vocals; guitar; keyboard) and N.U. Unruh (custom- made instruments; percussion; vocals), long-time contributor Alexander Hacke (bass; vocals), plus Jochen Arbeit (guitar; vocals), and Rudolf Moser (custom- built instruments; percussion; vocals), who both joined the line-up in 1997. One of their trademarks is the use of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted and screamed above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements. History=1980s= On 1 April 1980, made their first appearance, at the Moon Club in West Berlin. This first lineup featured Beate Bartel and Gudrun Gut, Blixa Bargeld, and N.U. Unruh. The two female members, Bartel and Gut, left the band after a short period and founded Mania D. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Hacke (alias Alexander von Borsig), a sound technician and multi- instrumentalist who was 15 years old at the time, joined the band and became a longtime member. In 1981, the percussionist F.M. Einheit (from the Hamburg band ) joined and they released their first LP, (English: \\"Collapse\\"), a mixture of rough punk tunes and industrial noises. The industrial noises were obtained from self-made music machines, electronics, and found objects such as metal plates. The live performances with Einheit in the 1980s included much metal banging and destruction on stage. During their first German tour, Mark Chung (previously the bass player with ) joined the group of musicians. This lineup lasted nearly 15 years. In 1983, recorded their second album, (English: \\"Drawings of Patient O.T.\\"). The title came from a 1974 book by Leo Navratil, describing the drawings of Oswald Tschirtner. It was also a guest performer on Fad Gadget's \\"Collapsing New People\\" 7\\" single's B-side track Spoil The Child, recorded at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin in November 1983. Also in 1983, Bargeld joined the band The Birthday Party (featuring Nick Cave and Mick Harvey) as a guitarist. That group soon disbanded, but Bargeld became a longtime member of one of the bands that sprang from it, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (again featuring Cave and Harvey). Bargeld remained a full-time member of both and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds until 2003, when he quit the Bad Seeds in order to focus on . In 1984, , with guests including Genesis P-Orridge, Stevo Pearce, Frank Tovey and others, played a show titled The Concerto for Voices and Machinery at the ICA in London. After 20 minutes the venue halted the show when the band began to dig through the venue's stage with drills and jackhammers. 1984 also saw the first release of a best-of and rarities compilation, Strategies Against Architecture 80-83. The band's next album, (English: \\"Half Man\\") in 1985, may be seen as a developmental breakthrough. Musical structure became more evident, and Bargeld's lyrics and, especially, his singing changed. He moved from shouted words and phrases toward organized, poetic melodies. The band played a show in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to kick off its third North American tour. The performance was sponsored by the German Goethe Institute as part of the German contribution to Expo 86. Also scheduled to appear were Test Dept and Skinny Puppy, though not everyone was able to play. On the tour, the group's experimental and improvised live performance style occasionally caused difficulties with venue management and law enforcement. A performance at The Palladium in Manhattan ended 30 minutes into the set after an improvised pyrotechnics display. The band ignited lighter fluid in a couple of metal pans, and management stopped the performance and cleared the venue. The one-hour film Halber Mensch (1986) by S≈çgo Ishii documents 's visit to Japan in 1985. The next two albums, (English: \\"Five on the open-ended Richterscale\\") in 1987 and (English: \\"House of the Lie\\") in 1989, were great successes in the United States and Japan. =1990s= In 1990, the band tried something completely new, recording the soundtrack for East German playwright Heiner M√ºller's play (English: \\"The Hamlet Machine\\") for East German radio ., Rough Trade Records, 1991 The band image of changed: Blixa Bargeld, formerly wearing punk/industrial style clothes, appeared at the live concerts in a suit. 1991 also saw the release of the double album, a best-of and rarities album, Strategies Against Architecture II. This collection included a musical setting of Heiner M√ºller's piece (English: \\"Explosion of a Memory\\" or \\"Description of a Picture\\"). In Vienna, May 1992, performed at The Academy of Fine Arts' 300th anniversary in a show by Erich Wonder, (English: \\"The eye of the typhoon\\"). The next album, Tabula Rasa (1993), was an important turning point in the band's history, the music becoming softer and containing more electronic sounds. In 1993, the band was booked to support U2 during the European leg of the Zoo TV Tour, but were thrown off the stage and off the tour when a band member threw an iron bar into the booing crowd. Mark Chung left the band in 1994 after the recording of for Werner Schwab's play, and made a career in the music industry. F.M. Einheit, who contributed much to the music and sound of the band, left the band a short time later in 1995, during the recording of the album, at least partially because of a conflict with Bargeld. The last track Einheit worked on was .see the booklet for Strategies Against Architecture III Roland Wolf replaced them on bass guitar and keyboards only a short time before dying in a car accident in 1995. A short time later, the band released the album (English: \\"Ending New\\") in 1996. The title is wordplay on the band's own name (i.e. \\"\\"). The song Stella Maris ‚Äì a duet between Bargeld and Hacke's then- wife, singer Meret Becker ‚Äì became quite famous; a world tour followed the release. During this time, Jochen Arbeit and Rudi Moser (both members of ) joined the band: Arbeit on guitar, and Moser on drums, with Hacke switching to bass guitar. This lineup, accompanied by Ash Wednesday on keyboards for live concerts, has held ever since. In 1997, the album Remixes was released, which featured remixes of the songs from by artists such as Barry Adamson, Pan Sonic and Darkus (alias Mark Rutherford); Darkus's remix tracks, with others not included on Remixes, were made available separately in the same year on The NNNAAAMMM Remixes By Darkus release. =2000s= Live at \\"Tollhaus\\" in Karlsruhe, May 2000: Alexander Hacke (left) and Blixa Bargeld (right) From 27 March to 23 May 2000, celebrated their 20th birthday with a \\"20th anniversary tour\\", playing in the Columbiahalle, Berlin on its birthday, 1 April, and released the album Silence Is Sexy, followed by a world tour. 2001 also saw the release of another double best-of and rarities album, Strategies Against Architecture III. Since 2001, albums and web projects have been partially produced and supported by Bargeld's wife, Erin Zhu, who also serves as webmaster of 's website. In 2002, began work on a new album without the backing of a record label, relying instead upon fan (\\"supporter\\") participation in an experiment of a type of Street Performer Protocol combined with an internet community and touches of the patronage system. An exclusive Supporter Album No. 1, and the Airplane Miniatures EP following, were made available in 2003. Bargeld left Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in 2003. In order to go on tour, the band reneged on the idea of creating a supporter-only album, and cooperated with Mute Records to go on tour and release Perpetuum Mobile in 2004. Air sounds, such as blowing the plastic pipes with an air compressor, were greatly explored and used for this album: the working title of the album was, for a long while, (English: \\"Change of air\\"). A half-hour documentary about the supporters project, , was made by Ste van Holm and Dihcar, and is available on YouTube. The live shows of the Perpetuum Mobile Tour were recorded by the band's sound engineers, then burned on CDRs with individual pictures of each show taken by Danielle de Picciotto and sold directly after the concerts; numerous \\"official\\" live albums were created during this tour as a result. In November 2004, the band went on a mini-tour, which included a supporters-only performance at Berlin's . The performance was filmed and coordinated by Danielle de Picciotto and Ian Williamson and released on the exclusive supporter's DVD at the end of Phase II. The band also started a new project called in early 2005. The first CD, , was sent out in May 2005, and was also available for download to subscribers. The project was a \\"line of releases intended to give the band an outlet for more experimental impulses and exploration.\\" albums were released roughly every 3 months. The second CD, (English: \\"Incredible noise\\"), was finished on 15 August, and shipped out (as well as posted for download) shortly after. Phase II of the Supporter's project finished in August 2005, and the official site was taken down on 20 September. The supporter album (English: \\"Plot of Land\\") and DVD (containing footage from the November 2004 performance in Berlin) was shipped in early October 2005. No. 3 (English: \\"Solo bass-spring\\"), released 8 December, is a collection of bass spring compositions by the individual members of . Phase III of the Supporter's project started on 10 February. On 25 February, the fourth part of the series, Redux Orchestra versus Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, was completed. One of the new additions to Phase III started in March 2006 was a piece-by-piece album, Jewels, finally finished in August 2007. Danielle de Picciotto, Alexander Hacke's wife and longtime companion, released the DVD documentary - On tour with .org which describes the supporter project in detail, having interviewed international supporters during the Perpetuum Mobile tour in 2004. No. 5 (English: \\"Cassettes\\"), finished 15 May with release scheduled for 31 May. At the same time, (English: \\"Everything of any use\\"), an album that had been in the work since Phase 2, were completed. The album consists of rare live tracks, handpicked by 6 supporters of Phase 2 and mixed by Boris Wilsdorf. This was quickly followed by No. 6 (English: \\"Piano music\\"), released on 31 August. In October, Neubauten released a public DVD, the recording made at . No. 7 (English: \\"Voice Remainders\\") was released on 2 December, consisting of vocal experiments, vocal recordings, and manipulations of voice recordings, enriched with leftover instrumental tracks made with polystyrene, electronic pulses, Hammond organ, bass guitar, and metal percussion. It was announced on the band's website that it would be undertaking a \\"small (mostly) UK tour\\" in April 2007, but playing in Hannover on 22 April beforehand. No. 8 (English: \\"Wine spirits\\") was released on 6 April, forming the final instalment of the series. A new commercial album was made available later in the year, the first release since 2004's Perpetuum Mobile. The new album, (English: \\"All open again\\"), was released in 2007 without the backing of a label, a move the band had intended to make with Perpetuum Mobile.

(English: \\"new buildings\\") is a general term referring to buildings constructed in Germany after 1945. These are often regarded as cheaper, flimsier, and less aesthetically attractive than , or pre-1945, especially pre-modernist buildings. Due to the extensive destruction throughout Germany during the Second World War, and the extensive rebuilding thereafter, constitute a very familiar element of German cities. The band's name attracted unexpected attention when on 21 May 1980, not two months after the band's forming, the roof of the Berlin Congress Hall famously collapsed, killing one person and injuring many. The resulting media attention surrounding the collapse of the German-American icon gave the meaning of their name a new dimension.

For example, a packer might agree to pay a hog producer the average cash market price on the day the hogs will be delivered, plus a 2-cent per-pound premium. Such transactions have been used widely in agriculture, particularly for livestock. Users believe that formula pricing brings efficiency and predictability to markets transactions. However, as the use of formula pricing expands, fewer animals are sold in cash markets, where prices are more widely reported and understood by producers. Some of these producers believe that formula pricing makes it harder to determine the true value of their animals in the marketplace, and creates greater opportunity for buyers to manipulate and pay lower prices.

The lava cools and breaks up as it encounters the water, with the resulting fragments filling in the adjacent seabed topography such that the flow can move further offshore sub-aerially. Lava deltas are generally associated with large-scale, effusive type basaltic volcanism. Occurrence Lava deltas are found mainly associated with volcanic islands, particularly those formed at hotspots as they produce the necessary effusive basaltic flows. The largest lava delta systems known are associated with formation of volcanic type passive margins. Just prior to break-up along the northern Atlantic in the late Paleocene, massive eruptions occurred along the eventual line of break-up. This volcanism, part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, led to the formation of two extensive lava escarpments, interpreted as deltas,Ki√∏rb√∏e, L. 1999.

Seismic imaging through basalt flows on the Faroe Shelf. Presentation at Petex. Formation 160px 160px When a sub-aerial lava flow reaches the ocean (or other large body of water), contact with the water causes both rapid cooling of the lava and steam explosions that fragment it. The glassy fragments that are formed, known as hyaloclastites, fall down to the seabed forming foresets. As the seabed topography becomes infilled, the subaerial flow is able to build out. The process continues as long as the lava supply is maintained, creating a lava bench. A lava bench is a volcanic landform with a horizontal surface raised above the level of the surrounding area. The Hawaiian islands are an example of land that was formed this way, and the Big Island is currently still expanding due to lava benches. The Kilauea Volcano releases lava that flows down the slope of the volcano and eventually encounters the ocean; this lava flow hardens when it comes into contact with the significantly cooler water of the ocean and forms an unstable lava bench. Eventually, when the material beneath the lava bench stabilizes, it becomes stable land that has been added to the island. Most lava deltas are formed by relatively low viscosity Pahoehoe type flows and the lava reaches the sea via a system of small lava tubes, their entry into the water being marked by a series of steam plumes. Hazards Collapse of the frontal part of lava deltas is common during their formation, representing a hazard for any people that are watching from a solidified part of the delta and such areas are normally marked as dangerous.When Lava Enters the Sea: Growth & Collapse of Lava Deltas, Hawaiian Volcanic Observatory, USGS If a newly formed lava bench rests on sediments, it may pose hazards due to its extremely unstable structure. Oftentimes, these benches are so unstable that they collapse into the sea, exposing the water to the hot lava on the interior of the bench and releasing acres of land into the ocean. When the hot lava hits the water, violent explosions of steam can shoot large rocks and molten lava up to inland. These collapses are extremely dangerous because they can happen without warning, and anyone or anything on the bench will be caught in the collapse. For safety, people are advised not to walk on lava benches because of their unstable nature, and they must maintain a safe distance from the lava bench.Advertiser, Final. Big Island gets smaller as lava bench breaks off Honolulu Advertiser, The (HI) 04 Aug. 2006: NewsBank. Web. 26 Oct. 2016. People standing too close to the edge of an active delta are not only at risk from being thrown in the water but from the steam explosions and the accompanying acidic clouds (laze) that result from the collapse as seawater comes into contact with the active lava tube system.

She was elected the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 2016, the second woman and the first in 64 years to hold this position. In her first presidential address, she discussed the importance of a healthy lifestyle for a safe pregnancy, and the risks of obesity. Regan graduated from the Royal Free Hospital, London in 1980 before becoming a registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital, Cambridge. She was awarded an MD thesis after a secondment to the Medical Research Council‚Äôs Embryo and Gamete Research Group before moving to London to be consultant and senior lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, where she is now chair and head of the department. In March 2007, she featured in the BBC's Prof Regan's Beauty Parlour. She was one of the first women to hold a chair in obstetrics and gynaecology in the UK, the first being Margaret Fairlie (1891-1963) who was appointed Professor of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the University of Dundee in 1940. She is also co-director of the UK‚Äôs Baby Bio Bank (BBB); a pregnancy tissue archive which will underpin future translational research into the major complications of pregnancy. The Baby Bio Bank was established on 1 November 2013, by two London Universities, University College London and Imperial College London, with funding by Wellbeing of Women. They collect samples from the three key members of the family: mother, father and baby, allowing hereditary factors from both parents to be tracked. They require a sample of blood from mother and father and a piece of term placenta which is routinely discarded. Regan was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to women's healthcare.  Publications  She has written several books on pregnancy and miscarriage including Your Pregnancy Week by Week, and Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know. Her book, Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know , written in 2018, explores how one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage and how it is the most common complication of pregnancy and also one of the least understood. Professor Lesley Regan is the first woman to hold a chair on obstetrics and gynaecology in the country and for the past decade she has worked to establish the biggest miscarriage clinic in the world. This book gives up-to-date information on the many causes of miscarriage and the latest treatments available. It covers the chances of a successful pregnancy, how to prepare for and cope with the next pregnancy, infertility, and gives answers to the most commonly asked questions on the subject of miscarriage. Revised and updated to take account of the latest developments in the study of miscarriage, this book is the book everyone who has ever suffered a miscarriage will need.

Life and career Hideto Aki was born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan in 1970. He tells how AV Idol Hitomi Kobayashi came to his neighborhood video rental shop when he was 17 and he shook hands with her and more than 10 years later he still remembered how small and cute her hand was. He said about the event (in his 1999 \\"Diary\\"): \\"At the time I didn't even imagine that I would do this kind of work. Now, I can't imagine doing anything else.\\" Although he says he always enjoyed pink films, especially the \\"Four Devils\\" (or \\"Four Heavenly Kings of Pink\\"), he is doubtful about trying to use dramatic stories in AV. He prefers to work in the documentary style much used in Japanese porn, feeling that fiction and sex don't mix well (\\"If so, it is better [to] watch pink cinema\\"). He says he has to do it sometimes when the production side wants it or if they are using a famous actress but he describes dramatic AV as \\"director's masturbation\\". Aki received his early training in the AV industry from Hot Entertainment and that company's founder Shungo Kaji. By late 1998, Aki was working for the Kuki studio and in a series of \\"Behind-the-scenes Diaries\\" from March to December 1999, he described his techniques and methods of working with actresses while making videos for Kuki. He also directed for the adult channel Cherry Bomb on the Japanese satellite TV network SKY Perfect. Aki continued with Kuki through 2002 when he began directing regularly for KMP. By the end of 2004 he began working with S1 No. 1 Style and since that time he has directed more than 200 videos for S1, although he has continued to work for KMP and also occasionally for Moodyz and other studios.

St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street, in Dublin, Ireland, was built in the early 18th century following the establishment of the local Anglican parish in 1707. In the early 21st century the church presents itself as ecumenical within the tradition of the Church of Ireland.\\"Christians of all traditions are welcome to participate in all services and to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion,\\" according to the visitor's pamphlet of the church; see also the church website. Building history The building of the church in baroque style commenced in 1720, to a design by Isaac Wills. The current fa√ßade dates to the 19th century. In 1907, St. Ann's was listed as one of just six Dublin church buildings surviving from the 18th century.Samuel A. Ossory Fitzpatrick, Dublin: A Historical and Topographical Account of the City (London, 1907), p. 208, where the fa√ßade is described (p. 281) as \\"Norman.\\"http://archiseek.com/2011/1720-st-anns-church- dawson-st-dublin/http://archiseek.com/2010/1868-st-annes-church-of-ireland- dawson-street-dublin/ =Exterior and fa√ßade= St. Ann's original fa√ßade was never completed above the first floor. In 1868, a competition was held for a new fa√ßade, with the architectural firm of Lanyon, Lynn & Lanyon losing the commission to the Deanes, Thomas Newenham Deane and his father. The younger Deane, who had been involved with the creation of significant buildings at Oxford University, designed a neo-Romanesque front. Described by one travel guide as \\"amazingly ornate,\\"Margaret Greenwood et al., Ireland (Rough Guides, 2003, 7th ed.), p. 88 online. the fa√ßade as it exists in the 21st century lacks some elements of Deane's original conception, most significantly the tallest tower; the design as Deane submitted it can be viewed online. From an architectural perspective, this omission has been criticised as disrupting the building's flow from the rectory to the spire.\\"St Anne's Church of Ireland, Dawson Street, Dublin,\\" Archiseek. =Interior= Bread Shelf to the left of the altar The Georgian interior was designed by Isaac Wills, influenced by churches built by Christopher Wren but with variations characteristic of Irish architecture. The church underwent a major renovation in 2009.St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. St. Ann's is noted for its wood carving. The carved reredos, placed within a shallow rounded apse, shares an unusual decorative feature with the reredos of the former St. Mary's in Dublin: Corinthian pilaster capitals with twin acanthus scrolls. The acanthus frieze is carved with winged angels and bishop's mitre; the segmental pediment, with festoons of flowers. The craftsman's name is unrecorded.The Knight of Glin and James Peill, Irish Furniture: Woodwork and Carving in Ireland from the Earliest Times to the Act of Union (Yale University Press, 2007), pp. 41‚Äì42 online. The Bread Shelf A distinctive woodworking and charitable feature of St. Ann's is the Bread Shelf. Since 1723, as a result of a bequest by Lord Newton of Newtown Butler, the church has made daily bread available to anyone who chooses to receive it. The bread is placed near the altar on a shelf between acanthus-carved volutes. A photograph of the Bread Shelf may be viewed online. Stained glass windows Victorian-era stained glass replaced the original 18th-century clear windows. Some windows commemorate people associated with the church. Three windows in the south aisle are notable for their artistic merit; these were designed by Wilhelmina Geddes of the An T√∫r Gloine (Tower of Glass) studio for stained-glass artists. One on the north aisle was created by Geddes with Ethel Rhind. St. Ann's is said to contain \\"more stained glass than any other church in Dublin.\\" =The organ= Written sources from 1742 record a subscription drive for the purpose of purchasing an organ for the church. The case of the modern organ, located in the west gallery of the church, is presumed to remain from the original 18th-century instrument. William Telford built the organ in 1834. It has been renovated numerous times. In 1911, the water-powered blower was replaced with an electrical blower, and in 1925 the organ underwent a tubular pneumatic conversion with a new console.Stanley Monkhouse, \\"The Organ of St Ann's Church, Dawson Street, Dublin,\\" with a detailed technical description.

Made out of monastic buildings in addition to a church, they were built at the beginning of the 16th century by Margaret of Austria, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. The complex was designed as a dynastic burial place in the tradition of the Burgundian Champmol and C√Æteaux Abbey, and the French Saint-Denis. The church is known as the √âglise Saint-Nicolas- de-Tolentin de Brou in French. The church was built between 1506 and 1532 in a lavishly elaborate Flamboyant Gothic style, with some classicizing Renaissance aspects. The tall roof is covered in coloured, glazed tiles. Margaret, her second husband Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, and his mother, Margaret of Bourbon, are all buried in tombs by Conrad Meit within the church, which have avoided the destruction that most royal tombs in France have suffered. The monastery is the property of the town of Bourg-in-Bresse, which installed the municipal art collection in the buildings in 1922. The museum presents religious statues of the 13th to 17th centuries on the ground floor, and a collection of paintings of the 16th to the 20th centuries on the upper floor. The church and monastery have been classed as a monument historique since 1862. The buildings are in the care of the French state, and are managed by the Centre des monuments nationaux. Meit's tomb group Conrad Meit's career led him from his birthplace at Worms on the Rhine, to the Wittenberg court and finally to Cranach's workshop in Mechelen. There he is recorded as court sculptor for Archduchess Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Netherlands from 1512 to 1530. For her Meits completed his most famous masterpieces, the group of monumental royal tombs for Margaret, her husband Philibert II, Duke of Savoy and his mother Margaret of Bourbon, produced from 1526 onwards. These are at the then newly built Royal Monastery of Brou, today in France, but then in the province of Bresse, part of the Duchy of Savoy. Philibert had died at the age of 24 in 1504, so Meit's images of him are based on other portraits. His majestic grave monument is placed in the middle of the Abbey's choir, with the two female tombs set against the wall on either side of it. The three aligned figures are turned towards each other, as though in communication. Though to the side, Margaret's tomb is the largest.Burk, 11-18 Philibert's tomb consists of two levels and two effigies, one above the other. The upper part, in expensive imported white Carrara marble, represents the Duke in ceremonial costume, surrounded by Italian-style angels (putti). Below this, ten little female figures, the sibyls point towards the effigy. To the north, the tomb of Margaret of Bourbon consists of a single effigy placed within an enfeu and lying upon a piece of black marble, with pleurants beneath, a traditional Burgundian feature. The princess is dressed in an ermine cloak and her feet rest on a greyhound, symbol of loyalty. Behind the effigy, putti bear etuschons with the initials of Margaret and her husband. Margaret of Austria's tomb also has an upper effigy in marble and a lower one in alabaster. In the upper one she is shown as an older woman in dress of state, wearing the crown- like archducal hat. Below she is shown in her youth, wearing a loose robe with her long hair unbound, and somewhat idealized. The two lower figures of the married couple vary the normal \\"transi\\" or cadaver tomb iconography, where a lower figure is shown as decayed remains, and connects to a broader theme of Resurrection in the abbey's art. Below their formal effigies, the couple are shown in their most perfect state, as they would be at the resurrection of the dead.Burk, 11-18 NotesReferences *Burk, Jens Ludwig, \\"Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou\\", PDF version, Centre des monuments nationaux (France) - part of the online book below Gelfand, Laura D. ‚ÄúMargaret of Austria and the Encoding of Power in Patronage: The Funerary Foundation at Brou.‚Äù In Widowhood and Visual Culture in Early Modern Europe, edited by Allison Levy, 145-165.

Often, relational- cultural theory is aligned with the feminist and or multicultural movements in psychology. In fact, RCT embraces many social justice aspects from these movements. RCT was developed in Boston, Massachusetts in the 1970s through the work of psychiatrist, Jean Baker Miller (Toward a New Psychology of Women), psychologists, Judith V. Jordan, Janet Surrey, and Irene Stiver at the Stone Center at Wellesley College in reaction to psychodynamic theory. The Stone Center at Wellesley College and the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute are the hubs of RCT research and training and are perhaps best known for their Working Papers series, collective works that are continuously considered for review and reconsideration. As RCT was founded in strong feminist principles, and was started at Wellesley College, the movement's traditional focus was on women and their relational experiences.Jordan, J., Kaplan, A., Miller, J.B., Stiver, I., & Surrey, J. (1991). Women's Growth in Connection: Writings from the Stone Center. Harvard, MA: Harvard University Press. Many mental health professionals employ RCT in their practice. A nonexhaustive list of these include: counselors, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Some current major relational-cultural theorists, writers, and practitioners include: Judith V. Jordan, Ph D, Amy Banks, MD, Maureen Walker, Ph D, Linda Hartling, Ph D, Sarah Sydelle Price, PCC, and Thelma Duffey, Ph D Counseling and psychotherapy: theories and interventions Dave Capuzzi-Douglas Gross - John Wiley & Sons - 2014 The consistent, primary focus of RCT is the primacy of relationships. That is, relationships are both the indicators for, and the healing mechanism in psychotherapy toward, mental health and wellness. One of the core tenets of RCT is the Central Relational Paradox (CRP). The CRP assumes that we all have a natural drive toward relationships, and in these relationships we long for acceptance. However, we come to believe that there are things about us that are unacceptable or unlovable. Thus, we choose to hide these things; we keep them out of our relationships.Miller, J. B., Jordan, J., Stiver, I., Walker, M., Surrey, J., & Eldrige, N. (2004). Therapist‚Äôs Authenticity. In Jordan, J., Walker, M., & Hartling, L. (Eds.), The complexity of connection (pp. 64-89). New York: The Guilford Press. In the end, the connections we make with others are not as fulfilling and validating as they otherwise might have been. A primary goal of RCT is to create and maintain Mutually-Growth-Fostering Relationships, relationships in which both parties feel that they matter. In these healthy relationships, all of the involved parties experience what is known as the Five Good Things. These include: 1) a desire to move into more relationships, because of how a good relational experience feels; 2) a sense of zest, or energy; 3) increased knowledge of oneself and the other person in the relationship; 4) a desire to take action both in the growth-fostering relationship and outside of it; 5) an overall increased sense of worth.Robb, C. (2006). This Changes Everything: The Relational Revolution in Psychology. New York: Picador. RCT involves working with clients to identify, and strive in, relationships that present opportunities for them to experience Mutually-Growth-Fostering Relationships. In fact, a strong, connected therapeutic relationship should be a model for these kinds of relationships. While there a number of specific challenges presented in the therapeutic relationship, RCT practitioners believe that their relationships with their clients can have a reasonably high degree of mutuality. Clinical experiences of mutuality include: the client's movement toward the awareness that she/he matters to the therapist, the therapist that she/he, too, matters to the client, an integrative awareness both have of what it means to feel like one matters, and the worth involved in offering this to another person through the process of connection.

A double- decker bus carrying Dutch tourists left the highway on a bend at the exit for the town, hit a car and a metal crash barrier and overturned. Six Dutch tourists were killed and between 36 and 44 people, including the driver, were injured, some seriously. Background The bus carried 65 Dutch tourists, most on holidays booked through Sundio Group of Rotterdam, who had been visiting Barcelona for the day and were returning to hotels in Lloret de Mar and Blanes on the Costa Brava. The bus was locally hired, with a Spanish driver; there was a Dutch tour guide on board. Crash The crash occurred at around 11.10PM (2110 UTC) when the bus left the C-32 highway at the Sant Pol de Mar exit. It left the road, colliding with a metal crash barrier, crossed into the opposite lane where it hit a car a glancing blow, and overturned. The injured were taken to several hospitals in the Barcelona area. Six people were killed and as many as 44 injured, some seriously. Most of those killed and seriously injured were sitting near the windows on the left, the side onto which the bus turned over, or on the upper deck of the double-decker bus. Initial reports were that eight had died. Cause Manager Pere Artau from the bus firm, Plenacosta, said the driver had been working for the company for over sixteen years and passed a breath test for alcohol. The bus was two years old and conformed to safety regulations. After an inquiry, the Mossos d'Esquadra (the Catalan police) announced that the bus had been travelling at entering the curve, where the speed limit was ; the driver had taken the wrong exit, and so the curve was sharper than he expected. The exit he was to have taken, for Santa Susanna, had a speed limit of . Also, as noted after the accident, most of the passengers were not wearing their seat belts as required by Spanish law; this included all the dead and most of the seriously injured. Reaction The accident was covered by news organisations around the globe, including in Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Ireland, South Africa, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The Dutch Minister of Justice Ernst Hirsch Ballin and the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Yves Leterme sent condolences.

In the movie itself, it appears as a dream sequence item number during another movie. The song reenacts famous scenes from Bollywood films, and is performed by Shahrukh Khan portraying a number of famous vintage Bollywood actors, opposite a series of other actresses who are also portraying vintage actors from the films. In chronological order, Shahrukh Khan plays opposite Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji. The five parts of the song correlate and pay homage to fifty years of Bollywood and some of the biggest actors over the time span. The lyrics themselves are mostly composed of song or film titles from each actor portrayed. The chorus itself has an allusion to a Kishore Kumar movie Nau Do Gyarah with the lyric \\"‡§π‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø\\" which is also a famous song in Nau Do Ghyarah.Official trailer: Phir Milenge Chalte ChalteShahrukh Khan's projection of bollywood history in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi  1950s  Raj Kapoor is the first actor to be portrayed by Shahrukh Khan, while Kajol portrays Nargis. The two acted in 16 films together. There are many allusions to his movies throughout this part of the song. The underlying melody is similar to that of \\"Awaara Hoon\\" from the 1951 film Awaara. In the video, the people on the arches are dressed similarly to Raj Kapoor's character in Awaara. The second shot is of a giant bowler hat, again, reiterating the homage to Awaara. Later on umbrellas appear paying tribute to Shree 420. The first line is \\"Pyar Hua Ikrar Hua\\" which is the name of a famous song from Shree 420 and \\"Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan\\" from Mera Naam Joker. The next stanza makes reference to three more movies, Chhalia (1960), Anari (1959), Awaara (1951), and Sangam (1964). \\"‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ö‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä, ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§π‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•á ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ, ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§Æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç‡•§\\" Chhalia, Anari, Awaara and Sangam are all names of movies. The melody changes from \\"Awaara Houn\\" to \\"Mera Joota Hai Japani\\" from Shree 420 at the line above.  1960s  The song spends two stanzas on the 1960s to pay tribute to big actors of different styles. The first is Dev Anand and the second is Shammi Kapoor. Dev Anand is the next man to be paid homage and Bipasha Basu portrays Nutan/Sadhana,Making: Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte dressed in white with red roses in her hair and styled churidar, styled in a 60s fashion. The first line of the stanza is \\"Dil ka Bhanwar Kare Pukar\\" which is the name of a song from Anand's 1963 movie Tere Ghar Ke Samne. \\"Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai\\" is the next line, and is the name of a 1961 film. The third line, \\"Jiya ohh, Jiya Kuch Boldon\\" is a line from Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai's title song. The next stanza starts with the line \\"Tere Ghar ke Samne Ghar Banaunga\\", an allusion to the first line of the aforementioned movie's title song. The last two lines are from the same song \\"Pal Bhar Ke Liye\\" from the 1970 movie Johny Mera Naam. Khan portrays Shammi Kapoor in the third part of the song. His co-star is Lara Dutta who plays Helen, colorfully dressed, with jewels and feathers in a high hair bun. The underlying tune is \\"O Haseena Zulfon Wale\\" from the 1966 movie Teesri Manzil. The set copies that of the song in the movie, and is also the first line of this stanza. Right before the song starts though, the melody changes from \\"O Haseena\\" to \\"Aaja Aaja\\" from the same movie. The next line is \\"Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\\" from the 1961 movie Junglee. The last line is from the film Prince (1969) which is \\"Badan Pe Sitare\\" which feature Shammi Kapoor with Vyjayanthimala.  1970s  The set of the penultimate stanza is a cartoon version of Aap Ki Kasam's \\"Jai Jai Shiv Shankar\\". Rajesh Khanna is the actor and Preity Zinta represents Sharmila Tagore. The opening melody and scene is similar to that of \\"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\\" from Aradhana, in which both Khanna and Tagore acted, hinting at the pairing. This song is later alluded to. In the first scene, Zinta is reading a book called Amar Prem, which is also the name of a Rajesh Khanna movie. The first two lines are from \\"Jai Jai Shiv Shankar\\". The third line alludes to his 1985 film Zamana. The next line repeats the name of Mere Jeevan Saathi from 1972. The last line of the first stanza is the name of a song (\\"Zindagi Ek Safar\\") from the 1971 movie Andaz. The second stanza holds two more allusions to Amar Prem and again Mere Jevan Saathi with the lines/song titles \\"Kuch Toh Log Kahenge\\" and \\"O Mere Dil Ke Chain\\".  1980s  Rishi Kapoor is the last actor to be portrayed and Rani Mukerji portrays Neetu Singh. The first melody is \\"Bachna Ae Haseeno\\" from Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977). The song \\"Dard-E- Dil\\" from Karz (1980) starts off the second line and the movie Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1981) finishes. Second line, another blatant allusion to Hum Kisise Kum Naheen, sung to the tune of \\"Ek Haseena Thi\\" from Karz. The last line, \\"Yeh vaada raha, o meri chandni,\\" has allusions to the films Yeh Vaada Raha (1982) and Chandni (1989).

Early life She was born in Bradford in West Yorkshire. At the age of three she moved to Essex. Her parents separated and she moved with her mother to south Lincolnshire. She attended Stamford High School, then a direct grant grammar school. She left at the end of the lower sixth. She had originally wanted to become a vet, but in the 1960s such careers were not encouraged for women. She began training as a quantity surveyor at the College of Estate Management via a correspondence course. However, she felt this was not the right course for her. She had some time in hospital, and decided that she wanted to work in the social occupations. She became a Welfare Assistant with Kesteven County Council. Six months later she became District Welfare Officer for South Kesteven. In 1971 there was a reorganisation in administration of the department she was working for and she decided to leave. She wrote short stories for women's and teenage magazines. Gardening She undertook a gardening correspondence course, and having got to know a nurseryman in 1972, she started her own business in landscape gardening. She originally wanted to design the gardens and let customers plant and change the landscaping themselves, but customers generally wanted the whole thing done for them. In 1973 she worked for Brian Ellis Mailing Services in Bedford, and in 1974 she started her own business, which sent plants by direct mail. The mail services were provided by the Bedford company. The company was not as lucrative as hoped for, so Ledward concentrated on landscape gardening. =Broadcasting and publications= In 1980 Ledward became the gardening presenter for the newly established BBC Radio Lincolnshire. In 1982 she became the first female panel-member of Radio 4's Gardeners' Question Time, and in 1988 she answered gardening questions with Geoffrey Smith on Gardeners' Direct Line Postbag for BBC Leeds. She was also well known for being the resident gardening expert on Sir Jimmy Young's long running lunchtime show on BBC Radio 2 between 1988 and 2002. In 2001 she presented her own TV series, Garden Hopping, seen on BBC2. In 2002 she was co- presenter with Joe Swift of Grow to Eat. Her BBC career ended in 2009.

Libya assisted Egypt in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Later, tensions arose due to Egypt's rapprochement with the west. Following the 1977 Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian War, relations were suspended for twelve years. However, since 1989 relations have steadily improved. With the progressive lifting of UN and US sanctions on Libya from 2003‚Äì2008, the two countries have been working together to jointly develop their oil and natural gas industries. History Nubian, a Syrian, and an Egyptian, drawing by an unknown artist after a mural of the tomb of Seti I The neighboring countries of Egypt and Libya have historical relations that date back thousands of years. The Twenty-third dynasty of Egypt was a regime of Meshwesh Libyan kings, who ruled Upper Egypt between 880 and 734 BC. The Greeks established colonies in both countries such Cyrene in Libya and Alexandria in Egypt. From 305 BC to 30 BC eastern Libya (Cyrenaica) and northern Egypt were ruled by the Ptolemaic Greeks. Later Cyrenaica and Egypt became provinces of the Roman Empire. Egypt, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania (Western Libya) were conquered by the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate between 639 and 644. At times Tripolitania was effectively independent of Egypt, as during the period of the Aghlabid dynasty from 800 to 909 AD, while at other times the two countries were united, as under the Fatimid Caliphate from 909 to 1171 AD. Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and Tripoli followed in 1555. However, both countries had considerable autonomy. Egypt & Libya: Map of the Western Desert Battle Area 1941 Muammar Gaddafi with Gamal Abdel Nasser, 1969 From 1882 Egypt was nominally independent but effectively under the control of Britain, while Italy invaded and occupied Libya in 1912. The border between Libya and Egypt was the scene of see-saw battles between the British and the allied German and Italian forces during World War II, culminating in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October‚ÄìNovember 1942 which finally eliminated the threat to the British in Egypt and led to the expulsion of Italy from Libya. Libya declared its independence as the Kingdom of Libya in December 1951 under King Idris I. In 1969 a young officer named Muammar Gaddafi led a coup that overthrew King Idris's monarchy. From that point, Gaddafi ruled Libya for 42 years until the Libyan Civil War which led to his death and the ousting of his government. Egypt won independence after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The leader of this movement, Gamal Abdel Nasser, became second president of the Republic of Egypt in 1956, holding power until his death in 1970. Anwar Sadat succeeded Nasser, and after his assassination in 1981 was succeeded as fourth president by Hosni Mubarak, who was in power until the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Elements of the relationship Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser with King Idris I of Libya. Egypt has a large and growing population, estimated at 83 million in July 2009, but has limited resources. With a much smaller population of 6.3 million in 2009, Libya is rich in oil and natural gas. Nasser pursued a non-aligned policy during the cold war and accepted aid from the USSR, notably with the Aswan High Dam project. However, after the Yom Kippur War of 1973 Egypt adopted a pro-western stance in exchange for the return of Sinai with its oil fields, and for massive injections of aid. Gaddafi followed a more radical policy, including support for pan-Arabism. In 1972 he proposed a Federation of Arab Republics consisting of Libya, Egypt and Syria, quietly abandoned in 1977. Gaddafi provided valuable assistance to emerging post-colonial African nations, but also supported terrorist attacks on western countries and Israel. Isolated and vulnerable after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by US forces in 2003, Gaddafi executed a volte-face, renouncing support of terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction. Since then, relations between Egypt and Libya have become more open and there is growing political and economic cooperation. Military cooperation and conflict 1973 Yom Kippur War. After the cease fire, Israel had lost territory east of the Suez Canal (red) but gained territory west of the canal(brown) =1973 October War with Israel= After Gaddafi seized power in 1969, he quickly began to use oil revenue to build up the Libyan armed forces, purchasing Mirage III jets and other equipment from France. Many of the fighters were quietly transferred to Egypt where Egyptian pilots were training in preparation for a fresh strike against Israel to recover territory lost in the 1967 Six-Day War.Wiley (US Interest Section in Cairo) to Department of State, April 20, 1973 The Egyptian attack with support from one armored brigade and two squadrons of Mirage III fighters from Libya (one squadron flown by Egyptians) was launched on 6 October 1973. However, despite initial success the Israelis quickly moved from defense to attack, and after three weeks a cease-fire was agreed. In subsequent negotiations to reach a lasting agreement with Israel and to recover the Sinai, Egypt under Sadat moved decisively towards the western side in the cold war, a policy change that was seen as a betrayal by many Arab states including Libya.Josif (US Embassy in Tripoli) to Department of State, December 12, 1973 =Deterioration of relations 1973-1977= Following the October War, Sadat inaugurated a policy of accommodation with the Israeli government, which included going to the peace conference convened in Geneva in December 1973, along with US and Soviet representatives. The Libyan response to the Geneva conference was negative, viewing it as counter-productive for Arab unity. =1977 Libyan‚ÄìEgyptian War= After rising diplomatic tensions, in June 1977 Muammar Gaddafi ordered the 225,000 Egyptians in Libya to leave the country. He accused Egypt of planning to seize the Libyan oil fields. In July 1977 several battles occurred on the border, and Libyan aircraft were destroyed by an Egyptian attack. After four days fighting with heavy losses by both sides, the two countries agreed to a cease-fire at the urging of Algeria's president. Although Libya claimed \\"victory\\", the loss of Egyptian workers was damaging to the Libyan economy. Official contacts After the 1977 war, relations were hostile for over a decade. As late as November 1988, Libya stated that it would not resume diplomatic relations with Egypt as long as Egypt had relations with Israel. However, in October 1989, Gaddafi visited Egypt for the first time in sixteen years. In March 1990, Hosni Mubarak and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria met with Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. By the end of 1990, relations between Libya and Egypt were excellent. In March 1991, Egyptian officials urged the U.S. government to review its hard-line policy towards Libya. In November 1991, while on a visit to Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, Gaddafi denied charges that his country was involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Fresh political differences between Libya and Egypt appeared in 1995. Gaddafi criticized Egyptian efforts to promote economic relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and said that Egypt was not doing enough to support removal of sanctions against Libya. In the second half of 1995, Libya again expelled Egyptian workers, and also began expelling 30,000 Palestinian workers in retaliation for the P.L.O. making peace with Israel. Despite these tensions and U.S. pressure to further isolate Libya, Egypt maintained contact. In July 1998, Mubarak flew to Libya to meet with Muammar Gaddafi, who was recovering from a hip operation. In July 2000, both Libya and Egypt agreed to work with the Atlanta-based Carter Center to help mediate between Sudan and Uganda over accusations about support for rebel movements in these countries. A dispute flared up in January 2004 over Egyptian press criticism of Libya's refusal to stop efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction, leading to travel restrictions between the countries. The row was short-lived, and after high-level diplomatic meetings relations quickly returned to normal and the restrictions were lifted. Both Egypt and Libya benefit from 350,000 Egyptians who work in Libya. At an August 2005 meeting in Sirte, Libya, Hosni Mubarak and Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria proclaimed the excellent relations between their countries and with Libya. In May 2006, during a visit to Tripoli by Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir, Libya proposed a tripartite union of Libya, Sudan and Egypt. The Sudanese promised to give their viewpoints after studying the draft constitution presented by Libya. In October 2006 the Egyptian and Libyan foreign ministers meeting in Cairo gave their support to the Sudanese government over their dispute with the United Nations over peacekeeping forces in Darfur. In January 2007 leaders from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tunisia met in Libya to talk about Arab and African issues. There are still differences between the two countries over the Israel-Palestine conflict. In December 2008, Egypt barred a Libyan plane carrying aid to Gaza from landing in the El Arish International Airport in Egypt. 2000s agreements In October 2000, Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan signed agreements for monitoring and managing groundwater in the Nubian Sandstone / Northwestern Sahara Aquifer Systems. In August 2003, Egypt and Libya signed a trade and customs agreement that removed customs fees on commodities and established a mechanism for settling trade disputes. The agreement replaced an earlier trade agreement finalized in 1990. In July 2006, the two countries signed a technical cooperation agreement in the field of stock markets. Trade between the two countries grew 39% in 2007 to $267m. There are now plans to establish an Egyptian-Libyan border free trade zone that would include industrial, warehousing, trade and tourism projects. In July 2008 Hosni Mubarak and Muammar Gaddafi met in Tripoli to discuss ways of promoting Egyptian-Libyan relations, especially in oil, gas and investment sector. The Egyptian Minister of Investment met with Libyan counterparts to discuss ways in enhance trade and investment between the two countries. Energy ENI Oil platform Bouri DP4 Egypt is a net exporter of both oil and natural gas, and also a transit country for Middle Eastern oil. By 2007, oil production was declining but natural gas production was rising quickly. With the lifting of sanctions against Libya, there is growing outside investment in Libyan oil and gas resources. Major players include the Italian firms Eni and Enel, and the Russian giant Gasprom, which revealed in 2008 that it was planning large investments in Egypt and Libya in cooperation with Eni. This caused concern in Europe, which sees the North African supplies as an alternative to dependency on Russia for natural gas. In June 1997 during a visit to Libya by president Hosni Mubarak of Egypt the two countries agree in principle to a plan to link the Egyptian and Libyan gas grids. A more ambitious proposal is to build a 900-mile pipeline to transport gas from Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria to the existing Morocco - Spain pipeline. In 2003, a jointly owned Libyan/Egyptian company \\"Al Tube\\" began further studies of pipelines to carry Egyptian natural gas to Libya, and to carry Libyan crude oil to Egyptian refineries near Alexandria. In July 2008, Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi announced that Egypt and Libya had signed an agreement to expand Libyan investment in the Egyptian energy sector and to ease restrictions on investment and movement of workers between the two countries. Libya will fund an oil refinery to the west of Alexandria, boosting Libyan investment in Egypt from US$2 billion to US$10 billion within two years. In January 2009 Libya announced further investment plans for the Egyptian refining industry, now the largest in Africa with the capacity to process 726,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Private companies are also active. In June 2009 the Kuwaiti company Al Safat Energy, 60% owner of Egypt- based National Drilling Company was negotiating for a loan to new rigs to meet increasing demand in Libya. In June 2009 the Egyptian firm Taqa Arabia, a unit of Citadel Capital, won a ‚Ç¨118m bid to develop a gas distribution grid in Libya to supply nearly 370,000 households. In March 2008, Egypt and Libya agreed to add 400-500 kV of capacity to the power grid between the two countries. In July 2008 the Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy and his Libyan counterpart discussed plans for a 1,300 megawatt thermal power station in Libya to supply the Egyptian market. Movement of people Dr. Gerasimos Tsourapas of the University of Birmingham argues that 'historically, Libya has been a preferred destination for Egyptian workers seeking opportunity abroad. The Egyptian state, longer established and more developed, sponsored much of this migration, having found that it could cater to the educational and bureaucratic staffing needs of its newly independent neighbor to the west.' With a large number of Egyptian temporary workers in Libya, there continue to be sporadic problems concerning entry permits, crossing fees and so on. In July 2005, Libya sent back 3,000 Egyptians with invalid work permits and no travel documents. Apparently the workers were victims of fraud by two Egyptian companies who had promised to obtain jobs and work permits in Libya. Later that month Egyptian human rights organizations accused Libya of executing four Egyptians without giving them a fair trial, and said there were 15 other Egyptians on the Libyan death row. In March 2007, Libya said they were deporting 32,000 Egyptian workers who did not have papers showing they had been inoculated against avian flu, which would cost 70 dinars. In June 2009, 6000 Egyptians were stuck on the border because Libyan authorities demanded 500 dinars before allowing them to return to Egypt. In July 2009, an outbreak of Bubonic plague was reported in the Libyan town of Tobruk. This caused Egyptian authorities to declare a state of emergency along the border, conducting health checks on everyone returning from Libya. The border town of Sallum was already under quarantine due to concerns about transmission of swine flue. In February 2015, the Islamic State released video footage showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Copts working in Libya, which, made headlines across the world, but 'there is a history of maltreatment of Egyptian migrants in Libya spanning more than 60 years.' Cross-border crime Ptolemy I Gold Stater Elephant Quadrigia Cyrenaica (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) The borders between Egypt and Libya are porous, and cross-border crimes are not unusual. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, in 1993 Egyptian agents abducted a prominent Libyan dissident and U.S. resident in Cairo and turned him over to the Libyans, who executed him. Libya is rich in ancient Greek and Roman ruins. Recently there has been a growing trade in looted coins, statues and other artifacts found by Libyans who sell them to Egyptian middlemen for eventual sale to rich American and European collectors. In September 2008, a group of eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian guides on a desert safari in south Egypt were kidnapped and taken south to Sudan. From there, Sudanese officials say the hostages were taken to Libya. The Libyans said that after investigations they had determined the hostages were still in Sudan.

History Opened in 1925, the halt - the last station to open on the line - sought to encourage passenger traffic in the face of increased competition from buses.Oppitz, 2000, page 22 It was situated to the south of a level crossing over an unclassified road leading to Lower Wainhill and Hempton Wainhill.

He is an inspector with the Hong Kong Police Force and is extremely skilled with fire arms. He is also a heavy drinker, which led to him being nicknamed \\"tequila\\". Tequila Yuen is introduced in Hard Boiled playing a clarinet in a bar, where, it seems, is the only place he feels at home. The barman, Mr. Woo, also seems to be his closest friend.Hard Boiled is one of Hong Kong's greatest fim's, and Tequila one of Yun-Fat's best characters Tequila is also portrayed as a typical anti-hero and he has a total disregard for authority. Although he shows little emotion other than anger for most of the time, he proves to be a loyal friend and a romantic, with strong moral values.Hard Boiled: Woo's Masterpiece Concept and creation After creating films which focused on the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop. Biography=Hard Boiled= Yuen first appeared in Hard Boiled in 1992. The film begins with him leading a squad of police officers into a Hong Kong teahouse where an arms deal is taking place. A shoot-out then ensued and a number of police officers were wounded and his partner, Benny, killed. Tequila then executed the gangster who killed Benny, rather than arrest him. For this, he was ordered off the case by his Superintendent, Pang, as the gangster was a senior member of a local Triad. Despite his orders, he continued with the case and went after \\"Uncle\\" Hoi, a Triad boss. He went to a warehouse that Hoi's gang owned, but found that he and his men had been killed by a rival group led by Johnny Wong. Another gun fight broke out and Tequila killed most of the opposing gangsters. When he was face-to-face with Alan, one of Wong's men, he was unable to kill him as he was out of bullets. Alan was then free to kill Tequila, but chose not to. Pang later revealed that Alan was an undercover police officer, and that one of the gangsters killed earlier in the teahouse was also deep cover. Yuen then set up a meeting with Tony to sort out the situation. They met at the docks, but were attacked by the remaining members of Hoi's gang. They manage to kill their attackers. Tequila's informant, Foxy, was badly beaten by Wong's gang and left for dead. He then found Tequila and was taken to a hospital, which is owned by Wong. There, Wong sent Alan and three other men to kill the pair. Alan and Tequila then eliminated the two of the men. While the two bickered with each other, the third man, Mad Dog, killed Foxy. They then discovered a hidden entry to the hospital morgue where they found Wong's arsenal of guns. Mad Dog attacked them, but then escaped by locking the pair in Wong's armory. Johnny Wong saw that his arsenal was compromised proceeded to take the entire hospital hostage. Amongst the hostages were Superintendent Pang and Officer Teresa Chang (Tequila's girlfriend) who were called to the scene. Alan and Tequila eventually fought their way through the hospital and freed the hostages before going after Wong. The pair split up; Tequila began evacuating babies from the maternity ward as Wong had planted explosives all over the building, and Alan faced off against Mad Dog. When the bombs were detonating, Tequila escaped with the babies and Alan and Wong went missing in the confusion. Wong later emerged with Alan as hostage. He made Tequila humiliate himself by slapping his own face and admitting his incompetence in exchange for Tony's life. In an awkward struggle with Wong, Alan shot himself in the stomach before Tequila grabbed the gun and shot Wong in the eye. Alan survived, however, and began a new life after Pang burned his file. =Stranglehold= Tequila Yuen then made his second appearance fifteen years later in the 2007 video game, Stranglehold. The story kicks off with a Hong Kong police officer being kidnapped, and the kidnappers phoning the police and telling them to send one officer to a Kowloon marketplace to make a deal. The police chief, Lee, believed this to be a trap and insisted on sending in a squad, but if it was to be one man alone it would be Jerry Ying. Ying disqualified himself, however, as he was deep cover in the Dragon Claw Triad, and this could expose him as a policeman. Tequila then put himself forward for the task. When he arrived at the marketplace, he was attacked by a group of gunmen belonging to the Imperial Nines Triad. After disposing of them after a long gun battle, he discovered the missing officer's badge, with a bullet hole through the centre, and a photograph of the dead officer. Later that night, he stopped in at a local bar where the Imperial Nines were making a deal with another Triad group, the Golden Kane. One of the Golden Kane members recognised Tequila and pointed him out. The Imperial Nines then panicked and shot the Golden Kane gangsters and tried to kill Tequila. He shot them down, however. After emerging from the barroom shoot-out unscathed, he informed his superiors that he would be travelling to Tai O, where the Imperial Nines are based, to investigate further. Upon his arrival in Tai O, he asked a local fisherman about Triad activity in the area. The fisherman then told Tequila that Tai O is under the control of the Imperial Nines, but that the Golden Kane are muscling in. He also revealed that the leader of the boss of the Dragon Claw, James Wong, was residing on a boat nearby. Tequila then tracked Wong down and discovered that Jerry Ying was working as a henchman for him. Wong then revealed that the GK killed the officer and pinned it on the I9s, and the only reason that he hasn't retaliated is because the GK and the Zakarov crime family, a Russian Mafia based in Chicago, have kidnapped his daughter, Billie, and granddaughter, Teko. The Zakarovs and GK want the DC to hand over some of their turf in Hong Kong as payment for Billie and Teko's safe return. Tequila then decided to go after the kidnappers, and it is suggested that Billie is the wife of Tequila and Teko is their daughter. After the meeting, the GK attacked but Wong and Tequila both escaped unhurt. Tequila then visited the Mega Restaurant and Casino which is owned by GK boss Yung Gi. He was unable to find Gi, who escaped and flew to Chicago to meet the Zakarov brothers, but did eliminate his personal bodyguard, Ty Lok. After his unsuccessful attempt to kill Gi in Hong Kong, Tequila flew to the US with Jerry and located Damon and Vladamir Zakarov, and Yung Gi in a Chicago penthouse. The pair then split up, and the tactic seemed to be working until Vlad's voice came over the PA system saying that Jerry had been killed. Tequila then fought his way past the Russian henchmen until he reached the top floor where he came face-to-face with Vlad. Zakarov then entered a helicopter which was shot down by Tequila. On his way to the exit of the building, he found Jerry lying wounded and helped him out. He then travelled across town to the Chicago Natural History Museum, which is owned by Damon Zakarov. Tequila arrived to find Damon and Yung Gi in a dispute over the fate of the women. This eventually led to a stand-off between both gangs, and Damon fled with Billie and Gi with Teko. Tequila hunted Damon down in another part of the museum, killed him and rescued Billie. However, just as all seemed well, Jerry entered the room and fired at the couple, hitting Billie and narrowly missing Tequila. He then shot and wounded Jerry, who fled the scene. He then turned back to find Billie dying of her wounds. With her last moments of life, she told Tequila that Yung Gi had taken Teko back to Hong Kong. Tequila then chased Jerry down and asked him who hired him to take him out. Jerry tells Tequila that it was Wong, before being shot dead after a prolonged gun battle. Back in Hong Kong, Tequila and Yung Gi met to make a deal. Tequila wants his daughter back, but Yung refuses as he knows that he can still use her to gain some of Wong's turf. Tequila then showed Yung a text message from Wong to Jerry, confirming that the Dragon Claw plan to eliminate the Golden Kane. Yung then called a meeting with Wong in Kowloon, planning for Tequila to show up and take out Wong and his gang. Tequila did show up as speculated, but took out Yung and Wong's bodyguard, Dapang, while Wong himself escaped with Teko. Tequila then drove to Wong's large estate in the New Territories where he was met with a large and well equipped army. Tequila, nonetheless, eliminated the army and an attack helicopter, and entered Wong's home. There, Wong had Tequila pinned down with a sniper rifle, but just before he took the shot, Teko rushed in and pushed Wong off the balcony, killing him. Tequila is then re-handed his badge by Chief Lee, who earlier confiscated it, and re-united with his daughter. =Gun Runner= In the cancelled sequel to Stranglehold entitled Gun Runnerhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-23-footage- released-of-midways-canned-stranglehold-sequel Chow Yun Fat was expected to reprise his role as Inspector Tequila, who would have partnered up with a new character played by Vin Diesel (whether or not Diesel's character is Milo Burik from Midway's other title Wheelman is unconfirmed.)

Construction commenced during the Soviet period in the 1980s, but halted in the beginning of the 1990s due to lack of financing when the station was about 20% complete. An agreement with Russia allowed to restart the construction, with four units entering service in 2008‚Äì2009. The plant was officially commissioned on 31 July 2009. Once working at full capacity, the plant will provide around 12% of Tajikistan's electricity output. History The Russian and Tajik presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Emomalii Rahmon simultaneously pushing the symbolic start buttons during the commissioning ceremony of the plant. Plans to build the power plant were made during the 1970s, with the actual construction commencing in 1989. Dissolution of the Soviet Union, the resulting halt of financing, as well as the Civil War in Tajikistan interrupted the construction for over a decade. In 1996, the government set up a company for the construction of the power plant and issued public shares. However, the company did not start operating and was liquidated when a deal with Russia was signed. In October 2004, an intergovernmental agreement was signed by Russia and Tajikistan to complete the project. In January 2005, Russia, Tajikistan and Iran signed a protocol according to which Russia would participate in construction of Sangtuda 1 and Iran in construction of Sangtuda 2 power plants. On 16 February 2005, a joint Russian-Tajik company Sangtudinskaya GES-1 was established. Construction resumed in April 2005. The first unit entered service ahead of schedule on 20 January 2008 during the unusually harsh winter, with temperatures dipping below , which put the Tajik energy system on the brink of collapse. The second and third units entered service on 1 July 2008, and 15 November 2008, respectively. The fourth and final unit was brought online on 15 May 2009. On 31 July 2009, the plant was officially commissioned, with the presidents of Russia and Tajikistan Dmitry Medvedev and Emomalii Rahmon participating in the event. Description The Sangtuda 1 Hydroelectric Power Plant is located on the Vakhsh River in Khatlon region, south of Dushanbe. It consist of four units with total capacity of 670 MW and producing 2.7 TWh electricity per year. The construction cost US$720 million. Russian government and companies has 75% of shares and Tajikistan has 25% plus one share. The power plant is operated by Sangtudinskaya GES-1, a company controlled by Inter RAO UES. Director of the company is Vladimir Belov. As of 2010, all electricity is sold to Barqi Tojik, a national electricity company of Tajikistan. There are plans to construct a high-voltage power transmission line to Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan for the electricity export. Sangtuda‚ÄîPuli Khumri 220 kV transmission line to Afghanistan was scheduled to be completed in 2010. Significance Launching of the plant is a significant milestone in achieving energy independence for Tajikistan, as the country had experienced severe energy shortages ever since it acquired independence. Tajikistan has experienced a severe shortage of electricity during the winter months for the past fifteen years. In the summer time, Tajikistan exports its electricity surplus to surrounding countries, and in the winter time Tajikistan experiences rolling blackouts. The plant provides around 12% of Tajikistan's electricity output. The plant is the largest project within the Commonwealth of Independent States with participation of the Russian companies, including Power Machines, Chekhov Gidrostal Plant, ChirkeyGESstroy, Zarubezhvodstroy, Zagranenergostroymontazh, and Trust Gidromontazh. Both the Tajik and the Russian presidents have noted that the project has contributed significantly to strengthening the relations between the two countries. Controversies In 1996, public shares of the company for the construction of the power plant were issued. After dissolving this company it remained unclear how the owners of shares are to be compensated. Some of Tajikistan's neighbours, especially Uzbekistan, are concerned that construction of large hydroelectric plants within the headwaters of the region's rivers will result in shortages of water downstream. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are concerned that the filling of the power plant's reservoir and the actual operation of the power plant will harm the water needed for their crop production. Withdrawal of Uzbekistan from the Central Asian unified power system also cut Tajikistan off from the system and blocked electricity export via Uzbek to southern Kazakhstan. Because of this, the plant can't utilize its full capacity. Rail traffic blockade by Uzbekistan had delayed construction of transmission lines from the plant to Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan.

They are the second- or third-largest club in the city after the famous Rotor Volgograd. History From their founding in 1989 until 1997, the club participated in various youth leagues. Some time between 1993 and 1994 the Volgograd native Leonid Slutsky, future coach of the Russian national team, joined the training staff. Among the Olimpia youth players developed under Slutsky were Denis Kolodin, Roman Adamov, Andrei Bochkov, Maksim Burchenko and Aleksei Zhdanov, all of whom went on to play in the Russian Premier League. As this group of players graduated from the youth team, they and Olimpia joined first the senior Amateur Football League in 1998 and, after winning the South Zone in 1999, the professional Second Division. Slutsky stayed with the club until 2001 when he left for Uralan Elista. The squad he left at Olimpia narrowly missed promotion to the second tier three times, with successive 3rd, 3rd and 2nd-place finishes in their zone. Olimpia continued to play professionally until 2008, though their fortunes faded after Slutsky's players left. Before the 2009 season their professional license was taken over by the new club FC Volgograd. This was meant to allow FC to assume the name and identity of Rotor who were suffering off-field troubles, but Rotor survived and ended up playing simultaneously with the new FC in 2009, while Olimpia dropped into the Volgograd Oblast Championship. They stayed there until 2011, winning the title in 2010. With confusion ongoing over the future of the Rotor name and club, Olimpia were allowed to resume their place in the Second Division in 2012 and managed a 4th-place finish in 2013/14. However, following Rotor's decision to enter the fourth-level Amateur Football League for 2015, Olimpia once again withdrew from the national pyramid and entered the Volgograd Oblast championship.

Leadership  Solomon Kinloch, Jr. is the senior pastor of Triumph Church. He has been a minister since the age of 14, at the New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. In 1998, Rev. Kinloch accepted the call to Pastor at Triumph Baptist Church, in Detroit, Michigan. Kinloch served on the board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the New Market Tax Credit Advisory Board.  History  In the fall of 1920, Reverend Claude Cummings organized the Triumph Missionary Baptist Church. In 1924, while located underground in a wood-frame structure at 515 Holford Street in River Rouge, Michigan, the church was officially incorporated. Cummings was succeeded by the Reverend L.A. Forte, Reverend Rosbrior, Reverend F. Freeman, Reverend Scott and Reverend G.W. Sims respectively. In 1941, Reverend A.D. Boone, who had been a member for twenty years, accepted the call to pastor Triumph. It was under the leadership of Boone that members marched to the new church in 1954 and one of its current locations, underground at 2550 South Liddesdale in Detroit. After the death of Boone in 1969, Freeman re-assumed pastoral duties until Reverend David DeYampert took over in 1970. Under DeYampert, Triumph‚Äòs membership grew from approximately 300 members to over 1,200. Construction of a new edifice on the same site began in March 1974. The following September, members began worshiping in the new sanctuary. By June 1988, members held a special service to celebrate full payment of the mortgage. From 1989 to 1997, Triumph faced difficult times as the membership dwindled from its highpoint of over 1,200 to only 44. In addition to the struggles facing the church, Pastor DeYampert died on July 2, 1997. Earlier the next year on March 22, 1998, Triumph Church appointed a then-24-year-old Solomon Kinloch, Jr as its next pastor. Under Kinloch membership has expanded from forty-four members to nearly 20,000. To accommodate this growth, Triumph Church made a decision to transition into a Multi-site church by adding additional services on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday at various sites. = 2010‚Äìpresent = In 2012, Triumph reached an agreement to take ownership of the former ROC ministry campus, spread over more than 20-acres in Northville Township, just minutes away from western suburbs like Plymouth, Livonia, Novi, & Canton. This became the church's new West Campus. In October 2014, Triumph negotiated with the former St. Martha‚Äôs Episcopal Church -- built by automobile mogul Henry Ford and his wife Clara -- to purchase the 22,000-square-foot church on Detroit's westside to become Triumph's Central Campus. The site is also the gravesite of Ford and many of his family members. In the summer of 2015, the church assumed ownership of the former Heart Academy charter school & St Peter Catholic Church in Harper Woods to become its new Eastland Campus (appropriately named as it is adjacent to the Eastland Center mall). In the fall of 2015, Triumph Church partnered with North Star Ministries and its retiring pastor, Bishop James Flowers, to assume ministry operations and financial obligations for the long-time Flint-area church. The new combined church became the Triumph Church - Flint Campus.  Recognition  In 2009, Outreach Magazine named Triumph the third fastest growing church in the United States, with over 2,000 new members during the 2008 calendar year. 2008 In 2012, Outreach Magazine named Triumph one of the Top 100 Largest churches in the United States, with nearly 10,000 in attendance each week. 2008  References  External links  * Triumph Church OFFICIAL Website Baptist churches in Michigan Churches in Detroit Evangelical churches in Michigan Evangelical megachurches in the United States Christian organizations established in 1920 ","title":"Triumph Church"},{"id":"23815575","text":"Guitarra is a 1973 Argentine film.

Early career  Christy began a singing career with The Adams Orchestra, whose drummer, Marc Hoyois, she later married. Her first solo recordings met with little success. During this period she toured in Belgium and France with Salvatore Adamo. In 1968 she won the Knokke Cup singing contest.  Eurovision Song Contest  Christy's first attempt to represent Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest came in 1970 with the song \\"Le temps, le vent\\" (\\"Time, Wind\\"), which failed to progress past the semi-final stage. She did better the following year, when \\"Dag vreemde man\\" (\\"Hello Stranger\\") finished in second place. A third attempt in 1973, when each of five chosen acts performed two songs, ended in third place for \\"Bye Bye\\". (Christy's other song, \\"Meeuwen\\" (\\"Seagulls\\"), was unplaced). Christy was finally successful in 1975, when \\"Gelukkig zijn\\" (\\"Being Happy\\") was chosen as Belgium's representative in the twentieth Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 22 March in Stockholm. Christy sang the first half of the song in Dutch and the second half in English, and although the song had been tipped to do well, it ended the evening in a very disappointing 15th place out of 19 entries.  Later career  In 1977 Christy played in 152 performances of a musical adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in the town of Mechelen. She had a major hit in Belgium in 1980 with \\"De Roos\\", a Dutch- language version of Bette Midler's \\"The Rose\\".

Life and career  Leonard was the eldest child of Leonard and Louise Melfi, who owned and operated the Circle Tavern in Binghamton, New York. In a 1966 radio interview with WBAI's Janet Coleman, he said, \\"We always talked, and we always cooked together, and while cooking we drank. My father's father was a bootlegger and my mother's father made wine in the cellar... I was sort of doomed.\\" He joked that he had developed his taste for alcohol by \\"working in the family business.\\" Melfi briefly attended St. Bonaventure University, followed by a tour of duty in Germany. Upon his discharge from the U.S. Army, Melfi moved to New York City to pursue a playwriting career. His plays tended to portray social outcasts with dark secrets spontaneously revealed in moments of great anxiety. He was among the most prominent artists making experimental theatre at the beginnings of the off-off-Broadway movement in the 1960s. Lazy Baby Susan was Melfi's first play to be produced. It took place during the inaugural season at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan in 1962.La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \\"Production: Lazy Baby Susan (1962)\\".

A number of Melfi's later plays were produced at the Theater for the New City. Melfi struggled with alcohol for many years, and eventually moved into the single room occupancy Narragansett Hotel at Broadway and 93rd Street. On October 24, 2001, Melfi's niece tried to visit her uncle and found his door to be locked. She tried again two days later, with no success, and became worried. The following day, paramedics arrived at the hotel and transported Melfi to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he died four hours later of congestive heart failure. Melfi's body was misplaced by hospital staff and was found four months later in a potter's grave. After weeks of working through bureaucracy, his brother John had Leonard's body exhumed and brought to Campbell Funeral Home. There, the coffin was opened and John verified the body as his brother's. He had the body transferred to DeMarco Funeral Home in Binghamton, and after a complete funeral service including a mass he was buried in the family plot next to his sister in April 2002.

Absent, but arriving eventually, were: Auch (Castelnau), Ivrea of Savoy (Bonifacio Ferrero), Lorraine, and Vend√¥me. Absent were: Crucense (Gurcense: Lang of Salzburg, Archbishop of Gurk), Eboracense (Wolsey), Minerva da Caieta (Cajetan), Magonza (Mainz: Albrecht of Brandenburg), Legre (Li√®ge: Eberhard von der Mark), and Alfonso de Portugal. Three French Cardinals, Auch. Vend√¥me and Lorraine, entered the Conclave on October 6 (Sanuto, 77). Nine cardinals were absent.The list provided by Foscari (in Sanuto, loc. cit.) gives the absentees as: Crucense (Lang of Salzburg), Eboracense (Wolsey), Minerva da Caieta (Cajetan), Magonza (Mainz: Albrecht of Brandenburg), Legre (Li√®ge: Eberhard von der Mark), and the fratillo of the King of Portugal (Alfonso de Portugal). Baumgartner apparently believes that the only cardinal created by Adrian VI (a fellow Dutchman) Willem van Enckenvoirt of Urecht: Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa Tomo Quarto (Roma: Pagliarini 1793), 79-80. was absent, but all the conclave attendance lists show him as participating. Cardinal Giulio de' Medici had sixteen or seventeen supporters; Cardinal Pompeo Colonna had the second most.Sanuto, columns 223-224, provides a list of all the Cardinals in attendance and their factional allegiances. The \\"anti-Imperial/anti-Medici\\" cardinals successfully demanded that the first scrutiny be delayed until the French Cardinals, who were known to be on the way, arrived. On October 6, they appeared, raising the number of electors to thirty-five.Sanuto, 61-62: Marco Foscari writes on the 5th of October, 1521, \\"Gionse li a Roma il secretario dil cardinal Aus francese [that would be Auch] con lettere al collegio di cardinali, soe e di Vendono e Lorena; etiam Cardinali, come erano zonti a Piombino. Poi, a hore 24, si have aviso esser zonti a Civitavecchia, et pregavano li cardinali li volesseno aspectar. Si dice il cardinale Ivrea, che vien per terra, e in camino tre Fiorenza e Siena.\\" Another letter, written on the 6th, is summarized by Sanuto, \\"Come li 3 cardinali francesi, Aus, Vandomo, et Loreno erano quel zorno a hore 15 zonte in Roma, et intrati in conclavo con li spironi in piedi subito Medici drew the lot to have his cell under Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter, a portrait seen as an omen of election as Julius II had been housed underneath it as well. The remark demonstrates incidentally that the voting was taking place in the Chapel of S. Nicolas and the sleeping quarters were in the Sistine Chapel. Fieschi was the candidate of the French and received eleven votes; Carvajal (the stalking horse of the Imperial party) received twelve. Both parties switched their support in the next scrutiny with Gianmaria del Monte coming within one vote of election following an accessus. Medici had previously agreed to support del Monte as the final vote, but broke his word and did not come forward. After the conclave reached its tenth day, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey allegedly received twenty-two votes, although he never received more ‚Äîconclave mythology of the most unlikely sort.Ethelred L. Taunton, Thomas Wolsey: Legate and Reformer (London 1902), 146-147, states that Wolsey received no votes at all. His name is never mentioned in the reports to the Emperor by the Duke of Sessa. Moreover, John Clerk, Bishop of Bath, and Thomas Hannibal, English Ambassadors in Rome, told Wolsey he had no chance and why: \\"We must shewe your Grace the worst. Many of owr cortyers and also Cardynalles cannot abyde the heryng that any one absent shold be chosyn, for feare of translatyng the See, and other sondry inconvenyentes, whiche ded ensue by the last election; whiche obstakyll we have movyd to your 3 foren [amyd] fryndes, to here there opynyons; who answeryd us quod in [hac] tam recenti plaga suffred by the long absence of the late Elect, your Graces absence semyd to be a great obstakyll: notwithstondyng they sayd that if ther shold be suche discention in the Conclave, so that the cowd not agre upon no man preesent (the lyke wherof was at the last election), then shuld they be fayne to condescend and chose absentem, and wold as lytll regarde the inconvenyentes affore expressyd now, the they dyd at the last election. And fynally, as farre as we can perceyve, the Cardinall of Medices hath a great hope for hymself, and is advised by his fryndes to attempt the fortune for hymself, and so intendith to doo. Next hymself he wyll do for your Grace all that he can, accordyng unto his promes.\\" State Papers, Published under the Authority of Her Majesty's Commission Volume VI, King Henry VIII Part V (1849), p. 176. By October 13, the Imperial party started voting for Medici, with the French supporting Farnese. Medici's supporters remained disciplined into November, while the French faction began to crack. Colonna (who despised Medici despite his close ties to Charles V) held a block of four votes against Medici. However, on October 18, when the French faction proposed the candidacy of Orsini (the Colonna family and Orsini family being rivals), Colonna was impelled to throw his support to Medici, giving him twenty votes. On November 10, Cardinal Ivrea (Ferrero) finally entered the Conclave, having been released from captivity. Cardinal Giulio de' Medici easily reached the requisite twenty-seven by accessus and took the name Clement VII. NotesReferences *Baumgartner, Frederic J. 2003.

Early life Whitehouse was born in New York City, the son of James Whitehouse (1767‚Äì1854) and Eliza Higgs Norman (1775‚Äì1835).Batterson, 167 Whitehouse was described as a \\"thorough aristocrat by birth and training and accustomed to every luxury.\\" He graduated from Columbia University in 1821, and from the General Theological Seminary in 1824.Batterson, 168 Whitehouse was ordained deacon in 1824, and was ordained priest in 1827. Career After his ordination as priest, he became rector of Christ Church in Reading, Pennsylvania. Two years later, he moved to become rector of St. Luke's Church in Rochester, New York, during which time he married his wife. He remained there for fifteen years before moving to New York in 1844 to become rector of St. Thomas Church. =Bishop of Illinois= Whitehouse was elected coadjutor Bishop of Illinois in 1851. He was the 55th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated by Bishops Thomas Church Brownell, Alfred Lee, and Manton Eastburn. Upon the death of Bishop Philander Chase, Whitehouse became bishop, but refused to take up his seat for nine years, until his salary demands were met.Guelzo, 79 The diocesan convention in 1860 charged him with dereliction of duty and generally condemned him. During the American Civil War, Whitehouse displayed decidedly pro-Southern sympathies, further alienating his Illinois flock.Guelzo, 80 Whitehouse identified with high church Anglicanism, and in 1868 he wrote of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.Guelzo, 81 Several of his clergy, led by Charles Edward Cheney, denounced the Anglo-Catholic idea, accusing Whitehouse of \\"unprotestantizing this Protestant Episcopal Church, corrupting her doctrine, debasing her worship, and over-turning her long-established rites, ceremonies, and usages.\\" Whitehouse had his revenge when, on hearing of Cheney's unauthorized omissions of certain liturgical phrases, he attempted to have Cheney deposed,Guelzo, 82 and by 1871, he was successful in having Cheney suspended from the ministry.Guelzo, 85 Cheney later became one of the original clergymen of the Reformed Episcopal Church. While in England in 1867, Whitehouse delivered the opening sermon before the first Pan-Anglican conference at Lambeth Palace, by invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was among the first American bishops to advocate for a cathedral system in the Episcopal Church. Personal life On August 8, 1835, Whitehouse married Evelina Harriet Bruen (1806-1864). Together, they were the parents of five sons and one daughter. They gave middle names to some of their children, specifically Meredyth, Cope, and FitzHugh, which were surnames of women who had married into the Whitehouse family prior to 1800. Their children were: * Henry Bruen Whitehouse (1838‚Äì1889), an attorney * Edward Norman Whitehouse (1839‚Äì1904), a career Naval officer whose duties included the office of Paymaster * Frederic Cope Whitehouse (1842‚Äì1911), also an attorney, but he engaged so ardently in his avocations of archaeology and Egyptology that his obituary in The New York Times referred to him as ‚Äúthe well-known Egyptologist.‚Äù He did not marry. * William FitzHugh Whitehouse (1846‚Äì1909), yet another attorney who married Frances Sheldon (1852‚Äì1944), the niece of William B.

Someone who studies in this field is a lepidopterist or, archaically, an aurelian. Origins Post-Renaissance, the rise of the \\"lepidopterist\\" can be attributed to the expanding interest in science, nature and the surroundings. When Linnaeus wrote the tenth edition of the Systema Naturae in 1758, there was already \\"a substantial body of published work on Lepidopteran natural history\\" (Kristensen, 1999). These included: * Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum ‚Äì Thomas Mouffet (1634) * Metamorphosis Naturalis ‚Äì Jan Goedart (1662‚Äì67 ) * Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium ‚Äì Maria S. Merian (1705), whose work included illustrated accounts of European Lepidoptera * Historia Insectorum ‚Äì John Ray (1710) * Papilionum Brittaniae icones ‚Äì James Petiver (1717) History=Scholars= 1758‚Äì1900 was the era of the gentleman scientist. Following Linnaeus' descriptions in Systema Naturae and with Boas Johansson in Centuria Insectorum, the Austrian Nikolaus Poda von Neuhaus wrote Insecta Musei Graecensis (1761) and Johann Christian Fabricius described very many more species in a series of major works. During this period, Ignaz Schifferm√ºller wrote a systematic catalogue of the butterflies of the districts around Vienna Systematische Verzeichnis der Schmetterlinge der Wienergegend herausgegeben von einigen Lehrern am k. k. Theresianum (1775). In Germany Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper in collaboration with Toussaint de Charpentier published Die europ√§ischen Schmetterlinge (European butterflies online here) and Die ausl√§ndischen Schmetterlinge (World butterflies online here). Between 1806‚Äì1834 Jacob H√ºbner wrote Sammlung exotischerSchmetterlinge [\\"Collection of exotic butterflies\\"] (2 vols.), Augsburg with Carl Geyer and Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Sch√§ffer. During the years of 1806‚Äì1824 H√ºbner added Geschichte europ√§ischer Schmetterlinge [\\"History of European butterflies\\"]. Herrich-Sch√§ffer expanded this as Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa, Zugleich als Text, Revision und Supplement zu Jacob Hubner‚Äôs Sammlung europ√§ischer Schmetterlinge(6 Volumes, 1843‚Äì1856). In France Jean Baptiste Boisduval, Jules Pierre Rambur and Adolphe Hercule de Graslin wrote Collection iconographique et historique des chenilles; ou, Description et figures des chenilles (larvae) d'Europe, avec l'histoire de leurs m√©tamorphoses, et des applications √† l'agriculture, Paris, Librairie encyclop√©dique de Roret, 1832 and with John Eatton Le Conte, 1829‚Äì1837 Histoire g√©n√©ral et iconographie des lepidopt√©r√®s et des chenilles de l‚ÄôAmerique septentrionale(General history and illustrations of the Lepidoptera and caterpillars of Northern America) which was published in Paris. Boisduval also described Lepidoptera from the expedition ship Astrolabe of Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse and the Coquille, that of Louis Isidore Duperrey. In Italy Giovanni Antonio Scopoli wrote Entomologia Carniolica published in Vienna. In the mid-century period, the expert knowledge of Lepidoptera dealers such as Otto Staudinger, Emile Deyrolle, Orazio Querci and Peter Godeffroy contributed to the field. =Explorers= Expeditions continued to be major sources of specimens.The Baudin expedition to Australia (1800 to 1803) with two laboratory equipped ships G√©ographe and Naturaliste had nine zoologists and botanists on board.They brought back to France, according to Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy, the largest collection Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle had ever received including 44 crates of zoological specimens. The √ñsterreichische Brasilien-Expedition explored the Botany, Zoology and Ethnography of Brazil. It was organized and financed for Austrian Empire and ran from 1817 to 1835. The SMS Novara, under the command of Commodore Bernhard von W√ºllerstorf-Urbair, made a voyage of exploration in 1857‚Äì1859. Baron Cajetan von Felder and his son Rudolf Felder amassed a huge entomological collection from the Novara that is deposited in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna and the Natural History Museum in London. The butterflies were described in Reise Fregatte Novara: Zoologischer Theil., Lepidoptera, Rhopalocera (Journey of the Frigate Novara...) in three volumes (1865‚Äì1867). =Collectors= Wealthy collectors played a major role: Aim√©e Fournier de Horrack in Paris, Walter Rothschild and James John Joicey in England and in Russia Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia who funded Sergei Alph√©raky and edited M√©moires sur les L√©pidopt√®res. The British Empire provided opportunities to Frederic Moore author of Lepidoptera Indica. =Museums= In the nineteenth century large collections of Lepidoptera were amongst the natural history specimens then flooding into Europe.Most of the largest and most specimens of new species are in Mus√©e royal de l'Afrique centrale (Belgian Congo), Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle (French colonial empire), Museum f√ºr Naturkunde (German colonial empire), British Museum (Natural History) (British colonial Empire) and Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (Dutch Empire).Museum lepidopterists include Samuel Constantinus Snellen van Vollenhoven.Francis Walker, Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer, Franti≈°ek Anton√≠n Nickerl, Lionel de Nic√©ville, Carl Heinrich Hopffer and Arthur Gardiner Butler. Notable lepidopterists Some notable lepidopterists are:‚Äì *Per Olof Christopher Aurivillius of Sweden: butterflies of Africa *Henry Tibbats Stainton of England: Microlepidoptera *Jules L√©on Austaut of France: specialised in Parnassius *Otto Vasilievich Bremer of Russia: butterflies of Siberia and Amur *John Henry Leech of England: butterflies of China *Sh≈çnen Matsumura of Japan: butterflies of Japan *Hans Rebel of Austria: butterflies of the Palearctic *Ruggero Verity of Italy: butterflies of the Palearctic *Hans Fruhstorfer of Germany: world butterflies, but especially Java *Edward Meyrick of England: Microlepidoptera *Herman Strecker of the U.S.A.: butterflies of the Americas *Anthony Valletta of Malta: butterflies of Malta *Margaret Fountaine of England: Europe, South Africa, India, Tibet, America, Australia and the West Indies. *Edna Mosher of Canada: A Classification of the Lepidoptera based on characters of the pupae  Collections and illustrations  As the chief mode of study of butterflies was through pinned specimen collections, it was difficult to catalogue and communicate names and descriptions widely. Books on butterflies with plates that were either hand-painted, lithographed and printed have been a major tool in lepidopterology. These include the massive works by Adalbert Seitz. Unusual works like the Butterfly Fauna of Ceylon (1942) by Lionel Gilbert Ollyett Woodhouse (1888‚Äì1965) and Moths and Butterflies of the United States East of the Rocky Mountains (1900) by Sherman F. Denton made use of butterfly wing- prints where the illustrations incorporated the scales of the wings. The illustrious Russian writer, Vladimir Nabokov was a noted lepidopterist, having discovered the passion at the age of seven. He would later write about butterflies, collect, and illustrate them. Nabokov volunteered at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology in the Entomology Department, where he would organize specimens for as much as 14 hours a day. Lepidopterological societies Lepidopterists are served by a number of national and international scientific societies. They promote research in lepidopterology and dissemination of the findings through conferences such as the biennial European Congresses of Lepidopterology or the TILS Leps Talk. These societies include: * Lepidopterists' Society * Societas Europaea Lepidopterologica * Lepidoptera Research Foundation * North American Butterfly Association * Association for Tropical Lepidoptera * International Lepidoptera Survey * Lepidopterological Society of Denmark * Lepidopterological Society of Finland * Lepidopterological Society of Japan * Sicilian Lepidopterological Association * Southern Lepidopterists' Society * Study Group of Hessian Lepidopterologists * Lepidopterists' Society of Africa Lepidopterological journals * Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera * Metamorphosis * The Taxonomic Report * Nota lepidopterologica See also * The Global Lepidoptera Names Index * Lepidoptera in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae * McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity, University of Florida * Butterfly watching ReferencesExternal links * Subfields of entomology ","title":"Lepidopterology"},{"id":"23815892","text":"Cecil Whittaker \\"Ted\\" Trueblood was an American outdoor writer and conservationist. From 1941 to 1982, he served as an editor and writer for the Field & Stream magazine.  Early Life and Education  Trueblood was born in Boise, Idaho on June 25, 1913, and was raised on his family farm near Homedale, Idaho. Trueblood graduated from Wilder High School in 1931. Drawn to writing about the outdoors, he published his first article in National Sportsman magazine in 1931. He attended both the College of Idaho and the University of Idaho, but left before earning his degree.  Career  In 1936, he became a reporter for the Boise Capital News. In 1937, he became a reporter for the Deseret News in Salt Lake City. From there, he began writing articles for Field & Stream. He returned to Idaho in 1939 and married Ellen Michaelson. Together they had two sons, Dan and Jack. After struggling as a freelance writer, Trueblood took a public relations position with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. He later became fishing editor of Field & Stream in 1941 and moved to New York City. In 1947, he moved back to Idaho in order to \\"fish, hunt, and write about it.\\" From his home in Nampa, he remained an associate editor and contributor to Field & Stream, and continued writing articles for the magazine throughout his life. In addition to his magazine work, he also wrote several books about the outdoors, including The Angler's Handbook (1949), The Fishing Handbook (1951), On Hunting (1953), The Hunter's Handbook (1954), How to Catch More Fish (1955), Camping Handbook (1955), and The Ted Trueblood Hunting Treasury (1978). Trueblood also worked as a conservation leader. In 1936, he helped to organize the Idaho Wildlife Federation, the state's major conservation group in the mid-twentieth century. Trueblood often helped the Federation fight many of its conservation battles. One of their most significant victories, in the 1950s, was the successful campaign to protect Idaho's salmon and steelhead trout by stopping the construction of Nez Perce Dam on the Snake River, which would have blocked the migration of fish up the undammed Salmon River. Trueblood advocated for the creation of the River of No Return Wilderness in central Idaho, and worked to oppose the anti- environmental \\"Sagebrush Rebellion\\" in 1980. His conservation work was honored with several awards, including a 1975 Conservation Service Award from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the 1975 Outdoorsman of the Year award from the Outdoor Writers of America. Trueblood died at the age of 69 on September 12, 1982 from a gunshot wound to the head after experiencing a painful and terminal form of bone cancer. His life of conservation leadership is commemorated by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game's Ted Trueblood Wildlife Area, near Grandview. In 1991, the newly organized Boise chapter of Trout Unlimited named itself the \\"Ted Trueblood Chapter.\\" His papers are housed in the Albertsons Library at Boise State University.

Romer‚Äôs work helped fund Polish Jewish refugees and ensure visas into Japan. He created a ‚ÄòPolish Committee to Aid the Victims of War‚Äô and appointed his wife, Zofia to be president of the committee. They worked to financially support Jewish communities in Yokohama and Kobe by campaigning in far eastern countries for funding. Romer‚Äôs position became increasingly important after the United States closed off immigration. Romer‚Äôs Polish ambassador position was one of the only beacons of hope for Jewish refugees stuck in Japan. Romer negotiated with Polish allies for immigration options for refugees. For example, Canada offered multiple opportunities for refugees interested in contributing to the Allies war effort. By October 1942, Romer was exiled from Japan but found a new position as a Polish consultant working in Shanghai. Romer expected the job to be temporary. However, after Pearl Harbor the routes from Shanghai to the USSR became extremely dangerous to trek, hence he couldn‚Äôt relocate in the USSR. Romer suggested an analytical report of the Polish War refugees living in Shanghai. In June 1942 Romer planned to record the gender, age and political parties of Polish refugees in Shanghai. The main goal of the 40 page report was finished was to analyze the communities‚Äô resources, activities and figure future plans for the Polish refugees. This report was published in August 1942 and gave refugees a strong sense of Polish pride which inspired many refugees to resist moving into stateless Shanghai Ghetto that were enforced by the Japanese Government. In August 1942 Romer embarked on a Prisoner exchange to East Africa. He used this exchange as an escape route for some Polish refugees.

Overview  Postwar Soviet bloc F1 grenade The F-1 grenade was first put into mass production by the French State in 1915 during the First World War. In May 1915 the first of the F1 grenades (fusante No. 1) appeared in the French military, in limited quantities. This new weapon inherited from the experience of the first months of the war: the shape was made to be more modern, with an external grooves pattern for better grip and easier fragmentation. The second expectation proved deceptive, since the explosion in practice gave no more than 10 fragments (although the pattern was designed to split into all the 38 drawn divisions). The design was proved to be very functional, especially due to its stability compared to other grenades of the same period. Later, the Fusante No. 1 was used en masse by many foreign armies in the period 1915‚Äì1940. The F-1 grenade has been used as a basis for the development of many other grenades by different nations, including the US and the Soviet Union. The F-1 was very widespread during the first half of the 20th century, used by armies of France, United States, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, Finland, and others. Overall more than sixty million of these grenades were produced over 25 years, from 1915 to 1940. Development Originally, the F1 was designed to use a lighter-based ignition system, but later it began using a percussion cap fuse. Designs such as the M1916 and M1917 Billant fuses turned the F1 into a time-fused grenade, which was the grenade's final ignition system. By World War II, the F1 used the M1935 fuse, which is a time-based fuse, but it differs from the M1916 Billant fuse internally. The F-1 in its original design was withdrawn from French military service in 1946. The altered models of the grenade remain in military service in countries around the world, among others in the Russian F1 Grenade and American Mk 2 grenade. United States The French F-1 grenade with the M1916 Billant fuse was the preferred grenade by the American Army during World War I. Russian Civil War During the Russian Civil War, the F1 was both given to the White Movement forces by France and seized en masse by the Bolshevik regime, resulting in a very widespread use of the grenade. After the civil war, the Soviet artillery command decided to modify the French F-1 into the Russian F1 grenade design. In Soviet folklore and colloquial speech, the grenade became a national icon of social upheaval and revolution, although not referred to as the F-1 but rather as \\"limonka\\" ([lƒ±'m…ínk…ô]), 'little lemon', due to its very wide usage during the civil war and the chaotic period of the early 1920s. The origins of the Russian limonka are ambiguous and remain a subject of historical debate, with one side presenting the case that the grenade was named after its shape and familiarity to the British No. 16 lemon grenade and another suggesting that the grenade was named after its French designer, Leman.

Administration The school is run by the Diocesan Board of Education of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Islamabad- Rawalpindi. The Bishop of the diocese is the chairman of the board. The school is administered by the Marist Brothers, who took over the administration in 1970. Academics The school conducts classes from Prep to Class 10 (Secondary School Certificate of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Peshawar). The medium of instruction is English. History The school was opened in 1957 in the presbytery of St. Michael's Church on Mall Road , Peshawar Cantonment with fourteen boys who had passed Standard III from Presentation Convent School located next door to St. Michael's Church. Fr. Thyssen was the founder and first principal. The other teachers were Fr. Pingstern and Fr. Heideman. All three were Dutch citizens belonging to the Catholic order of Mill Hill Fathers (London). Before his transfer to Peshawar, Fr. Thyssen was at Burn Hall, Abbottabad and before the Great Partition, he had served in Kashmir. In 1959, the school moved to Air Force Barracks, on Roberts Road, as St. Mary's PAF Cambridge School. Classes available at the time ranged from Prep to Standard V. Fr.Joseph Beemster from Holland joined the teaching staff around this time In 1962, the first batch of ten students sat for the Matriculation (SSC) Examination and the success rate was 100%. In the same year, five of its students qualified for GCE 'O' Level of Cambridge University (three in First Division). The present site was acquired for the school by Fr. Michael Grant, an Irishman and the second principal of the school and the foundation stone laid by Lt. Gen. Altaf Qadir on 29 October 1963. Many parents contributed to the construction of the school by donating a truckload of bricks. In 1970, the Marist Brothers took over the administration of St. Mary's from the Mill Hill Fathers. Br. Patrick Faulkner took over as the first Marist principal. In 1977, Br. Francis Sales Fernando became the school's tenth principal. During his tenure as principal, many new buildings were added. The fully equipped auditorium, library, squash courts, hall for indoor games, children's park and mini zoo are some of those additions. Technical education was also introduced, with fully equipped workshops, around this time. In 1993, Br. Charles Fernando took over as the principal. He was replaced by Br. Shanthi Liyanage who led the school until September 2005. During his tenure, a new spacious staff room was added to St. Mary's. In 2005, students of St. Mary's secured the first position, third position and sixth position in the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education SSC examination. =Golden Jubilee= On 29 March 2007, the school celebrated the Golden Jubilee of its foundation. At the time, the principal was Br. Devasiri Fernando FMS. The school had 1,302 students and 70 academic and administrative staff. =Area attacks= ;2009 On 14 November 2009, a massive bombing targeted the offices of the Army Inter-Services Intelligence on Khyber Road. The school, situated on the corner of both Khyber Road and Warsak Road, was partially damaged in the huge explosion and was shut until 23 November for repair.Education News Archive 2009 ;2014 On 16 December 2014, nine members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) conducted a terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar. They entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children, killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren, ranging between eight and eighteen years of age. A rescue operation was launched by the Pakistan Army's Special Services Group (SSG) special forces, who killed all seven terrorists and rescued 960 people. Chief military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a press conference that at least 130 people had been injured in the attack. Due to this massacre, St. Mary's High School was closed immediately while the firings and martyring was going inside Army Public School Peshawar. The school remained closed until 18 January 2015.

They were not successful. Development With prizes worth a total of ¬£2,150, the Lympne light aircraft competition of October 1923 attracted 28 entries including the Avro 558, de Havilland Humming Bird and Gloster Gannet. Handley Page provided three contestants, at that time without a company type letter but bearing the competition numbers 23, 25 and 26. These were designed by W.H Sayers, technical editor of The Aeroplane and owed much to a glider that he, along with Frank Courtney and Maurice Wright had designed and built for the glider competition held at Itford Hill the previous year. In the later 1920s, when Handley Page began using the familiar H.P. numbering system they retrospectively named the initially similar no.23 and 25 the H.P.22 and no.26 became the H.P.23. As originally completed, all three aircraft had much in common. They had almost constant chord wings that carried ailerons fitted with slots for low speed control. The fuselage was of square cross-section, with the underside tapering towards the tail. There was no fixed tailplane, only an elevator, and both types had a fixed triangular fin. On the H.P.22s this carried a rectangular, unbalanced rudder, but the H.P.23's rudder was rounded on the trailing edge and horn-balanced. The open cockpit was ahead of the wings and the undercarriage had two small wheels, mounted inboard on the fuselage on the H.P.22 and outboard on the H.P.23. The main differences between the two types came about because the H.P.23 was designed for the speed prizes rather than those for flight duration. It therefore had a much shorter span of 20 ft (6.1 m) compared with 36 ft 6 in (11.13 m) for the H.P.22. This wing had full span leading edge slots and camber changing flaps. Both types had their engine mounted on a pylon immediately ahead of the pilot. The H.P.22 used a 397 cc ABC flat-twin and the H.P.23 a 750 cc Blackburne V-twin, the latter requiring slight changes to the pylon and nose.Flight 11 October 1923 p.626 No.23 proved impossible to get airborne, even when the little ABC was replaced with a 500 cc Douglas. No. 25 was therefore reworked: the wing was lowered to shoulder height with its incidence increased to 7¬∞, the ABC engine was faired in and the cockpit faired over apart from two small viewing ports, giving a smooth nose profile.Flight 18 October 1923 p.640 Thus modified, with a lightweight pilot and bungee-cord takeoff assistance, allowed under the rules, no.25 took part in the competition though without success. The H.P.23 could not be completed in time for the competition. It was later bought by the Air Ministry and moved to Martlesham, though it never flew there.

The narrator describes the boy and his upbringing so far. He was born to a 14-year-old mother who quickly left him months after giving birth. He grew up alone and without any real parents. He was regarded through the community as a \\"son of sin\\". As he began working and living in the town he began forming a dislike, even hatred for the people there. They would tease him and treat him very poorly. He finally earned enough money to rent a house just outside town where he could isolate himself from the people who emotionally tormented him. Although this was not an ideal life for Allal he lived this way for quite some time till one day he had an encounter with a man carrying a sack of snakes. This man, who caught snakes and then sold them, had dropped his sack and lost a few snakes right in the middle of town. Allal helped the man recapture the snakes that had gotten away and befriended the man. The townspeople did not appreciate the old man bringing the poisonous snakes into town so they kicked him out. Allal, who knew what it felt like to be rejected by the townspeople, offered him a place to stay for the night. As they sat inside for the night talking, Allal came increasingly interested in the snakes inside the bag. He convinced the man to let the snakes out so he could see them again. He became entranced by a reddish-gold snake, watching its every move. He decided at that moment he must have this snake and proceeded to formulate a plan to acquire it. As the old man slept, Allal enticed the snake with milk into a folded up blanket and then went and hid it outside. The next day the old man was in a frenzy looking for his lost snake, but to no avail, was unable to find it and eventually left Allal's house en route to another town. Allal worked at his job all day, distracted by the thought of the snake. Finally after work, he decided it was time to let the snake out once again. He poured some milk in a bowl and began drumming on the table. The snake appeared, drank the milk, and then went back into the blanket. Allal loved this. He repeated this action a few times a day. He became very obsessed with the snake and its daily ritual. One night after the snake was done drinking its milk Allal did not stop drumming on the table but instead calling the snake towards him. Moments passed with no movement but then the snake suddenly made a move towards Allal. It then began to slither across Allal's body and then rested next to his head. He was very calm at this moment and looked right into the snake's eyes and felt almost one with the snake. Soon his eyes closed and he fell asleep in this position. The next morning Allal, feeling rather strange, realized he had traded bodies with the snake. He continued to possess his conscience thoughts but was inside the snake's body. He slithered around his house and even saw himself lying inside. As he made his way outside the house he felt a new sense of freedom. He was no longer an ugly \\"son of sin\\". He was a beautiful creature that had no limits. He now moved himself towards town, traveling in a ditch alongside the road. As he explored the outside world in his new body, he soon encountered a man walking. This man, along with others, began chasing him. They did not like poisonous snakes so close to their families and children. Allal hurriedly returned to his house. Unfortunately the men continued the chase and saw him enter the house. Although Allal's human form was still lying on the floor, there was not time for Allal to transition back into it. The men continued the pursuit, and Allal quickly recognizes that his death is imminent. Allal tries to escape but has no chance. Still, he does get some revenge by successfully biting two of the three men that had been sent to catch him. \\". Analysis There are a few different overall themes that play significant roles in this short story. These include loneliness, human atavistic nature, and the uncanny. =Loneliness & Atavistic Nature= Allal in this story is doomed from the start. He is born under unfortunate circumstances and what makes it worse is that his mother abandons him. He is forced to live with people that are not even his parents and is labeled and ridiculed for something he was not responsible for. The townspeople treat him as an outcast. This causes Allal to become very isolated and alone. This seclusion plays a big part in the story because this loneliness is what draws Allal to the snake. He is in search of a companion, someone or something that will not judge him. A friend that will enjoy being around him. The snake is the perfect companion in Allal's mind. This snake is unwanted in the village just like himself. He can connect to the creature on a level that he has been unable to with anyone else. What makes Allal even more fascinated with this snake is the fact that it does not disappoint him. All the people in Allal's life have been unfriendly and unreliable. The snake is very compliant, coming out of the bag for Allal everyday and listening to his commands. When the drumming stops he returns to the bag. This is unlike something Allal has ever experienced and he begins to identify with the snake. The lack of companionship, and the snake's obedient nature, is what draws him and this snake closer and closer together. This leads to the idea that humans are attracted to their own atavistic natures. Atavistic refers to characteristics of remote ancestors or elders.\\". People tend to relate better to things they know. Ideas and characteristics that they relate to are what they are more attracted to in other people. Allal found that the snake was mistreated by the villagers just like he was his whole life. That is why he felt so comfortable around the snake and so mesmerized by it. =The uncanny= Another element that appears often in Gothic fiction is the existence of the uncanny. The weird, odd, strange, magical, or impossible is an element in each piece of Gothic fiction. It adds the element of surprise when reading the story. It adds the thought of doubt in the reader's mind (What if that really did happen?). It creates a fear of the unknown because readers have obviously not experienced these types of things before. It keeps them guessing in every story. It not only adds excitement but also suspense, mystery, and surprise. Many Gothic stories use this tool to keep readers hooked, such as The Enormous Radio, Subsoil (short story), and \\"Replacements (short story)\\". In \\"Allal\\", the obvious uncanny element in the story is that Allal switches bodies with the snake. One minute Allal is lying on the floor with the snake on his shoulder and chest and the next, he wakes up in the snake's body, lying next to his human form. Although this seems far-fetched, it puts an idea in the reader's head. It gives them a bizarre perspective and introduces the question \\"what if this happened?\\" Would they dare try to copy such a feat? Maybe the next time they see a snake they will hesitate - not get too close or look too deeply into its eyes for the fear of waking up a snake. Even though everyone knows this is impossible, the eeriness of it sticks with readers and stays in the back of their minds. It adds, even if only a small bit of fear and doubt into the reader's head.

Pi√±eres is a Colombia-born American artist who lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. She was formerly represented by DCKT Contemporary in New York City and is currently represented by Walter Maciel Gallery in Los Angeles where she had her eighth solo exhibition in April 2015. Her work, mostly embroidery, has been exhibited at the Museum of Art & Design in New York City. and Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. She studied painting at The Art Students League of New York and graduated from Parsons School of Design with a BFA in illustration. Embroidery work She credits her mother and grandmother for teaching her to sew, knit, and crochet, but she taught herself needlepoint after discovering a book by Mary Martin, an actress and avid needlepointer. The artist's work often consists of homo-erotic imagery taken from vintage pin-up magazines combined with vivid, sometimes complex, textile pattern backgrounds. She first became widely known through her series of needlepoint celebrity mug shots which was first exhibited in 2005. This series included portraits of celebrities such as Robert Downey Jr., Paris Hilton, and Michael Jackson, as well as a portrait of Jack White which was later shown in V magazine. The artist‚Äôs interest in the subject came from a desire to show the celebrity in a most vulnerable moment, without the protection of stylists and agents. These haunting images end up revealing a naked humanity in these often idealized subjects.McFadden, David Revere. Pricked: Extreme Embroidery. Museum of Arts and Design: New York, 2007. Technique She uses several different techniques including gathering imagery from vintage magazines, digital collages with images collected from the internet, and her own photographs. After some manipulation, the images are embroidered by fusing traditional needlework techniques ranging from a simple Continental stitch to more complex Bargello and Florentine traditions, which lend rich texture with a modern painterly focus on light and color.

The service was created in 1955, when Michigan City assumed control of bus routes operated by Michigan City Transit Lines, a private bus system. Michigan City Transit Lines, in turn, was a successor of Michigan City's streetcar system. Current system summary Michigan City Transit operates four fixed bus routes and a dial-a- ride service for seniors and people with disabilities. The system runs at 6:30 AM ‚Äì 6:30 PM on weekdays and 8:30 AM ‚Äì 6:30 PM on Saturdays. Between 2007 and October 1, 2010, the system ran between 5:30 AM ‚Äì 9:00 PM on weekdays and 6:30 AM ‚Äì 9:00 PM on Saturdays thanks to a federal service grant, but the service hours were cut once that grant ran out. All fixed routes originate and terminate at the Michigan City Public Library with an hourly headway. Each route runs in a largely counterclockwise loop that only runs in one direction (except for the few parts where two sides of the loop converge on the same street, creating an illusion of bi-directional service). Michigan City Transit fares are $1.00 for adult riders and $0.50 for youth, elderly and the disabled. The system also offers monthly passes that cost $20.00 and $10.00, respectively.

Career Werner Schwier made a name for himself in silent films on German television. On 14 May 1961 to September 1965, he presented 65 episodes of Hessischer Rundfunk and produced the series Es darf gelacht werden (It is permitted to laugh). The show was a 45 minutes long evening program of the ARD. During the broadcast, three complete short films would be shown. He also had two silent film stars on the show as guests, Buster Keaton in 1962 and Harold Lloyd in 1963. In the manner of a small film show of the times of the silent films, Schwier presented in a checkered suit, assisted by Konrad Elfers on the Piano and G√©za Jan√≥s on violin. Before each short film, he would say \\"I present now, the symbol---assuming the operator approves.\\", this was followed by a flying bowler hat on screen, to mark the start of the show. Silent films played only a role on Schwier's afternoon show, which showed only the funny material of the era of silent films. He obtained, with the show, viewers ratings over 80 percent. Schwier added presentation with appropriate dry-humour to the shows, that was not as chaotic as his English counterpart Bob Monkhouse in 1966 with Mad Movies or the later Vater der Klamotte with the corny jokes of Hanns Dieter H√ºsch. After the decline of silent films, Schwier also worked as a supporting actor in films, such as Es (1966), ' (1967), ' (1968) or ' (1979).

Weston was combined with the Township of York to form the Borough of York.

Toronto mayoral race Incumbent mayor Philip Givens was challenged by two strong opponents. Givens was associated with the Liberal Party while Controller William Archer was a Progressive Conservative. The winner was William Dennison, a former Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Member of Provincial Parliament who was a longtime member of the New Democratic Party. Dennison, despite his labour roots was considered the most conservative of the three candidates. His slogan was \\"Respect for the Taypayer's Dollar\\". Archer was the more centrist candidate, and had the endorsement of city councillors Charles Caccia, Kenneth Dear, and Hugh Bruce. Central issues during the election was the extension of the Yonge subway line north of Eglinton and whether it should run on a cheaper above-ground route or should built underground so as not to demolish homes. Perhaps the most important issue was Givens' advocacy for Henry Moore's controversial sculpture The Archer for Nathan Phillips Square also remained an issue. Originally the city had agreed to pay $100,000 for the modernist sculpture, but city council rejected the idea. Instead Givens succeeded in raising the $100,000 from private donors and had the sculpture placed in the square in front of city hall. Dennison strongly objected to having the piece of art in such a prominent venue. In the final vote, the city was divided along ethnic and class lines. Givens dominated the downtown core winning the votes of the young and the cultured. He also won the heavily Jewish neighbourhood of Forest Hill. Archer carried the wealthy Anglo-Saxon areas of Rosedale and North Toronto. Dennison was victorious by winning the working class districts in both the east and west end of the city, including strong votes from Italian and Polish areas. ;Results :William Dennison - 59,363 :Philip Givens (incumbent) - 54,525 :William Archer 40,946 :John Sara - 1,239 City council and Board of Control Ward boundaries used in the 1966 election The 1966 election was the last in Toronto for the Board of Control. It consisted of four members elected at large from across the city who then formed the executive on city council. The Board candidate with the most votes became council president and budget chief. Two sitting controllers, Dennison and Archer, opted to run for mayor. This resulted in a competitive race of six major candidates for the four spots. Those in the running were three city councillors: June Marks, Joseph Piccininni, and Herbert Orliffe; sitting controller Margaret Campbell; former mayor Allan Lamport; and Liberal MPP George Ben. =Board of Control= The Toronto Board of Control was made up of the Mayor and four Controllers elected at large.

The reorganized Metropolitan Toronto was made up of six constituent municipalities: the City of Toronto and five boroughs: Etobicoke, Scarborough, North York, East York, and York. Concurrently, representation on Metropolitan Toronto Council also changed and the body was expanded from 22 to 32 seats, with greater representation from the suburbs which now had 20 out of 32 seats on the body - up from 11 out of 22 with seats roughly allocated according to population. The distribution of seats was as follows. Toronto (12), North York (6), Scarborough (5), Etobicoke (4), York (3), East York (2). The new Metro Council was made up of the mayor of Toronto, two of the four members of the Toronto Board of Control, senior aldermen from the nine wards of the City of Toronto, the mayor of Scarborough and the four members of Scarborough's Board of Control, the mayor of Etobicoke and three of the four members of Etobicoke's Board of Control (the top three in terms of votes), the mayor of York and its two Controllers, the mayor of East York and one alderman, selected by East York council, the mayor of North York, all four members of North York's Board of Control, and one alderman selected by North York's council.

The mansion's construction began in 1888 and was completed in 1893. A gazebo was added to the property in the 90's and is a popular place for many weddings. History The Mansion Museum was built in 1888 to 1893 and was designed in the Romanesque style. The house stayed in the possession of private families until the 1960s. The house had sat vacant for several years and plans were made to raze the structure to make way for a gas station.http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/506052.html?nav=71&showlayout;=0 The house was purchased by John Bradfield and Everett Hanlon for $10,000 and was turned over to the Belmont County Historical Society. Exterior The large mansion is constructed of red brick and sandstone with white trim. Large rectangular windows light the house. The house rises two floors with a mansard roof containing the attic/third floor. Dormers protrude from the roof and a large pediment is located on the front facade. A large turret is located on the northern facade and contains a balcony with wrought iron fencing. At one point an elegant porch wrapped around the entire length of the mansion, but this was removed for safety reasons. The porch contains a wooden plank floor with sandstone pillars. Today the only part still standing is the porch covering the carriage entrance. The porch is supported by four Ionic columns with an entablature and dentil molding. Flashing can still be seen running along the walls where the porch was once attached. The entrance is framed by a fan light and side lights with a large white solid wood door. Interior The house contains 26 rooms decorated in the Victorian era designs. Beautiful oak fretwork welcomes visitors to the entrance parlor. The eye is instantly drawn to the handcarved griffin found in the woodworking to the bottom right. The dining room is located to the right of the entrance with two parlors to the left. The great hall runs past the fretwork and contains an inglenook known as a \\"Courting Fireplace\\" with cast-iron firebox. A large oak stairway leads to the upper floors. Off the landing is the growlery, where the men would go after dinner to discuss the issues of the day. The second floor contains 5 bedrooms, two dressing rooms and two bathrooms. The bathrooms are decorated in 22K gold trim, mirroring the bathroom below, which is decorated with 22K gold and ruby marble. The bathrooms are fed water from a tank on the third floor, used as for storage or other amenities. The backstairs lead down to the first floor. The kitchen with its original soapstone sink and coal stove is located to your left, with the butlers pantry just beyond containing the original copper sink and the household china. The cabinetwork in these rooms are all northern pine, a tree now extinct. The basement can be reached by another flight of stairs and contains tools and utensils throughout the history of house, many of which were used in the building of the mansion. One of the oddities is a child-sized coffin set as a reminder of the high mortality rate during child-birthing in the 1800s.

The palazzo was probably built from 1555, but remained unfinished. Allied bombardment in 1945 demolished a great part of the building. However, conspicuous remains of Palladio‚Äôs construction survive: the majestic access portal and a courtyard with columns and entablature.

If the dating is uncertain (the majority of scholars dates the beginning of construction to 1555), equally vague is our knowledge of the building‚Äôs actual form. This was only partially executed and can be reconstructed, therefore, only from the plate in the I quattro libri dell'architettura (1570), in this case particularly unfaithful. Patron There are no doubts, however, about the identity of the patron, Giambattista Dalla Torre. Tied by familial bonds to the Vicentine Valmarana and Marcantonio Thiene (who commissioned his family palace from Palladio, Palazzo Thiene), he was a friend of intellectuals and artists; above all Giangiorgio Trissino, but also the great geographer Giambattista Ramusio, the doctor Giovanni Fracastoro and the architect Michele Sanmicheli.

It became the county seat when Riverside County, California, was established in 1893.  Precolonial period  Prior to the colonization of Mexico and Alta California by Spain, the land that would become Riverside, California, was frequented by various Native American people. No permanent settlements are known to have existed, but occasional villages close to the river were documented by later explorers. Artifacts found at White Sulphur Springs, as well as grain grinding holes in rocks south of Mount Rubidoux, provide evidence of the Native American activity.  Spanish period  Sherry Peticolas's statue of Juan Bautista de Anza in Riverside, California On March 20, 1774, Juan Bautista De Anza, leading an exploratory expedition to find a good land route from southern Mexico to Alta California, reached the area today known as Riverside. He, and others in his contingent, described the area as a beautiful place fragrant with rosemary and other herbs, and having rich grasslands for their horses and cattle to graze. He named the area Valle de Paraiso, or Valley of Paradise. This was the first official record made of what was to become the city of Riverside.Why did Captain Juan Bautista de Anza return to Riverside, California?. Riverside Chamber of Commerce, 1975. Page 3. De Anza lead a second expedition through the area on December 31, 1775. This expedition was a colonizing expedition headed for Monterey. They spent New Year's Eve on the banks of the Santa Ana River, and crossed the river the following day. The routes taken by the two expeditions are believed to have followed a course from somewhere near Lake Perris, in current-day Moreno Valley, down the Box Springs grade near the 60/215 Highway interchange, and across Riverside in the direction of the Martha McLean ‚Äì Anza Narrows park. A marker in the park was dedicated to recognize the point where the group crossed the Santa Ana River. To commemorate De Anza's expeditions, the city of Riverside, through private donations and a federal grant from the Works Progress Administration, began work on a 20-foot statue of De Anza in 1939.Baggs, Terry.

The Press Enterprise Company, Riverside, CA, 1964. Pages 174‚Äì175. American period The California Silk Center Association was established in November, 1869, and included some of the land that would later become Riverside. The Association dissolved in April, 1870, when Louis Prevost, the only member of the Association knowledgeable on silk farming, passed away unexpectedly. On September 12, 1870, the Southern California Colony Association of Jurupa was formed, and on September 14th they purchased much of the Silk Association's land and water rights. Initially the new colony was referred to as Jurupa, for the name of the original Rancho that occupied the area, but the Colony Association formally adopted the name Riverside on December 18, 1870.Gunther, pp 506-507. = Citrus history = A navel orange, also known as the Washington, Riverside, or Bahia navel. In 1873 Eliza Tibbets convinced William Saunders, Superintendent of the fledgling Bureau of Agriculture, to make her a test grower for his new seedless oranges from Bahia, Brazil.William Saunders' journal, unpub., quoted in USDA, The Navel Orange of Bahia, Bull. No. 445 (Washington, DC: GPO), 5‚Äì6.USDA, Annual Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, 64. By planting and nurturing the orange trees that Saunders sent her, Tibbets revolutionized the citrus industry.Bailey, 1595. Introduction of these oranges, later called the Washington Navel Orange, proved to be the most successful experiment of Saunders' tenure, and one of the outstanding events in the economic and social development of California. For the next 60 years and more, a great industry was built up from the two small trees planted in Riverside by Eliza Tibbets. The citrus industry in California had begun before Tibbets' introduction of the Washington navel orange. However, there was no outstanding early and midseason variety of sweet orange generally adapted to the climate. Extant citrus was mostly seedling trees grown from seeds obtained locally or from the Spanish missions. Growers experimented, but there was a lack of standardization in quality. Eliza Tibbets planted the two trees in her garden in 1873. It is widely accepted that she took care of the two remaining trees using dishwater to keep them alive because the Tibbets lot was not connected to canal water.Roistacher, PGCGN, 60.Klotz, \\"Eliza Tibbets,\\" 17. Agriculture officials attribute the success of the two trees that did flourish to Eliza Tibbets' care. The first fruits borne by these trees were produced in the season of 1875‚Äì76.Shamel, 1915, 3. When the Washington navel orange was publicly displayed at a fair in 1879, the valuable commercial characteristics of the fruit, including their quality, shape, size, color, texture, and seedlessness, were immediately recognized.USDA, Bud Selection, 2USDA, 1937 yearbook Tibbets' orange was also ideally suited to Riverside's semiarid weather, and its thick skin enabled it to be packed and shipped.Shamel & Pomeroy, Washington Navel Orange, 9. The contrast between this new fruit and that of seedling trees was so striking that most new grove plantings were of Washington navel oranges.Roistacher, PGCGNShamel & Pomeroy, The Washington Navel Orange, 8. Tibbets sold budwood from her trees to local nurserymen, which led to extensive plantings of nursery trees cloned from hers = Legacy of introduction = Tibbets' success with the navel orange had led to a rapid increase in citrus planting,Dumke, Boom, 14. and the citrus planted was predominantly the Washington navel orange. The commercial success of these early orchards soon led to a widespread interest in this variety, so that by 1900 it was the most extensively grown citrus fruit in California.USDA, A. D. SHAMEL, C. S. POMEROY, and R. E. CARYL, Bud selection in the Washington navel orange progeny tests of limb variations. Washington, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture;1929USDA Yearbook 1937. The growth that the Washington Navel Orange (WNO) produced in Riverside spread throughout the state, driving the state and even the national economy. Citrus assumed a major place in California's economy.Gerald D. Nash, State Government and Economic Policy: A History of Administrative Policies in California 1849‚Äì1933 (New York: Arno Press, 1979 ¬©1964) 140State Board, 13. By 1917 WNO culture was a $30 million per year industry in California.Dorsett & Shamel, 1917. By 1933 the WNO industry in CA had grown to an industry with an annual income of $67 million.Cal Statutes. From one million boxes of oranges in 1887 to more than 65.5 million boxes of oranges, lemons, and grapefruit in 1944, despite the depression years of the 1930s, the California citrus industry experienced nothing short of explosive growth. The success of Tibbets' orange inspired irrigation projects which converted more desert to orange groves.State Board, 14 The size, scale, and ingenuity of the irrigation structures in Riverside and surrounding area are considered one of the agricultural marvels of the age.Nash, \\"Economic Growth,\\" 319 citing Nash, State Government, By 1893 Riverside was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States. Money poured into California. Tibbets' orange led to an estimated $100 million of direct and indirect investment in citrus industry over the next 25 years.. But see: Michael A. Lane \\"Scientific Work of Government,\\" Making of America Vol VII, ed. Robert Marion La Follette. Robert Marion La Follette, Charles Higgins, William Matthews Handy (Chicago,: Making of America, 1906.) But Eliza Tibbets' orange did not merely feed the wealth and growth of existing towns; new cities and towns popped up whose birth, existence, and future depended upon the condition of the orange market.State Board, 13‚Äì14. In 1886 alone new citrus towns were laid out in Rialto, Fontana, Bloomington, Redlands, Terracina, Mound City (Loma Linda), Guasti and South Riverside, (Corona). Irrigated communities like Etiwanda, Redlands, Ontario and many others were launched.Tom Patterson, \\"The Tibbets, the Navel Orange, and the Dishpan,\\" in Landmarks of Riverside and the Stories Behind Them (Riverside, CA: Press- Enterprise Co., 1964) 31. The rapidly expanding citrus industry also stimulated the capital market for real estate. As the industry grew, land which had been regarded as worthless dramatically increased value. Not only did orange culture feed the land boom of the 1880s in Southern California; it allowed Riverside to survive when the land boom collapsed in 1888. (See also: Panic of 1893.) The success of Tibbets' orange stimulated related industries. Citrus built the foundations of the region's economic modernization before the great flood of defense funds began in World War II. Tibbets' introduction of the Washington navel orange was largely responsible for the fruit packing houses, inventions in boxing machines, fruit wraps and the iced railroad car. By the mid-1880s, five packing houses sprang up in Riverside. Many methods developed in the course of the growth of this industry, which had a wide application, to other fruit growing industries as well to citrus. The study and efforts of pioneers in the development of the California citrus industry led to the invention of fumigation, of orchard heaters, and of many other methods of culture. In 1897‚Äì1898, Benjamin and Harrison Wright invented and patented a mechanized orange washer. By the end of 1898, two-thirds of Riverside's packinghouses were using the machines. At the turn of the century, Stebler and Parker began manufacturing citrus packing machinery in Riverside independent of each other. The companies, which merged in 1922, became the California Iron Works, and later still Food Machinery Corporation (today's FMC Corp.). The Santa Fe Railroad opened a direct line to Riverside in 1886, allowing direct shipment to the east. Eight years later, the first refrigerated rail cars shipped oranges from Riverside to the east on the Santa Fe Railroad. Another illustration of the results of the success of the citrus industry in California was the organization of the growers into an exchange for the co-operative handling of their crop and its distribution. California Fruit Growers Exchange, a cooperative marketing association made up of local growers, was founded in 1893; it is now known as Sunkist Growers, Incorporated. A key feature of the growth of the Washington Navel orange industry was a scientific approach to improvement. Study of propagation culture handling, transportation and other phases of producing distributing and marketing the crop was largely responsible for advancements used not only with citrus but also in other fruit industries. In 1893, cyanide gas was used to fight citrus scale. A U. S. Department of Agriculture scientist helped growers to harness nature's biological wrath during the \\"decay crisis\\" of 1905‚Äì1907, when alarming proportions of fruit spoiled in transit, and wed the industry to the scientific expertise of the USDA. Growers, scientists, and workers transformed the natural and social landscape of California, turning it into a factory for the production of millions of oranges. Orange growers in California developed the commercialized agriculture that only spread to the rest of the country a generation later. In 1906, University of California established in Riverside its Citrus Experiment Station, the beginnings of the University of California, Riverside. Originally located on the slope of Mount Rubidoux, the station institutionalized the scientific expertise, support, and presence of the state's university and the federal government in the citrus industry, and brought quality control to the first link in the corporate agricultural chain. In a field department was created which provided member growers with scientific and practical horticultural advice and direction that ultimately led to huge gains in productivity. Tibbets' orange allowed agriculture in California to survive transition from wheat. Wheat had been the single most profitable crop statewide between 1870 and 1900 as California became one of the largest grain producers in the nation.Nash, State Government 117. Sometime about 1880, many agriculturalists in the central valley and Southern California began to convert to fruit. Soil and climate were obviously conducive to such a conversion.Nash, \\"Economic Growth,\\" 318. After the turn of the century, wheat exports began a rapid decline prompted by intense Canadian and Russian competition and declining grain yields due to soil depletion. As the soil became depleted by wheat growing, the large fields were subdivided and used for horticulture. Agriculture thus came to provide a firm foundation for the state's economy. =Asian-American history= Settlements of Japanese and Korean migrants used to exist along the railroad tracks, which would fill with thousands of workers during the citrus harvest. None of these remain, but the Santa Fe depot, like several others in the Inland Empire, has been restored to its turn-of-the-century glory. Today, many of Riverside's Asian Americans live in the sections of Arlington and La Sierra, the majority being Chinese American and Korean American. The largest Korean American church in the city is Riverside Korean Baptist Church near Arlington. Riverside's first Chinatown was located in Downtown Riverside, but growing anti-Chinese sentiment and a series of city ordinances, including one that outlawed laundry businesses in the Downtown Mile Square, precipitated the Chinese community's relocation to an area bounded by Brockton and Tequesquite Avenues. The last resident of this Chinatown, George Wong (Wong Ho Leun), died in the 1970s and the remaining buildings were razed. A proposed development spurred archaeological investigations of the Chinatown site in the 1980s. Artifacts that were unearthed during these investigations are housed at the Riverside Metropolitan Museum across from the Mission Inn Hotel. Following the archaeological study, the Chinatown site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The site had previously been landmarked as a State Point of Historical Interest, County landmark, and City Landmark. In 2008, the Save Our Chinatown Committee was formed to protect the Chinatown archaeological site from commercial development and increase awareness of Riverside's Chinese American history through public programming. In 1915 a Japanese immigrant named Jukichi Harada, proprietor for many years of a local restaurant, purchased a home in Riverside in the names of his American-born children in order to provide access for them to the public school system. Neighbors formed a committee and charged him with violating the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which barred aliens ineligible for citizenship from owning land. The case, The People of the State of California v. Jukichi Harada, became a test of the constitutionality of the law and progressed to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the Harada children could own land. The Metropolitan Museum of Riverside now owns the Harada House, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark. Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian-born politician elected to the United States Congress (and the only Sikh-American), was voted into office in 1956 to represent a district that included Riverside. A substantial community of Indian Americans including Sikhs and Punjabis lived in Riverside with the Inland Empire and the Colorado Desert regions (i.e. Imperial Valley) for nearly a century. Filipinos (see Filipino American) have been in Riverside for over 100 years. Known as the Pensionados, they were Philippine nationals sent to live in the United States to learn the principles of liberty and self- government. Since the US annexed the Philippines from 1898 to its independence in 1946, the Filipino community of Riverside and Riverside county are well numerous (i.e. in nearby Moreno Valley). =African-American history= At the intersection of Howard and 12th sits the last remnants of a formerly thriving African-American neighborhood. The old Wiley Grocery store now houses the activities of \\"Black\\" Prince Hall Masons. Nearby is the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a pilgrimage site complete with shrine. Built and destroyed three times, the current incarnation dates from the 1920s. And the Bobby Bonds recreation center named for the major league baseball legend. Extensive information on Riverside's African American Community can be found on the Riversider.Org website. One of Riverside's claims to fame was the Riverside International Raceway. It was open from 1957 to 1989. =Sports history= Riverside was home to the Riverside International Raceway from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989. Races held at the Riverside International Raceway included Cal-Club (SCCA), Formula One, NASCAR, Can-Am, USAC, IMSA, IROC, and CART. The raceway was closed in 1989 to make way for a shopping mall and housing development five years after the raceway property was incorporated with the city of Moreno Valley in 1984. In 2003, plans were announced to build a 3-mile (4.8 km) road course near Merced, California, based on the design of the Riverside layout. The new track would have been known as the Riverside Motorsports Park. Riverside has had three minor league baseball teams: one in 1941 known as the Riverside Reds, and two from the class-A California League ‚Äì the Riverside Red Wave from 1988 to 1990, and the Riverside Pilots (a Seattle Mariners Class-A minor league affiliate) from 1993 to 1995. The teams played at the UC-Riverside Sports Center also known as the Blaine Sports Complex. The Red Wave moved to Adelanto in 1990 to become the High Desert Mavericks and the Pilots moved to Lancaster in 1995 to become the Lancaster JetHawks. The Pilot's move occurred after a long-standing dispute between the Pilots, the California League, and the city to build a new facility to replace the Blaine Sports Complex. Today, a semi-pro collegiate team, the Inland Empire Rockets, plays some home games in Riverside and Moreno Valley. In the early 1940s before the start of World War II, the Riverside Reds whom played cross-region rival the San Bernardino Bucs when two major league teams ‚Äì the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh Pirates held spring training in the area, followed by the California Winter League and in the 1950s, was the site for the Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies as well the St. Louis Browns (Baltimore Orioles). Riverside is the hometown of Bobby Bonds and his son Barry Bonds, and Dusty Baker, current manager of the Houston Astros, and former manager of the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Washington Nationals. Although from Donora, Pennsylvania, Ken Griffey and his son Ken Griffey Jr. have residences in Riverside.

Renalase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that is secreted into the blood from the kidney.  Structure = Gene = The gene encoding this protein is called RNLS (also known as C10orf59 or FLJ11218). The renalase gene has 9 exons spanning approximately 311,000 bp and resides on chromosome 10 at q23.33. =Protein= The renalase protein consists of a putative secretory signal peptide (SignalP score of 0.4), a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding region, and an oxidase domain. At least four alternative splicing isoforms have been identified in humans (hRenalase1 to hRenalase4). Only hRenalase1 is detected in human blood samples, which means that hRenalase2 to 4 probably have different functions than hRenalase1. Analysis of the primary structure of renalase shows that it is an FAD-dependent oxidase. The X-ray crystal structure of hRenalase1 reveals structural similarity between renalase and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.  Function  Renalase has been claimed to degrade catecholamines like adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in the blood circulation. Dr. Gary Desir's laboratory at Yale School of Medicine discovered and named renalase in 2005 suggest that the human kidney releases this protein into the bloodstream to regulate blood pressure (in addition to other possible, as yet undiscovered, functions). Whether renalase actually oxidizes catecholamine substrates has been widely disputed. The primary evidence for catecholamine oxidation is the detection of H2O2, however catecholamines emanate H2O2 in the presence of O2 in a natural decomposition reaction. In 2013, renalase was claimed to oxidize Œ±-NADH (the normal form of NADH is the Œ≤ anomer) to Œ≤-NAD, with concomitant reduction of O2 (dioxygen) to H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). This reaction was proposed to repair aberrant NADH and NADPH forms that are not accepted as cofactors by most nicotinamide-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes. It transpired that Œ±-NAD(P)H molecules are not substrates for renalase; instead 6-dihydroNAD (6DHNAD) was identified as the substrate, a molecule with highly similar spectrophotometric characteristics and equilibrium concentrations as those reported for Œ±-NAD(P)H. 6DHNAD is an isomeric form of Œ≤-NADH that carries the hydride in the 6-position of the nicotinamide base as opposed to the metabolically active 4-position. This form of NAD is one of three products that are formed from non-enzymatic reduction of Œ≤-NAD in addition to 4-dihydroNAD (Œ≤-NADH), 2-dihydroNAD (2DHNAD). Both 2DHNAD and 6DHNAD were shown to be substrates for renalase. These molecules react rapidly to reduce the enzyme's flavin cofactor forming Œ≤-NAD. The renalase flavin then delivers the electrons harvested to O2 (dioxygen) forming H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), completing the catalytic cycle. It was shown that both 6DHNAD and 2DHNAD are tight binding inhibitors of specific primary metabolism dehydrogenases, thereby defining a clear metabolic function for renalase in the alleviation of this inhibition. Extracellular renalase functions as a survival and growth factor, independent of its enzymatic activity. Either naturally folded renalase or a 20 amino acid renalase peptide can activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in a manner that protects cells against apoptosis.  Catalysis  Renalase converts either 6-dihydro-NAD(P)H (left) or 2-dihydro-NAD(P)H (right) to NAD(P)+. Renalase isolated in native form, that is, without refolding steps, catalyzes the oxidation of 6DHNAD(P) or 2DHNAD(P), the isomeric forms of Œ≤-NAD(P)H . In contrast to clear evidence for catalysis of this activity, the native renalase used in these experiments did not catalyze the conversion of the catecholamine epinephrine to adrenochrome. Renalase is secreted in plasma, and functions as an anti-apoptotic survival factor. The Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase PMCA4b is a putative receptor for extracellular renalase. The binding of renalase to PMCA4b stimulates calcium efflux with subsequent activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, increased expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, and decreased caspase3-mediated apoptosis. Administration of recombinant renalase protects against acute kidney injury (AKI), and against cardiac ischemia in animal models.  Clinical significance  Renalase levels are markedly reduced in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (end-stage renal disease, ESRD). Since hormones like erythropoietin are secreted less in ESRD, renalase may also be a kidney hormone, although it is also expressed in heart muscle, skeletal muscle and liver cells in humans, and in mouse testicles. Renalase has been controversially proposed to degrade catecholamines, which are hormones involved in the acute stress (fight-or-flight) response. Injection of renalase in rodents transiently decreases blood pressure, heart rate, heart muscle contractility, and blood vessel resistance. Under normal conditions, renalase is present but inactive in the bloodstream. When catecholamines are released into the bloodstream however, renalase activity increases about tenfold within 30 seconds, and remains high for an hour or longer. Activation of circulating renalase is probably responsible for early activation, while secretion into the bloodstream occurs after 15 minutes. polymorphisms in the renalase gene is a risk factor for essential hypertension. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the renalase gene are associated with type 1 diabetes. A genome-wide association study and meta-analysis found that approximately 42 loci affect the risk of diabetes The data confirmed linkage with most of the 24 previously identified loci, and identified 27 novel loci. The strongest evidence of association among these novel regions was achieved for the renalase gene.  Animal studies  In mice, hearts exposed to oxygen shortage (ischemia), myocardial infarction size was decreased and heart function better preserved when renalase was administered. Renalase knock-out mice are also more sensitive to damage to the heart muscle. Renalase expression in the heart is also decreased in the rat model of end-stage renal disease. The scientists who discovered renalase believe that it might explain some of the susceptibility to heart disease among patients with chronic kidney disease. Using small inhibitory RNAs or knock-out mice, the consequences of loss of renalase function have been studied. These include raised blood pressure (hypertension), increased heart rate (tachycardia), increased blood vessel resistance (vasoconstriction) and an increased catecholamine response. In a rat model of chronic kidney disease (in which 85% of kidney tissue is surgically removed), renalase deficiency and defective renalase activation develops 2‚Äì3 weeks after surgery.  Interactions  Renalase has been shown to interact with PMCA4b.

It was developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.  Plot  Choco Aoyama and Akasaka Sempai are students at Cross Academy. One day, while experimenting with Numblast cubes in the Scientific Alchemy Club, Choco accidentally turns club president Akasaka into a monkey. Choco then takes it upon himself to master the mysterious cubes so that he can harness their energy and restore Akasaka's human form.  Gameplay  The game is played on an 8x8 grid. Each space on the grid is occupied by a Numblast cube bearing a number between one and four. Players control a 2x2 cursor which is used to rotate groups of four cubes either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more of the same cube form a square, they turn red and rotate, and their number increases by one (four cycles back to one). If another square is then formed, the relevant cubes also turn red and rotate. This process continues until no new square is formed, at which point all the red cubes disappear and points are awarded (a \\"Numblast\\" occurs when the entire play area is cleared in the same combo). A few seconds later the empty spaces are filled with random cubes. If the player fails to clear a cube within a certain time, it will turn black, and if all cubes turn black, the game is over. If four black cubes of any number form a 2x2 square, that square cannot be rotated (although the individual cubes within the square can be rotated if the player's cursor covers at least one non-black cube). After a certain number of cubes have been cleared, a special star cube appears which can occupy any number. When the special cube is used as part of a square, it eliminates all cubes of whichever number the square is otherwise made up of.  Game Modes  There are three available modes: endless, time trial and puzzle. In endless mode, players attempt to score as many points as possible before all cubes have turned black. The rate at which cubes turn black is determined by difficulty (easy, medium or hard) and level (which increases as more cubes are cleared). In time trial mode, players attempt to score as many points as possible in three minutes. In puzzle mode, players are required to clear predetermined patterns of cubes using as few moves as possible. Bronze, silver and gold awards are available for each puzzle depending on how many moves are required. There are fifty puzzles in total.

Confirmed tornadoes=Pennsylvania= Two tornadoes touched down in Pennsylvania, one in Monroe County and one in Wyoming County. The first tornado was an EF2 in Monroe County that touched down around 1:30 pm EDT and tracked for . Five homes lost their roofs and several barns were destroyed along the tornado's path. Numerous power lines were also downed, resulting in several road closures. This tornado was one of 12 tornadoes to touch down in the county since 1950. In Cherry Valley, 25 power poles were downed, resulting in extensive internet and power outages. In Franklin County, a downburst caused structural damage. =New Jersey= In New Jersey, one EF2 tornado was confirmed in Sussex County. The tornado tracked for roughly before dissipating. Along its track, thousands of trees were uprooted and snapped, numerous segments of guardrail were destroyed, acres of farmland were lost and several structures were damaged. The tornado, peaking with winds up to touched down around 2:45 pm EDT and traveled for 15 minutes. The worst damage was along a stretch of the track in Wantage where a state of emergency was declared; in this area, hundreds of trees were tossed in multiple directions, a corn field was decimated by the tornado's winds and damaged a dairy farm. One tall silo, made of 40 tons of concrete and steel, was destroyed by the tornado. Two of the barns on the dairy farm were destroyed and two others were severely damaged. A large portion of one of the barns roof was torn off, and was tossed roughly before landing in the yard of another home. Another barn was pick up and twisted around despite being secured by 18 poles anchored 4 feet in the ground. There were also 100 cows on the farm at the time of the tornado, of which one was reported missing. Residents who saw the tornado reported that two of the cows were picked up and tossed by the tornado. On the dairy farm property alone, roughly 600 trees were uprooted. Severe storms in the region also produced damaging wind gusts up to . Torrential rainfall also fell within these storms, triggering widespread flash flooding. Numerous power lines were downed and a radio tower collapsed due to the winds. The tornado was one of 145 to touch down in the state since 1950 and the first to hit Wantage in 29 years. Throughout the state, roughly 25,000 residences were left without power due to the storms. =New York= In Unionville, New York, near the New York-New Jersey state line, a brief EF0 tornado touched down around 3:05 pm EDT. Dozens of trees were damaged and several more were uprooted. The most severe damage took place along County Highway 36. =Maryland= Around 2:46 pm EDT, an EF1 tornado touched down near Oldtown, Maryland in Allegany County. Several roads were closed due to downed trees and power lines, including route 51. Several homes were also damaged by the tornado. The path of the tornado was estimated to be long. A total of 810 residences were also left without power after the storm.

It has RPG elements, including dialogue trees, so it can also be called an action role-playing game, but it uses resource management as puzzles, requiring the player to combine items in order to advance in the game. It was created by Krome Studios Melbourne, in 1998, when they were called Beam Software Pty. Ltd. Plot What remains of Earth and most of its inhabitants after a nuclear holocaust is dominated and enslaved by the insect-like humanoid Raksha, invaders from another planet. Many years later, only the Resistance remains free, in the sewers of a ruined city. The player takes control of Finn, a villager in a jungle that the Raksha use to hunt their slaves as prey. A Raksha hunting lord marks Finn as a troublemaker, and he must outwit the Raksha, and seek aid wherever he can find it, to survive. His nemesis vanquished, Finn searches for answers about the fate of his civilization in a wartorn city, despite the Scavengers hunting through the ruins for scraps of remaining technology...and intruders. Gameplay Resource management is a key part of the game; items are collected, as in most games, but also combined; the latter is crucial to completing the game. Combining a wooden pole with a metallic blade forms a Spear, for example, or an empty bottle, petrol and a rag cloth to form a molotov cocktail. Separate NPCs make scavenged Raksha weapons usable and sellable, and level up Finn's psionic abilities. Finn's fighting abilities use a skill levelling system; the more Finn uses a weapon, the better he gets at using it.

Rijndael is free for any use public or private, commercial or non- commercial.Letter Submitted by creators Daemen and Rijndael The authors of Rijndael used to provide a homepageOriginal homepage and archived copy for the algorithm. Care should be taken when implementing AES in software, in particular around side-channel attacks. The algorithm operates on plaintext blocks of 16 bytes. Encryption of shorter blocks is possible only by padding the source bytes, usually with null bytes. This can be accomplished via several methods, the simplest of which assumes that the final byte of the cipher identifies the number of null bytes of padding added. = Implementation Considerations = Careful choice must be made in selecting the mode of operation of the cipher. The simplest mode encrypts and decrypts each 128-bit block separately. In this mode, called electronic code book (ECB), blocks that are identical will be encrypted identically; this is entirely insecure. It makes some of the plaintext structure visible in the ciphertext. Selecting other modes, such as using a sequential counter over the block prior to encryption (i.e., CTR mode) and removing it after decryption avoids this problem. Another mode, Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is one of the most commonly used modes of AES due to its use in TLS. CBC uses a random initialization vector (IV) to ensure that distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the same plaintext is encoded multiple times. The IV can be transmitted in the clear without jeopardizing security. A common practice is to prepend the 16 byte IV to the ciphertext, which gives the decrypter easy access to the IV. Care must be taken to use a new IV for every encryption operation, since otherwise an attacker can recover plaintext. * Current list of FIPS 197 validated cryptographic modules (hosted by NIST) * Current list of FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules with validated AES implementations (hosted by NIST) ‚Äì Most of these involve a commercial implementation of AES algorithms.

The first major step to its formation occurred in October 1990, when the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT) Greg Dyke met with the representatives of the \\"big five\\" clubs - David Dein of Arsenal, Philip Carter of Everton, Noel White of Liverpool, Martin Edwards of Manchester United and Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur.. The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for ITV if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. Talk of a super league of elite English clubs had been frequently mentioned by various footballing bodies, and by the media, since the mid 1980s. The fundamental difference between the old Football League and the breakaway league (what became the Premier League) is that the money in the breakaway league would only be divided between the clubs active in that division whilst in the previous arrangement it was shared between all Football League clubs across all divisions. The plan was drawn up for a Premier League of 18 clubs to be created in time for the 1992‚Äì93 season, although the recently announced plan to increase the First Division from 20 to 22 clubs for the 1991‚Äì92 season still went ahead, as the creation of the Premier League had still not been confirmed by this stage. However, 14 of the 22 clubs who would be competing in that season's First Division had agreed to form a breakaway league of their own if the Football Association's bid to create a breakaway league failed. The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it, however the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal F.C. held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position. Football League president Bill Fox even described the FA's plans to form a breakaway league as an attempt to \\"hijack\\" the First Division. ITV offered ¬£205 million for the television rights and later increased their offer to ¬£262 million but were outbid by Rupert Murdoch who saw it as an opportunity to lure new customers to their loss-making satellite service Sky Television plc who had been advised by the new Tottenham Hotspur Chairman Alan Sugar. Trevor East of ITV heard Sugar on the telephone speaking to Murdoch at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London in May 1992 advising an increased bid for the television rights. Sugar is alleged to have told Murdoch to \\"Blow them out of the water\\". On 27 May 1992, the Premier League was officially formed, with the first fixtures to be played on 15 August 1992. The new league would involve the 19th highest placed teams in that season's First Division as well as the champions, runners-up and playoff winners from the Second Division. The old Second Division would be renamed Division One, the Third Division would become Division Two and the Fourth Division would become Division Three. The three-up, three-down system of promotion and relegation, established in 1974 (although there had since been exceptions to the system on occasions when the league was being reorganised) would continue in the future. Sugar at the time was supplying Sky with satellite dishes and was the only chairman of a big five club to vote in favour of Sky's bid. He would soon take over Tottenham Hotspur. The other big clubs were reluctant to accept Sky's bid due to it being a non-terrestrial television service and no pledge from Sky to feature their games more regularly was made. Following a trial in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court by Justice Rose, it was held that the formation of the Premier League was not subject to judicial review, The Football Association being governed by private law.

The station was inaugurated in 1891 and closed in 1948; Between 2005 and 2009 the station was restored and converted to an entertainment and leisure venue, branded as The Station (HaTachanah). The grounds of the adjacent Israel Defense Forces History Museum are part of the historical station. History Jaffa railway station in 1892 Jaffa railway station in 2009 The idea to build a railway linking the coast with Jerusalem was first raised in the middle of the 19th century by Dr. Conrad Schick, Sir Moses Montefiore and others. The franchise for laying the railway was obtained from the Ottoman government by Joseph Navon, but due financial difficulties, he had to sell the franchise to a French company which was set up to build the line ‚Äì the Soci√©t√© du Chemin de Fer Ottoman de Jaffa √† J√©rusalem et Prolongements. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 31, 1890. The track was chosen to be of , similar to French minor railways, and was brought in from France and the Belgian manufacturer Angleur.Travis (2009), Chapter 5, pp. 33‚Äì35 A short gauge section, as well as a meter gauge section with a pier, was laid between the Port of Jaffa and the Jaffa Station to easily transport materials from the harbor to the railway. The first test run was made on the railway in October 1890, an event that was attended by some 10,000 onlookers‚Äîmore than half of the population of Jaffa. The locomotive was a Baldwin 2-6-0, one of the first three built for the line, and carried the American and French flags.Travis (2009), Chapter 5, pp. 35‚Äì41 The section between Jaffa and Ramla railway station was fully opened to the public on May 24, 1891, and a further section to Dayr Aban was opened on December 4 of the same year. The stations were built just a short time before the track was laid in their respective areas. In Jaffa and Jerusalem, the French railway company sought to build the stations as close as possible to the old cities, while the Ottoman authorities prevented them from doing so, resulting the terminuses' relative distance (for the time) from the city centers. Despite this, the land that the stations were built on was purchased at very high prices by the railway company.Travis (2009), Chapter 5, pp. 42 In 1892, construction of the whole line from Jaffa to Jerusalem was completed. The Jerusalem railway station was inaugurated on 26 September 1892 in the presence of the city's dignitaries, Jews and Arabs. Among those present at the ceremony was Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the reviver of the Hebrew language, which gave the train the literal name of - horse of the steel in Hebrew as the word Rakevet had not yet been created. The length of the journey was approximately 3.5‚Äì4 hours,Merrill, p. 300. Retrieved on 2009-05-01. about equal to the same trip on a carriage, and contrary to the original plan, which envisioned a 2-hour trip. Even so, Yosef Navon was granted several high-profile awards for his efforts, and the opening event received extensive media coverage worldwide.Travis (2009), Chapter 6, pp. 61‚Äì80 =During the British Mandate= During World War I, the railway was taken over by the Turkish and German armies, which adapted it to serve their needs.Biger (1995), p. 34 While the Jaffa railway station served as a military headquarters during the war, the Ottomans did not want to expose the railway itself to British naval bombardment. In early 1915, most of the heavy machinery and equipment was moved to Jerusalem, and later in the same year the Jaffa‚ÄìLydda section was completely dismantled. Its rails and sleepers were used in the construction of the Railway to Beersheba. The Lydda‚ÄìJerusalem section was re-laid to gauge, and Lydda was connected to the Hejaz railway through Tulkarm.Travis (2009), Chapter 12, pp. 157‚Äì182 When the British advanced northwards in November 1917, the railway was sabotaged by the retreating Turkish army and most (five) of its bridges were blown up.Cotterell (1984), Chapter 3, pp. 14‚Äì31 The Turks carried away anything that was movable, from railway cars and wooden rails to parts of the stations. It was however still valuable to the British, as it provided the only viable link from Jerusalem to Egypt, as the roads were in disrepair.Kark (2001), p. 138 Trestle bridges were installed instead of the destroyed iron ones and a gauge railway was built from Jaffa to Lydda, with an extension to the Yarkon River, the front line at the time., it continued to be used until 1922‚Äì23 mainly for transporting construction materials, without locomotives. Another gauge railway extension was built from Jaffa railway station to Port of Jaffa, which operated until 1928. In 1918, the Palestine Military Railways of the victorious British forces rebuilt the line to the wider , an operation that lasted between January 27 and June 15. The final section, between Jaffa and Lydda, was completed in September 1920, and inaugurated in a ceremony attended by Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner, on October 5.Travis (2009), Chapter 13, 183‚Äì189 In April 1920Cotterell, 1984, page 32 the civilian Palestine Railways took over the line and Britain compensated its original French operators with ¬£565,000, down from the original demand of ¬£1.5 million made by the French. The coastal railway now extended from Haifa to El Kantara, intersecting the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem line with a junction at Lydda. =The station after 1948= Immediately following the declaration of independence by the state of Israel, services were moved to Tel Aviv South railway station 2.5 km to the east and the station was closed. (Services were then moved once again in 1970 2 km further out towards the city's outskirts, which itself became disused when a completely new railway alignment in Tel Aviv started operating in the mid-1990s.)

It is Child ballad number 193 and its Roud number is 335 . The ballad is a classic story of the Border Reivers, and tells of an alliance between the Hall family of Redesdale and the Crosier family of Liddesdale in Scotland, against the Reeds. Percival Reed held the office of Keeper of Redesdale, and had arrested a Crosier for raiding in the valley. This put the Reeds at feud with the Crosier family. The Halls, old friends of Percy Reed, turned against him and conspired with the Crosiers to trap him while he was out hunting. When the Crosiers ambushed Percy, the Halls stood by and watched as he was murdered. In local tradition, Percy Reed's ghost is said to have haunted Redesdale for many years, and \\"at times he would come gallantly cantering across the moorland as he had done when blood ran warm in his veins. ...And yet, again, he would come as a fluttering, homeless soul, whimpering and formless, with a moaning cry for Justice- Justice-Judgment on him who had by black treachery hurried him unprepared to his end.\\"John Lang, Stories of the Border Marches, Dodge Publishing Company, New York, 1916, p. 228. Synopsis Parcy Reed arrests the reiving outlaw Whinton Crosier. The Crosier clan then vows to destroy the house and lands of Troughend in revenge. Parcy Reed goes hunting with three Halls, who are neighbors and friends from nearby Girsonfield. Unknown to Parcy Reed, the Halls have forged an alliance with the Crosiers to betray him. After hunting throughout the day ‚Äúall Reedwater round‚Äù, the hunting party stops to rest at Batinghope, where Parcy Reed falls fast asleep. While he is asleep, the three ‚Äúfalse Halls‚Äù steal his powder horn, pour water into the barrel of his gun, wedge his sword in its sheath, and remove the bridle from his horse, thus depriving Parcy of the means to either fight or flee. When the Crosier clan is seen galloping over the hill, the Halls awaken Parcy and inform him of the danger. Parcy appeals to the Halls to stand with him, saying, ‚ÄúIf they be five men, we are four. If ye will all stand true to me, now every one of you may take one, and two of them ye may leave to me.‚Äù The Halls refuse to assist him in the fight, for they will surely be killed, they say. Parcy successively offers them his horse, his oxen, half his land, and ultimately the hand of his daughter if they will stand with him in the coming fight, but each Hall refuses in turn. Parcy then discovers their treachery in sabotaging his horse and weapons, and resigns himself to his fate. Without time for Parcy to even utter a prayer, the Crosiers close around him while the Halls stand by. Parcy makes a gallant fight of it and lashes out with his sword, still jammed in its sheath. Though he knocks one of the Crosiers to the ground, the rest of them strike, mangling him cruelly and leaving him with thirty-three wounds. After hacking off his hands and feet, they ride off leaving him lying on the ground. At dusk, a herdsman finds the dying Parcy and recognizes him. Parcy asks for a drink of water, and the herdsman procures it from a nearby spring, using his hat as a cup. Parcy asks for one more favor: to bear his farewells to his wife and kin at Troughend, and to tell all his faithful neighbors about the deeds of the ‚Äútreacherous Halls‚Äù.

Life Blaschke was born in Neustadt in West Prussia (now Wejherowo) and studied dentistry in Berlin and at the University of Pennsylvania. He trained as a dental surgeon in London and opened his own practice in late 1911. During World War I, he served as a military dentist in Frankfurt/Oder and in Berlin. After the war ended, he went back to private practice in Berlin. After treating Hermann G√∂ring in 1930, Blaschke began seeing other top Nazi leaders for dental work. Blaschke then joined the Nazi Party on 1 February 1931. G√∂ring recommended him to Hitler in 1933. After the successful treatment, Blaschke became Hitler's personal dentist. As well as Hitler, he also treated Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler. He joined the SS on 1 May 1935 and was appointed chief dentist of the SS on 31 August 1943. He was promoted to the rank of SS-Brigadef√ºhrer on 9 November 1944. In 1945 as the end of Nazi Germany drew near, Blaschke accompanied Hitler to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and later the F√ºhrerbunker. As the Red Army was closing in on Berlin, on 20 April, Hitler ordered Blaschke, Albert Bormann, Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, Dr. Theodor Morell, secretaries Johanna Wolf, Christa Schroeder, and other staff to leave Berlin by aircraft for the Obersalzberg. The group flew out of Berlin on different flights by aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel des F√ºhrers over the following three days. Blaschke's longtime dental assistant K√§the Heusermann had been offered a chance to fly out of Berlin with the others, but declined and stayed behind with Hitler until his death. Heusermann left on 1 May in one of the break-out groups and made her way back to her apartment by the morning of the following day. =Post-war= In early May, Soviet Red Army soldiers captured both Heusermann and Blaschke's longtime technician Fritz Echtmann. By 11 May, the Soviets confirmed through Heusermann and Echtmann that a dental bridge and part of a lower jawbone found outside the F√ºhrerbunker belonged to Hitler, and another dental bridge was Braun's. Before her visual inspection, Heusermann had been required to give a detailed description of Hitler and Eva's bridges and make detailed drawings of them. They were both separately shown the dental remains, which they confirmed. Heusermann went on to spend the next ten years in a Soviet prison and was released in June 1955. Echtmann, also spent several years in Soviet prisons until being released in December 1953. While in Austria, Blaschke was arrested by US Army forces on 20 May 1945. He was interrogated by the Americans after the war about Hitler's dental treatment in the hope that this would lead to the identification of his remains. Blaschke stated that he had been called in to examine Hitler in October 1944. He discovered that Hitler had a substantial gum infection in tooth number 6, which formed part of the fitted large dental bridge Blaschke had made for him in 1933, and Hitler wanted it to be dealt with quickly. Blaschke went on to recount that he carried out surgery to cut off part of the bridge and remove tooth number 6 due to the infection causing the severe toothache. After his release from captivity in December 1948, Blaschke continued to practice as a dentist in Nuremberg. Blaschke reconstructed the dental records of Martin Bormann from memory, and these were later used to identify his skeletal remains, which were discovered in Berlin in 1972. Hugo Blaschke died in Nuremberg at age 78 in 1959. He is buried in St. Peter Cemetery in Nuremberg, but the gravestone only stood until 1977 and since 1980 the grave has been occupied by the Gossler family.

He was a candidate at the 2001 mayoral elections of Marseille, and appeared on the third season of Secret Story in 2010. Biography=1998-2000= At an early age the dog was found in the garbage by the Soci√©t√© Protectrice des Animaux (Society for the Protection of Animals). He underwent several operations and was finally saved. He waited eight months behind the bars of his cage before being adopted by the team of L'√âcailler du Sud, a Marseille publishing house of detective novels, notably by the writer Serge Scotto who made him his mascot and named him Saucisse (\\"Sausage\\"). =2000-2014= Saucisse quickly became the hero of many of novels and his reputation began to spread across the Marseille region. On 14 September 2000, a square in the city of Marseille was inaugurated and named after him, becoming the Place du Chien Saucisse.() He gained wider fame for his candidacy during the 2001 municipal elections of 2001 in Marseille in the first area (1st and 7th arrondissement) as the mascot of an alternative eponymous list led by St√©phane Joiris with the slogan \\"For a more human sauci√©t√© [society].\\" This list managed to rank sixth with 4.5% of the votes, defeating the candidate of the local party Rally for France by almost 1 percentage point. Thereafter, Serge Scotto registered his dog to the 2002 French presidential election. Serge Scotto introduced his dog to many celebrities, taking him to trade shows and literary gatherings. Saucisse appeared on many television shows including Vie priv√©e, vie publique, hosted by Mireille Dumas, La M√©thode Cauet or On ne peut pas plaire √† tout le monde by Marc-Olivier Fogiel. Saucisse was photographed with many people such as √àve Ruggieri, Bernard Werber, Florence Foresti and Raymond Devos. During these few years, Saucisse continued to follow Scotto and was \\"used\\" several times by the latter as a media figure to expose certain injustices such as the kidnapping of Florence Aubenas and Hussein Hanoun. The dog also helped his master during all these years in his columns for the daily M√©tro. In 2002, a vintage wine named \\"Cuv√©e Chien Saucisse\\" was created in Roquemaure. In 2007, Scotto composed a duet he sang with his dog, accompanied by the group Musard entitled \\"Petit Chien des Rues\\" (\\"Little Dog of the Streets\\"), in reference to the Saucisse's early life. On 17 September 2009, in the reality show Secret Story 3, Benjamin Castaldi announced the arrival of a new resident, aged 77 years old, for the following week. Thus, on 24 July 2009, after many rumors on this subject, Saucisse entered the house and was renamed 'Secret' for the occasion. He entered with his own secret which was : \\"I was candidate for Mayor at the City hall of Marseille\\". This secret was on the list of secrets since the beginning of the 3rd season. During his participation in the reality show, Saucisse was only with other candidates from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm daily and consulted his veterinarian twice every day. The money he won was given to the Soci√©t√© protectrice des animaux. However, he left the house on 31 July and his secret was not discovered by other contestants. Saucisse died 22 November 2014, aged approximately 16 years old. Bibliography * Collectif, La fiesta dessoude, dix nouvelles polici√®res √† Marseille, L'√âcailler du Sud, September 2001, 186 p.

The Catholic Chapel in the Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel. The Jewish Chapel in the Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel. The Protestant Chapel in the Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel. The Chaplain Corps of the United States Air Force (USAF) is composed of both clergy‚Äîcommissioned officers who have been endorsed and ordained by a religious organization‚Äîand enlisted Religious Affairs. As military chaplains, their main purpose is to support the free exercise of religion by members of the military service, their dependents, and other authorized personnel. They also provide advice on spiritual, ethical, moral, and religious-accommodation issues to the leadership of the United States Department of Defense. Air Force chaplains come from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Buddhism, Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Protestantism, and any other religious organization with an endorser that has been recognized by the Armed Forces Chaplains Board. Mission statement While serving as a visible reminder of the Holy, the Air Force Chaplain Corps provides spiritual care and the opportunity for Air Force members and their families to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of religion. History=Beginnings= The first American military chaplaincy was established by the Continental Congress on 29 July 1775. Chaplains were paid $20 per month, a captain's salary, and required no formal ordination or endorsement by a religious organisation. During the American Civil War, attempts were made by both government and church organization to increase professionalism. Ordination by an authorized ecclesiastical body became a legal requirement and the non-combatant status of chaplains was officially recognised. =Air Force= The first Air Chaplain of the United States Army Air Force was Captain Charles I. Carpenter, appointed 28 July 1942. Although the United States Air Force became a separate department on 18 September 1947, following the passage of the National Security Act, the Army opposed the creation of a separate Air Force chaplaincy as it would violate the Spaatz-Eisenhower Agreement, which stated that parallel organizations in the Army and the Air Force would not be approved unless organically necessary, and would serve as a precedent for the separation of other services. Carpenter, on the other hand, emphasized the need for a shared sense of identity between chaplains and the men they served and favored a separate Air Force chaplaincy. On 10 May 1949, after consulting with Carpenter, General Carl Spaatz ordered the institution of a separate Air Force chaplaincy; fewer than 10 of the 458 active duty chaplains elected to remain in the Army. Carpenter was promoted to major general and was appointed the first Air Force Chief of Chaplains, serving from 1949 to 1958. The Air Force Chaplain Assistant Specialist Career was established in 1948. Leadership The Chief of Chaplains of the United States Air Force (CCHAF) is the senior chaplain in the United States Air Force, the leader of the U.S. Air Force Chaplain Corps, and the senior adviser on religious issues to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. The CCHAF is responsible for establishing an effective chaplain program that meets the religious needs of all members of the Air Force by leading an Air Force Chaplain Corps of approximately 2,200 chaplains and chaplain assistants from the active and Air Reserve components. As a member of the Armed Forces Chaplains Board, the CCHAF advises the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff on religious, ethical and quality-of-life concerns. The position of Chief of Chaplains is currently held by Major General Dondi E. Costin. The Air Force Deputy Chief of Chaplains assists the Chief of Chaplains in directing and maintaining the Chaplain Corps. The position is currently held by Brigadier General Steve Schaick. The Chaplain Assistant Air Force Career Field Manager runs the chaplain-assistant career field, preparing chaplain assistants to support the Air Force Chaplain Corps and advising the Air Force Chief of Chaplains on policy matters regarding chaplain assistants and the Air Force Chaplain Corps. The position is currently held by Chief Master Sergeant Dale McGavran. Air Force Chaplain Corps College The Air Force Chaplain Corps College (AFCCC) is located at the Ira C.

Legislation Beginning in 2005, Joanne Giannini became the leading proponent to change the prostitution law in Rhode Island, every year submitting bills to close what she termed the legal \\"loophole\\" that allowed indoor prostitution. \\"Rape behind closed doors, is that permissible? Is murder permissible if it's done behind closed doors?\\", she asked. Critics of her bills have argued that \\"In Joanne Giannini's world, prostitution and human trafficking are synonymous, and every prostitute is a victim, not an individual making a personal choice.\\" Giannini addressed the issue in her appearance in the 2009 documentary Happy Endings?, concerning the lives of the women in the Asian massage parlors in the center of the debate to re-criminalize prostitution.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1455623/ Giannini's bill was signed into law in November 2009. Another loophole in Rhode Island laws was discovered in July 2009 when a 16-year-old runaway girl from Boston was found working at a strip club in Providence. Shortly after that, Joanne Giannini introduced a bill to ban minors from working in strip clubs in Rhode Island. Her bill was successfully passed and signed into law a few months later. In January 2010, Representative Joanne Giannini introduced legislation that would make it illegal for Rhode Island drivers to use cell phones without a hands-free device. Representative Peter F. Kilmartin introduced similar legislation. These bills are currently being studied. Issues In March and April 2010, Rhode Island experienced significant flooding, which closed many businesses throughout the state, including the Warwick Mall. As chairperson of the House Finance Committee panel, Giannini expressed this concern about unemployed workers: \\"I'm looking to see what else we can do\\" to reduce backlogs and delays that unemployed people are experiencing.

It is not a systematic encyclopedia like the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, though with Pliny's work it represents one of the few Roman works dedicated to investigating the natural world. Seneca's investigation takes place mainly through the consideration of the views of other thinkers, both Greek and Roman, though it is not without original thought. One of the most unusual features of the work is Seneca's articulation of the natural philosophy with moralising episodes that seem to have little to do with the investigation. Much of the recent scholarship on the Naturales Quaestiones has been dedicated to explaining this feature of the work. It is often suggested that the purpose of this combination of ethics and philosophical 'physics' is to demonstrate the close connection between these two parts of philosophy, in line with the thought of Stoicism. Date The earliest date (terminus post quem) for writing is 60 AD,J. Tracy cross- references Hine (2006) in and it is generally thought to have been written around 62 to 64 AD. Contents The Naturales Quaestiones is addressed to Lucilius Junior: The work originally had eight books, but the book on the Nile (book 4a) is missing the second part, whereas the book concerning Hail and Snow (book 4b) is missing the first half. These two books have been joined by tradition to become book 4. The contents of these seven books are as follows: #meteors, halos, rainbows, mock suns, etc. #thunder and lightning. (theory of thunderstorms Posidonius, Ian Gray Kidd - Posidonius: The commentary. Vol.2 (p.503) (Cambridge University Press, 1988) [Retrieved 2015-3-18]) #water; this book also contains the description of the Roman heat exchangers, which were called \\"dracones\\", or \\"miliaria\\"; and a description of the deluge. #the Nile (4a) ; hail, snow, and ice (4b). (theory of hail Ian Gray Kidd - p.510 [Retrieved 2015-3-18]) #winds. #earthquakes and the sources of the Nile. #comets.

It is not a systematic work, but a collection of facts of nature from various writers, Greek and Roman, many of which are curiosities. Moral remarks are scattered through the work; and indeed the design of the whole appears to be to find a foundation for ethics in the knowledge of nature. There is an incontrovertible intertwinement of an ethical concern with the questions of nature (physics) in the work.Limburg, F. J. G., 2007, Doctoral thesis, p. 1-2. Leiden University Stoics from early in their history considered the telos (goal) of their efforts to be kata physin (according to nature). Thus for Seneca, virtue in a human was dependent on behaving in a natural way. The highest good or virtue is to live \\"according to one's own nature\\" (secundum naturam suam vivere in Ep. 41:9, Ep. 121:3); referring to both nature in general and one's own innate nature. Seneca had been the imperial advisor during the early part of Nero's reign before falling out of favour, and Seneca compliments Nero four times in Naturales quaestiones. A more indirect allusion to his former role can be found in book 2 when during a discussion of lightning bolts (Book 2.43), Seneca breaks off to urge rulers to always take counsel from their advisors. Seneca thought that promoting an active interest in science to Nero would be beneficial to the emperor's morality. Contemplation of nature for Seneca \\"unchains the mind\\" enabling a person to transcend evil, and by experiencing the totality (totum) of nature, develop a consciousness and being more compatible with direct experience of God, by elevating one's moral nature.

Outside these areas, he is best known for his participation in the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest.  Early life and career  Rapsat was born in the Ixelles municipality of Brussels to a Flemish father and a mother of Asturian descent. When Rapsat was 10 years old the family moved to Verviers, which remained his home for the rest of his life. He started performing with various groups before launching a solo career in 1973. His musical style was eclectic, ranging from rock to chanson, but at this stage earned him little success.  Eurovision Song Contest  In 1976 Rapsat's self-composed song \\"Judy et Cie\\" (\\"Judy and Co.\\") was chosen as the Belgian entry for the twenty first Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 3 April in The Hague. With its haunting melody and melancholy lyrics, it was an unusual and atypical song for Eurovision at that time. In a strong field, it finished the evening in eighth place out of 18 entries, and is often cited by Eurovision fans as being among Belgium's best.  Later career  Rapsat's first major success post-Eurovision came in 1982 with the album L√¢chez les fauves which sold 30,000 copies in Wallonia. The albums Ligne claire (1984) and J'aime √ßa (1986) also sold well, and marked Rapsat's first success in the French market. He continued to release albums to critical acclaim in Belgium throughout the 1990s, although during this period his French success abated. It was not until the release of Dazibao in 2001 that he broke out of the Belgian market once again to enjoy widespread success and acclaim in other Francophone countries.

The island was formed by a series of eruptions in the 17th century. It is composed of lakebed sediments deposited above volcanic domes. It is one of two major islands in the lake, the other being the smaller Negit Island. Its name comes from a Native American word, Pa-o-ha, describing the abundant hot springs and fumaroles on its surface. History and geology Before the mid-17th century, the present-day Paoha Island did not exist.Hill, p. 327 Volcanic eruptions on the lakebed gave rise to the island, which eventually rose to above sea level, above the present-day elevation of Mono Lake. The pale color of the island is attributed to lakebed sediments rising above the lake surface along with the volcanic material. The volcanic origin of the island gave rise to many vents, hot springs, fumaroles and mudpots on the surface of the island. An eruption sometime before the twentieth century created a crater lake that is shaped like a heart. Paoha Island is the younger of the two Mono Lake islands; Negit rose about 1,350 years before Paoha.Hill, p. 328 Paoha Island was named by Israel Cook Russell, a well-known American geologist, in the late 19th century.Hill, p. 326 It supposedly received its name from the Paiute word pa-o-ha, for spirits they believed to exist in Paoha Island's hot springs. These spirits, or elves, were described as \\"diminutive sprites having long, waving hair, that were sometimes seen in the vapor- wreaths escaping from the hot springs.\\"Russell, p. 211 The surface sediments of Paoha Island consist primarily of clay and marl, which are responsible for the pale surface. Volcanic ash is scattered all around the island and basalt is exposed at some of the lower elevations. There are also river-deposited sediments and granite rocks.Russell, p. 212 In his semi-autobiographical book Roughing It, writer Mark Twain recounted a \\"voyage of discovery\\" to the island while camping on the shores of Mono Lake. He and a companion had been led to believe that on the island \\"within ten feet of the boiling spring is a spring of pure cold water, sweet and pure,\\" but once there they \\"found nothing but solitude, ashes, and heartbreaking silence\\"‚Äîand they had already emptied their canteens. Meanwhile, their untethered rowboat began to drift away. Marooned, they would have died of thirst and starvation: it was a twelve-mile swim back to shore and \\"that venomous [lake] water would eat a man's eyes out like fire, and burn him out inside too, if he shipped a sea.\\" As the wind of a rising storm blew the rowboat past an island cape, Twain's companion managed to jump aboard and recover it. Description Paoha Island is located in the central part of Mono Lake, slightly closer to the western shore. It is a roughly oval- shaped landmass north-south and east-west. It is separated from Negit Island, to the north-northwest, by a narrow channel. During low water levels, Negit Island and eventually Paoha Island become connected to the mainland in one giant peninsula. The island is more mountainous near the east side, with the highest volcanic domes rising more or less than above the lake surface. The highest cone, which contains the heart-shaped crater lake, is located at the far northeastern end of the island. Several small islets are located off the island's west and south shores.

The trial served to show Marius‚Äôs impartiality when dealing out justice that made him popular among his soldiers as well as the common Roman citizens. Valerius Maximus calls Trebonius, Gaius Plotius. Because Plutarch says that this event contributed to Marius' third election as consul, the trial most likely took place in 104 BC. This event is not related to Gaius Trebonius, one of the allies and later assassins of Julius Caesar. Setting Gaius Lusius was the son of the sister of Gaius Marius, and had been given the position of a commissioned officer during the Cimbrian War between Rome and the Proto-Germanic tribe of the Cimbri. Plutarch describes Lusius as a man who had sexual feelings for a young soldier under his command, but was not generally a bad man. Cicero describes the Trial of Trebonius (although not by name) and describes Trebonius as ‚Äúthe virtuous youth.‚ÄùCicero, Marcus Tullius. Speech in Defense of Titus Annius Milo. Yonge. pp. 9. Valerius Maximus and Cicero both say that Lusius was a military tribune. Marian reforms to the military had lessened the power and number of military tribunes. Despite this, he attempted to use his position to seduce Trebonius, who had so far not cooperated with his advances. Lusius summoned Trebonius to his tent and attempted to rape the young soldier. Trebonius had no choice but to go to the tent, because he could not disobey the summons of his commander. Inside the tent, Trebonius killed Lusius with his sword. Trial Gaius Lusius‚Äôs uncle, Gaius Marius, returned and had Trebonius brought to trial. Plutarch describes there being many accusers against Trebonius, but no one to defend him.Plutarch, Mestrius. \\"Marius\\" Roman Lives. Waterfield. pp. 134. Cicero and Maximus both claim that Lusius's position as a tribune could account for this, in that he would have probably held political power during life, and others may have been afraid of a similar fate if Trebonius was not suitably punished. Trebonius took up his own cause and defended himself before the trial. He provided examples of Lusius‚Äôs unceremonious behavior, and offered up witnesses to testify about Lusius‚Äôs acts. Lusius had often made generous offers towards Trebonius and had often made advances on him, but Trebonius had never given into his seductions. Marius was impressed with both the courage of Trebonius‚Äôs self defence at his trial, as well as his unwavering affirmation of Lusius‚Äôs attempts to seduce and bribe him. He ordered the laurel which symbolized the prize for valour to be placed on the head of Trebonius. Marius declared Trebonius‚Äôs deeds as noble and that he was an example to show other Romans how to behave. Both Cicero and Valerius Maximus agree that it was Gaius Lusius‚Äôs advances towards Trebonius that led to his death. The prize for valour was a physical symbol showing that Trebonius should be respected and heralded for his incorruptibility and his determination. That Marius \\"took it and with his own hands placed it on Trebonius's head\\" shows his desire to be associated with such qualities. Implications The news of the outcome of the trial spread quickly, and helped Marius gain popularity and helped him achieve his third consulship of Rome. For some, the results of the trial showed that Marius was a man who would reward noble deeds and was against immorality. The trial showed that Marius would not show favouritism towards even members of his own family if he believed them to be in the wrong. The trial was shown by several Roman authors to be an example of justice and that Trebonius should be held up as a moral example, influencing other Romans to take up his example and perform noble deeds. Although Trebonius was not of the nobility, as he was just a common soldier in an uncommon situation, it illustrated the ideal that all Roman citizens were expected to behave in a noble manner. The trial is cited by Cicero in his defence of Milo for the killing of Clodius. Cicero uses it as an example in Roman history of a situation when it is acceptable to use violence, arguing that it is a time ‚Äúwhen violence is offered, and can only be repelled by violence‚Äù.Cicero, Marcus Tullius. Speech in Defense of Titus Annius Milo. Yonge. pp. 9. The decision also says something about the thoughts on men soliciting others for sexual favours. Valerius Maximus gives the main cause of Gaius Lusius‚Äôs death not because he attempted to use his power over the common soldier for his own personal gain, but because ‚Äúthe reason was that Lusius had dared to approach Plotius (Trebonius) for sexual favours.‚ÄùMaximus, Valerius.

The percentages are the proportions of the resident population served by public water supplies who are receiving fluoridated water. As with some other countries, water fluoridation in the United States is a contentious issue. As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation. On January 25, 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the United States to fluoridate its drinking water to prevent tooth decay. Fluoridation became an official policy of the U.S. Public Health Service by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50 million people. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population. Near the end of 2012, 67.1% of the U.S. population were getting water from community water systems (CWS) supplying water that had fluoride at or above recommended levels. Those included the 3.5% of the population that were on CWS with naturally occurring fluoride at or above recommended levels. 74.6% of those on CWS were receiving water with fluoride at or above recommended levels. U.S. regulations for bottled water do not require disclosing fluoride content. A survey of bottled water in Cleveland and in Iowa, published in 2000, found that most had fluoride levels well below the 1 mg/L level common in tap waters.  History  1909 photograph by Frederick McKay of Greene Vardiman Black (left) and Isaac Burton and F.Y. Wilson, studying the Colorado Brown Stain. Community water fluoridation in the United States is partly due to the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as \\"Colorado Brown Stain.\\"History of Dentistry in the Pikes Peak Region, Colorado Springs Dental Society webpage, page accessed February 25, 2006. The condition, now known as dental fluorosis, when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth. Of 2,945 children examined in 1909 by Dr. McKay, 87.5% had some degree of stain or mottling. All the affected children were from the Pikes Peak region. Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children. McKay brought this to the attention of Greene Vardiman Black, and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession. Initial hypotheses for the staining included poor nutrition, overconsumption of pork or milk, radium exposure, childhood diseases, or a calcium deficiency in the local drinking water. In 1931, researchers from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) concluded that the cause of the Colorado stain was a high concentration of fluoride ions in the region's drinking water (ranging from 2 to 13.7 mg/L) and areas with lower concentrations had no staining (1 mg/L or less).Meiers, Peter: \\"The Bauxite Story ‚Äì A look at ALCOA\\", from the Fluoride History website, page accessed May 12, 2006. Pikes Peak's rock formations contained the mineral cryolite, one of whose constituents is fluorine. As the rain and snow fell, the resulting runoff water dissolved fluoride which made its way into the water supply. Dental and aluminum researchers then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of fluoride to be added to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent tooth decay. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride. In April 2015, fluoride levels in the United States were lowered for the first time in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, because too much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999‚Äì2004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental fluorosis, and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms. = Early studies = H. Trendley Dean set out in 1931 to study fluoride's harm, but by 1950 had demonstrated the benefits of small amounts. Contains H. Trendley Dean, D.D.S. Reprinted in: A study of varying amounts of fluoride in water was led by Dr. H. Trendley Dean, a dental officer of the U.S. Public Health Service.Dean, H.T. \\"Classification of mottled enamel diagnosis.\\" Journal of the American Dental Association, 21, 1421 ‚Äì 1426, 1934.Dean, H.T. \\"Chronic endemic dental fluorosis.\\" Journal of the American Dental Association, 16, 1269 ‚Äì 1273, 1936. In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from Amarillo, which had 2.8 ‚Äì 3.9 mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride Wichita Falls. The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published. Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1 mg per day, per adult. Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to correlate with the concentration of 1 mg/L. In 1937, dentists Henry Klein and Carroll E. Palmer had considered the possibility of fluoridation to prevent cavities after their evaluation of data gathered by a Public Health Service team at dental examinations of Native American children.Klein H., Palmer C.E.: \\"Dental caries in American Indian children\\", Public Health Bulletin, No. 239, Dec. 1937 In a series of papers published afterwards (1937‚Äì1941), yet disregarded by his colleagues within the U.S.P.H.S., Klein summarized his findings on tooth development in children and related problems in epidemiological investigations on caries prevalence. In 1939, Dr. Gerald J. CoxMeiers, Peter: \\"Gerald Judy Cox\\". conducted laboratory tests using rats that were fed aluminum and fluoride. Dr. Cox suggested adding fluoride to drinking water (or other media such as milk or bottled water) in order to improve oral health. In the mid-1940s, four widely cited studies were conducted. The researchers investigated cities that had both fluoridated and unfluoridated water. The first pair was Muskegon, Michigan and Grand Rapids, Michigan, making Grand Rapids the first community in the world to add fluoride to its drinking water to try to benefit dental health on January 25, 1945.After 60 Years of Success, Water Fluoridation Still Lacking in Many Communities. Medical News Today website, accessed February 26, 2006. Kingston, New York was paired with Newburgh, New York. Oak Park, Illinois was paired with Evanston, Illinois. Sarnia, Ontario was paired with Brantford, Ontario, Canada. In 1952 Nebraska Representative A.L. Miller complained that there had been no studies carried out to assess the potential adverse health risk to senior citizens, pregnant women, or people with chronic diseases from exposure to the fluoridation. A decrease in the incidence of tooth decay was found in some of the cities which had added fluoride to water supplies. The early comparison studies would later be criticized as, \\"primitive,\\" with a, \\"virtual absence of quantitative, statistical methods...nonrandom method of selecting data and...high sensitivity of the results to the way in which the study populations were grouped...\\" in the journal Nature.Diesendorf, Mark, \\"The mystery of declining tooth decay\\" Nature, July 10, 1986  Water fluoridation  As of May 2000, 42 of the 50 largest U.S. cities had water fluoridation.The Benefits of Fluoride, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, accessed March 19, 2006. According to a 2002 study,Fluoridation Status: Percentage of U.S. Population on Public Water Supply Systems Receiving Fluoridated Water, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, accessed March 19, 2006. 67% of U.S. residents were living in communities with fluoridated water at that time. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has identified community water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. The CDC recommends water fluoridation at a level of 0.7‚Äì1.2 mg/L, depending on climate. The CDC also advises parents to monitor use of fluoride toothpaste, and use of water with fluoride concentrations above 2 mg/L, in children up to age 8. There is a CDC database for researching the water fluoridation status of neighborhood water. In 1998, 70% of people polled in a survey conducted by the American Dental Association (ADA) believed community water should be fluoridated, with 18% disagreeing and the rest undecided.American Dental Association Survey Center. 1998 consumers' opinions regarding community water fluoridation. Chicago, Illinois: American Dental Association, 1998 In November 2006, the ADA began recommending to parents that infants from 0 through 12 months of age should have their formula prepared with water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis.What is the ADA‚Äôs interim guidance on infant formula and fluoride? American Dental Association Website accessed May 28, 2008 The issue of whether or not to fluoridate water supplies frequently arises in local governments. For example, on November 8, 2005, citizens of Mt. Pleasant, Michigan voted 63% to 37% in favor of reinstating fluoridation in public drinking water after a 2004 ballot initiative ceased water fluoridation in the city.Crozier, Stacie. \\"Michigan town votes to return fluoridation\\" November 30, 2005. At the same time, voters in Xenia, Ohio; Springfield, Ohio; Bellingham, Washington; and Tooele City, Utah all rejected water fluoridation. In Skagit County in the state of Washington, the county commissioners in 2007 voted 2 to 1 to order the local public utility district to begin fluoridating the public water supply by Jan. 2009. $1.2 million was to be provided by the privately funded Washington Dental Service Foundation to begin building the equipment needed to add fluoride to the Judy Reservoir, which supplies the majority of Skagit Valley's water customers. The source and type of fluoride to be added to the drinking water of more than 70,000 citizens had not been disclosed. However, in February 2009, Skagit County commissioners rescinded the 2007 order, citing costs and possible lawsuits. The cost of adding fluoridation to the water of 44 Florida communities has been researched by the State Health Office in Tallahassee. In communities with a population of over 50,000 people, fluoridation costs were estimated at 31 cents per person per year. The estimated cost rises to $2.12 per person in areas with a population below 10,000. Unintended consequences, such as equipment malfunction, can substantially raise the financial burden, as well as the health risks, to the consumer.CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, July 31, 1993, Fluoride Blamed in 3 Deaths: Traces found in Blood of U. of C. Dialysis Patients Gary WiebyEVENING CAPITAL (Annapolis, Maryland), November 29, 1979, Fluoride Linked to Death, Mary Ann Kryzankowicz In the U.S., Hispanic and Latino Americans are significantly more likely to consume bottled instead of tap water, and the use of bottled and filtered water grew dramatically in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Decisions about water fluoridation  Many political and popular entities and activities determine whether fluoride is added to water supplies. Those include courts, local governments, popular referenda, and water authorities. = Court cases = Fluoridation has been the subject of many court cases wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and due process are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation. Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation. To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.  Early cases  A flurry of cases were heard in numerous state courts across the U.S. in the 1950s during the early years of water fluoridation. State courts consistently held in favor of allowing fluoridation to continue, analogizing fluoridation to mandatory vaccination and the use of other chemicals to clean the public water supply, both of which had a long- standing history of acceptance by courts. In 1952, a federal regulation was adopted that stated in part, \\"The Federal Security Agency will regard water supplies containing fluorine, within the limitations recommended by the Public Health Service, as not actionable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\\"17 Fed. Reg. 6743 (July 23, 1952). The Supreme Court of Oklahoma analogized water fluoridation to mandatory vaccination in a 1954 case.273 P.2d 859, 862‚Äì63 (Okl. 1954) (available at FindLaw for Legal Professionals) The court noted, \\"we think the weight of well-reasoned modern precedent sustains the right of municipalities to adopt such reasonable and undiscriminating measures to improve their water supplies as are necessary to protect and improve the public health, even though no epidemic is imminent and no contagious disease or virus is directly involved .... To us it seems ridiculous and of no consequence in considering the public health phase of the case that the substance to be added to the water may be classed as a mineral rather than a drug, antiseptic or germ killer; just as it is of little, if any, consequence whether fluoridation accomplishes its beneficial result to the public health by killing germs in the water, or by hardening the teeth or building up immunity in them to the bacteria that causes caries or tooth decay. If the latter, there can be no distinction on principle between it and compulsory vaccination or inoculation, which, for many years, has been well- established as a valid exercise of police power.\\" In the 1955 case Froncek v. City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the ruling of a circuit court which held that \\"the fluoridation is not the practice of medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy, by the City\\" and that \\"the legislation is a public health measure, bearing a real, substantial, and reasonable relation to the health of the city.\\"69 N.W.2d 242, 252 (Wis. 1955) The Supreme Court of Ohio, in 1955's Kraus v. City of Cleveland, said, \\"Plaintiff's argument that fluoridation constitutes mass medication, the unlawful practice of medicine and adulteration may be answered as a whole. Clearly, the addition of fluorides to the water supply does not violate such principles any more than the chlorination of water, which has been held valid many times.\\"127 N.E.2d 609, 613 (Ohio 1955)  Fluoridation consensus  In 1973, as cases continued to be brought in state courts, a consensus developed that fluoridation, at least from a legal standpoint, was acceptable.Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, 30 Cal. App. 3d 112, 115 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1973) (citations omitted). In 1973's Beck v. City Council of Beverly Hills, the California Court of Appeal, Second District, said, \\"Courts through the United States have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. The matter is no longer an open question.\\"  Contemporary challenges  Much of the contemporary debate on water fluoridation revolves around questions of how consumer demand for fluoride is determined and processed, which fluoridation costs and benefits are considered, how conflicts over its provision and production are addressed or resolved, and how the merits of relevant health policies can be equally recast in terms of their presumed demerits.Roger Lee Mendoza (2011). Fluoride-treated water and the problem of merit goods. Water Policy Journal, 13 (1): 38‚Äì52, http://www.iwaponline.com/wp/01301/wp013010038.htm.Roger Lee Mendoza (2009).

Opponents continue to make contemporary challenges to the spread of fluoridation. For instance, in 2002, the city of Watsonville, California, chose to disregard a California law mandating fluoridation of water systems with 10,000 or more hookups, and the dispute between the city and the state ended up in court. The trial court and the intermediate appellate court ruled in favor of the state and its fluoridation mandate, and the Supreme Court of California declined to hear the case in February 2006.Jones, Donna \\"Supreme Court turns down Watsonville's appeal to keep fluoride out of its water.\\" Santa Cruz Sentinel. February 10, 2006. Since 2000, courts in Washington,Parkland Light & Water Co. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Bd. of Health, 90 P.3d 37 (Wash. 2004) Maryland,Pure Water Committee of W. MD., Inc. v.

City of San Antonio, Not Reported in S.W.3d, 2003 WL 21203878 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2003) have reached similar conclusions. = Federal drinking water regulations = The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a maximum contaminant level (MCL) standard of 4.0 mg/l for fluoride, applicable to public water systems. The standard was promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The SDWA allows states to set more stringent standards, and several states have done so, including New York (state), where the fluoride MCL is 2.2 mg/l.New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY (2018). New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. Title 10, SubPart 5-1 - Public Water Supplies. \\"Public Water Systems; Maximum Contaminant Levels; Monitoring Requirements; Notification Requirements.\\" Section 5-1.52 - Tables. = State law = San Diego, California began water fluoridation in February 2011, despite its Municipal Code Section 67.0101, which prohibits the city from fluoridating. The local ordinance was preempted by California law that requires fluoridation when an outside funding source is available. In 2008, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, a state-funded child advocacy organization, provided nearly $4 million to San Diego, for fluoridation equipment and operating costs for the first two years of fluoridation. That organization is funded with tobacco taxes instituted by California Proposition 10 (1998). San Diego raises the fluoride level of its water to 0.7 mg/L, as recommended by CDC. In 2012, New Hampshire began requiring public water systems that fluoridate to post the following notice in their consumer confidence reports: \\"Your public water supply is fluoridated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if your child under the age of 6 months is exclusively consuming infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, there may be an increased chance of dental fluorosis. Consult your child's health care provider for more information.\\" The law was passed with overwhelming majorities in the legislature and took effect August 4. = Local ordinances = On September 22, 2011, The city council of College Station, Texas voted, 6‚Äì1, against fluoridating city water supplies. ending 22 years of fluoridation. In 2011 the Pinellas County, Florida commissioners voted to stop adding fluoride to the county's public drinking water. Tampa Bay Times editor Tim Nickens and columnist Daniel Ruth then published a joint series of ten editorials challenging the decision in 2012, and two of the commissioners who had voted to stop fluoridation were voted out of office and replaced with candidates who had pledged to add it back. In March 2013, after a 6‚Äì1 vote, the county resumed the addition of fluoride, which the Times characterized as being \\"long considered the most effective method to prevent tooth decay\\". Nickens and Ruth were awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for their series. The Board of County Commissioners of Hernando County, Florida voted, 4‚Äì1, on February 25, 2014 not to begin fluoridating the county's water. = Referenda = On May 21, 2013, voters in Portland, Oregon decided 61‚Äì39% not to commence fluoridation of Portland's water, which is supplied to 900,000 people. It was the fourth defeat of fluoridation proposals in Portland, the first being in 1956. On September 12, 2012, the Portland City Council unanimously passed Ordinance No. 185612, authorizing and directing the Portland Water Bureau to begin fluoridating. Those opposing the ordinance immediately began a petition process to hold a referendum that could reverse the ordinance. In October, it was revealed that four city council members had had undisclosed meetings with pro-fluoridation lobbyists. Public calendars of those four did not mention the meetings, except that one meeting was mentioned with a vague title. This was in violation of a city ordinance requiring the disclosure of such meetings. Over 33,000 signatures were gathered for the petition, which led to the referendum that defeated fluoridation. In the campaign, the pro-fluoridation side out-raised opponents $850,000 to $270,000.

The group is stationed at Carswell Field, Texas. During World War II, the group's predecessor unit, the 301st Bombardment Group was a highly decorated group flying B-17 Flying Fortresses that served primarily in North Africa and Italy. It operated as part of Eighth, Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces. In the postwar era, the 301st Bombardment Group was one of the first USAAF units assigned to the Strategic Air Command on 4 August 1946, prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force. The group was activated as a redesignation of the 467th Bombardment Group due to the Air Force's policy of retaining only low-numbered groups on active duty after the war. The group was inactivated in 1952 when the parent wing adopted the Tri-Deputate organization and assigned all of the group's squadrons directly to the wing. Reactivated as the 301st Operations Group in 1991 when the 301st Air Refueling Wing adopted the USAF Objective organization plan. Overview The 301st Operations Group (Tail Code: TX) is equipped with the F-16C+ Fighting Falcon. It commands the operational fighter squadrons of the 301st Fighter Wing. The group has a rich tradition of leadership in the reserve component of the Air Force dating back to the mid-1940s and continues to make history. Components The group consists of the following squadrons: * 457th Fighter Squadron * 301st Operations Support Flight History : Note: The 301st Operations Group does not share a common history or heritage with its parent unit, the 301st Fighter Wing, being assigned to the 301st FW on 1 August 1992.

Began combat in September 1942, attacking submarine pens, airfields, railroads, bridges, and other targets on the Continent, primarily in France. Reassigned to Twelfth Air Force and moved to North Africa in November 1942. Bombed docks, shipping facilities, airdromes, and railroad yards in Tunisia, Sicily, and Sardinia. Attacked enemy shipping between Tunisia and Sicily. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for action on 6 April 1943 when the group withstood intense antiaircraft fire from shore defenses and nearby vessels to attack a convoy of merchant ships off Bizerte and thus destroy supplies essential to the Axis defense of Tunisia. Assaulted gun positions on Pantelleria during May‚ÄìJune 1943. Flew numerous missions to Italy, July‚ÄìOctober 1943. Assigned to Fifteenth Air Force in November 1943, moved to Italy in December, and afterward directed most of its attacks against European theatre of World War II strategic targets such as oil centers, communications, and industrial areas.

In international politics, food power is the use of agriculture as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC‚Äôs earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food. Food power is an integral part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people. Historical background There are four nations in the world that export enough agriculture to exert this hypothetical food power: the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Forced to rely on these nations in times of shortage, food-importing countries may face food crises if needed supplies are withheld. But while political leaders in food-importing countries have expressed misgivings over their dependence, food-exporting nations generally do not withhold food, as agricultural producers in these nations press their governments to continue to export.Robert Paarlberg, Food Politics, The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, 2008 Policy Food imports in 2005 Food politics are the political aspects of the production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food. The politics can be affected by the ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. Food power is an integral part of the politics of food. ‚ÄúFood is a weapon‚Äù, stated Earl Butz, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, in 1974. OPEC's use of oil as a political weapon brought on the possibility for America to use food as a tool against other states and to further the US's goals. There are alternative uses of food power as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This would have the same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence). =Food power and food security= Food security and food power are not the same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power. =Food power and embargoes= Fidel Castro at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly An embargo is not the same as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo.Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 24 In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of restricted items often fail.Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 26 For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.Robert A. Doughty and Harold E. Raugh, Embargoes in Historical Perspective, Parameters, 1991, pg. 27 In the early 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This was an attempt by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus imported grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 upon Iraq. Another example of an embargo is the United States embargo against Cuba. This is still an ongoing embargo, and, due to the declining situation and health of Cuba's people, the embargo has been subject to much protest.R√©my Herrera, The Effects of the U.S. Embargo Against Cuba, Alternatives, 2003 Employment=Structural conditions= Food power can only be used effectively if certain structural conditions apply: # Scarcity: If demand is high and supply is limited the value of a given commodity increases. The price often reflects the potential of the goods as a weapon; as it indicates the importance attached to it. Example: If a consumer is prepared to pay a high price for monetary terms he may also be willing to pay a high price in political concessions. # Supply Concentration: Supply should only be in the hands of few producers/ sellers, as this makes possible for limited competition, price fixes, or potentially a monopoly. # Demand Dispersion: Allows sellers to play the consumers against each other as well as increase prices or make terms conditional. This favors the use of economic goods food as a weapon. # Action Independence: In order to ensure affectivity the seller/producer most control his own assets. Either the seller/producer must be able to control the production process, perhaps through governmental control over companies carrying out the production), or he must have access to means on the other dimensions to ensure that he can maintain or extend control over his assets. The four conditions listed above MUST be simultaneously present in order to turn an economic asset food into a political instrument. This does not necessarily mean that the asset will be used whenever the four conditions above are present. Such a decision would be considered only if there were further conditions, for example, the nature of a given conflict and judgment, goals, alternative means, and judgment of utility. =Employment as an economic weapon= There are several uses for employing economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on the conditions of a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. Although this is an example of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. A political use would be one concerning the buyer‚Äôs foreign and defense policies. Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third  the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government. =United States= Barley is a major animal feed crop. During the time the United States was the most dominant in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. Food Power was not really thought about. However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food has come to the surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. While other nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, there is a possibility that the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes. The United States could use this Food power as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. Food power will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate. The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries. One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti- communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies. The U.S. has modified its stance since the 1970s, when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring the potential of food embargoes. Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya, Sudan, and North Korea (agricultural trade with Cuba remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard. =Africa= Food politics in Africa differs from the cases in North America and Europe in that there is a case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa‚Äôs numerous food insecurity issues. Sudan Satellite image of Sudan Famine is shaped by generally two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This is the result of a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population‚Äôs ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine. For example, Sudan‚Äôs famine in the 1980s was completely intentional, and was only a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren‚Äôt the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored the needs of the people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country. The famine in Sudan in 1998 was a humanitarian disaster caused mainly by human rights abuses, as well as drought and the failure of the international community to react to the famine risk with adequate speed.Famine In Sudan, 1998 Human Rights Watch, Accessed May 25, 2006 The worst affected area was Bahr El Ghazal in southwestern Sudan. In this region over 70,000 people died during the famine.

The Last Song is Sparks's fourteenth published novel (fifteenth published book), and was written specifically as the basis for the film adaptation by the same name. It was released on September 1, 2009 by Grand Central Publishing. The story revolves around the summer of Ronnie (Veronica) Miller's seventeenth year, during which she is sent to stay with her estranged father. Through their shared love of music, the duo reconnect. Plot 17-year-old Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Miller is a troubled teenager who wants to live her own life and is trying her very best to ignore her divorced parents: Kim, her mother with whom she lives in New York, and Steve, her father who lives in his hometown of Wrightsville Beach, NC. Her mother decides that it would be in everyone's best interest if Ronnie and her 10-year-old brother, Jonah, spent the summer in Wrightsville Beach with Steve. Jonah is excited, while Ronnie can only wonder why her parents hate her so much as to send her there for the summer. Once they arrive, Kim leaves and Ronnie runs off to the carnival down at the beach, where she watches a volleyball game in the crowd. As she turns to leave, one of the players, the privileged Will Blakelee, knocks into her while trying to reach the ball, spilling her soda all through the front of her shirt. In search of a stand selling apparel, Ronnie bumps into Blaze, an estranged teenager like herself, Blaze helps her find a T-shirt booth and they leave to watch a show by Marcus, Blaze's boyfriend, on the pier. The show includes \\"harmless\\" fireballs, and when it's over, the police runs Marcus off. They go to sit under the pier, where Blaze heads off to get Marcus another beer. In Blaze's absence, Marcus attempts to hit on Ronnie, causing her to leave. Later, when Ronnie finds a nest of Loggerhead turtle eggs in danger of racoons behind her house, she decides to camp out next to it to save it. She learns that Will volunteers at the aquarium, and after a few nights of talking with him on the beach, she realizes she has feelings for him. Ronnie then finds out that her dad has cancer. As his cancer progresses, she, Jonah, and Will finish the window while Ronnie also finishes her dad's song for him on the piano. Pastor Harris, Steve's friend, then installs the window in the new church. Kim arrives to say goodbye to Steve one last time and take Jonah home. Ronnie stays with Steve. Will had left in August to go to Vanderbilt; however, he shows up at the funeral once Steve has passed. He leaves again for school and Ronnie returns to New York. While at Juilliard, auditioning for a spot, Will shows up to surprise her; he reveals that he's decided to go to Columbia to be closer to her. Release A book tour for The Last Song was announced on July 11, 2009 and reached around 13 cities. Despite the relatively short tour, The Last Song debuted at number one on weekly bestseller charts. It headed the Publishers Weekly and New York Times charts for hardback fiction and the Wall Street Journal chart for fiction. According to USA Today's chart, which combines sales of all formats of a book, The Last Song outsold all other titles in its first week. The book dropped to number 2 on all lists the following week, due to the release of Dan Brown's highly anticipated The Lost Symbol, the sequel to The Da Vinci Code. Film adaptation The film version of The Last Song was released in the U.S. on March 31, 2010, Unlike previous adaptations of Sparks's novels, Sparks participated in writing the film's screenplay; after agreeing to the project, Sparks invited his college roommate Jeff Van Wie to co-write the script. With Van Wie's help, Sparks finished the screenplay before he began writing the novel. The Last Song is director Julie Anne Robinson's first feature film. The film stars Miley Cyrus as Ronnie, along with Greg Kinnear as Steve, Liam Hemsworth as Will Blakelee, Kelly Preston as Kim, and Bobby Coleman as Jonah.

Perpignan railway station, which Dal√≠ proclaimed to be the \\"center of the Universe\\" after a cosmogonic ecstasy experience The railway station of the French city of Perpignan, near the border with Spain, held special significance for Dal√≠, who had proclaimed it to be the \\"Center of the Universe\\" after experiencing a vision of cosmogonic ecstasy there in 1963.  Description  The sacrifice of the son is imaged in the form of Christ on the Cross, with his crown of thorns, floating in the center of the composition. The bleeding wound of Christ is associated with the farmer's fork (on the right) thrust into the ground (as a fertility ritual). Dal√≠ is represented twice in the vertical axis: he appears in the light at the center of the image, seen from below, floating with arms spread, and again at the top of the painting. On the bottom of the painting lies a calm sea with a boat, an ancient symbol of the passage from life to death, reinforcing the theme of Christ's sacrifice. Above the sea, a woman seen from the back watches these scenes, immobile, and recalling the helplessness of man facing death, symbolized not only by the bloody wounds of Christ, but also by Dal√≠, who, spread-eagled, seems to fall into nothingness. At the top center of the painting, a flat wagon carrying a specialized trailer comes out of nowhere (characteristic of Surrealism), and reminds one of the central themes of the painting, the railway station of Perpignan in France, near the Spanish border in the Pyrenees. The left side of the painting shows embodiment of positive values (the couple on the bags of wheat represent labor, and the man in a meditative pose embodies respect), while on the right of the image are embodied sins and suffering (the man and woman representing lust, and the woman mourning). The two figures flanking the far left and right sides are taken from The Angelus, a well-known pious painting by the French artist Jean- Fran√ßois Millet.

Coleridge's, the original, was written in December 1794 and published in the 16 December 1794 Morning Chronicle as the fifth of his Sonnets on Eminent Characters series. Hunt and Keats were inspired to follow his poem with their own versions (under the same title) in November 1815 and December 1816, respectively. The sonnets were dedicated to heroism of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, leader of the 1794 Polish rebellion against Prussian and Russian control. Background Towards the end of 1794, Coleridge began writing a series of sonnets called Sonnets on Eminent Characters. The first sonnet, \\"To Erskine\\", was printed on 1 December in the Morning Chronicle, and 10 more sonnets followed. Coleridge's sonnet \\"To Kosciusko\\" was the fifth in the series, printed on 16 December. The poem was revised twice, first for a 1796 collection and then for an 1828 collection of Coleridge's poems. It remained in that final form for the two collections that followed, in 1829 and 1834.Mays 2001 pp. 155, 159 Kosciusko was a Polish national who led Poland in rebellion against two countries, Prussia and Russia, during the spring of 1794. When the rebellion was crushed by that October, he was captured by Russian forces and held as a prisoner. Coleridge knew few details about the specifics, and altered his poem when he found out that Kosciusko was merely wounded and captured instead of being killed.Mays 2001 p. 159 The British Romantic poets favoring of Kosciusko as a hero can be traced to Coleridge, and Leigh Hunt published his own sonnet on Kosciusko in the 19 November 1815 Examiner. Following this, Keats wrote his version of the sonnet in December 1816 and published it in the 16 February 1817 examiner.Roe 1997 p. 108 Poem The 1796 edition of the poem reads:Mays 2001 p. 160 Coleridge's uncertainty of Kosciusko's state after the defeat of the Polish rebellion is shown in the original 3rd and 4th line: For the 1828 edition and later printings of the poem, the final lines read: =Hunt= Hunt, like Coleridge, saw Kosciusko as a hero, and Hunt admired Kosciusko for his character during the Polish rebellion and, as the subtitle suggests, his having \\"never fought either for Buonaparte or the allies\\".Davies and Liu 2009 pp. 213‚Äì214 Hunt's version reads: =Keats= Following Coleridge's poem, Keats wrote his own sonnet called \\"To Kosciusko\\". Keats's version reads:Feldman and Robinson 2002 p. 156, 245 Themes Kosciusko was a hero to Coleridge as a patriot, even though Kosciusko was Polish and many of Coleridge's political heroes were British.Ashton 1997 p. 61 Hunt and Keats viewed Kosciusko as a political ideal that was connected to King Alfred, a figure that was believed to have established English constitutional liberty. The praise within the poem is similar to how Coleridge praised Fayette; he believed that both were political prisoners that were martyred for their beliefs. Coleridge discussed Kosciusko and the issues surrounding Poland in many of his works, including during a lecture series that Coleridge gave in 1795 and articles within Coleridge's newspaper, Watchman. The first four lines of Coleridge's poem are related in style to Thomas Campbell's The Pleasures of Hope, with the line \\"And Freedom shriek'd when Koskiusko fell\\" in particular. However, Campbell did not come up with the phrasing on his own. Instead, he based his phrasing on an ode by John Dennis with a line that reads, \\"Fair Liberty shriek'd out aloud, aloud Religion groan'd\\".Mays 2001 pp. 159‚Äì160 NotesReferences * Ashton, Rosemary.

He played a large role in building up and paving the way for the expansion of the school. Biography Sorensen was born in Draper, Utah, and was raised in Draper and Deseret, Utah. He graduated from Jordan High School in Sandy, Utah. As a young man and member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he served as a missionary in the California Mission. Later in life he would continue activity in the LDS Church, serving as a bishop and in a stake presidency. He married Helen Howard in 1942 in the Salt Lake Temple. They had four children and raised their family in Provo, Utah. Helen died in 2000 and their daughter Kathy died in 2001. Sorensen graduated from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, with a bachelor's degree in industrial arts and a master's in educational administration. =Career= After graduation, Sorensen taught industrial arts at Granite High School in South Salt Lake, Utah. He was hired by the Central Utah Vocational School to purchase supplies to train workers in arms and ammunition manufacturing during World War II. Although he had an educational background, Sorensen was a carpenter by trade, which made him attractive to head the growing trade school as it became a state-funded institution. When Sorensen started at the institution, it had under 1,000 students. By the time he left, there were over 5,500 students and it had moved campuses twice, arriving at its current location in Orem, Utah, under the name Utah Technical College. Sorensen was succeeded as president of the school by J. Marvin Higbee in 1982. In his long retirement, Sorensen saw the school grow into Utah Valley Community College, then Utah Valley State College (UVSC), then Utah Valley University. =Retirement= Sorensen remained active during retirement. He was on the Committee to Save Geneva Steel in the 1980s, and he ran for a seat in the Utah State Legislature in 1984. He published a history of Utah Technical College in 1985. He also served on the board of the Orem Community Hospital and served as chairman of Provo's Freedom Festival. Sorensen has been named Citizen of the Year by the Kiwanis Club of Provo and received the Modern Day Pioneer award from the Sons of Utah Pioneers. Late in life, he moved to South Jordan, Utah. He died of natural causes shortly before his 93rd birthday. Relationship to UVU UVU leadership recognizes Sorensen for building up the school and paving the way for its future expansion. The student activities center at UVU is named for Sorensen, as well as the school's benefactor's society and Lifetime Achievement Award. At UVSC's first alumni recognition banquet in 1998, Sorensen became the award's inaugural recipient. Observing the academic transformation of the college into a university, Sorensen openly pushed for it to retain its focus on vocational training. He opposed the closing of the school's machine tools, heavy equipment, and welding programs, saying, \\"Eventually, the liberal arts will take over.\\" He believed the \\"best education\\" was \\"to first get job preparation\\" and \\"[learn] how to make a living\\", followed by \\"classes that will enrich you.\\" He argued that the need for academic research was satisfied by existing universities in Utah, which had \\"enough universities already\\". He felt UVSC's new university status \\"will give the school a social image. That's all it will do.\\" Sorensen had hoped for the school to develop into something more like the Dunwoody College of Technology or the Rochester Institute of Technology. The school's representatives responded that modern students needed academic degrees and that vocational programs had either closed due to poor enrollment or had evolved with industry. It also stated that the need for local vocational training was filled by the Utah College of Applied Technology. Other former UVSC presidents also disagreed with Sorensen and welcomed university status. Publications * NotesExternal links *Wilson W.

He is Jin Kisaragi's biological brother, whose rivalry with him stems from an incident that happened when their sister Saya was presumably killed. His right arm is mechanical because his real one was cut off by Terumi, who had taken control of Jin's mind. He was resurrected by Rachel as a dhampir, causing one of his green eyes to turn red and his once-blond hair to white. The BlazBlue he possesses is only a fragment of an imitation; the true Grimoire is actually destined to be wielded by Noel Vermillion. In Continuum Shift, Ragna is given the Idea Engine by a dying Lambda which enabled him to access the true Azure. He realizes that Saya is possessed by Izanami and decides to give up vengeance to protect his loved ones in Chrono Phantasma, and later in Central Fiction decides to protect the girl inside Amaterasu from the Entitled-people whose dreams are strong enough to remake the world. He and Jin (including his future-past counterpart Hakumen) soon learned that Noel/Mu can be used to recreate Saya, whose soul remains in her old body, possessed by Izanami. Once Noel and Mu merge, he helps Noel merge with Izanami and imprison her into her soul, recreating Saya. With the help of Jin and Trinity after Ragna separates the Susano'o armor from Terumi, Jin transports Ragna and Terumi to the Azure void where Ragna can kill him for good. Once all evils are finished, and after helping Noel merge with the Origin to free her from the Amaterasu Unit, Ragna's last act is to cast himself into the cauldron and remain outside the world, to make sure the Azure never falls into the wrong hands. As this act would erase himself from the memories of everybody in the story, he says goodbye to his beloved siblings and tells Amane that he has no regrets at all. Ragna disappears and leaves only his sword behind, which is later put to the hill where it is placed on a hill near Celica's church as a makeshift grave. Whether or not Ragna is truly unable to return to the world is unknown, as the final scene shows that his sword has been taken by somebody. He is also hinted not to be a natural-born human due to his unusual features, an idea that is confirmed in the final game when it is revealed he is the child of the fifth Prime Field Device. Ragna's weapon is called Blood- Scythe („Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„Éâ„Çµ„Ç§„Ç∫ Buraddo Saizu), a giant sword that can extend into a scythe. His Drive, Soul Eater, enables him to absorb a portion of the damage dealt to replenish his health. =Jin Kisaragi= :Voiced by (English): David Vincent Voiced by (Japanese): Tetsuya Kakihara is a former Major in the NOL and one of its elite commanding officers as well as the rival to Ragna. He is always cool and calm, but is also jealous, ambitious, and possessive with little care for others, treating them like they are mere obstacles. He displayed formidable actions to gain his rank during the Ikaruga Civil War. When he heard that Ragna the Bloodedge had arrived on the scene, he quickly abandoned his post to hunt him down by himself. The truth, however, is that Ragna is Jin's biological brother, and Jin's early feelings of rivalry were furthered by his visions of the future and his Nox Nyctores' amplification of his emotions. Terumi corrupted Jin's mind and incited him to hack off Ragna's arm (the latter nearly dying without the intervention of Rachel) and supposedly kills Saya, and Jin often says that he is looking forward to killing Ragna again. After the incident, he was adopted into the Kisaragi house, a highly powerful and respected family within the NOL. He possesses a notable psychosis, said to be caused by his sword, the Nox Nyctores . While the sword grants him manipulation over ice, it also enhances primal feelings and is often blamed for \\"insanity\\". It is also revealed that Hakumen is another incarnation of Jin from a different time cycle. Jin's Drive, Frost Bite, allows him to freeze his opponents. During Chrono Phantasma he begins to resist the effects of his weapon, and by Central Fiction he no longer acts insane towards Ragna. In the end of Central Fiction, once Ragna separates the Susano'o armor from Terumi, Jin is able to don the armor with the help of Trinity and kill Terumi's physical form before transporting his brother and Terumi to an Azure void where his brother can kill Terumi for good. When Ragna enacts his final act to take the Master Unit away with the world along with him, Jin initially objects his plan, until he and Noel have no choice to let their older brother go. After bidding Ragna farewell, Jin loses all memories of his brother. It is shown at the end of the game that he has been promoted to a higher rank, though according to developer interviews he can no longer fight due to his deal with Trinity having used up all of his energy. =Noel Vermillion= :Voiced by (English): Cristina Vee Voiced by (Japanese): Kanako Kond≈ç is the main heroine of the series, who was found as a young girl amidst the burning fields of Ikaruga where she was rescued, and then adopted by the noble Vermillion family. After her family was accused of treason, she enrolled in the Military Academy in an effort to save her family's name. It was because of her outstanding combat activity that she became a lieutenant of the NOL using the Nox Nyctores revolver , which apparently does not fire actual bullets but rather inflicts damage by creating distortions in dimensional space. At the start of the series, she was Jin's secretary. In truth, Noel suffers from amnesia, and is actually Mu-12, a Murakumo Unit created by Relius Clover, the predecessor of Nu-13 and the final boss in the console version of Continuum Shift. After being rescued by Ragna, Noel seeks out Rachel in Chrono Phantasma, who helps her learn to control her powers as Mu. In Central Fiction however, Noel separates from Mu to protect the gate to the Azure, and it is revealed that she is the Master Unit's link to the world, due to being based on the Origin itself. Once Noel merges with Mu once again, she is able to merge with Izanami and imprison her within her soul with help from Ragna, recreating Saya, though she prefers to still use 'Noel' as her name, so as to prevent Izanami's mind from taking full control over her just recreated body. At the end of the final game, Noel is able to merge with \\"The Origin\\" within the Master Unit, having no choice but to allow Ragna to take the Unit outside of the world so that time will not loop nor will the world be destroyed any further, despite her and Jin's previous objections. At the end of the series, Noel rebuilds Celica's church and presides as a nun there, along with Lambda, with Izanami still imprisoned inside her soul. When offered a chance to rejoin the newly reformed NOL, she is unable to rejoin her friends due to having her hands full on her new current job, and is shown to be caring for a catatonic Nu-13. She does, however, offer to let her friends know the very instant Izanami (if possible) frees herself from Noel's soul to plague the Earth with eternal death once again. With her Drive, Chain Revolver, Noel does different attacks in an active stance. Jonathan Oyama at VentureBeat gave Noel positive reception, where he described her as being \\"extremely effective as a fighter,\\" and stated \\"Oddly enough, she's one of the few game characters who I can truly sympathize with. Just like Noel, I often have a tough time remembering my own past.\\" =Rachel Alucard= :Voiced by (English): Mela Lee Voiced by (Japanese): Kana Ueda is a vampire and the current head of the noble Alucard family. Despite her small appearance, she is a formidable opponent in battle, using her servants, Nago and Gii, as weapons, and her Drive, Silpheed, to control the wind. Rachel also possesses one of the three Sankishin, the , which is a giant shield that she describes as the \\"ultimate defense\\". Rachel slipped out of her castle in search of fun because she hates to be bored, though in truth she is an 'Observer' tasked with watching over the actions of the main characters. Due to her hairstyle, several characters nickname her \\"Rabbit\\", a name that irritates her to no end, though Ragna seems to be the only one who can get away with calling her an idiot. Despite her status, however, she deeply loathes her vampiric impulses. She seems to be watching Ragna, as she is the one who accidentally turned him into a half-vampire by giving him her powers (this is also the reason behind his heterochromia and healing ability). Due to this, he is one of the only characters who is aware of her. Though Rachel often insults Ragna and treats him poorly, it is simply a ruse to hide the feelings she has developed for him. She also watches and toys with the other characters of the game as part of her amusement. At the end of Chrono Phantasma, she asks Tsubaki to kill her if she, Jin or Noel fails to kill Ragna. In Central Fiction it is shown that Rachel is losing her powers due to constant interference and she is shown to have reacted to Naoto due to his similarities to Ragna, making her lose her composure. In the ending, Rachel loses her memories of Ragna due to his sacrifice, but recalls having fond memories of someone whose name she does not know. It is implied that she will try to find Ragna once more, aided by a Tsubaki from an alternate timeline. =Taokaka= :Voiced by: Chiwa Sait≈ç , or Tao for short, is a catgirl who is a member of the Kaka tribe, wearing a large coat that obscures her true face, only exposing beady red eyes and a row of teeth (whether or not this is her true face is a mystery). She wants to get back the sky above her village, which was sealed off by humans building cities above her village, was recently sent by the Elder to retrieve the bounty on Ragna's head, becoming a vigilante in the process. Despite this resolve, she is considerably food-obsessed and forgetful, often falling asleep on a whim, becoming hungry moments after a meal, or forgetting details moments after hearing them. She is good friends with Litchi, affectionately referring to her as \\"boobie lady\\". However, she does not seem to refer to anyone other than herself by name; she calls Ragna \\"good guy\\" (because he buys her food), Bang \\"scruffy man\\", Arakune \\"black squiggly\\", Noel \\"lacking lady\\", Hakumen \\"mask man\\", Nu \\"flappy-flap\\", and Jubei \\"cat person\\". She is unable to recognize that Ragna the \\"good-guy\\" and \\"Rawrgna\\" the criminal are the same person. It is revealed the Kaka tribe, which she hails from, is actually genetically- engineered from the genes of Jubei, one of the Six Heroes. With her Drive, Dancing Edge, Taokaka launches at her opponents in a torpedo-like fashion. =Iron Tager= :Voiced by (English): Jamieson Price :Voiced by (Japanese): Kenji Nomura Originally the leader of an Ikaruga unit, suffered a mortal wound during the Ikaruga Civil War and was forced to withdraw. He was revived as , an enormous cyborg, by Kokonoe whom he pledged loyalty to afterward. After his revival, he bears a similar resemblance to a demon, which resulted in him dubbed as the \\"Red Devil of Sector Seven\\". He was originally Bullet's captain before his near death at the hands of Azrael. In the end of Central Fiction, Tager and Bullet are now partners once again. Tager uses his Drive, Voltic Battler, to magnetize his opponents for a short period of time. =Litchi Faye-Ling= :Voiced by (English): Lauren Landa Voiced by (Japanese): Chiaki Takahashi is a renowned doctor living in Orient Town, located in Kagutsuchi. She owns a clinic there and is helped by her assistant Linhua. She had worked with Tager and Kokonoe in Sector Seven until the incident where Lotte \\"Roy\\" Carmine, one of her colleagues whom she had feelings for, became Arakune. She defends the local townspeople from Arakune and seeks to restore him to his former self through any means necessary, even through death. She also seems to respect Bang Shishigami, even apologizing to him if she defeats him in a match, although she remains unaware of the true extent of his feelings for her. In Continuum Shift, Litchi is compelled to join the NOL by Hazama in order to obtain information that can help her save Arakune. By the end of Central Fiction Litchi is able to enter the Boundary, where she finds Roy alive and well, and that Arakune is simply a shade of himself used to anchor his existence until he had acclimated to the Boundary. Finding closure with Roy, Litchi returns to the real world and is given Roy's blessing to destroy Arakune. Bang, however, knocks her out to do the deed for her, so she would not have to kill even a shadow of the man she loved. Her Drive, Mantenb≈ç (Ëê¨Â§©Ê£í lit. Myriad Heavens Staff), enables her to control her b≈ç staff of the same name while changing her moveset. Litchi is described as \\"The hottest doctor in video games\\" in the list of the 50 hottest video game characters by Complex, where she ranked at 38th. =Arakune= :Voiced by (English): Spike Spencer Voiced by (Japanese): Takashi Hikida , formerly known as , is a black blob- like creature with a white mask who formerly worked alongside Tager, Kokonoe, and Litchi in Sector Seven. After an attempt to study the Boundary, he fell in and became what he is today, now housing innumerable insects with his now- blobby body and thriving on knowledge. His horrible condition has rendered him virtually insane and lacking any reliable memory, as well as distorting his speech to near incoherency (most of his dialogue consists of gibberish, insane laughter and tortured screaming). Throughout the series his sanity returns at times but is quick to disappear just as fast. Central Fiction later reveals that Roy was inside the Boundary the whole time and Arakune was just his vessel that allowed himself to exist within the Boundary. Due to acclimating to the Boundary, Roy no longer needs Arakune to anchor himself. Choosing to stay within the Boundary to study it, Roy gives Litchi his blessing to destroy Arakune after making peace with her. With his Drive, Crimson, Arakune's special attacks fill his Curse Gauge. Chris Hoadley of VentureBeat listed Arakune as \\"15 most significant new fighting game characters,\\" where he commented that he \\"fits the genre's \\"freak\\" archetype with erratic movements and the ability to pester foes with insects after inflicting a curse,\\" and credited him paving the way for similar characters in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Injustice: Gods Among Us. =Bang Shishigami= :Voiced by (English): Tony Oliver (Calamity Trigger); Steve Kramer (Alter Memory) Voiced by (Japanese): Tsuyoshi Koyama is a ninja from Ikaruga village. He lost his home in the Ikaruga Civil War and his master Tenj≈ç at the hands of Jin Kisaragi, and he and his followers began living in Kagutsuchi waiting for the right moment to strike back at Jin and the NOL. There, he declares himself a hero of love and justice, and dedicates himself to exterminating evil and overturning injustice wherever he goes. He is quite over-exuberant, prone to speeches and tangents as well as making dramatic entrances. He has a romantic fascination with Litchi, always willing to go charging in headlong if he sees someone making her upset. He is overzealous in every way, subtlety not usually at the forefront of his mind (this is only reinforced where his Astral Heat in Continuum Shift destroys almost all of his clothes), however his fiery spirit and will have earned him the respect of a few characters, most notably Hakumen. He also wants Ragna's bounty to rebuild the glory of Ikaruga. In Chrono Phantasma, it is revealed that Bang's giant nail is the Nox Nyctores, Phoenix: Rettenj≈ç (È≥≥Áøº„ÉªÁÉàÂ§©‰∏ä H≈çyoku: Rettenj≈ç), which greatly shocks him, and he decides to seek more answers about his weapon. Bang later learns that his weapon was in fact also a key to halt the flow of seithr across the world while also learning of Izanami's schemes. Donning a more serious attitude, Bang teams up with Ragna in order to help him save the world. In the end of Central Fiction, Bang leads a restoration of Ikaruga, under the order of his master's successor Homura. His Drive, Burning Heart, is a set of attacks that light up an icon in his Fu-Rin-Ka-Zan Gauge on hit. =Carl Clover= :Voiced by (English): Michelle Ruff Voiced by (Japanese): Miyuki Sawashiro is a young boy who, like Noel and Jin, was a student at the Military Academy, but dropped out without warning while Noel and Jin graduated. He is currently after Ragna's bounty and the Azure Grimoire, leading him to become a vigilante. He travels with a maid-like puppet called Nirvana, whom he believes to be his sister Ada. He is unwilling to see that she is, in fact, the Nox Nyctores , a causality weapon in the form of a marionette which amplifies its owner's desires to kill. After several people attempted to disassemble or remove Nirvana from him, Carl became extremely paranoid and possessive over her. He is the son of Relius, whom he hates and refuses to call his father. Despite this, over the course of the series Carl begins to slowly become more like Relius-a development many characters note. In the end of Central Fiction, Carl peeks into the boundary and is wounded in his right eye, blinding it but giving him an understanding of the nature of souls. The finale of the series hints that Carl will walk down the same path as his father, donning an eyepatch with the same design as his father's signature mask. His Drive, Automaton, enables him to control Nirvana in battle. =Hakumen= :Voiced by (English): David Vincent Voiced by (Japanese): Tetsuya Kakihara Leader of the Six Heroes, is a mighty warrior wielding a long sword, the Nox Nyctores, . His body is one of the Sankishin, the . Though the armor acts as his body, Hakumen removes his mask at one point in the first game to reveal to an illusion of Ragna his face, though the player does not see it. Hakumen led mankind to defeat the Black Beast, and was said afterward to have been cast into a void between worlds known as the \\"Edge\\" after attempting to warn the people that they needed to \\"repent for their sins\\" lest the Black Beast return. The truth, however, is that Hakumen had Jubei seal him within the \\"Edge\\" alongside Yuuki Terumi to seal the latter away. After drifting in the \\"Edge\\" for hundreds of years, Kokonoe helped him return to the world, hoping to use him to defeat Terumi, but he set out to achieve his own agendas before being completely salvaged from the Edge. During his journey, he has also shown tremendous respect towards Bang and his unyielding spirit-something surprising given his normally strict disdain for others. Hakumen's true identity is Jin Kisaragi from an alternate time cycle, who fell into the Cauldron beneath Kagutsuchi trying to save Ragna from Nu-13. Transported to the distant past and wounded greatly, he was saved by Rachel and had his soul inserted into the Susano'o Unit, which Rachel came to possess after its original owner discarded it. In the finale of Central Fiction, after he prevents Nu from merging with Ragna, Hakumen is assaulted by Terumi, who destroys his soul to recover the Susano'o Unit as it was his true body. Despite this seemingly permanent death, at the end of the story Hakumen briefly reappears in some form to have one last talk with Trinity before fading away entirely. Though Hakumen is normally a cold, almost emotionless individual a hidden softer side is shown in his love for Tsubaki, who in his timeline died taking a fatal blow in his stead. His desire to save her stems from this, and he is one of her most stalwart allies throughout the story. He is also shown to deeply despise anybody who dares to hurt her, mainly Nu -No .13- as she was the one who caused Tsubaki a gruesome end in the previous timeline. His Drive is called Zanshin (Êñ¨Á•û lit. Slaying God), which projects a shield-like energy barrier that, when hit by an opponent's attack, will negate said attack and follow-up with an unblockable, invincible counter- attack. =Nu-13= :Voiced by (English): Cristina Valenzuela Voiced by (Japanese): Kanako Kond≈ç is the main antagonist of Calamity Trigger, and a Murakumo Unit created by Relius Clover, who was forged in Kagutsuchi's Gates of Sheol. Her weapon is the Nox Nyctores, Lux Sanctus: Murakumo (Á•ûËºù„Éª„É†„É©„ÇØ„É¢ Shinki: Murakumo), a giant sword that breaks apart to become her armor and a set of floating swords. She was programmed, either by Relius or his partner, Hazama, to terminate anyone she deems as hostile subjects that come near the Gate. Despite normally acting as an emotionless girl who speaks in a mechanical fashion, Ragna's presence causes her to shift to the personality of a bubbly yet highly murderous girl who is in love with Ragna, showcasing traits typical of a yandere. Nu temporarily inhabits the body of a makeshift Murakumo unit named Lambda-11 during Continuum Shift, suffering amnesia and only remembering her love for Ragna. After she sacrifices herself to save Ragna from a fatal blow by Terumi, her soul leaves Lambda's body. After this, Hazama and Relius restore her in her original form and return her memories, reverting her back to her normal state while under their control. By Central Fiction, her more murderous and emotional personality becomes dominant though her sanity begins to dwindle along with it. At the end of the series, Nu suffers a fatal defeat at the hands of Ragna and Hakumen. She is shown alive in the ending but catatonic, being cared for by Noel and Lambda. Nu uses her Drive, Sword Summoner, to attack with sword-like projectiles at different angles. Playable in BlazBlue: Continuum Shift=Tsubaki Yayoi= :Voiced by (English): Julie Ann Taylor Voiced by (Japanese): Asami Imai is Jin's childhood friend/relative and Noel's former roommate from the Military Academy and a member of the NOL's 0 Division. She is described as a straight-A student, and has a rather no- nonsense personality. She is very serious and reserved, and is a member of the dignified Yayoi family, and possesses romantic feelings for Jin. In the true ending of Calamity Trigger, where she appears as a sub-character, she is assigned by Hazama to kill Noel and Jin, though this is just a false mission to further Hazama's objectives. In Continuum Shift, Tsubaki learns from Hazama that she was originally Jin's secretary in the previous timelines before Noel took her place in the current. This revelation, along with Hazama's goading, leads her to hate Noel due to the perception that she took everything from her, though Hazama intentionally did not tell her that she died in the previous timelines. In the end, Tsubaki was placed under the control of Izanami through the Mind Eater spell, turning her into a cold and emotionless enforcer of Izanami's will. However, in Chrono Phantasma, Tsubaki is freed thanks to the efforts of Jin, Noel, and Makoto and is able to unlock the true power of her weapon, Izayoi. In Central Fiction, Tsubaki learns from Jin that Ragna is his brother, and vows to help Jin out however she can. Though she disdains Ragna, she aids him as well for Jin's sake. Tsubaki also greatly admires Hakumen, though is unaware he is Jin until the end of the series, who in return is one of her most stalwart allies. In the end, once Izanami and Terumi's threat is over, Tsubaki and Makoto visit the church Noel has been residing, offering Noel a position in the newly reformed NOL alongside her and Makoto. Another Tsubaki from an alternate timeline appears in the end of the story, and though her appearance is obscured, the shape of her hair and possession of Hakumen's Okami implies she has inherited the Susano'o Unit and his duty as well. She teams up with Rachel to try and find Ragna, after he sacrificed himself to change the world into one of everlasting peace. Tsubaki's weapon is the Sealed Weapon Izayoi (Â∞ÅÂç∞ÂÖµË£Ö„ÉªÂçÅÂÖ≠Â§ú F≈´in Heis≈ç ‚Äì Izayoi), an Ars Armagus that enables her to control light, though it can potentially lead to blindness. Her Drive, Install, charges her Install Gauge. =Hazama= :Voiced by (English): Erik Davies (Calamity Trigger); Doug Erholtz (Alter Memory  Cross Tag Battle) Voiced by (Japanese): Y≈´ichi Nakamura , also known by his extend code name , a captain of the NOL's Intelligence Division and the main antagonist of Continuum Shift. He is an artificial human born from an Azure grimoire created by Relius to be a vessel for Terumi. Hazama fights with balisong knives and the Nox Nyctores, . His Drive, Ouroboros, enables him to summon chains that can be used to quickly move through the battlefield or attack his opponents. In Calamity Trigger, he appears to be supervising Noel's actions to keep her in line, but he has a sinister hidden agenda. Initially, it appears that Hazama has no will of his own and is simply a body and alias for Terumi, yet Chrono Phantasma reveals that the two share control of the body. Whenever Terumi is in control of Hazama's body, he discards the former's fedora hat and spikes up his hair, while gaining a manic look to his face. In Central Fiction, after separating from Terumi following a near-fatal clash with Platinum the Trinity, Hazama has decided to no longer be Terumi's vessel and wants to pursue his own desires to comprehend the emotions of others. Hazama goes through with this by inflicting as much pain, both physical and psychological, on others as he can, though Naoto and Ragna put a stop to his machinations. In the end, he and Relius jump into a Cauldron, with his fate unknown. His appearance in Bloodedge Experience hints that the cauldron deposited him in Naoto's timeline. Chris Hoadley of VentureBeat listed Hazama as \\"15 most significant new fighting game characters,\\" where he stated, \\"As a fighter, Hazama is a terror in close range with his knife slashes and Jayoku Houtenjin kick super, but in order to reach that point, he needs to use special chains to whip him around the screen,\\" and credited him paving the way for similar characters in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. =Lambda-11= :Voiced by (English): Cristina Valenzuela Voiced by (Japanese): Kanako Kond≈ç is an imitation Murakumo Unit created by Kokonoe by combining the body of the 11th experimental replica of Saya with the soul of Nu, which was recovered after falling into the Gates of Sheol during the conclusion of Calamity Trigger's Story Mode. Her Drive, Sword Summoner EX, is a copy of Nu's. Lambda's personality and self initially is deleted by Kokonoe to allow her to be a vessel for Nu. At the end of Continuum Shift, however, Nu sacrifices herself to protect Ragna from a fatal blow from Terumi, passing on her Idea Engine to him as she dies in his arms. Lambda's original self is resurrected in her own body once Izanami creates the Embryo, which she promptly enters in order to find Ragna. At the end of the series, Lambda is shown to have become a nun alongside Noel, and cares for a catatonic Nu. Lambda is in many ways a foil to Nu: she is calm, soft-spoken, and quiet, and while she loves Ragna like Nu does, she wishes to protect and aid him rather than murder him like Nu does. While Nu gradually becomes more aggressive and insane throughout the series, Lambda becomes more determined and stable, and in the end is shown to be able to live a normal life. When being re-introduced in Chrono Phantasma Extend, Lambda became her own character to differentiate from Nu‚Äôs play style, although most of her moves remain the same as Nu‚Äôs. =Mu-12= :Voiced by (English): Cristina Vee Voiced by (Japanese): Kanako Kond≈ç is a Murakumo Unit created by Relius Clover, and Noel Vermillion's true form. She is the final boss of Continuum Shift. Her memories as Noel are sealed by Terumi after breaking her with intense psychological conditioning to hate the world, and she serves him for one purpose: to destroy the Sankishin Unit \\"Amaterasu\\" and erase the world from its existence. Due to this, she is called Kusanagi, the \\"Sword of the Godslayer\\" and the perfect form of a Murakumo Unit, and her hatred for the world has increased substantially, making her aggressive towards everything she fights. Like Nu, Mu wields the Nox Nyctores Lux Sanctus: Murakumo, though her version is different in color and appearance. Her Drive, Steins Gunner, projects a Stein to a targeted location. In the end of Continuum Shift, Ragna is able to undo Terumi's conditioning and restore Noel, who initially is afraid of her true self afterwards. However, in Chrono Phantasma, Noel acknowledges Mu as herself and is able to use her true abilities while retaining her personality. In Central Fiction Mu is separated from Noel after they learn the truth of the world in an effort to protect the gate to the Azure. This leaves Mu without a form and existing as only a soul, while an amnesiac Noel retains their body. Eventually, the two rejoin and are able to explain the truth of the world to Ragna and Jin, as well as the nature of Izanami. Noel is later able to assimilate Mu, and imprison Izanami, into her soul with Ragna's help and recreate Saya, though she still chooses to go by the name \\"Noel\\" to prevent Izanami's mind from controlling her. By the end of the series, Mu and Noel are one harmonious being again, with Izanami still imprisoned inside their shared soul, though for how long exactly is as of yet unknown. Playable in Blazblue: Continuum Shift II=Makoto Nanaya= :Voiced by (English): Cindy Robinson Voiced by (Japanese): Tomomi Isomura is another classmate of Noel's and Jin's from the Military Academy, much like Tsubaki. She is a beastkin with squirrel- like features, and is considerably hyperactive with a short attention span though has surprisingly high intelligence. She is outgoing, adventurous, and has inhuman reflexes. She has a few complexes about her race but nonetheless proudly acknowledges who she is. She initially appears to be working under the NOL's Intelligence Division, but is actually an informant for Sector Seven. After officially defecting from the NOL, Makoto stays by Noel's side to help her throughout the story. At the end of the series, Makoto rejoins the newly reformed NOL with Tsubaki, and is last seen visiting Noel at her church. In battle, she fights using her specially-made cross tonfas, and her Drive, Impact, allows her to execute special attacks depending on the level of charge. Many characters in the story comment on Makoto having an unusually strong soul. =Platinum the Trinity= :Voiced by (English): Laura Bailey (Continuum Shift II~Chrono Phantasma); Alexis Tipton (Alter Memory; Cross Tag Battle) Voiced by (Japanese): Aoi Y≈´ki is a young girl created by Trinity Glassfille, whose spirit inhabits her Nox Nyctores . While Trinity rarely possesses her and manifests herself for brief moments, Platinum has two co-existing personalities: a rude girl named and a polite boy named who both cherish Jubei. In Central Fiction, Trinity transferred herself into Jin's Yukianesa to help him stop the machinations of Izanami and Terumi. But this has causes Platinum to begin fading away as Luna and Sena are unable to maintain their existence within the Embryo on their own. But they are saved by Jin and Trinity, the former's power enabling Platinium to exist independently of Trinity. Following Terumi's defeat and Trinity passing on, Platinum is shown living peacefully with Litchi Faye-Ling in Kagutsuchi. Platinum's Drive, Magical Symphony, equips her with a special item to use in battle. =Valkenhayn R. Hellsing= :Voiced by (English): Doug Stone Voiced by (Japanese): Motomu Kiyokawa is one of the Six Heroes and Rachel's elderly butler and trusted adviser who has served the Alucard family line for generations. He possesses a sharp wit and is concerned for Rachel's well- being. Valkenhayn seems to be worried about Rachel associating with things below her class (particularly Ragna, although others might apply), but he always acts in a sophisticated and gentlemanly manner. Before Ragna devices his final plan to save the world from looping itself in Central Fiction, Valkenhayn bids him farewell and good luck. At the end of the series, Valkenhayn is last seen pouring a tea while waiting for Rachel's return. Valkenhayn was once partnered with Relius Clover as an assassin in the past, and initially tried to kill Rachel's father before changing his ways and working under him. His Drive, Werewolf, enables him to transform into a wolf. Playable in BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend=Relius Clover= Voiced by: Junichi Suwabe is one of the three main antagonists of the series, alongside his partner, Y≈´ki Terumi, and their mistress, Hades Izanami. Relius is Carl and Ada's father. He is a genius alchemist known as the Puppeteer, and revealed in Central Fiction to be formerly a wizard known as One of the Ten Sages, using both magic and science for his inventory. His inventions include the artificial human Hazama and his modifications to Saya's body, both of whom were used to host Terumi and Izanami respectively. He also created the Murakumo Units, which themselves consist of Nu-13, Lambda-11, and Mu-12, and the Nox Nyctores named Deus Machina: Nirvana, which he harvested his daughter's body to create. He completed the latter with help from Kokonoe of Sector Seven, only for his son Carl to steal it and use it against him. His own puppet, the , was created from the body of his wife, Ignis, who is similar in appearance to Nirvana. He summons Ignis into battle with his Drive, Detonator.

She is the drive of the Master Unit Amaterasu, and is its power of 'destruction.' This makes her the embodiment of death in the real world, meaning she cannot truly be killed. By the time of Central Fiction her host body is beginning to fail and deteriorate. Relius reveals that not many bodies would be able to host her without immediately decaying or falling apart, and that it truly speaks to Saya's power that it could hold Izanami as long as it did. Initially cold, unfeeling, and emotionless, her time using Saya as a vessel causes her to develop a sense of self and personality. After speaking with Relius on the nature of her existence, she decides that because she revels in the death and despair she causes that her desire to cause the death of the world is not due to being Amaterasu's drive but because of her own desires. Though she comes dangerously close to achieving her objective of the death of all life, Ragna is able to help Noel recreate Saya by imprisoning Izanami into her soul, where she remains to this day by the end of the series. Notably, this is the only time in the series where Izanami truly feels fear, as her imprisonment within Noel's soul results in the destruction of her 'self' afterwards ‚Äì the only way her body can truly die, though her mind still lingers within Noel's mind.

Jin's jealousy grew so much that he eventually attempted to kill her, immediately after she gave Jin the Nox Nyctores, Yukianesa. It is hinted, however, that in Central Fiction Jin's attempt to kill her was instead brought on by insanity induced by Yukianesa, and that Saya giving it to him was part of his delusions. She was kidnapped by Y≈´ki Terumi shortly after and was given to Relius Clover to be used as a \\"vessel\\" for Hades Izanami. In Central Fiction, it is revealed that Saya's body was heavily modified by Relius to better suit Izanami, though it is falling apart by that point in time. Izanami references Saya's feelings throughout the series, mainly to taunt Ragna. Once Noel assimilates and imprisons Izanami into her soul, the two merge and bring Saya back with both Noel and Izanami's memories. It is due to the fact that Izanami is now trapped inside of her, that Saya chooses to still use the name 'Noel', as to not let Izanami take full control of her just reunified body. After assimilating the Origin as well at the end of the series, Saya loses all of her memories as Izanami due to Ragna's self-sacrificial actions, and therefore goes by just Noel. She and Lambda-11 now work as nuns at the church she grew up in, as they care for a catatonic Nu-13.

It is also the one responsible for the time loops in Calamity Trigger every time their plans fail. At the end of Continuum Shift, Terumi is able to trick Takamagahara with the help of the Izayoi to blind them, using Ragna defeating Mu as a distraction, and upload a virus created by Phantom to infect them, so that Izanami can take over its powers and use them for her own plots. =The Origin= :Voiced by: Yukana The Origin is the first Prime Field Device and the one who discovered the Master Unit: Amaterasu.

She is often referred to synonymously with the name Amaterasu, though she is not the deity that gives its namesake to the Unit. Despite this, the Origin does not wish for this and wants to be freed of her duty, and has come to see Ragna as her 'hero' that would save her. Every time Ragna dies or the world reaches a point where Ragna could not reach her, the Origin would reset it until Ragna found a greater path. It is due to this that the Origin has earned the ire of many other characters, notably Nine. Eventually, Noel is able to assimilate her and free her from her position in the 'Master Unit.' Despite this, afterwards Ragna speaks to another being inside the Master Unit that shows the traits of both Saya and Naoto's sister, Saya Terumi. It is unknown if this is a piece of the Origin left in the unit, Amaterasu herself, or another entity entirely. =Tomonori= is Jubei's younger brother, Konoe's brother-in-law, and Kokonoe's uncle.

Due to a comment dropped by Hazama, she was implied to be indirectly responsible for allowing him to kill Nine, due to him tricking her into releasing Nine's \\"Ruby: Mind Eater\\" spell from him which allowed him to kill both Trinity and Nine, as explained in one of the Phase Shift novels. In Central Fiction, Trinity separated from Platinum and transferred herself into Yukianesa to aid Jin, later enabling her creation to exist independently of her as she passes on to the afterlife. =Tsukuyomi= The Tsukuyomi Unit is a giant shield wield by Rachel Alucard and one of the three Sankishin units brother of Amateratsu and Susanoo.

It is a member of the Shuswap Nation Tribal Council. It is a First Nations government of the Secwepemc (Shuswap) Nation, located in the Central Interior region of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The band's main community is at Chu Chua, British Columbia. Four of the five First Nation Reserves in Simpcw territory were designated on July 5, 1877 and the fifth was designated on February 24, 1916. The Shuswap language name for North Thompson Band's community and reserve is 'Simpcw'. Chief and Councillors The current chief and council were sworn in on June 1, 2015 at 1:00 pm, they will serve a 3-year term until the next election. =Historical Leaders= Chief Cinnitza was mentioned by Archibald McDonald from a trip in 1828. Chief Andr√© is mentioned in records from the time of settling First Nation Reserves in 1877 as well as being a signatory to the Memorial to Frank Oliver in 1911. Treaty Process Simpcw First Nation is currently not involved in the treaty process and has never ceded or surrendered any of their land. History The Simpcw inhabit Simpcw√∫lÃìecw, an area now known in English as the North Thompson. Simpcw lands include an area from McLure to McBride, from Jasper to the headwaters of the Athabasca. The Simpcw collected local plants and animals for survival and employed various methods for fishing. An example of a kind of fishing barrier observed in the Barri√®re River was described by George Mercer Dawson as \\"two weirs or fences each of which stretched completely across the stream.\\" The Simpcw interacted with other First Nations in British Columbia and Alberta. Early interactions with Europeans began around the start of the nineteenth century with fur traders. Alexander Ross wrote that David Stuart came to the area to spend the winter of 1811‚Äì12. Stuart's wrote of his visit that after being blocked from a return to Fort Astoria by snow \\"[we] passed our time with the She Whaps and other tribes in that quarter.\\" Ross came himself in May 1812 to establish 'Fort Cumcloups' where he \\"sent messages to the different tribes around who soon assembled bringing with them their furs. Here we stayed for ten days The number of Indians collected on the occasion could not have been less than 2,000.\\" Alexander Ross's account of a journey in about 1815 describes some meetings specifically in the North Thompson. Describing his journey from Kamloops to the Rocky mountains he writes, The lake called by Ross \\"Friendly Lake\\" is identified as East Barriere Lake by Kenneth A. Spaulding in his edited edition of Ross's account. Ross also notes the extent of the area with which the guide he met near East Barriere Lake was familiar when he writes after reaching Eagle Hill, \\"As we journeyed along our guide took us up to another height and pointing out to us the country generally, said he had passed and repassed through various parts of it seven different times, and in as many different places; he seemed to know it well, and observed that the road we had travelled, with all its difficulties, was the very best to be found.\\" On the way back to Canoe River and passing 'a considerable lake' they returned to 'Friendly Lake' where the guide's family had departed, but had left behind a stick with a certain notch, stuck in the ground with a certain lean which indicated to their guide where his family had gone. Spaulding identified the 'considerable lake' as Adams Lake. In 1828, Archibald McDonald kept a journal of a trip from Hudson's Bay to the Pacific Ocean. In an entry for October 3 he described meeting Chief Cinnitza at 'the Fort' after a traverse of the 'North River'. On October the 4th he wrote, \\"At Barrier Village by eight.\\" And described a breakfast at eleven \\"surrounded by the Indians of the Barrier.\\" McDonald lists \\"Shin-poos (of the north branch of the Thompson)\\" as one of seven tribes that traded at Fort Kamloops in the reports of his father, Angus McDonald. And writes, \\"As to the Shin-poos, a mountain race, a remnant of the 'Snare Indians', my father in his report says, that there were but few of them (about 60 families) and that they did not come very regularly to the Fort.\\" McDonald also copied the following from his father's report to the Governor and Council reporting on the spring of 1823: \\"This Tribe (the Shin-poo) inhabits the north branch of Thompsons River. They are good beaver hunters, and go sometimes to and even east of the Rocky Mountains--I had in view to have one or two men to accompany them all summer, so as to endeavor to meet the Gentlemen (that is to say the Express and Passengers coming in by Rocky Mountain Portage) coming to the Columbia next fall, at the little House (which I believe was at the east end of the Portage) which would be by far a nearer and more practicable way of obtaining a knowledge of the country about the heads of the Thompson and N Branch than by sending from the east side, as Mr Annance was, last summer: the Tribe not having come to the Port this Spring prevents my sending with them.\\" In 1862 a gold rush in the Cariboo brought smallpox to the area which caused many deaths, reducing the population to \\"the merest handful.\\" From the 1890s to 1970 children were taken to the Kamloops Indian Residential School where life was harsh and use of their own language was forbidden. Some Simpcw served in the Second World War. In 1909 anthropologist James Teit recorded \\"opinions held by the tribe regarding the qualities and average characteristics of their neighbors and also of the several divisions of their own people in former days.\\" Of the 'North Thompson' he wrote that, \\"The North Thompson division were probably the best hunters and greatest travellers. They were mild, quiet, steady, rather serious, hospitable, rather poor.\\" In August 1916, the Simpcw people of the T√™te Jaune Cache were forcibly relocated out of the area to Chu Chua and other places. The people were made to travel the 300 kilometres by foot. In August 2016 events were held to mark the 100th anniversary of that event. The people of the Simpcw First Nation have made applications to the government to have lands at T√™te Jaune Cache formally recognized. The Simpcw have been known in English by different names, \\"The name of the North Thompson Band, simpx ∑wemx...also known in English to traders as people of the North Fork of Thompson River, was spelled Chin-Poo by [John] McLeod (1823) and [Archibald] McDonald (1827), Shinpoo by the Oblate Missionaries...and Nsi'mpxemuxÃ£ by Teit. Their former main village, ciq ∑ceq ∑√©lq ∑ 'red willows' (Cornus stolonifera)...was referred to as Tsuk-tsuk-kwalk, erroneously translated as 'red pine' by Dawson...and as Tcoqtceqwa'llk by Teit. The reserve name Chu Chua is not derived from this but is an anglicization of tex ∑cwex 'creek running through the bush'.\\" Demographics The Simpcw First Nation currently has 724 members. Archibald McDonald reported that in about the 1820s his father wrote that there was about sixty Simpcw families. In 1883 a government report on population listed \\"North Thompson and Canoe Lake: 144.\\" In 1850 the population after being reduced by foreign infections was estimated at 250, in 1906 the population was down to 70. Economic Development The Simpcw First Nation has a highly developed and active economic development organization currently known as the Simpcw Resources Group of Companies (SRG) Social, Educational and Cultural Programs and Facilities Simpcw Fisheries manages and operates a hatchery called Dunn Lake Hatchery. Simpcw hosts a special 'Coho Day' in October at the hatchery. Neqweyqwelsten School is an elementary school located in Chu Chua. It is open to all Simpcw First Nation and community members, as well as non-members if space is available. First Nation Reserves First Nation Reserves under the administration of the Simpcw First Nation are: *North Thompson 1 (07186), 1236.1 ha, \\"Kamloops District on the east bank of the North Thompson River about 45 miles north of Kamloops.\\" *Nekalliston 2 (07187), 1.4 ha, \\"Kamloops District near Little Fort and opposite Nekalliston Creek 50 miles north of Kamloops.\\" *Barriere River 3A (07188), 1.6 ha, \\"Kamloops District on left bank of the Barri√®re River about 2 miles from mouth of the North Thompson River.\\" *Louis Creek 4 (07189), 3 ha, \\"Kamloops District on the left bank of Louis Creek about ¬º mile from its confluence with North Thompson River about 34 miles north of Kamloops.\\" *Boulder Creek 5 (07190), 280 ha \\"Kamloops District, Lot 4088, north of Dunn Lake.\\" In the 1870s the government created the Red Trees Reserve at Chu Chua without consulting with the Simpcw. In the report of a survey of 1872, Alfred R C Selwyn mentions two stays at what he calls the \\"Red Pine Reserve\\". Records of decisions on the reserves are listed online in the BC Provincial Collection at the Federal and Provincial Collections of Minutes of Decision, Correspondence, and Sketches which is a collection of materials produced by the Joint Indian Reserve Commission and Indian Reserve Commission from 1876‚Äì1910. Decisions for North Thompson 1, Nekalliston 2, Barriere River 3, and Louis Creek 4 are item 1081/78, from July 5, 1877. Barriere River 3 was sold in 1921 in exchange for Barriere River 3A. These decisions were made by A. C. Anderson during a trip up the North Thompson River with Chief Andr√© on July 3‚Äì5, 1877 to as far as Little Fort. This decision was made at a time when other First Nations in the area were considering going to war over their treatment by the government. The sale of Barriere River 3 and the Boulder Creek reserve are listed in the 1943 Schedule. Boulder Creek was allotted by Royal Commission on February 24, 1916.

The hotel was built in 1928 after the original Redmond Hotel, (sometimes referred to as \\"Hotel Redmond\\" ) was destroyed in a fire. It is a three-story Georgian-style brick masonry building located on 6th Street in downtown Redmond. It has been in continuous use as a commercial hotel since it first opened. Today, the New Redmond Hotel is a major landmark in downtown Redmond. Because of its importance to the history of Redmond, the New Redmond Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On August 1, 2019, Soul Community Planet announced that after a two-year, $7 million renovation, The New Hotel Redmond by SCP (or SCP Redmond) opened in the Fall of 2019. The 41,000 square-foot, 49-room hotel, was redeveloped in partnership with the city of Redmond. The Rooftop, a 1,500 square-foot rooftop social garden (restaurant / bar), was added, opened in August. The redevelopment was made possible through a public-private partnership between the city of Redmond and the developer ‚Äì a partnership managed by Alpha Wave Investors and RevOZ Capital. The city of Redmond, through its Redmond Urban Renewal Agency, provided a $3.53 million investment in the project. In 2020, The New Redmond Hotel by SCP (or SCP Redmond) was awarded the DeMuro Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation through Restore Oregon along with ten other historic projects from across Oregon.  Old hotel  The original two-story Redmond Hotel was built in 1906 by William and Fanny Wilson. The Wilson's arrived in Redmond in 1905 after making a modest fortune in Alaska selling supplies to miners during the Klondike gold rush. Once in Redmond, they became active community boosters, organizing a businessmen's group that meet weekly to discuss civic affairs. In 1911 the hotel made the papers, and again in 1914, when the Jones Land Company was excavating for a septic tank in the rear of the hotel. The workmen had dug 19 feet through solid rock and drilled an additional 10 more feet before setting dynamite. The explosion of the dynamite was anticlimactic after a dull sound followed and cold, heavy-pressured air issued out. It was assumed a cavern was punctured and that it would make for a suitable septic tank. The discovery made the local papers and Hotel Oregon across the street wanted to locate their own cavern and eventually did. By 1914, the piping in the Redmond Hotel became clogged after use of the outlet increased. Another hole was drilled in the hotel and larger piping installed. The new setup was found to be adequate for disposal.  New hotel  In June 1927, the original wood-frame hotel burned to the ground. However, the Wilson's quickly replaced the original hotel with a new one.\\"New Redmond Hotel\\", National Register of Historic Places - Nomination Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, 21 March 1980.\\"New Redmond Hotel\\", Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 17 January 2001. Construction of the New Redmond Hotel began on 17 June 1927. In the building's cornerstone community leaders place a time capsule containing coins, photographs, newspapers with reports of the recent hotel fire, and other community related documents. The new hotel cost approximately $150,000 to build. When it was completed, the hotel had of interior space. The hotel's grand opening was held on 27 July 1928. The event included tours of the new hotel, a banquet with 350 guests, and a community dance. A meeting of the Central Oregon Jersey Breeders was held in conjunction with the grand opening. The hotel's early advertisements boosted that the New Redmond Hotel provided the best lodging and service east of the Cascade Mountains at the lowest possible prices, only $1 to $2.50 per day.\\"New Redmond Hotel\\" (posted on www.waymarking.com), Heritage Walk marker, Redmond Historical Commission and Deschutes County Landmarks Commission, Redmond, Oregon, 18 June 2006. The New Redmond Hotel quickly became a popular social center for the growing Redmond community as well as a well known lodging stop for travelers passing through Central Oregon. The primary function of the building has always been a hotel. However, the hotel lobby served as the home for the local Chamber of Commerce for a time, and as the Redmond bus station since it was conveniently located on Highway 97 which followed 6th Street though town. Today, the hotel remains one of the largest and best known buildings in the city of Redmond. It is also one of the few surviving examples of early 20th century Georgian architecture in Central Oregon. Because of its importance to Redmond history and its distinctive Georgian architecture, the New Redmond Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 October 1980.\\"New Redmond Hotel\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 24 July 2009. In 1993, the hotel was extensively remodeled, modernizing the structure while maintaining the building's historic character.Cole, Leslie, Jim Yuskavitch, and James Yuskavitch, \\"New Redmond Hotel/Travelodge\\", Insider‚Äôs Guide to Bend and Central Oregon, Globe Pequot Press, Guilford, Connecticut, 2002, page 49. The hotel underwent an extensive, two-year $7 million renovation, which was completed in 2019.  Structure  New Redmond Hotel heritage walk markerThe New Redmond Hotel is located on the southwest corner of 6th Street and West Evergreen Avenue in downtown Redmond. It is a three-story brick masonry building with a footprint of by . The hotel is a good example of Georgian- style architecture. It was designed by Bend architect, Hugh Thompson. The building was constructed by a local contracting firm led by Ole K. Olson and his partner S. Elmer Erickson. Another general contractor, Fred N. VanMatre, also helped with the construction. On the first floor, there are six commercial store fronts with large display windows, three facing 6th Street and three facing West Evergreen Avenue. The display windows are separated by wide brick pillars. Above the display windows are glass transom windows. The hotel entrance faces 6th Street. The entrance is marked by a large round archway with flanking bay windows. The upper stories of the building are faced with brick. The second and third floors both have fifteen casement windows facing 6th Street and eight facing Evergreen Avenue. On the third floor, window size alternates between large and small size across the facade. There is a ninth window bay on the Evergreen Avenue side of the building that does not have a window on either upper floor. The hotel's interior fire escape stairwell is behind that bay. Above the entrance extending out toward the street is a vertical marquee announcing the name of the hotel. The sign rises above the rounded cornice that tops the third floor above the hotel entrance. It is from the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the top of the cornice, making the hotel the tallest building in Redmond.McDonald, Jeff, ‚ÄúRedmond will get a preview of downtown at 100 feet tall‚Äù, The Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 2 June 2008. In 2019, The Rooftop (bar/restaurant) was added. The intimate 1,500-square-foot indoor / outdoor garden setting provides panoramic views of the Cascade Range, including Three Sisters volcanic peaks (known as Faith, Hope and Charity), Mount Bachelor, Black Butte, and Smith Rock State Park. The Rooftop offers locally inspired small plate menu, along with handcrafted cocktails featuring herbs, fruit and spices ‚Äì some of which will be grown organically in The Rooftop‚Äôs own gardens.  Interior  The main public spaces inside the hotel are the main lobby and banquet room. Both the lobby and dining room have high beam ceilings with square side-columns crowned by Corinthian capitals. The focal point of the hotel lobby is a large stone-faced fireplace. The lobby is furnished with a mixture of antiques and modern furniture pieces. The floor in the lobby is fir covered with black and white linoleum squares, laid out in a checkerboard pattern. The lobby carpet is patterned after an oriental rug. The banquet room has hardwood floors. An elevator, installed in the 1940s, takes guests to the upper floors. The number of hotel rooms has varied over the years. In 1980, when this building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, there were 29 overnight rooms and 28 longer-term apartment rooms plus two executive suites, one known as the Governor‚Äôs Suite. The rooms have high ceilings and tall windows with the hotel's original woodwork still in place. The hotels heating and cooling plants are located in the basement. The redevelopment of The New Hotel Redmond by SCP opened with 49 guest rooms and suites in 2019 after a two-year renovation. The renovation took the vintage structure down to its historic bones, replacing outdated infrastructure with modern and efficient plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems. This included use of green materials and eco- friendly products and added features such as a living green walls on the rooftop. The hotel's historic grand staircase, which leads to the second floor, and the original 1928 fireplace constructed out of locally sourced lava rock welcomes guests in the lobby. The first floor also includes Provisions Market offering healthy food options in a caf√© setting, SCP Commons providing 1,500 of creative co-working space with conference rooms, and SCP Fit space for health and wellness group classes or social functions and collaborations.

It is used as a biomarker to test for ethanol use and to monitor alcohol abstinence in situations where drinking is prohibited, such as by the military, in alcohol treatment programs, in professional monitoring programs (health professionals, attorneys, airline pilots in recovery from addictions), in schools, liver transplant clinics, or in recovering alcoholic patients. In addition to its use to monitor abstinence and detect drinking, EtG also has potential for monitoring the amount of alcohol use over time because it can be detected in hair and nails, though the effectiveness of this has not yet been proven. A disadvantage of the test is that because EtG can be detected in samples at very low levels, it can also be positive after exposure to alcohol from non-beverage sources, or incidental exposure, which can lead to false positives. The sources of possible exposure in the environment are numerous and include alcohol in mouthwash, foods, over-the-counter medications, and even from inhalation of alcohol from topical use. It is impossible with this biomarker to distinguish small amounts of drinking from extraneous exposure to alcohol. Hair testing controversy A growing number of articles are documenting the high sensitivity and specificity of hair (or nail) EtG for detection of heavy drinking. EtG testing in hair specimens was previously attempted by laboratories in the United Kingdom, but has suffered from numerous lawsuits. Due to the concerns of legal risk, few laboratories offer this type of testing anymore, as it has been determined to be unreliable and unsupportable. The Society of Hair Testing (SOHT) also notes the limitations of EtG, stating that this form of testing can determine \\"chronic excessive alcohol consumption only. This consensus is not applicable for determination of abstinence from alcohol or moderate consumption of alcohol.\\" SOHT also states, \\"It is not advisable to use the results of the hair testing for alcohol markers in isolation\\". The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has cautioned that the test is \\"scientifically unsupportable as the sole basis for legal or disciplinary action\\" because the highly sensitive tests \\"are not able to distinguish between alcohol absorbed into the body from exposure to many common commercial and household products containing alcohol and from the actual consumption of alcohol.\\"Center for Substance Abuse Treatment.

Gaelic music is distinguished from Anglophone musical forms in a number of ways. For example, longer narratives such as murder ballads and songs chronicling the many woes of the singer's life, very common in England and lowland Scotland, and later America, are seldom seen in the Gaeldom. Themes frequently found in Gaelic music include the great beauty and spiritual qualities of nature (\\"Chi Mi Na M√≤rbheanna,\\" \\"An Ataireachd Ard\\") and laments for lost loved ones (\\"Fear a' Bh√†ta,\\" \\"Ailein Duinn,\\" \\"Griogal Cridhe\\"). The latter are nearly always sung from the female perspective, expressing deep grief if the male lover is dead or begging him to return if he is absent or missing. In Scotland, long complex piobaireachd, or pibroch, compositions, originally on the Gaelic harp but then transposed to bagpipes and fiddle as these instruments came into vogue in the Highlands in the 16th and late 17th centuries respectively, are also characteristic of Gaelic music, as is the highly ornamented style of Sean-n√≥s singing in Ireland. Other subgenres include puirt √† beul and waulking songs. In the Western Isles of Scotland, the distinctive Gaelic psalm singing can be found in Presbyterian churches, though this is simply the Gaelic adaptation of an older English tradition that has become rare in the English-speaking world. This is one of relatively few traditions that managed to spread from England to Gaelic-speaking areas, which for the most part tended to maintain their musical independence. Dance music such as reels and jigs, usually played on the fiddle, were also common--for example, the Strathspey reel, which likely developed in the Scottish region of the same name. These were usually considered to be \\"lower\\" forms of music in the Gaelic world, and as such were often referred to as \\"ceol beag\\" (\\"little music\\") to distinguish them from the more elevated pibroch style (\\"ceol mor,\\" or \\"great music\\"). Scottish Gaelic music could be found in pockets of the Cape Fear Valley in North Carolina until just after the Civil War. In Nova Scotia, particularly Cape Breton Island, where many Scottish Highlanders emigrated in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there remains a thriving Gaelic music community. Irish Gaelic music can be found in Newfoundland.

It has over 112 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population of approximately 18 million. Nagpur is Maharashtra's second, or winter, capital. Government in the state is organized on the parliamentary system. Power is devolved to large city councils, district councils (Zila Parishad), sub-district (Taluka) councils, and the village parish councils (Gram panchayat). The politics of the state are dominated by the numerically strong Maratha‚ÄìKunbi community. There are national and regional parties in the state, serving different demographics, such as those based on religion, caste, urban and rural residents. Government structure=State Government= Vidhan Bhavan (State Legislative Assembly), Nagpur. The assembly meets here for the winter session The government of Maharashtra is conducted within a framework of parliamentary government, with a bicameral legislature consisting of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and the Maharashtra Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) is the lower chamber and consists of 288 members, who are elected for five-year terms. There are 25 and 29 seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and others, respectively. The Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) is the upper chamber and is a permanent body of 78 members. The government of Maharashtra is headed by the Chief Minister, who is chosen by the party or alliance with a majority of members in the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister, along with the council of ministers, drives the legislative agenda and exercises most of the executive powers. However, the constitutional and formal head of the state is the Governor, who is appointed for a five-year term by the President of India on the advice of the Union government. =Maharashtra in Indian Parliament= Maharashtra elects members to both chambers of the Indian Parliament. Representatives to India's lower chamber, the Lok Sabha, are elected by adult universal suffrage, and a first- past-the-post system, to represent their respective constituencies. They hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers. Representatives to the upper chamber, the Rajya Sabha, are elected indirectly by the Vidhan Sabha members. Maharashtra elects 48 members out of 543 total elected members of the Lok Sabha and 19 out of 233 elected members of the Rajya Sabha. =Local government= Gram panchayat office of Waghoda Budruk Village in Jalgaon district in Maharashtra There are three further levels of government below that of the state: districts (Zilla Parishad), taluka (sub-divisions), and gram panchayat (village parish councils). The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act also stipulated representation in local government for women, the scheduled castes, and the scheduled tribes. There are 36 districts in Maharashtra, which are typically grouped into six divisions, although there are no division-level governments. The administration in each district is headed by a District collector, who belongs to the Indian Administrative Service and is assisted by a number of officers belonging to Maharashtra state services. The state has a long tradition of powerful planning bodies at the district and local levels. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, an officer belonging to the Indian Police Service and assisted by the officers of the Maharashtra Police Service, maintains law and order, in addition to handling related issues in each district. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, an officer belonging to the Indian Forest Service, manages the forests, environment, and wildlife of the district, assisted by the officers of Maharashtra Forest Service and Maharashtra Forest Subordinate Service. Sectional development in the districts is looked after by the district head of each development department, such as Public Works, Health, Education, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry. Cities and towns have their own separate governments. Local self- governance institutions in rural areas number 34 zilla parishads, 355 Taluka Panchayat samitis, and 27,993 Gram panchayats. Urban areas in the state are governed by 26 Municipal Corporations, 222 Municipal Councils, four Nagar Panchayats, and seven Cantonment Boards. Political parties & alliances Sharad Pawar, A dominant political figure of Maharashtrian politics for more than forty years Bal Thackeray, Founder of Shiv Sena Since its inception in 1960, and also of predecessor states such as Bombay, the politics of Maharashtra has been dominated by the Indian National Congress party. Maharashtra became a bastion of Congress party stalwarts such as Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, Vasantrao Naik, and Shankarrao Chavan. Sharad Pawar has been a significant personality in state and national politics for nearly forty years. During his career, he has split Congress twice, with significant consequences for state politics. After his second parting from the Congress party in 1999, Sharad Pawar formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) but joined a Congress-led coalition to form the state government after the 1999 Assembly elections. The Congress party enjoyed a nearly unchallenged dominance of the state political landscape, until 1995 when the coalition of Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured an overwhelming majority in the state, beginning a period of coalition governments. Shiv Sena was the larger party in the coalition. From 1999 until 2014, the NCP and INC formed one coalition while Shiv Sena and the BJP formed another for three successive elections, which the INC-NCP alliance won. Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress party was the last Chief Minister of Maharashtra under the Congress-NCP alliance that ruled until 2014. For the 2014 assembly polling, the alliances between the NCP and Congress and between the BJP and Shiv Sena broke down over seat allocations. In the election, the largest number of seats went to the BJP, with 122 seats. The BJP initially formed a minority government under Devendra Fadnavis; but in December 2014, Shiv Sena entered the Government and provided a comfortable majority in the Maharashtra Vidhansabha to the Fadnavis-led government. In the 2019 Loksabha elections, the BJP and Shivsena fought under the NDA banner, whereas the Congress and NCP were part of the UPA. The two alliances remained intact for the legislative assembly elections in October 2019. The BJP and Shivsena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP‚ÄìShivsena alliance came to an end in early November 2019, with Shivsena subsequently forming a new alliance with its longtime rivals, the NCP and Congress, to form the new state government on 28 November 2019. Other parties in the state include the All India Forward Bloc, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, the Communist party of India, the Peasant and workers party, the All India Majlis-e Ittihad al-Muslimin, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, the Samajwadi Party, various factions of the dalit-dominated Republican Party of India, the Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Socialist party. Dominant groups in Maharashtra politics After the state of Maharashtra was formed on 1 May 1960, the INC was long without a major challenger.The party also enjoyed overwhelming support from the state's influential sugar co-operatives, as well as thousands of other cooperatives, such as rural agricultural cooperatives involved in the marketing of dairy and vegetable produce, credit unions etc. For the better part of the late-colonial and early post-independence periods in Bombay state and its successor, Maharashtra state, the politics of the state has been dominated by the mainly rural Maratha‚ÄìKunbi caste, which accounts for 31% of the population of Maharashtra. They dominated the cooperative institutions; and with the resultant economic power, controlled politics from the village level to the state Assembly and the Lok Sabha. In 2016, of the 366 MLAs (Legislative Assembly has 288 MLAs and Legislative Council has 78) combined, 169 (46%) were Marathas. Major past political figures of the Congress party from Maharashtra‚Äîsuch as Keshavrao Jedhe, Yashwantrao Chavan, Shankarrao Chavan, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and Sharad Pawar‚Äîhave been from this group. Of the 19 Chief Ministers so far, as many as 10 (55%) have been Maratha. Since the 1980s, politicians from this group has also been active in setting up private educational institutions. Following disputes between Sharad Pawar and the INC president Sonia Gandhi, the state's political status quo was disturbed when Pawar defected from the INC, which was perceived as the vehicle of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, to form the Nationalist Congress Party. This offshoot of the Congress party is nevertheless dominated by the Maratha community. Shiv Sena was formed in the 1960s by Balashaheb Thackerey, a cartoonist and journalist, to advocate and agitate for the interests of Marathi people in Mumbai. Over the following decades, Shiv Sena slowly expanded, and took over the then Mumbai Municipal corporation in the 1980s.Although the original base of the party was among lower middle and working class Marathi people in Mumbai and the surrounding suburbs, the leadership of the party came from educated groups.However, since 1990s there has been shift in leadership with many middle level leaders creating personal fiefdom for themselve,s and their families with the use of strong-arm tactics. Hansen has termed this as the \\"dada-ization\\" of the party. By the number of Marathas elected on the Shiv Sena ticket in the last few elections, the party is emerging as another Maratha party. The BJP is closely related to the RSS and is part of the Sangh Parivar. The party originally derived its support from the urban upper castes, such as Brahmins and non-Maharashtrians. In recent years the party has been able to penetrate the Maratha community by fielding Maratha candidates in elections. The Shiv Sena‚ÄìBJP coalition came to power at the state level in 1995, which was a blow to the Congress party. In 2006, a split within Shiv Sena emerged when Bal Thackeray anointed his son Uddhav Thackeray as his successor over his nephew Raj Thackeray. Raj Thackeray then left the party and formed a new party called Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). Raj Thackeray, like his uncle, has also tried to win support from the Marathi community by embracing anti-immigrant sentiment in Maharashtra, for instance against Biharis.https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-juhu-beach- decks-up-for-worshipping-the-sun-god-1302371 After the Maratha‚ÄìKunbi, the Mahars are numerically the second largest community. Most of the Mahars are followers of Buddhism and fall under the scheduled caste (SC) group. Since the time of B. R. Ambedkar, the Mahar community has supported various factions of the Republican Party of India (RPI). There are 25 seats reserved for the SC. Parties such as NCP, BJP, and the Congress field candidates from other Hindu SC groups like Mang and Chambhar for the reserved seats, to thwart the candidates of the RPI. 2014 Assembly Election Devendra Fadnavis, Former Chief Minister of Maharashtra and leader of opposition in Maharashtra Vidhan sabha The 2014 assembly election followed a landslide national victory of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, which brought the Narendra Modi to power as prime minister. All major parties in the state (BJP, Shivsena, INC, and NCP) contested the elections on their own, leading to a complex and much- contested election. The BJP put together an alliance of upper castes, the Other Backward Class (OBC), and to some extent the Dalit to fight the Maratha- led Congress and NCP. The results were significant in that the BJP received the highest number of seats, despite being historically smaller than Shiv Sena in the state. Although the BJP still required Shiv Sena's support to form a majority, it progressed from being a minor party in state politics to the party of the chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, who held that position until January 2020. 2019 Lok Sabha elections In April 2019, voting for the 48 Lok Sabha seats from Maharashtra was held in four phases. Despite their differences, the BJP and Shiv Sena once again contested the elections together under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) banner. Similarly, the Congress and NCP had their own seat-sharing arrangement. The breakaway party of Raj Thakeray, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, did not contest any seats, and instead urged their supporters to vote for the NCP‚ÄìCongress alliance, Thakre campaigning for candidates belonging to these parties. The results of the election on 23 May 2019 was another landslide victory for the NDA, with the BJP and Shiv Sena winning 23 and 18 seats, respectively, out of the total of the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats. The Congress party won only one seat in the state whereas the NCP won five seats from its stronghold of western Maharashtra. 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections Uddhav Thackeray, 19th Chief Minister of Maharashtra The BJP‚ÄìShiv-Sena and NCP‚ÄìCongress alliances remained intact for the Vidhansabha elections in October 2019. The BJP and Shiv Sena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP, with 105 seats, was far short of the 145 seats required to form majority and declined to form a minority government. At the same time, Shiv Sena started talks with the NCP and Congress to form government. On 23 November 2019, BJP formed a government with support from NCP, with Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister.

The Kellers were convicted of multiple charges and sentenced to 48 years in prison, but were freed in 2013 based on newly revealed information about misconduct by the prosecution and other authorities. The charges against them were dismissed in 2017, and the Kellers were declared \\"actually innocent\\", entitling them to compensation for the lost years of their lives. Overview In the summer of 1991, the therapist of a three-year-old child being treated for behavioural problems due to her parents' divorce alleged that the Kellers had sexually abused the child. The child's mother contacted the police, who alerted the case's eventual prosecuting attorney, who contacted a friend whose child was also enrolled in the day care and being treated by the same therapist. During the time leading up to the trial, two other children from the day care offered similar accusations. According to the children, the couple served blood-laced Kool-Aid and forced them to have videotaped sex with adults and other children. The Kellers, they said, sometimes wore white robes and lit candles before hurting them. The children also accused the Kellers of forcing them to watch or participate in the killing and dismemberment of cats, dogs and a crying baby. Bodies were unearthed in cemeteries and new holes dug to hide freshly killed animals and, once, an adult passer-by was shot and dismembered with a chainsaw. The children recalled several plane trips, including one to Mexico, where they were sexually abused by soldiers before returning to Austin in time to meet their parents at the day care. An adult, who had recently claimed to have recovered memories of childhood ritual abuse, claimed the abuse was an example of satanic ritual abuse, and parents began to contact each other, eventually launching a legal case. With information gathered from Believe the Children, an organization created by the parents involved in the earlier McMartin preschool trial, children enrolled in the Kellers' daycare were repeatedly questioned by parents, therapists and law enforcement officers as part of the investigation. Suspicion expanded to include public officials, including police officers; one officer's ex-husband was interrogated for several hours and submitted to two polygraph tests, eventually confessing child (but not ritual) abuse, although he retracted the confession the following morning. Following this confession, the Kellers fled the state, later explaining that their decision was based on the draconian sentences imposed on other, similarly-accused day care providers. The children were diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. The Kellers faced a six- day trial. The first child, whose testimony began the investigation against the Kellers, claimed that no abuse had actually taken place, but she had been coached to claim that abuse had occurred. The only physical evidence of abuse in the case was presented by Dr. Michael Mouw, an emergency room physician at Brackenridge Hospital who examined the 3-year-old girl in 1991 on the night she first accused Dan Keller of abuse. Mouw testified at the Kellers' trial that he found two tears in the girl's hymen consistent with sexual abuse and determined that the injuries were less than 24 hours old. Three years after the trial, while attending a medical seminar, Mouw said a slide presentation on \\"normal\\" pediatric hymens included a photo that was identical to what he had observed in the girl. In 2013, at a new trial, Mouw said under oath in no uncertain terms: ‚ÄúI was mistaken.‚Äù The Kellers were found guilty and given sentences of 48 years each. Fran Keller went to a prison near Marlin, Texas, while Dan Keller went to a prison near Amarillo, Texas. Reevaluation Later investigation of the case revealed serious problems: there was no physical evidence of abuse, a retracted confession that the investigating officer did not believe, flawed medical exams of the children, testimony by a dubious \\"expert\\" on satanic ritual abuse, and the prosecution withholding information from the defense. More generally, there has been more understanding since 1991 of the unreliability of child testimony and that young children are easily suggestible, meaning an unethical or simply incompetent interrogator can easily get wild and false claims from children. On November 26, 2013, the Travis County district attorney's office announced that Fran Keller, now 63, was being released on bond and her husband, Dan Keller, who was convicted at the same time, would be released within a week in a deal reached with lawyers. \\"There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial,\\" said the district attorney. On June 20, 2017, the Travis County district attorney's office announced that the case against the Kellers had been dismissed, citing actual innocence. This ruling made them eligible for compensation from the state of Texas for the 21 years they spent in prison. In August 2017 they were awarded $3.4 million in compensation for the wrongful conviction.

In theory this does not apply to sex-selective abortion, although this remains the basis for some women's requests. Virtually universal access to contraception has been attributed to \\"[keeping] abortion rates relatively low, with 25 percent of women of reproductive age having had at least one abortion, as compared with 43 percent in the United States\\". Contraception and, in extreme cases abortion, is utilized to manage population growth in accordance with its now-defunct one-child policy,Hesketh, Therese . Lu, Li.

History In the early 1950s, the Chinese government made abortion illegal other than when 1) the mother had a preexisting condition, such as tuberculosis or pernicious anemia, that would cause the pregnancy to be a threat to the mother's life; 2) when traditional Chinese medicine could not settle an overactive fetus and spontaneous abortion was expected; and 3) when the mother had already undergone two or more Caesarean sections.Jing-Bao, Nie. Behind the Silence: Chinese Voices on Abortion Lanham, ML: Rowman & Litterfield Publishers, 2005. Punishments were written into the law for those who received or performed illegal abortions. In 1954 and 1956, the law was extended to include other pre-existing illnesses and disabilities, such as hypertension and epilepsy, as well as allowed women working in certain types of occupations to qualify. Women who had already had four children and became pregnant four months after giving birth to their last child also qualified for an abortion. These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth. The scholar Nie Jing-Bao explains that these laws were relaxed in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the intent of reducing the number of deaths and lifelong injuries women sustained due to illegal abortions as well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control. Statistics Exact statistics on the number of abortions performed annually are hard to come by as not all abortions are registered and Family Planning statistics are usually considered state secrets.Report: China aborts 13 million babies a year\\". Burlington, Vermont: Burlington Free Press. 31 July 2009. pp. 2A. However, in 2008, there were an estimated 13 million abortions performed, and approximately 10 million abortion pills sold. Induced abortions, including late-term or even after birth killing, are more common in urban areas, where couples may only have one child.Garner, Paul. Qian, Xu.

Sex-selective abortion The exception to the otherwise general permissibility of abortion in China is that the practice of pre-natal sex determination and sex-selective abortions for non-medical reasons are illegal.Nie, Jing-Bao.

It is argued that sex- selective abortion continues to be one of the key factors in the notably imbalanced sex-ratio in China, as the imbalance cannot be explained solely by the underreporting of female births or by excess female infant mortality.Hesketh, Therese . Lu, Li. Xing, Zhu Wei, Sept 2005, ‚ÄúThe Effect of China‚Äôs One-Child Family Policy After 25 Years, The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 353, Iss. 11. In 2001, 117 boys were born to every 100 girls. These trends are explained by the persistence of a preference for sons in Chinese families.Junhong, Chu, June 2001, ‚ÄúPrenatal Sex Determination and Sex- Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,‚Äù Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 267. In 2005, the government began an Action Plan consisting of ten policies with the aim of normalising the sex ratio of newborns by 2010.Nie, Jing-Bao. Feb 2010, ‚ÄúLimits of State Intervention in Sex-Selective Abortion: The Case of China,‚Äù Culture, Health and Sexuality, Vol. 12, Iss. 2, p. 207. Under this plan, sex-selective abortion was outlawed, as was prenatal sex diagnosis, and harsher punishments were implemented for violating both. Other policies include controlling the marketing of ultrasonic B machines and improving the systems used by medical and Family Planning organisations to report on births, abortions and pregnancies. Family planning The importance of abortions as a family planning tool is evident through the extensive implementation of medical abortions (abortion induced by pills, which can be performed in early pregnancy) in China. In fact, such abortions were legalized in China in 1988, earlier than any other place and are already produced in a large scale in China for many years. It is unclear whether the efficiency of the procedure reaches the high success rates it has in many western countries, but it is highly promoted by Chinese doctorsMedical Abortions in China - A Long Lasting Love Affair, Thinking Chinese, March 2011 and much less invasive than surgical abortion.

The building was built in 1885. As it was built by and for Swedish expatriates in Saint Petersburg, it is usually called the Swedish church. The adjacent building is occupied by the Swedish General Consulate. History The church has a 300-year history since the beginning of Saint Petersburg.On this part, refer to Swedish-Finnish Church in Saint Petersburg, Russia Many Swedes and Finns worked in Peter the Great's construction of Saint Petersburg. Finland had been a part of Sweden from the early 13th century till 1809 when it became a Duchy of Russia. The Swedish people not only worked as laborers, but also worked in the new Russian government, as Peter the Great is said to have modelled it after the Swedish government. From 1703, a Swedish-Finnish Evangelical Lutheran church had been organized, and in 1730 a church was built on the land on Malaya Konyushnaya Street, which Anna Petrovna had donated, and was called the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Anna. Next to this land was the Swedish Embassy, now a Swedish General Consulate's office. In 1745, the Finnish people left the church, became independent and completed a church building on Bolshaya Konyushnaya Street, which later became known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Mary. In 1789, the Swedish people built a new church building, which later came to be known as the \\"Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Catherine\\". In 1885, the current church building was completed, designed by Carl Andersson (1826‚Äì88) who was born in Sweden, but worked in Saint Petersburg. Prominent Swedish families such as those of Immanuel Nobel and Johan Patrik Ljungstr√∂mS:ta Katarina i S:t Petersburg AI:3 (1831-1840) uppslag 134 belonged to this church. The church membership reached 7,000 at its peak and was 5,000 just before the Russian Revolution of 1917. During the Soviet time, the church was closed completely in 1936 and was used for basketball and other sports activities.

The term came into wide use from the mid-1990s after Communist candidates won a number of regions from non- Communist opposition candidates. The \\"red zone\\" comprised predominantly agricultural areas of Central Russia, the national republics of the North Caucasus, as well as a number of the southern regions of Siberia and the Far East. The agricultural areas in the \\"Red Zone\\" were being privatized while the rest of Russia was a more open market. Compare: With the coming to power of Vladimir Putin ( President from 31 December 1999) and reduced support for the Communist Party, the \\"red belt\\" ceased to exist. Reasons In 1999, the regions of the \\"red zone\\", according to the analyst Rostislav Turovsky, included the Smolensk, Bryansk, Kaluga, Orel, Kursk, Belgorod, Ryazan, Lipetsk, Tambov, Voronezh, Penza, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, Volgograd and Astrakhan regions. They have a high proportion of rural population with the appropriate mentality of inherent conservatism. However, with the economic development of different regions, they are not among the most depressed. Turov noted strong support for the Communist Party in the North Caucasus (except in Ingushetia). In the territories and regions of the North Caucasus, a predominantly Russian population of this area support Communist candidates, in his opinion, due to the same reasons as in the rest of the \\"red zone\\". In the national republics (Karachay-Cherkessia, Dagestan and North Ossetia) support is due to nostalgia for the Soviet era, when these poor areas experienced ethno-political and socio-economic stability. In the Urals, and to the east of them, Turovskii notes strong pro-communist sentiment in regions such as Orenburg, Kurgan, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Chita Oblast and Altai Krai, as well as in agricultural areas and in districts of mostly Russian national composition (the Altai Republic, the Ust-Orda Buryat AO and the Jewish AO). According to political scientist Alexander Kanev, \\"in fact the so-called red zone of the 1990s was no more than a residual support for the former communist government. As soon as the new government is \\"well established\\" and returned to the familiar (Soviet) rhetoric and behavior, it has become an electoral power base inherit the previous.\\" Maps Red belt in Russian 1995 praliamentar elections.svgFederal subjects in which the Communist Party won more than the national average (22.39%) in the 1995 legislative election (in red).

Payne (1845‚Äì1925) was a prominent African-American religious, educational and political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Despite being born in the American South during the time of slavery, Payne rose to a level of prominence achieved by few, regardless of race. Among his many accomplishments was being the first African American elected to the West Virginia Legislature. Early life Payne was born in Monroe County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on September 7, 1845. His parents, both of whom were by then free blacks, were Thomas Payne and Barsheba Ellison. He was their only child. Thomas Payne, a cattle drover, died of smallpox when his son was two years old. His maternal grandfather was the slaveholder James Ellison who had Barsheba with his slave Fanny. Ellison made provisions in his will to free Fanny and Barsheba upon his wife's death. He also taught Barsheba to read and write. Payne's mother in turn taught him to read and write at a very early age. Education would remain a guiding tenent of the Payne family.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p368-373 During the American Civil War, Payne was forced to serve as an orderly in the Confederate Army. He was able to return home in 1864 and begin formal education for the first time after the war by attending night school while working as a farmhand during the day. He received a teaching certificate in 1868, becoming one of the first black teachers in Summers County, West Virginia. He continued to teach and farm until 1875, when he was baptized. He was licensed to preach in February 1876 and in May 1877 was ordained as a Baptist minister. Religious leader Following Payne's ordination, he founded the Second Baptist Church in Hinton, West Virginia. He pastored many other churches and was said to have delivered over 1,500 sermons and converted 500 people. He graduated from the Richmond Theological Institute in 1883 and State University, now the Virginia Union University. Payne presided over the West Virginia Baptist state convention for 16 years. On several occasions, he spoke at the national assemblies of white Baptists. Newspaper publisher Payne established three newspapers in West Virginia. They were the West Virginia Enterprise, The Pioneer and Mountain Eagle. When founded, the West Virginia Enterprise was the only black newspaper in West Virginia. He was also a correspondent for other journals, including those geared for the white community. Payne used these venues to pursue equality between the races as well as to encourage other blacks to better themselves through education and the purchase of their own land and homes. Politician Payne's growing stature within both the black and white communities led to his appointment as an alternate delegate to the 1884 Republican national convention. He would serve as a regular delegate to the Republican national convention in 1888, where Benjamin Harrison was nominated for President of the United States. State leaders pushed for Payne's appointment as Ambassador to Liberia. Instead, he was appointed Deputy Collector for the United States Internal Revenue Service in Charleston, West Virginia. In 1896, Payne was elected to the West Virginia legislature, becoming the first black to serve in that elective body. Along with Byrd Prillerman, another prominent African American, Payne was able to persuade the West Virginia Legislature to establish the West Virginia Colored Institute, now West Virginia State University, in 1891. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, Payne raised a volunteer black regiment and saw to their arrival at the war time encampment of Camp Atkinson. Attorney Payne studied law and was admitted to the West Virginia bar in 1889, becoming one of the first black lawyers in West Virginia. Ambassador Hon C H Payne Due to his faithful service to the Republican party, United States President Theodore Roosevelt named Payne as Consul General to the Danish West Indies in 1903, a very rare appointment for an African American at that time. NAACP Payne worked with the NAACP, serving on the planning committee for the historic 1917 Negro Silent Protest Parade. Family life Payne, married Ann Delilah Hargo at a young age and they had eight children. His youngest son and namesake, Christopher Hansen Payne (1881‚Äì1914), graduated from Howard University and received a medical degree. He practiced medicine in Hinton, West Virginia, until his early death in 1914. Children of Christopher Payne: * Arabella Geneva Payne, 1860‚Äì1930 * Lewis W.

The project With the help of volunteers, Beuys planted 7,000 oak trees over several years in Kassel, Germany, each with an accompanying basalt stone. In response to the extensive urbanization of the setting the work was a long-term and large-scale artistic and ecological intervention with the goal of enduringly altering the living space of the city. The project, though at first controversial, has become an important part of Kassel's cityscape. The artwork, circa 2008. The project was of enormous scope, and met with some controversy. While the biggest difficulty of the project was raising the money, the project had its share of opponents. Much of it was political, from the conservative state government dominated by the Christian Democrats. (The mayor of Kassel was a social democrat who stood by Beuys). Some people thought the black stone markers were ugly, even piling pink stones on the sites in 1982 as a prank. Also, a motorcyclist had died as a result of one of the stone markers. However, as more trees were planted people's perception of the project as a parking lot destroyer had met with increasing tolerance. ‚ÄúI think the tree is an element of regeneration which in itself is a concept of time. The oak is especially so because it is a slowly growing tree with a kind of really solid heart wood.

The group was short-lasting, with a temporal range restricted to the late Olenekian age, spanning only a few million years of the Early Triassic. The order gets its name from Hubei Province, China, from which many specimens have been found. They are probable members of the newly defined clade Ichthyosauromorpha. Description Hupehsuchians display an unusual combination of characteristics. The overall shape of the body is fusiform, with a long tail and large, paddle-like limbs. The skull is elongated and the jaws are edentulous. The rostrum is flatteded with the premaxilla thought to form most of the dorsal and lateral surface, while the maxilla is mostly restricted to the ventral surface beyond the base of the rostrum. An opening between the nasal and the prefrontal bones in one hupehsuchian specimen (known as IVPP V3232) was initially interpreted as an antorbital fenestra, but is now thought to be an artifact caused by the damage of the surrounding bones during preservation. Its position is not indicative of a narial opening, either. More likely, the naris lies between the nasal and the maxilla in an area anterior to that of the supposed antorbital fenestra, although the preservation of this area in known specimens is too poor to prove definitively that it is the external naris and not an artifact of preservation, as is the case for the fenestra. Hupehsuchus nanchangensis The neck is relatively elongated and the cervical ribs are short. An unusual feature of the neural spines of the trunk region, from the 11 vertebra to the first caudal, is that each is divided into two distinct units by a suture line. One is proximinal to the rest of the vertebra and the other is distal to it. Some anteroposterior displacement of these two units occurs along the vertebral column, suggesting they are not ossified to one another. In vertebrae 8-14, the distal ends of the distal portions of the neural spines are expanded posteriorly. An additional anterior expansion of the neural spine is seen in all vertebrae after the 14th. These expanded distal regions exhibit some sculpturing, and may have penetrated the dermis. Another unusual characteristic of hupehsuchians is the presence of dermal plates over the neural spines of the approximately 34 presacral vertebrae. A small dermal bone overlies each space between the posterior expansion of one distal neural spine and the anterior expansion of the one behind it. Above these dermal bones lie even larger dermal plates that directly overlie even numbered neural spines. Gastralia are present in some specimens that form a type of ventral armor from the pectoral to the pelvic girdle. The medial row consists of large, overlapping, V-shaped elements, and lateral rows consist of smaller, cylindrical, widely spaced bones. Genera Holotype of Parahupehsuchus Only five named genera of hupehsuchians are known. All come from the Jialingjiang Formation in Hubei Province, China. Geologists originally dated the Jialingjiang Formation to the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic, but it is now thought to date back slightly earlier to the late Olenekian stage of the Early Triassic. The first described hupehsuchian was Nanchangosaurus, named in 1959. A single skeleton of Nanchangosaurus suni (the only species within the genus) have been found from the Daye Limestone in the Hsunjian District of Hubei Province from a single specimen. Another genus, Hupehsuchus, was named in 1972 from a locality in the Xunjian Commune of Nanzhang County. Nanchangosaurus and Hupehsuchus do not differ greatly, and were probably quite similar in appearance. Nanchangosaurus possesses a frontal that participates in the orbital margin and is quite long, more similar to what is seen in basal diapsids. Additionally, the dorsal plates lack sculpturing. In Hupehsuchus, the zygapophyses of the trunk region are more modified, while those of Nanchangosaurus resemble those of more primitive terrestrial reptiles. Overall, Nanchangosaurus was smaller in size than Hupehsuchus, and although several characteristics of the single representative specimen of the former genus suggest it belonged to a juvenile individual, other differences between the two genera are clearly not ontogeneic and dispel the possibility that the single specimen of Nanchangosaurus could represent an immature Hupehsuchus. Different means of preservation can also be taken as evidence for different body forms in the two genera. It is important to note that all specimens of Hupehsuchus are preserved in lateral view, while the single specimen of Nanchangosaurus is preserved in dorsal view (except for the neural spines, which were probably too long to be preserved in this manner). Hupehsuchus possibly had a more laterally compressed body than Nanchangosaurus, which, as a result, would favor preservation in lateral view. A third genus, Parahupehsuchus, was named in 2014 from the Jialingjiang Formation and differs from both Nanchangosaurus and Hupehsuchus in having a more elongated body. It has a series of broad, flattened ribs that abut each other and connect with closely packed gastralia on the underside of the body, forming a bony tube encasing the torso. A fourth genus, Eohupehsuchus, was also described in 2014 and had a shorter neck than other genera, with only six cervical vertebrae. =Unnamed genera= Life restoration of a polydactylous hupehsuchian based on SSTM 5025 In late 2003, a new specimen of hupehsuchian called SSTM 5025, found from the same area as Hupehsuchus and Eretmorhipis, was briefly mentioned in the journal Nature. It is most notable for exhibiting polydactyly, in which more than the usual maximum of five digits per limb were seen as in most advanced tetrapods. Polydactyly is also seen in ichthyosaurs. However, in ichthyosaurs, this condition occurs as either bilateral polydactyly in the case of ophthalmosaurids (extra digits anterior to digit I and posterior to digit V) or interdigital or postaxial phalangeal bifurcation as in non-ophthalmosaurids. Preaxial polydactyly occurs in SSTM 5025, where extra digits only develop anteriorly to digit I. This condition is seen in earlier stem tetrapods from the Devonian period, such as Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. SSTM 5025 possessed seven digits on the forelimbs and six on the hindlimbs. The wide manus and pes of the specimen resemble the limb-like fins of extant frogfishes.Clack, J. A. (2002). Gaining Ground: the Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods. Indiana University Press, 369 pp. Taxonomy and phylogenetics Nanchangosaurus holotype Hupehsuchia was first defined as a suborder of \\"Thecodontia\\" in 1972, when it was first thought to be a group of early archosaurs. It was also thought to be related to several other groups of Triassic reptiles previously thought to be clearly distinct. The presence of the supposed antorbital fenestra described above was seen as evidence for grouping hupesuchians within Archosauria, but the antorbital fenestra characteristic of archosaurs is surrounded by the maxilla and lacrimal, not the nasal and prefrontal bones. The dermal plates were also seen as evidence for terrestrial archosaur ancestors, and comparisons were made with some early armored forms. However, a later study in 1976 could find no similarities between the dermal plates of hupehsuchians and the armor of early archosaurs.Charig, A. J., Krebs, B., Sues, H.-D. and Westphal, F. (1976). Encyclopedia of Paleoherpetology (ed. O. Kuhn), part 13. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer Verlag. The ancestors of hupehsuchians more likely were earlier, more basal terrestrial diapsids, as suggested by several synapomorphies they share with such primitive ancestors. In 1991, Hupehsuchia was recognized as a distinct order after better methods of specimen preparation allowed new features to be revealed that distinguished Hupehsuchia from all other diapsid orders. The assumed position of the naris in hupehsuchians as explained above can be taken as evidence for possible ichthyosaurian affinities, as it is in the same general area as those of ichthyosaurs. Hupehsuchians do resemble earlier ichthyosaurs in outward appearance with slightly fusiform bodies and long, straight, non-lunate tails. Other features shared with ichthyosaurs include a supraoccipital similar to what is seen in early forms, a relatively long antorbital region, and a short transverse process for the ribs. Many more differences exist between hupehsuchians and ichthyosaurs, however. In hupehsuchians, the surfaces of the vertebral centra that articulate with one another are distinctively flat, or acelous, while in ichthyosaurs they are noticeably heterocelous (it is also important to note that the surfaces of centra in the possible early diapsid ancestors of hupehsuchians were amphicelous). However, there are some early ichthyosaurs and ichthyosaur relatives such as Chaohusaurus and Utatsusaurus that possess vertebrae that are not deeply heterocoelus and more closely resemble those of hupehsuchians. Unlike more derived ichthyosaurs, the centra of these two genera are about as long as they are high. In hupehsuchians, where the neural arches dominate the vertebral column, the height of the centra is reduced and the height to length ratio of the centra is smaller, meaning that they are also about as long as they are high. This may suggest that hupehsuchians may have evolved from an ichthyosaur relative. It has also been suggested that hupehsuchians were related to or members of Sauropterygia. Indeed, Nanchangosaurus was classified as a sauropterygian upon its initial description. Many of the features seen in known hupehsuchian specimens that are comparable to those of more well known diapsids may not necessarily be evidence of ancestry or relationship. The lower jaw and rostrum of hupehsuchians have been compared to many other secondarily aquatic tetrapods such as plesiosaurs, whales, and the early marine bird Hesperornis, all of which have developed a similar morphology independently in response to the need for adaptation to a marine environment. Eretmorhipis holotype Classification of Hupehsuchia remains difficult because most of the derived characters exhibited in the clade that can be helpful in phylogenetic analyses are also present in other unrelated groups of secondarily aquatic reptiles, and the overall record of diapsids during the Late Permian-Early Triassic is relatively poor, making it difficult to find any closely related or ancestral taxa. Even higher level classification is difficult because many of the plesiomorphies that characterize such groups are absent in the highly derived, marine adapted hupehsuchians. For example, several characteristics suggest that Hupehsuchia belongs within Neodiapsida, but most of the derived characteristics that define the clade are absent or hard to distinguish in hupehsuchians, even though their ancestors may have possessed these characteristics at one point. Three derived characteristics of Neodiapsida are a reduced number of teeth on the pterygoid, an absence of teeth on the parasphenoid, and a lack of caniniform maxillary teeth, but none of these apply to hupehsuchians because they lack teeth altogether. Many derived characteristics that define neodiapsids regard the limbs and girdles, but these characteristics are not seen in marine reptiles because the limbs and girdles are too highly modified. Many characteristics of the skull cannot be seen in hupehsuchians due to poor preservation of remains. Therefore, any placement of Hupehsuchia within Neodiapsida remains tentative until more specimens are found. Due to the great number of derived characteristics in hupehsuchians that are a result of convergence, computational phylogenetic analyses using computer programs based on the method of maximum parsimony do not produce cladograms that can accurately establish a relationship between hupehsuchians and other diapsids. However, such techniques can be used to study interrelationships within Hupehsuchia. A 2014 phylogenetic analysis found a sister group relationship between Parahupehsuchus and IVPP V4070, with Hupehsuchus and Nanchangosaurus as successively more basal taxa within Hupehsuchia. The authors of this analysis chose to name the Hupehsuchus+(Parahupehsuchus+IVPP V4070) clade Hupehsuchidae, excluding Nanchangosaurus from the group. In 2015 the taxon Eretmorhipis was described for IVPP V4070 and WGSC V26020, and found to be closely related to Parahupehsuchus. The cladogram from their analysis is shown below: Paleobiology Eohupehsuchus holotype Hupehsuchians were clearly well adapted to marine life, as they possessed limbs that were paddle-like in shape and had fusiform bodies. The characteristically elongated neural spines likely were associated with well-developed epaxial muscles (muscles lying above the transverse process of the vertebrae) that facilitated lateral undulation in an axial subundulatory mode. The pattern of articulation in the vertebrae suggests that such undulation was concentrated posteriorly near the pelvic girdle and tail. Hupehsuchus likely was better equipped for lateral undulation as a means of locomotion than Nanchangosaurus was, as evidenced by the assumed greater degree of lateral compression in the body of the former genus, as well as generally more elongated neural spines. The presence of polydactyly in SSTM 5025 may have been an adaptation to moving across underwater substrates in a similar manner to some early tetrapods of the Devonian such as Acanthostega. The flat, toothless rostrum may have supported an avian-like bill, or perhaps rows of baleen as seen in cetaceans of the suborder Mysticeti. The hupehsuchians seemingly were adapted to continuous ram feeding, a form of mobile suspension feeding. The large skull and lack of a fixed symphysis with the lower jaw is indicative of such a feeding method, but the narrowness of the rostrum and the existence of marine vertebrates with larger skulls that were not completely edentulous (e. g. ichthyosaurs) seem to point against it. The long necks of hupehsuchians would seem to inhibit continuous ram feeding at high speeds through the water, so more likely they practiced intermittent ram feeding at slower speeds. The purpose of the dorsal dermal plates of hupehsuchians is unknown. These plates, as well as the ventral gastralia and the tendency for pachyostosis, would have added considerable weight to hupehsuchians, allowing them to have neutral buoyancy. However, the position of the dorsal plates are high above the center of gravity, and this seemingly would have made the bodies of hupehsuchians unstable. Hupehsuchians were among the largest marine animals of their time, so dorsal plates as a protective measure would be unneeded. The tendency for the dorsal plates to be more developed anteriorly may have allowed the anterior portion of the vertebral column to remain relatively rigid, while the posterior portion could freely undulate. Whether hupehsuchians acquired plates subsequent to an adaptation to the marine environment is unclear, or inherited them from a terrestrial ancestor, in which case they would have given rigidity to the spine and protection from predators. In any case, if Nanchangosaurus is seen as representative of an ancestral morphological pattern that led to the more derived Hupehsuchus, then the plates seem to have experienced further development in hupehsuchians and must have had some advantage. The general shape of hupehsuchians seems to have made any locomotion on land nearly impossible, and although no direct evidence is seen in known specimens, these animals were probably viviparous, giving live birth at sea rather than laying eggs on land. Vivipary is also seen in ichthyosaurs.

Two appeals were filed in the case, one by Miss Asma Jilani in the Punjab High Court for the release of her father Malik Ghulam Jilani, and the other by Mrs Zarina Gohar in the Sindh High Court for the release of her husband Altaf Gohar under Article 98 of the Constitution of Pakistan 1962. The detention of Malik Ghulam Jilani and Altaf Gohar had been made under the Martial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971 which was challenged in Lahore and Sindh High Courts respectively. Both the High Courts held that they had no jurisdiction over it because clause 2 of the Jurisdiction of Courts(Removal of Doubts) Order No.3 of 1969 barred the courts from questioning the validity of any act done under the Martial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971. Asma Jilani appealed to Supreme Court of Pakistan where she stated that this country was not a foreign country which had been invaded by any army with General Yahya khan as its head, nor was it an alien territory which had been occupied by the said army. Martial Law could not have arisen in the circumstances. Pakistan had its own legal doctrine, Holy Qur'an and the Objectives Resolution. Therefore, martial law was never superior to the Constitution. Supreme Court further held that Yahya khan was neither a victor nor Pakistan was an occupied territory and thus declared him a 'usurper' and all his actions were also declared illegal. When Asma Jilani case's judgment was released, Yahya Khan was not in power and it was then Bhutto's Martial Law and he was the civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator and the President. Asma Jilani's case paved the way for the restoration of democracy in the country. This case was followed by the interim Constitution of 1972 and then by the permanent Constitution of 1973.

The film stars Ritesh Deshmukh, Amitabh Bachchan, Jacqueline Fernandez (in her film debut) and Sanjay Dutt. The film received mixed reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office. Backstory Long ago, Ringmaster (Sanjay Dutt) was once a genie, but he used his powers only for himself, not to grant wishes to humans, so the other genies decided to strip him of his powers. He was still immortal, however, and still possessed great strength and knowledge. He vowed to regain his powers someday and get his revenge. Kasim has a strange fixation on Aladin and constantly teases him about his name, bringing him oil lamps, forcing him to rub them, and taunting him when no genie appears. He has always done this, ever since he and Aladin were both children. Aladin's grandfather taught him a magic trick: he can put a small object in his hand, close it, say the magic words \\"Tak Dhina Dhin,\\" and open his hand to reveal a different small object. It is not real magic; he's secretly transferred the object to his other hand. It is entertaining, though, and sometimes useful. Genies have certain rules they must abide by. First of all, there is the well-known three wishes rule: whoever rubs the genie's lamp and summons the genie gets three wishes. Also, a genie may not harm anyone who possesses either their lamp or any part of it --- this protects Ringmaster, because he still has the piece that broke off Genius's lamp. If a genie refuses to grant a wish, he loses his powers and becomes mortal. There is also some sort of code of ethics that genies must abide by, stating that genies must use their powers to grant wishes to humans and not use them selfishly‚Äîthis is not a magical rule like the others, but it is enforced by genie society. It is possible for genies to band together and take away a misbehaving genie's powers. It is unstated how many genies there are in existence and how many of them are free to do as they please, or whether they are mostly confined to lamps. There is a magical mirror that genies can use to obtain information and answer questions they have. It can be broken, but if its pieces are reassembled, it returns to its original flawless shape. A human had just found and reassembled the mirror when Ringmaster and his gang killed him and stole it. There appears to be a magical comet that approaches Earth once every million years. Its magic can restore an ex-genie's power, although what else it may be able to do is unknown. Ringmaster originally plans to wish for Genius to transport him to the comet, but after Genius also loses his powers, Ringmaster changes his plan, because he knows that the comet's reflection will work just as well. Aladin handles the comet's reflection only briefly, but it seems to have granted him some sort of magic power as well, although the extent of this power is unclear. Genius turns Aladin's guitar into a colorful frog that makes guitar-like sounds; it remains a frog for the rest of the film. Plot The film opens with the family of archeologist Arun Chatterjee, who lives with his wife, Riya, and baby son, Aladin. When out on a holiday, Arun is attacked by a gang searching for a magic lamp, which Chatterjee has found, but has hidden somewhere. Arun and Riya Chatterjee are murdered; Aladin is raised by his grandfather. After his granddad's death, a now grown-up Aladin Chatterjee (Ritesh Deshmukh) lives in the fictional city of Khwaish(wish). He is lonely, and Kasim (Sahil Khan) and his gang members have bullied Aladin since his childhood. His life changes when Jasmine (Jacqueline Fernandez) enters the city, and Aladin immediately falls for her. Jasmine has a birthday party for Aladin, and as a present Kasim gives Aladin a magic lamp for his birthday to embarrass him in front of Jasmine. However, this lamp turns out to be the magic lamp that Aladin's father's murderers were trying to find. Aladin rubs the lamp and releases the genie, Genius (Amitabh Bachchan). Desperate to grant him three wishes so his contract with the magic lamp can end, the rock-star Genius suddenly makes Aladin's life very interesting but chaotic. Aladin does not want to make any wishes, but Genius enters Aladin's dreams and finds out what he wants, getting his sleeping mind to make a wish: to make Jasmine fall in love with him. When he wakes up, he does not like what Genius has done and uses his second wish to return Jasmine to normal. His third wish is for Genius to help him woo Jasmine without using magic to make it happen. Genius does his best, but magic is really his strong suit. Still, as a result of Genius's help/interference, Aladin stands up to Kasim and starts a relationship with Jasmine, and Genius teaches Kasim a lesson. Aladin's future looks perfect, until the real threat looms on the horizon - the ex-genie, Ringmaster (Sanjay Dutt). Ringmaster is searching for the magic lamp and kidnaps Jasmine with the help of his circus gang. Shortly after Genius and Aladin realize she has been kidnapped, an informer (really Ringmaster in disguise) tells Aladin that it was Genius who murdered his parents. Aladin insults Genius and tells him to leave. Heartbroken, Genius goes to rescue Jasmine alone. As he arrives, it is revealed that Ringmaster is the one who actually killed Aladin's family, as he has been searching for the magic lamp for a long time; Aladin's parents found it first, and Ringmaster punished them for it. Ringmaster steals the magic lamp and wishes for Genius to kill Aladin, but Genius refuses to do it, and loses his magic because he did not grant the wish, just as Ringmaster had planned. Aladin learns that Genius is innocent and arrives to help him, and they succeed in rescuing Jasmine. Ringmaster's plan is then completely revealed: he plans to perform a ritual to steal the reflection of an approaching comet, getting back his genie powers as a result. Genius, Aladdin and Jasmine intervene, and Aladdin steals the comet's reflection, giving genie powers back to Genius instead of Ringmaster. Genius seals Ringmaster inside a mirror and then shatters it, defeating him. The Ringmaster's gang is also defeated. In the end, the trio happily gets back to the city, Aladin and Jasmine are a couple, and after earning special superpowers from the comet, Aladin gives Kasim yet another lesson.

Reception Zoom TV gave the film 2.5/5, stating \\"Aladin fails to enchant\\". They have also criticized that Jacqueline has been put in the cast for the sake of an actress and she has not got much to do. However, according to the scale 2.5/5 is an average. Amitabh Bachchan was praised for his performance as \\"Genius.\\" Entertainment Daily has given the verdict saying that \\"Aladin is surely a let down.\\" Nonetheless they have praised the special- effects used in the film. Noyon Jyoti Parasara from AOL India praised the SFX but also pointed out, \\"Despite a good enough story to carry the film ahead, Aladin falls due to blunders in screenplay. Attempts to rush up things and add entertainment make the story go haywire.\\" He rated the film 2 out of 5. Rajeev Masand of IBN Live gave the film 3 stars and noticed the movie bought fable to life. Box office Aladin did not perform well at the box office either. Its lifetime gross was 135 million with the budget not being recovered.

A left-handed pitcher, he spent parts of the 1956 and 1957 seasons as a member of the Chicago White Sox. Derrington first appeared in semi-professional baseball at age 13 and was a high school star at age 16 as a hitter and a pitcher, winning a local player of the year award. Graduating at an early age, he signed with the White Sox for one of the largest bonuses of his time in 1956. Under the bonus rule of the time, he joined the White Sox immediately and went on to start their final game of the 1956 season, becoming the youngest pitcher to do so in the 20th century, and stayed with the team throughout the 1957 campaign. Sent back to the minor leagues in 1958, Derrington suffered an elbow injury that ultimately ended his professional career before age 22. Family and early life Derrington was born on November 29, 1939 in Compton, California. His father, Charles, played Minor League Baseball in the Cleveland Indians organization. An uncle, Herman Reich, had a 17-year professional career that included one year in the major leagues. When Derrington was 13, he pitched alongside his father in semi-pro baseball. Derrington entered high school early, a result of having skipped two grades during his elementary school years, but nevertheless had a successful amateur career. As a 16-year-old senior in 1956, he was named Los Angeles City player of the year during a season where he recorded an earned run average (ERA) of 0.23 and also had a batting average of .452. Derrington's success drew the attention of many scouts, as well as Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, who ruled that Derrington needed to pitch in American Legion Baseball before signing a professional contract. He spent the summer playing on a team playing first base, as his father did not let him pitch. At season's end, Derrington was approached by White Sox owner Chuck Comiskey, at the recommendation of scout Hollis Thurston and signed him on September 10. The team announced him as having received a $50,000 bonus, though in reality the real amount was much higher at $78,000, at that time the second-largest, and ultimately the fourth-largest, bonus given during the years of the bonus rule in Major League Baseball. Major league career Because of the size of his bonus, rules of the time required Derrington to stay on the major league roster for the next two calendar years. He was not used by the White Sox until the season finale on September 30, when he was given a start against the Kansas City Athletics. In the process, he became the youngest pitcher in major leagues to start a game since the start of the 20th century at an age of 16 years and 306 days, a distinction he still holds, with only Willie McGill in 1890 starting a game a younger age in a recognized major league. Starting against George Brunet, Derrington allowed three runs in the first two innings, but kept the game tied through the next three. In the fourth inning, Derrington recorded his first career hit, a single off of reliever Bill Harrington, becoming the youngest player in American League history to record a base hit, a record that he still owns. He was ultimately unable to score. In the sixth inning, he allowed three runs on a pair of home runs, a solo homer from Vic Power and a two-run shot to Lou Skizas. In the seventh inning, Larry Doby pinch hit for Derrington with the White Sox trailing 6-3. Despite a late rally, Chicago lost seven to six and Derrington took the loss in the game. In a 1957 preview of the major league season, Derrington was described by Sports Illustrated as a \\"17-year-old whiz of a bonus pitcher\\". He had a successful spring training with the White Sox that year, but did not make his first appearance with the White Sox until June 1. Over the course of the season, Derrington appeared in 20 games, starting five of them, recording a 4.86 ERA. He was credited with one decision, a loss against the Detroit Tigers on September 25. In his two longest outings for the year, he was on pace for a victory only for the bullpen to cost him the win. Facing the Cleveland Indians on July 7, he pitched five innings of relief and only allowed one hit, and left the game with the White Sox leading eight to six, only for Paul LaPalme to allow the Indians to tie with two runs in the ninth. Over a month later, on August 10, he was given a starting assignment against the Detroit Tigers where he pitched in seven innings and allowed two runs, leaving with a three to two lead before Billy Pierce allowed four runs in the ninth. Though he did not record a regular season victory, he did get credited with the win in the exhibition Hall of Fame Game that year. Minor league career Before the 1958 season started, the bonus rule was rescinded, as was the requirement for such players affected by the rule to be kept on a major league roster. Derrington, who would have been required to stay on the roster for much of 1958 had the rule stayed in place, was subsequently sent to the Indianapolis Indians, Chicago's Triple-A club, of the American Association. Derrington spent four games with Indianapolis, then went down to Chicago's Single-A team, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Western League, winning ten games but recording a high ERA of 7.06. The 1959 season saw Derrington play with a new Single-A affiliate, the Charleston ChaSox of the South Atlantic League. Again, he won 10 games; this time with an ERA of 3.68. He also made an appearance that year with the Triple-A Sacramento Solons. Derrington went into spring training in 1960 with the Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres. While pitching in a game that spring, he suffered a major injury, tearing all of the tendons and ligaments in his elbow. Derrington continued to play in the minors that year as a position player, most of which was spent back at Charleston. He began to throw off-speed pitches through weight training and, by 1961, he had returned to pitching. Sent to the Class B Lincoln Chiefs of the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League, Derrington pitched with some success, going 7-5 with a 3.47 ERA. Moved up to the Double-A Mobile Bears of the Southern Association, he pitched less successfully, giving up 12 earned runs in 10 innings. At age 21, this was Derrington's final minor league season, as attempted to find a baseball-related job in 1962 failed. Later life Derrington went on work at his father's appliance store upon retiring, then took over the business when his father died in 1968. He sold the business in 1979, then worked in produce for 10 years before seeking baseball-related work in 1989. In 1991, Derrington worked as a coach for Fullerton Union High School's baseball team and was their manager in the summer leagues. Later, he was the manager of the Pacific Suns of the independent Western Baseball League for the first half of the 1998 season. Derrington died on March 12, 2020.

It grows in subalpine and alpine climates in moist areas in rocky habitat, such as talus that retains patches of snow year-round. Most specimens grow on north-facing slopes with little surrounding vegetation.Halford, A. S. and R. S. Nowak. (1996). Distribution and ecological characteristics of Lewisia longipetala (Piper) Clay, a high-altitude endemic plant Great Basin Naturalist 56:3 225-36. The plant thrives in the snow, growing largest and most densely in areas of high snowpack and becoming easily water-stressed when far away from areas with snow. This is a perennial herb growing from a slender taproot and caudex unit. It produces a basal rosette of many thin but fleshy leaves 3 to 6 centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of several flowers on short stalks. Each flower has around 8 petals each between 1 and 2 centimeters long, pinkish in color, and tipped with a resin gland similar to those on the edges of the bracts and two small sepals.

History The Aroney post office was established in 1890. It has been since been discontinued. The community's name was incorrectly spelled \\"Arona\\" on the 1966 USGS Base Maps.Foscue, Virginia. Place Names in Alabama. University: U of Alabama Press, 1989. Ever since, the misspelling has been duplicated on many other maps and geographical databases. The spelling continues to be used by the USGS, which lists \\"Aroney\\" as a variant spelling. Conversely, \\"Aroney\\" is the name of the post office in the USGS database. People The people of Aroney, Alabama are historically farmers. They grew cotton during the 1950s and 1960s, but like many others when the cost of growing cotton outweighed the value of the cotton once it was picked, Aroney farmers shifted to growing soybeans and corn. Many of the farmers, at the urging of the state agricultural department, fenced in their fields and started raising cattle. The town never got big enough to require even a single stop light. For some period of time, there was a flashing light that was then downgraded to a 4-way stop intersection and finally to a through fare. Life doesn't get too complicated in towns like Aroney. It's a reminder of a middle America that existed long ago. These are a people that, until the last 20 years, the majority were related in some way. Traditional surnames like Camp, Scott, Walker, Davis, and Downs are the names you see on mailboxes in this rural community. The area never grew large enough to justify a school system. But until the very early 70s, there was a small school called Center Point Junior High School. When built, the school housed classrooms for grades 1‚Äì9, but as time went on it was downgraded to grades 1-6 and eventually closed in 1976. Today, all that stands as a reminder of the school is the front doorsteps and the lunchroom. Geography Aroney is located at . Its average elevation is above sea level.

The Shen-kuang-szu Incident (Chinese: Á•ûÂÖâÂØ∫‰∫ã‰ª∂; Pinyin: Sh√©nguƒÅngs√¨ Sh√¨ji√†n; Foochow Romanized: S√¨ng-gu≈èng-s√™ S√™Ã§uÃ§-gi√¥ng) was a series of events that took place between 1850 and 1851 in Fuzhou, China and was marked as one of the earliest conflicts between local Chinese and foreign Protestant missionaries. It began in June 1850 when two English missionaries rented rooms in a temple known as the Shen- kuang-szu on Wu-shih-shan within the walled city of Fuzhou. In the months that followed, local Chinese gentry and officials attempted in various ways to evict the missionaries from the hill, but all their efforts apparently failed. The controversy was settled the following year in October with the terms of the agreement stating that the missionaries were allowed to stay behind. This led to great discontentment amongst the local gentry and eventually foreshadowed yet another more important missionary incident - the 1878 Wu- shih-shan Case. Background Zhongzhou Island, ca. 1850 Following the footsteps of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) and the Methodist Episcopal Mission (MEM), the English Church Missionary Society established a mission at Fuzhou during the spring of 1850.Doolittle, Justus (1865), Social Life of the Chinese, Vol. 1 During first few days since their arrival they resided temporarily on Zhongzhou Island (), together with their American predecessors. As the Methodists had moved south of the River Min and the ABCFM northwards into the Nantai, the CMS missionaries, Robert David Jackson and William Welton, decided to seek assistance from the British consulate to secure premises within the walled city (which is located within the present day Gulou District). They considered Wu-shih-shan (‰πåÁü≥Â±±; Black Stone Hill), the tallest hill of Fuzhou, to be the most desirable site not only because the British consulate had been located there for years already but also because, living on the hill, they would \\"never go out or come in without being occasionally reminded of the vastness\\"Stock, Eugene (1890), The Story of Fuh-Kien Mission of the Church Missionary Society of their work. The Incident Tian Xiang Tai (Â§©È¶ôÂè∞), the former site of Shen-kuang-szu When Jackson and Welton brought with them a letter from the bishop of Hong Kong to the Consul in June 1850, expressing their desire to reside within the city, Dr. William Raymond Gingell, who was the then consular interpreter in Fuzhou, provided assistance. Having formerly been informed about the availability of a temple on Wu-shih-shan called Shen-kuang-szu (), Gingell arranged a meeting with the county magistrate Xinglian () to discuss about its rental opportunities. Without putting much detailed thought into the matter, Xinglian placed his seal on the agreement. The Chinese, however, were not pleased with the outcome of the meeting, protesting that foreigners other than consular officers should not be permitted to reside within the walled city. Two days after the conclusion of the rental agreement, Gingell began receiving urgent communications from Xinglian and other Chinese officials requesting to undo the rental agreement at Shen-kuang-szu. Gingell refused, taking the position that foreigners had the Treaty rights to reside within the city, and that the magistrate himself had already placed his seal on the agreement. By the time the missionaries had moved into the Shen-kuang-szu premises, the tensions soon escalated to a large outburst of protesting amongst the students and gentry which lasted for weeks. This protest took many forms: a public letter from the gentry and people of Fuzhou to the British consular officers, petitions to the Qing government, public meetings, the posting of placards and the publication of pamphlets, and even harassment and threats of violence. The Governor of Hong Kong Sir George Bonham informed the Chinese government that he would not ask the missionaries to leave the city, and that the Fuzhou authorities should be held responsible for their safety. On August 30, 1850, British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston also gave approval to the actions of the British officers in China regarding this matter.Carlson, Ellsworth C. (1974), The Foochow Missionaries 1847-1880 The Fuzhou authorities were then in a dilemma: on one hand, to compromise with the foreigners was to add fuel to the flames of xenophobia and enrage the common people who might carry out further violence; on the other hand, to deny the foreigners what they considered as their treaty rights could also provoke Great Britain into using military force to settle the issue. On the handling of this case, great dissension existed amongst Chinese officials. The governor-general of Yun-Gui Lin Zexu (), who had then returned to his hometown in Fuzhou for retirement, played a key role amongst the native gentry in taking a strong position demanding that the foreigners be expelled by force. Such a proposal was never accepted, however, by the governor of Fujian Xu Jiyu () and the governor-general Liu Yunke (), who believed the issue could be settled in a peaceful manner. To avoid violent actions, Xu Jiyu and Liu Yunke sent soldiers to guard the temple premises, but they also discouraged people from going to the missionaries to listen to their preaching or seek medical care from them, and forbade any carpenters or masons from repairing the rather dilapidated temple, in the hope that the foreigners would themselves give up on the premises.Biography of Xu Jiyu In spite of these difficulties the missionaries refused to leave, believing that the Lord's work required their presence in the city. Tao-shan-kuan today Caught between the demands of the Fuzhou gentry and the stubbornness of the foreigners, Xu Jiyu offered the two English missionaries another temple on Wu- shih-shan known as Tao-shan-kuan () in November 1850. Tao-shan-kuan had at one stage been rented as a residence for the interpreter of the British consulate, and this had not been objected to by the Fuzhou gentry. By December 13 Welton had decided to accept the exchange, and by January 21, 1851 the two missionaries relinquished Shen-kuang-szu. Meanwhile, Lin Zexu, together with other Chinese officials outside of Fuzhou, submitted official memorials to the Qing court criticizing the Fuzhou officials for their mishandling of the Shen- kuang-szu Case. These memorials especially accused Xu Jiyu of favoring the foreigners and thwarting the will of the common people rather than siding with them to resist the foreigners, which aroused the wrath of the Xianfeng Emperor. On October 30, 1850 an edict was issued ordering the dismissal of Xinglian. Xu Jiyu was reprimanded in January 1851 and relieved from office by June. Consequences With Xu Jiyu having placed his official seal on the Tao-shan-kuan rental agreement, Fuzhou became the first Chinese treaty port (before Guangzhou) in which Protestant missionaries were eventually permitted to reside within the walled city. During the next three decades Wu-shih-shan had been the mission center of the Church Missionary Society in Fujian. Although the controversy of the Shen-kuang-szu Incident was supposedly settled in October 1851, a strong undercurrent of discontent still existed amongst the Chinese populace, leading to yet another larger-scale conflict in 1878 known as Wu-shih-shan Case that resulted in the final eviction of the English missionaries from the walled city of Fuzhou in 1880.

The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, administers FDPIR at the Federal level, and is locally operated through ITOs or State agencies(SAs).http://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/360 Eligibility for benefits is similar to the food stamp (SNAP) program, and funds are drawn from food stamp appropriations. Food Distribution Program Nutrition Education (FDPNR) grants are also awarded to participating FDPIR ITOs. These grants are awarded to support nutrition education activities that are culturally relevant, promoting healthy food choices, and promoting physical activity among participants.https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program&mode;=form&tab;=core&id;=bab168f6a3065aa9aa6e1188bc2e22a3. 100 tribal organizations and 5 State agencies receive funding to administer the FDPIR. This supports approximately 276 tribes in receiving the programs benefits. The approximate number of people served by this program monthly in Federal Fiscal Year 2014 totaled to 85,400 individuals. Tribes do not compete with other entities for funding from the program, nor is there a recurring base fund for tribes.http://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/360 FDPIR is one of 15 nutrition assistance programs administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, which also works with the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs, and the Summer Food Service Program.http://www.fns.usda.gov/pressrelease/2015/fns-0006-15 Foods contained in packages include frozen and/or canned meats and poultry, canned and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, dry cereals, cornmeal, flour, butter, macaroni, cheese, evaporated and UHT lowfat milk, oats, peanuts and peanut butter, cereals, and oils. According to a 2008 USDA FNS report on the Health Eating Index [HEI] of foods provided in FDPIR, \\"Individuals consuming FDPIR foods in the quantities provided would achieve a HEI-2005 score of 81 out of 100, considerably better than Americans in general (58 out of 100) and SNAP participants (52 out of 100). \\" The majority of the foods provided in this program are either frozen or canned, which require substantial food preparation, cooking experience, and education on designing a balanced diet. This program does not provide fresh produce, including vegetables and fruits. For households dependent on FDPIR, individual recipients may be susceptible to developing additional health consequences due to the absence of fresh produce in their diet.  Eligibility  American Indians who are classified as being low-income and non-Indians who reside on a reservation, and individuals in households living in approved areas near a reservation or in Oklahoma that contain at least one person who is a member of a federally recognized tribe, are eligible to participate in FDPIR. Applicants may be required to provide documents including but not limited to: pay check stubs, Social Security, SSI benefits, TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), General Assistance, VA (Veterans benefits), Pensions or retirement benefits, Unemployment or Workers Compensation benefits, Child Support or Alimony, Dependent Care Expenses, and/or bank account statements. Households are certified based on income and non-financial standards determined by the Federal government, and must be recertified at least every 12 months. Elderly and disabled households may be certified for up to 24 months. Income standards vary by household size and are based on 100% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines adjusted by the applicable SNAP standard deduction. Households must be re-certified at least every 12 months, but elderly and disabled households may be certified for up to 24 months. Households may not participate in FDPIR and SNAP in the same month.http://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/360  Evaluation  According to the USDA's evaluation of the FDPIR, half of local FDPIR programs serve fewer than 250 households per month. The average administrative costs per household ranged from $614 (small programs) to $287 among large programs. Federal regulations do not require local FDPIR programs to offer extensive nutrition education services to program participants. Of those programs evaluated, over 25% reported no nutrition education budget.http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/FDPIREval_Summary_0.pdf The FDPIRs design places a large responsibility on individual participants to create and prepare a nutritious diet from the foods provided. Participants are responsible for selecting their foods, developing cooking skills, and designing meals that constitute a nutritious diet.http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/FDPIREval_Summary_0.pdf In order for the success of the FDPIR to be accurately measured, additional and extensive research must be conducted.

According to surviving coinage, Ininthimeus appeared to have been a religious person who was involved in the worship of the Goddess Aphrodite and her cult. He also represents himself on coins as the goddess Astarte. During the Ininthimeus‚Äô reign, the intrusion of the Goths created great pressure on the Bosporan Kingdom.

It was first published as the New Testament under the name Good News for Modern Man in 1966. It was anglicised into British English by the British and Foreign Bible Society with the use of metric measurements for the Commonwealth market. It was formerly known as Today's English Version (TEV), but in 2001 was renamed the Good News Translation in the U.S., because the American Bible Society wished to improve the GNB's image as a translation where it had a public perception as a paraphrase. Despite the official terminology, it is still often referred to as the Good News Bible in the United States. It is a multi-denominational translation, with editions used by many Christian denominations. It is published by HarperCollins, a subsidiary of News Corp. Beginnings The beginnings of the Good News Bible can be traced to requests made by people in Africa and the Far East for a version of the Bible that was easier to read. In 1961, a home missions board also made a request for the same type of translation. Besides these requests, the GNB was born out of the translation theories of linguist Eugene Nida, the Executive Secretary of the American Bible Society's Translations Department. In the 1960s, Nida envisioned a new style of translation called Dynamic equivalence. That is, the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek would be expressed in a translation \\"thought for thought\\" rather than \\"word for word\\". The dynamic theory was inspired by a Spanish translation for Latin American native peoples. The American Bible Society, impressed with Nida's theories, decided to use them. Due to these requests and Nida's theories, Robert BratcherRobert Bratcher obituary (who was at that time a staffer at the American Bible Society) did a sample translation of the Gospel of Mark. This later led to a translation of the full New Testament. The result, titled Good News for Modern Man: The New Testament in Today's English Version, was released in 1966 as a 599-page paperback with a publication date of January 1, 1966. It received a mass marketing effort with copies even being made available through grocery store chains. The New Testament would see second, third, and fourth editions released in 1967, 1971, and 1976, respectively.http://bibles.wikidot.com/tev The Psalms were published in 1970 as The Psalms For Modern Man in Today's English Version. Other portions of the Old Testament began to appear over the course of the 1970s - Job in 1971, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes in 1972, Jonah in 1973, Ruth, Hosea, Amos, and Micah in 1974, and Exodus in 1975.http://bibles.wikidot.com/tev In 1976, the Old Testament was completed and published as the Good News Bible: The Bible in Today's English Version. In 1979, the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books were added to the Good News Bible and published as Good News Bible: Today's English Version with Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha and also later published as part of subsequent Catholic and Orthodox Editions. In 1992, the translation was revised with inclusive language. The Bible Societies released the Contemporary English Version in 1995, also using jargon-free English. While this translation is sometimes perceived as a replacement for the GNB, it was not intended as such, and both translations continue to be used. While the American Bible Society promotes both translations, the British and Foreign Bible Society and HarperCollins have since 2007 refocused their publishing efforts on the GNB including the Good News Bible iPhone App.www.goodnewsbible.com - Good News Bible iPhone App Popularity The GNB has been a popular translation used across multiple denominations of Christianity. By 1969, Good News for Modern Man had sold 17.5 million copies. By 1971, that number had swelled to 30 million copies. It has been endorsed by Billy Graham and several Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church in the United States (Today's English Version, Second Edition),USCCB Approved Translations of the Sacred Scriptures the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Presbyterian Church (USA). Excerpts from the New Testament were used extensively in evangelistic campaigns, such as the Billy Graham crusades and others, from the late 1960s right through to the early 1980s. In 1991, a Gallup poll of British parishioners showed that the GNB was the most popular Bible version in that nation. In 2003, the GNB was used as the basis for a film version of the Gospel of John.\\"Gospel of John\\" DVD/Videorecording End Credits. Philip Saville, Director. Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Burbank, CA: 2003. In 2008, Swedish group Illuminated World paired the text of the GNB with contemporary photography for the English translation of Bible Illuminated: The Book.Illuminated World: A Contemporary Bible Publication website Features The GNB is written in a simple, everyday language, with the intention that everyone can appreciate it, and so is often considered particularly suitable for children and for those learning English. There are introductions to each book of the Bible. Unlike most other translations, some editions of the GNB contain line drawings of biblical events with a snippet of text. The line drawings were done by Annie Vallotton (1915‚Äì2014). However, Vallotton is credited with doing the drawings only in certain editions of the GNB‚Äîin others, the drawings are simply credited to \\"a Swiss artist\\". Since the focus is strongly on ease of understanding, poetry is sometimes sacrificed for clarity. This choice can be seen in the example quotation of John 3:16, which is rendered, \\"For God loved the world so much that ‚Ä¶\\", which is more conversational than the familiar \\"For God so loved the world\\". The phrase contains a figurative, if not literal, translation: the Greek word for \\"so\\" in that passage is Œø·ΩïœÑœâœÇ,The New Greek-English Interlinear New Testament translated by Robert K. Brown and Philip W. Comfort, edited by J.D.Douglas translates Œø·ΩïœÑœâœÇ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ as \\"for~thus\\", where \\"~\\" indicates an inversion of Greek word order to make the interlinear rendering more readable (\\"for thus God loved the world\\") which likely means \\"in such a way\\" as well as \\"so much\\". Because the implication of the phrase \\"in such a way that he would sacrifice his only son\\" includes the implication of \\"so much\\" and could certainly not include the opposite \\"loved the world so little,\\" the translators chose the phrase \\"so much\\" for its brevity and clarity.

It had a population of 243,266 in 2016. The district has the most educated residents with the second highest income and the third lowest population due to its relatively small size. Central is the central business district and the core urban area of Hong Kong. Western District covers Shek Tong Tsui, Kennedy Town, Sai Ying Pun, parts of Lung Fu Shan. The district was part of City of Victoria, the earliest urban settlement in colonial Hong Kong. History Central District, as Victoria City, was the first area of planned urban development in Hong Kong during the colonial era. The British held a land sale in June 1841, six months after the flag was raised at Possession Point. A total of 51 lots of land were sold to 23 merchant houses to build offices and warehouses. The property buyers included Dent's, Jardine's, Russell's and Olyphant's. At the time, the two roads Albany Nullah (now Garden Road) and Glenealy Nullah (now Glenealy) were mainly used by the British. The streets later became known as Government Hill. In 1857, the British government expanded Victoria City and divided it into seven districts. Those located in present-day Central and Western are: Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Tai Ping Shan, Central. The area was essentially a European area until 1860 when Chinese merchants begin buying up European properties around Cochrane, Wellington and Pottinger Streets. The Central district was the principal European business district, hence the arrival of the first major bank HSBC. The Western district was the commercial centre for Chinese businesses. When property values in the district rose, a meeting was held in February 1866 to establish a \\"District Watch Force\\" to police and protect this specific area.Tsai Jung-fang. [1995] (1995).

Early life Lewis was the son of a concert pianist and an opera singer. In the mid-1940s he became an executive of the Blaine Thompson Advertising agency, where he created and produced, together with his wife, Mina Bess, the daily radio talk show Luncheon at Sardi's. Ed Sullivan In 1948 Lewis co-created the Toast of the Town program with Ed Sullivan. In 1955, the TV classic was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. Together with Sullivan, Lewis personally set the appearance time of each act for the show. On 9 September 1956, Elvis Presley appeared for the first time on the show, but on his third and last appearance on January 6, 1957 he was censored because the rumor had it that the rock'n'roll singer had been \\"hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\\"See Marlo Lewis and Mina Beth Lewis, Prime Time (1979), p.146. Therefore, Lewis and Sullivan decided to shoot the singer only from the waist up during this, his last performance on their show. Other shows Apart from this show, Lewis also helped to launch The Jackie Gleason Show, The Dinah Shore Show and The Phil Silvers Show. After 12 years, he left the Sullivan Show in order to set up an independent production company. One of his first projects was the ballet The Nutcracker for an ABC Christmas special in 1961. In the mid-1960s, he produced several musical specials for Perry Como. In 1967, Lewis joined the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency and was elected vice chairman a year later. Publication In 1979, he published, together with his wife, a book entitled Prime Time which includes many backstage stories from the author's times as a producer. Awards Lewis was also a founder of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Both Lewis and Sullivan shared the George Foster Peabody Award for humanitarian activities. In 1992, Lewis was elected to the Television Producers Hall of Fame. Death In 1993, he died of heart failure at a hospital in Palm Springs, California.

It was described by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1829. The description was part of the second edition of Le R√®gne Animal, or The Animal Kingdom. Guachanche barracuda are also known simply as guaguanche throughout much of the Caribbean. When used for food, Guaguanche barracuda are usually sold fresh or salted. Description Guachanche barracuda, like other members of the family Sphyraenidae, possess elongated bodies, pike-like heads, and large jaws. The lower jaw protrudes slightly from the upper jaw, both of which contain fang- like teeth. They have two dorsal fins, which are widely separated on their backs. The anterior dorsal fin usually possesses spines, while the posterior only has rays. Guachanche barracuda have six dorsal spines and 9 rays, while they have only two spines and eight rays on their anal fins.

Early life He was born in Schleswig, Federal Republic of Germany in 1967. W√∂lk started piano training at the age of seven. His classical music teachers and professors were Kevin McKenna (Dublin, Ireland), Hartmut Leistritz (conservatory of Lubeck), Eliza Hansen (conservatory of Hamburg), and Gunther Daubler (conservatory of Wurzburg). His jazz improvisation teachers were Walter Norris, Dieter Glawischnig, Richie Beirach, Philip Catherine, John Taylor, Fred Hersch, and Barry Harris. After graduating from high school in 1987 he studied historical and systematic musicology at the university of Hamburg and later in the mid-1990s at the Humboldt University in Berlin. From 1988 to 1994 he studied classical piano at the conservatories in Hamburg and Lubeck. 1994 he graduated as a concert pianist and music pedagogue. In 1995 W√∂lk moved to Berlin and continued working as a pianist, composer, arranger, bandleader and accompanist mostly in classical and jazz musical genres. Silent films A couple of his works for German films have been released on DVD by New York-based company Kino. Secrets of a Soul by G. W. Pabst from 1926 with Werner Krauss was released in 2008 and The Finances of the Grand Duke by Murnau. With the silent movie music trio Blanc Et Noir he also performed at the Palais Royal Des Beaux Arts in Brussels, accompanying silent short comedies. In the summer of 2019 W√∂lk presented his new original quartet composition for the classic German film Madame DuBarry (Ernst Lubitsch, 1919) during the open-air summer festival of UFA Filmn√§chte in Berlin. Recordings He has seven albums released as a bandleader, composer and arranger in Germany and Italy: * Songs, Chorals and Dances (2005, Nabel Records) * Reflections on Mozart (2006, Nabel Records) * Desire for Spring (2007, Splasch Records) * Homage To Nino Rota (2008, Splasch Records) * The Berlin Album (2011, Jazzwerkstatt Records): Presents several of W√∂lk's compositions from his Berlin suite, as well as new arrangements of tunes by Mendelssohn, Weill, Eisler and Holl√§nder. * Another Kind Of Faith (2017, Nabel Records): features W√∂lk's jazz arrangements of Protestant chorals by Luther, Walter, Sch√ºtz and J. S. Bach. * Pictures In Sounds (2019, Nabel Records): W√∂lk's latest album (released on CD and LP) with his own ensemble encompasses a collection of his original compositions from the last two decades. Compositions Among his most notable works as a composer, there are several large-scale suites for chamber music ensemble in the last ten years, combined with powerful segments of instrumental improvisation. The first of these compositions happened to be the epic six-movement suite Across The Border which was written in the summer of 2000. This piece is an elaborate attempt to catch an imaginary atmosphere and the basic emotional experience of perpetual motion in travelling through a vast, wild and unexplored continent, musically alternating between tightly arranged ensemble parts and vigorously executed jazz-influenced improvisations. The collection of compositions under the title \\"Pictures in Sounds\\" (1999‚Äì2019) include numbers inspired by non- musical motifs from literature and visual arts, mostly written for piano trio, saxophone and cello. In the winter of 2004, Ekkehard W√∂lk was invited for a composer\`s residency in Ahrenshoop. During that time he worked on the four- part Berlin suite called \\"People on Sunday\\" (Babylon Revisited) for septet including violin, alto sax, trombone and clarinet besides the regular piano trio in which he musically depicts the course of life on a Sunday in contemporary Berlin from sunrise to sunset. The suite is structurally inspired by the silent movie by Robert Siodmak and Billy Wilder, Menschen Am Sonntag (1929). In June 2004 W√∂lk was invited for another composer\`s residency in Toronto, Ontario. While taking part in the Gibraltar Point Artists' Residency, he composed a vast 18-part song cycle called \\"Book of images\\" based upon early poems by Rainer Maria Rilke (1875‚Äì1926) from his publication The Book of Images. Some extracts from these suites have been frequently performed by the Ekkehard W√∂lk Trio in the past years and have also been recorded live by Deutschlandradio Kultur, Radio Berlin- Brandenburg and Bayerischer Rundfunk M√ºnchen. Festival appearances His notable festival appearances include the Bachfest Leipzig, the Mozartfest W√ºrzburg where he delivered piano solo renditions of famous classical Mozart songs and arias, the International Jazz Festival in New Delhi, Russia (at the Glinka Hall Philharmonic and the Mariinsky Theatres) in St. Petersburg, and also in various European countries including Norway, Estonia, Czech Republic, Belgium and Italy.

Overview The novel is both bizarre and allegorical, detailing the discovery and ascent of a mountain, which can only be perceived by realising that one has travelled further in traversing it than one would by travelling in a straight line, and can only be viewed from a particular point when the sunrays hit the earth at a certain angle.Ren√© Daumal, Mount Analogue: a novel of symbolically authentic non-Euclidean adventures in mountain climbing, Boston: Shambhala, 1992, p.14. > \\"Its summit must be inaccessible, but its base accessible to human beings as > nature made them. It must be unique and it must exist geographically. The > door to the invisible must be visible.\\" Daumal died before the novel was completed, providing an uncanny one-way quality to the journey. Father Sogol ‚Äì the \\"Logos\\" spelled backwards ‚Äì is the leader of the expedition‚Äîthe expedition to climb the mysterious mountain that unites Heaven and Earth. Mount Analogue was first published posthumously in 1952 in French as Le Mont Analogue. Roman d'aventures alpines, non euclidiennes et symboliquement authentiques. In 1959 it was published in English translation by Vincent Stuart Ltd. The book was one of the sources of the cult film The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky. The novel also marks the first use of the word \\"peradam\\" in literature, an object that is revealed only to those who seek it.Ren√© Daumal, \\"Our Money Has No Value - On the Foothills of Mount Analogue\\" > \\"One finds here, very rarely in the low lying areas, more frequently as one > goes farther up, a clear and extremely hard stone that is spherical and > varies in size‚Äîa kind of crystal, but a curved crystal, something > extraordinary and unknown on the rest of the planet. Among the French of > Port-des-Singes, it is called peradam. Ivan Lapse remains puzzled by the > formation and root meaning of this word. It may mean, according to him, > \\"harder than diamond,\\" and it is; or \\"father of the diamond,\\" and they say > that the diamond is in fact the product of the degeneration of the peradam > by a sort of quartering of the circle or, more precisely, cubing of the > sphere. Or again, the word may mean \\"Adam's stone,\\" having some secret and > profound connection to the original nature of man. The clarity of this stone > is so great and its index of refraction so close to that of air that, > despite the crystal's great density, the unaccustomed eye hardly perceives > it. But to anyone who seeks it with sincere desire and true need, it reveals > itself by its sudden sparkle, like that of dewdrops. The peradam is the only > substance, the only material object whose value is recognized by the guides > of Mount Analogue. Therefore, it is the standard of all currency, as gold is > for us.\\" Daumal compares art and alpinism in this novel, saying:Ren√© Daumal, The Art of Climbing Mountains > Alpinism is the art of climbing mountains by confronting the greatest > dangers with the greatest prudence. Art is used here to mean the > accomplishment of knowledge in action. You cannot always stay on the > summits. You have to come down again... So what's the point? Only this: what > is above knows what is below, what is below does not know what is above. > While climbing, take note of all the difficulties along your path. During > the descent, you will no longer see them, but you will know that they are > there if you have observed carefully. There is an art to finding your way in > the lower regions by the memory of what you have seen when you were higher > up. When you can no longer see, you can at least still know. . . Some of the paintings of the Spanish-Mexican painter, Remedios Varo, were used in the illustrations for the first edition of this novel, like Embroidering the Earth's Mantle and The Ascension of Mount Analog.

That day over 150 hotel workers walked out as a sign of protest against their poor working conditions. The strike was organized by Joseph James Ettor and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in conjunction with the Hotel Workers' International Union. At the height of the strike there were 54 hotels and 30 restaurants and other establishments without their staff. This amounted to 2,500 waiters, 1,000 cooks, and 3,000 other striking hotel workers. The strike continued through the rest of May but police began reprimanding protestors, making many of them go back to work. The strike officially ended on June 25, 1912. Rise of Strike On May 7, 1912, a group of 150‚Äì300 waiters and other hotel staff walked out in the middle of a meal service at the Belmont Hotel in New York City. Upon leaving the Belmont Hotel, workers held signs and communicated their demands to the public, before being dispersed by police. The main demands for the hotel workers were: left > One day off per week, > A higher minimum wage, > :$10 a week for established waiters, :$7 a week for bus boys and porters, > :$5 a week for hotel maids, Sanitary lockers and restrooms for hotel > employees, > No fines for hotel workers who belonged to a union, > No unjust discrimination against employees due to union affiliation. After this initial walkout, many other hotel employees started following suit. The IWW then created the Hotel Workers‚Äô International Union. The next day the state labor employment bureau announced that the strike had ended, but the union announced that they were still on strike due to the unsatisfactory treatment of waiters who were union members. By May 15, 1912, around 150 employees from the Waldorf Astoria and the Vanderbilt also walked out to join the waiters‚Äô strike. On May 15 the a representative from the state labor employment bureau met with a member of the Hotel Workers' International Union to discuss the strike, and on May 17 a list of demands was created for the hotel workers. The New York Labor Bulletin stated that the union demanded one day off a week, a maximum ten-hour workday, sanitary lockers, overtime pay, and no fines for being a union member. On May 23, 1912, six of New York City's leading hotels with union affiliated employees had their thousands of waiters, bus boys, cooks, and other hotel staff walk out of their respective hotels. The union members scheduled to meet with the Hotel Men's Association on May 24, 1912, to discuss the terms of the end of the strike, however four days prior to the meeting the Hotel Men's Association cancelled stating that it could not meet due to a disturbance that happened at a union rally the previous Sunday. The IWW and the Hotel Workers' International Union Striking waiters at headquarters, May 31, 1912. In 1912 the IWW had been very successful in its organizing, and created the Hotel Workers' International Union. Before the IWW became involved in the 1912 New York City waiters' strike, the only union in place for hotel workers was the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, which had about 2,000 members, most of whom were bartenders in local bars. Many waiters could not even afford the high membership dues that were required for the union, which effectively kept out lower-class workers who found themselves working in higher-class establishments. This union was originally going to fight against the Hotel Men's Association; however, it was very disorganized, had trouble mobilizing its members, and excluded many of the workers who wanted to participate in the strike. In an attempt to accommodate lower-class waiters, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union tried to make a waiter specific branch to their union called Local 5. However, when organizers continued to run into issues with the union attached to Local 5, another union was created by Joseph Estler, a former Local 5 organizer, in conjunction with the IWW to further the rights of hotel waiters and other hotel employees called the Hotel Workers' International Union. Joseph Ettor, a leader of the IWW took charge of the 1912 strike. But when the 1912 strike ultimately failed, the IWW withdrew their support leaving only a select few behind to help lead the Hotel Workers' International Union, mainly Ettor and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who led the 1913 New Year's strike for the union. Backlash By May 30, 1912, waiters and other hotel workers had left over 17 establishments, including Sherry's, Mouquin's, Vanderbilt, Waldorf, Prince George, Breslin, Rector's, the Hotel Knickerbocker, Bustanoby's, and the Plaza. Hotel owners continued to ignore the demands of the union members, stating that they would only deal with their workers when they came back on their own, without the union. Union members observed that higher-class eating and hotel establishments rarely ever accommodated outside labor organizations. By this time, the Hotel Workers‚Äô International Union was receiving major harassment from the police and media outlets. The Herald is quoted saying, ‚ÄúIt is inconceivable that any properly managed establishment could afford to do anything that would place the control of its servants in the hands of an irresponsible union‚Äù.New York Herald, June 4, 1912, 10; New York Times, June 1, 1912, 10; June 4, 1912, 10. The Hotel Men's Association refused to comply with the demands set by the union. Instead, they imported their labor from neighboring cities and colleges, and also began employing workers of color to fill the void left by the striking hotel workers. The president of the Hotel Men's Association stated that he would close all his hotels before succumbing to the demands of any organization. When union members heard that workers of color were coming to replace their jobs, they became allies with the Colored Waiters‚Äô Association. The Hotel Workers‚Äô International Union told the Hotel Men's Association that if they hired workers of color that they would only join the strike. However, many hotels had already started employing black males, such as the Plaza and the Majestic. End of strike Cartoon criticizes upright=.9 May brought the hotel workers' strike to its most rousing numbers, but it quickly began to dwindle in June. Since workers of color and local college students were hired as strikebreakers, many workers feared they would not have a job to return to and went back to the hotels, despite the poor working conditions. On June 11, 1912, the state labor bureau called a meeting between the Hotel Men's Association and the Hotel Workers' International Union to negotiate terms to end the strike, but the Hotel Men's Association ultimately refused to acknowledge them as a union. The strike ended soon after, on June 25, 1912, after many of the strikers had already gone back to work. Police had been showing brutality against strikers, deterring many from coming back to picket. In addition, management from various hotels had agreed to some of the demands of the union; however, they refused to recognize the union. This brought most of the workers back, to the detriment of the union itself. The more intense strikers found that they did not have a job to go back to since many were blacklisted from the industry. The entire strike, although only lasting from May 7, 1912 to June 25, 1912, cost 117,000 days in lost working time for hotel staff in New York City. This concluded the 1912 strike; however, hotel workers continued to strike in 1913, 1918, 1929, and 1934. Hotel workers did not receive adequate representation until the Hotel Trades Council (now the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council) was formed in 1938.

He taught at the University of Rochester before moving to his current post. As a historian, Knox has specialized in the political, military and diplomatic history of Europe in the late 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the two world wars and the emergence of dictatorship in the 1920s and 1930s.Biographical details from To the Threshold of Power, 1922/33, Cambridge University Press, 2007, i.

He is fluent in French, Italian and German.http://www2.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/m.knox@lse.ac.uk London School of Economics website Knox's most recent work, To the Threshold of Power, is a comparative study of the rise of Benito Mussolini and Fascism in Italy with that of Adolf Hitler and National Socialism in Germany. Knox argues that the origins of both dictatorships can be found in the late development of both countries as united states, their shared sense of grievance against the established European powers, Britain and France, and their common sense of frustration at the outcome of World War I (Germany's sense of undeserved defeat, and Italy's sense of unrewarded victory). He rejects Marxist views that Fascism and National Socialism were agents of, or represented the interests of, capitalism or big business, and he is highly critical of both the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Germany, whose revolutionary rhetoric, he argues, provoked middle-class support for Fascism and National Socialism. On the other hand, he argues that the leadership of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, from Friedrich Ebert to Otto Braun, was the strongest pillar of German democracy under the Weimar Republic. He sees the failure of democracy in Italy and Germany as ultimately caused by the desire of the armies in both countries for an authoritarian regime that would suppress the parties of the left and allow rearmament, and a foreign policy that would reverse the verdicts of 1918.To the Threshold of Power, 1922/33, Cambridge University Press, 2007, 399-406 Books * Mussolini Unleashed, 1939-1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War.

The hospital tower was completed in 1987. The building sits at the center of a campus, it rises approximately and 11 stories. It was designed by noted American architect Bertrand Goldberg, best known for the Marina City complex in Chicago. History Providence Hospital was founded in 1854 by the Daughters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland. Mobile's first bishop, Michael Portier, had asked the first four Sisters to come to Mobile in 1841 to care for orphans, following an outbreak of yellow fever. By 1852 the Sisters were under contract to administer the City Hospital of Mobile. This ended in 1854 when they resigned from the hospital. Their resignation came during a period of high anti-Catholic sentiment in the city, provoked by the local Know Nothing political movement. A board of local citizens was formed on August 15, 1854 to build a new hospital for the Sisters. They completed a new 60-bed hospital in 1855 at the intersection of Broad and St. Anthony Streets. In 1902 the facility moved to a new Mediterranean Revival structure on an Springhill Avenue campus. In 1904 they founded the second school of nursing to be established in Alabama. By the late 1940s the old 100-bed structure had been outgrown and a new building, in front of the old, was started in February 1949. The new 250-bed Modern-style structure was completed by October 1952. That structure was also outgrown by the 1980s. The Sisters decided to move the hospital to a site on the western boundary of the city. Bertrand Goldberg, known for his innovative hospital designs, was hired to design the new $60-million facility. It would be one of the last major hospital complexes designed by his firm.

It also prohibited the importation from any foreign country any animal-whole or in part, any product, or any egg belonging to a species on that list. Limited exceptions for scientific, educational, zoological, or propagational purposes and for certain cases of commercial \\"economic hardship\\" were allowed under strict permitting procedures. Lacey Act A predecessor to the Endangered Species Act of 1969, the Lacey Act of 1900, was the first in a long line of efforts by the United States government to preserve wildlife. Introduced by Iowa Congressman John F. Lacey in the House of Representatives in 1900 and signed into law by President William McKinley on May 25, 1900, it was originally \\"directed more at the preservation of game and wild birds by making it a federal crime to poach game in one state with the purpose of selling the bounty in another\\". Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 Peregrine falcon on rock The Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-669) was passed prior to the 1969 act, and set up a list of species native to the United States that qualified as endangered. The animals on this list were then afforded certain protections from the National Wildlife Refuge System. For example, the Endangered Species Preservation Act was in part dedicated to raising awareness of endangered species of birds like the peregrine falcon, and to \\"conserve, protect, restore, and propagate certain species of native fish and wildlife\\". Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969 Despite these protections, however, researchers found that the act was insufficient. This led to the passage of the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969. Characteristics of the Act Multiple images of reptiles The Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1969 was largely an expansion of the Lacey Act of 1900. In 1969, it was amended to protect species beyond game and wild birds. It granted protection to amphibians, reptiles, mollusks, and crustaceans, groups previously unprotected by any U.S. law. It also expanded the maximum punishment for poaching to a possible $10,000 and up to a year of jail time. In addition, it established two lists into which endangered species could be sorted, foreign and domestic. The act then allowed for species on the domestic list to be given extra protection by United States agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It also stated that species on the foreign endangered list could not be brought into the United States. The 1969 act further amended other existing laws to prohibit throughout the United States the sale or purchase by any person of any domestically endangered species or part or product thereof that was taken in any manner in violation of the laws or regulations of a state or foreign country. It also established the framework for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITIES which, \\"accords varying degrees of protection to more than 30,000 species of animals and plants, whether they are traded as live specimens, fur coats or dried herbs.\\" Finally, the 1969 Act authorized up to $15 million to be appropriated to acquire land for the purpose of conserving, protecting, restoring, or propagating any endangered species. Endangered Species Act of 1973 The Endangered Species Act of 1969 was only in effect for four years. It was soon replaced by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The 1973 act was signed into law by President Richard Nixon, and expanded the protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act of 1969. The act is administered by two federal agencies, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service(FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Pelagius (or Pelayo) of Oviedo (died 28 January 1153) was a medieval ecclesiastic, historian, and forger who served the Diocese of Oviedo as an auxiliary bishop from 1098 and as bishop from 1102 until his deposition in 1130 and again from 1142 to 1143. He was an active and independent-minded prelate, who zealously defended the privileges and prestige of his diocese. During his episcopal tenure he oversaw the most productive scriptorium in Spain, which produced the vast Corpus Pelagianum,A catalogue of the Corpus can be found in the Inventario General de Manuscritos de la Biblioteca Nacional, IV (Madrid: 1958), no. 1513, pp. 401‚Äì4. to which Pelagius contributed his own Chronicon regum Legionensium (\\"chronicle of the Kings of Le√≥n\\"). His work as a historian is generally reliable, but for the forged, interpolated, and otherwise skillfully altered documents that emanated from his office he has been called el Fabulador (\\"the Fabulist\\")According to Simon Barton and Richard A. Fletcher (2000), The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest (Manchester: Manchester University Press), p. 65 and n3, this comes from M. G. Mart√≠nez (1964), \\"Regesta de Don Pelayo, obispo de Oviedo,\\" Bolet√≠n del Instituto de Estudios Asturianos, 18:211‚Äì48. and the \\"prince of falsifiers\\".According to Barton and Fletcher, p. 70, the sobriquet was coined by Peter A. Linehan (1982), \\"Religion, Nationalism and National Identity in Medieval Spain and Portugal,\\" Religion and National Identity, ed. S. Mews, Studies in Church History, 18 (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 161‚Äì99, at p. 162. Linehan (1993) History and the Historians of Medieval Spain (Oxford), 78, also remarks that Pelagius \\"was a giant amongst falsifiers in an age which provided him with keen competition and ample opportunity.\\" It has been suggested that a monument be built in his honour in Oviedo.Vicente J. Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a, \\"El obispo don Pelayo, clave para el estudio de la historia de Asturias\\", El Basilisco, 8 (1979), 72‚Äì84. Life The date and place of Pelagius' birth are unknown. The Liber testamentorum includes a genealogy that suggests that Pelagius may have been related to the western Asturian families that founded the monasteries of Coria and Lapedo. He also made a donation to his own canons of properties he owned in Villamoros and Trobajuelo, near Le√≥n, suggesting perhaps a Leonese connexion.Barton and Fletcher, pp. 65‚Äì66. The earliest known reference to Pelagius is as a deacon at Oviedo in 1096. He was an archdeacon there in 1097. His consecration as the auxiliary of bishop Martin I took place on 29 December 1098.Bernard F. Reilly (1982), The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under Queen Urraca, 1109-1126 (Princeton: Princeton University Press), p. 32 n66. He succeeded Martin four years later, as the choice of Alfonso VI,Bernard F. Reilly (1988), The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under King Alfonso VI, 1065-1109 (Princeton: Princeton University Press), p. 14 and n1. and with vigour took up the defence of his church's properties and jurisdictions. The Archbishop of Toledo (1086), Bernard de Sedirac, sought to incorporate the sees of Oviedo, Le√≥n, and Palencia into his province as suffragans. In 1099 Pope Urban II gave the order. In 1104, Pelagius of Oviedo and Peter of Le√≥n went to Rome to plead their case to the new pope, Paschal II, who granted them a privilege of exemption and made them dependent directly on Rome (1105).Barton and Fletcher, p. 69. At the same time (1104), Pelagius engaged in lawsuits with the count Fernando D√≠az, the countess Enderquina Mu√±oz, and the abbot of Corias to maintain his rights of seignory within Asturias.Barton and Fletcher, pp. 67‚Äì68. He was also involved in jurisdictional battles with the neighbouring sees of Burgos (over Asturias de Santillana) and Lugo, and between 1109 and 1113 had to fight off the metropolitan claims of the Archdiocese of Braga as well. In 1121 the Archdiocese of Toledo successfully petitioned Pope Callistus II to remove Paschal's 1105 exemption, though this was regained in 1122. Pelagius was generally on good terms with Alfonso VI (died 1109) and his successor, Urraca (died 1126). After 1106 no new Count of Asturias was appointed and it seems that the title lapsed, while a castellan, a novus homo, with lesser authority replaced the last count. This was probably in the interests of Pelagius and his authority, since the county of Asturias corresponded to the centre of his diocese.Reilly (1982), pp. 286‚Äì87. The bishop gave Urraca political support against both her husband, Alfonso the Battler of Aragon, and her son, the future Alfonso VII, who was in conflict with his mother after 1110. She in turn made grants to Oviedo on three separate occasions, in 1112, 1118, and 1120 and Pelagius was the dominant Asturian at court, confirming fifteen royal charters during her reign.Reilly (1982), p. 221. Pelagius had a part in reconciling the queen and her son at a council of the realm in Sahag√∫n (1116). After Alfonso's accession he never recovered his importance, rarely appearing at the new king's court and never receiving a gift from him.On the relationship between Pelagius and Urraca, see Barton and Fletcher, p. 67. The grant of 1120 has been partially interpolated, cf. Reilly (1982), p. 79 and n107. The source for his r√¥le at Sahag√∫n is the Historia Compostelana, I.cxiii (in Enrique Fl√≥rez, ed., Espa√±a Sagrada, XX). Arca Santa of Oviedo may date to the episcopate of Pelagius, one of his many pious deceptions. In 1130 Pelagius was deposed by a synod held under Cardinal Humbert at Carri√≥n, along with Diego and Munio, bishops of Le√≥n and Salamanca, and the abbot of Samos, because they had opposed the marriage of Alfonso VII and Berenguela of Barcelona (1127) on grounds of consanguinity. Their deposition was politically motivated, engineered by Alfonso and the prelate Diego Gelm√≠rez.Barton and Fletcher, p. 66, citing Bernard F. Reilly (1978), \\"On Getting to be Bishop in Le√≥n-Castile: the 'Emperor' Alfonso VII and the Post-Gregorian Church,\\" Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History, 1:37‚Äì68, esp. pp. 48‚Äì51. During the last decades of the eleventh century and the first of the twelfth, Santiago de Compostela became one of the leading centres of pilgrimage among the Catholic faithful, aided by the efforts of its archbishop, Diego Gelm√≠rez. The rivalry between Pelagius and Diego can be seen in the former's attempt to establish Oviedo as a comparable destination for pilgrims, by expanding the cult of the relics of the Cathedral of San Salvador, most importantly the alleged Sudarium of Christ.S. Su√°rez Beltr√°n (1993), \\"Los or√≠genes y la expansi√≥n del culto a las reliquias de San Salvador de Oviedo,\\" Las peregrinaciones a Santiago de Compostela y San Salvador de Oviedo en la Edad Media, ed. J. I. Ru√≠z de la Pe√±a Solar (Oviedo), pp. 37‚Äì55, esp. pp. 46‚Äì51, has yet to be consulted. He has even been credited with the creation of the Arca Santa to house his cathedral's relics.Julie A. Harris (1995), \\"Redating the Arca Santa of Oviedo,\\" The Art Bulletin, 77(1):82‚Äì93. Pelagius continued to live in Oviedo and be addressed as bishop. When his successor, Alfonso, died in January 1142, Pelagius took up the diocesan administration again until early in the summer of 1143.Barton and Fletcher, p. 66 and n10. Pelagius is named as Bishop of Oviedo in documents of March and April 1142 and March 1143. By June the see was being administered by Froila Garc√©s, the archdeacon, and in September Martin II was elected bishop at a council in Valladolid. He had planned his own funeral and had reserved a space in the Cathedral of San Salvador for his burial. Nevertheless, his death came unexpectedly while he was visiting Santillana del Mar, and there he was buried. Corpus Pelagianum Among Pelagius writings is a short treatise on the origins of the cities of Le√≥n, Oviedo, Toledo, and Zaragoza in 1142.Edited in Manuel Risco (1793), Espa√±a Sagrada, 38:372‚Äì76. In the sixteenth century Ambrosio de Morales discovered a manuscript titled \\"Many Genealogies of the Scripture until Our Lady and Saint Anne\\", a genealogy of the Virgin Mary and Saint Anne ascribed to Pelagius, in the cathedral library of Oviedo. It contained several historical texts under the heading \\"Itacius\\", after the first of them, the chronicle by Hydatius. This manuscript has since been lost, but it demonstrates an especial interest of Pelagius' in the extended family of Jesus and his maternal grandmother.Harris, 90. =Liber chronicorum= Pelagius' original ChroniconThe definitive modern edition is Benito S√°nchez Alonso (1924), Cr√≥nica del Obispo Don Pelayo (Madrid). A partial Spanish translation is available by J. E. Casariego (1985), Cr√≥nicas de los reinos de Asturias y de Le√≥n (Le√≥n), pp. 172‚Äì81. An English translation can be found in Barton and Fletcher, pp. 74‚Äì89. was composed as a continuation of a series of chronicles which he gathered together and had copied into the Liber chronicorum, the principal part of the Corpus Pelagianum. These included the Historia Gothorum of Isidore, the Chronica ad Sebastianum, and the Chronicon of Sampiro (which was heavily interpolated, but ultimately truncated).For the relationship between Pelagius and Sampiro, see Justo P√©rez de Urbel (1951), \\"Pelayo de Oviedo y Sampiro de Astorga\\", Hispania, 11(44):387‚Äì412. Altogether these form the Liber chronicorum (\\"Book of Chronicles\\") which was finalised in 1132, when its preface, with an index, was composed. Pelagius' original chronicle, that known as Chronicon regum Legionensium, was completed sometime after 1121, since it refers to the marriage of Alfonso VI's daughter Sancha to Rodrigo Gonz√°lez, who is given the title Count.Rodrigo did not become Count until 1121 and the first reference to his marriage dates to July 1122. Additionally, Pelagius refers to the marriage of Elvira, daughter of Alfonso VI, to Roger II of Sicily in 1118 (cf. Reilly, p. 14). The Chronicon can be found in twenty- four manuscripts, the earliest dating to the late twelfth century.Barton and Fletcher, 71. It begins with the rise of Vermudo II in 982 and ends with the death of Alfonso VI in 1109. Pelagius' work as a historian has been contrasted with that of the contemporary anonymous authors of the Historia seminense and the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris. Pelagius' Latin is \\"unsophisticated and workmanlike ... [lacking] the verve and the rhetorical flourishes\\" of the Historia, and he does not display the \\"conspicuous erudition\\" of either. Pelagius probably drew up his history in haste with a minimum of preparation. Lopsided though it is in its coverage, Pelagius' Chronicon is the most important source for many eleventh-century events, such as the division of the realm that took place on Ferdinand I's death (1065). He is also a contemporary and frequent eyewitness for the reigns of Alfonso VI and Urraca; indeed, his is the only contemporary account that covers the entire reign of Alfonso VI, whom he laudingly calls \\"the father and defender of all the Spanish churches.\\"Barton and Fletcher, pp. 72‚Äì73. The reign of Alfonso V before him is covered very briefly, but that of Alfonso's father, Vermudo II, takes up roughly half the entire Chronicon and is highly critical of the king. Pelagius is the only source for the imprisonment of his predecessor, Bishop Gudesteus, by Vermudo in the 990s. The criticism of Vermudo is a useful window onto Pelagius' ideology and bias. Pelagius' Chronicon is mostly interested in ecclesiastical history, especially that of his province, and its description of royal activity is barren, rarely amounting to more than a list of successes, such as cities conquered. The historian credits Divine Providence at every turn, such as when Almanzor was allowed to ravage the Christian states because of Vermudo II's sins. Pelagius was also interested in genealogy, a fact which comes through also in the Liber testamentorum, although his genealogy of the Leonese kings is imperfect.M. Calleja Puerta (1999), \\"Una genealog√≠a leonesa del siglo XII: la descendencia de Vermudo II en la obra cron√≠stica de Pelayo de Oviedo\\", La nobleza peninsular en la Edad Media (Le√≥n), pp. 527‚Äì39, is yet to be consulted. The Chronicon regum Legionensium and the revised chronicle of Sampiro influenced the later authors of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris and the Chronica naierensis, and also Lucas de Tuy, Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, and Alfonso X. Pelagius' importance as a historian is a matter of academic disagreement.According to Barton and Fletcher, pp. 72‚Äì73, nn. 33 and 36‚Äì37, F. J. Fern√°ndez Conde (1971), \\"La obra del obispo ovetense D. Pelayo en la historiograf√≠a espa√±ola,\\" Bolet√≠n del Instituto de Estudios Asturianos, 25:249‚Äì91, esp. pp. 250‚Äì55, is highly critical of Pelagius' historiography, and B. S√°nchez Alonso (1947), Historia de la historiograf√≠a espa√±ola (Madrid), p. 117, lambastes it as superficial, while A. Bl√°zquez y Delgado Aguilera (1910), \\"Elogio de Don Pelayo, obispo de Oviedo and historiador de Espa√±a,\\" Memorias de la Real Academia de la Historia, 12:439‚Äì92. He is neither free from legend, nor miracle, nor all invention, but he did not set out to reconstruct the past. Pelagius also penned an account of the translation of the relics of Pelagius of C√≥rdoba from Le√≥n to Oviedo and of those of Froil√°n to Valle C√©sar, near Oviedo, which he included in his chronicle. =Liber testamentorum= Page from the Liber testamentorum Pelagius also had all judicial documents relating to the diocese collected and copied into a massive cartulary called the Liber testamentorum or Libro (g√≥tico) de los testamentos, compiled around 1120, possibly at the monastery of Santos Facundo y Primitivo in Sahag√∫n.The modern edition is F. J. Fern√°ndez Conde (1971), El Libro de los Testamentos de la catedral de Oviedo (Rome). Though it contains falsified, forged, and interpolated documents designed to buttress the claims of Oviedo, otherwise it remains an important compilation for historical research. It is illustrated with colourful miniatures in the Romanesque style, and is the most important monument to this period in the history of painting in Spain. The Gregorian reform had always desired the reorganisation of the Spanish Church along the same lines as had been during the Visigothic Kingdom. As the see of Oviedo was created during the period of the Asturian Kingdom, Pelagius had recorded the false history of a diocese founded at a place called Lugo de Asturias during the period of the Vandal domination in Spain in the fourth century, before even the Visigoths.Barton and Fletcher, p. 70. Pelagius forged many related documents to demonstrate his diocese's claims against those of Burgos and Lugo. To fend off claims by several sees to be Oviedo's legitimate metropolitan he forged documents claiming that Oviedo had once been a metropolitan seat as well.Demetrio Mansilla (1955), \\"La supuesta metr√≥poli de Oviedo,\\" Historia Sacra, 8(16):259‚Äì74, esp. ¬ß. II, pp. 264‚Äì74, on the \\"Teor√≠a del obispo Don Pelayo sobre la metr√≥poli de Oviedo: fundamentos y cr√≠tica de la misma\\". He made to be forged a letter from Pope John VIII, dated incorrectly to 899, in which Oviedo was made a metropolitan. He had acta (decrees) drawn up for synods which had supposedly taken place at Oviedo in 821 and 872, but for which there is no evidence. In these Lugo and Braga are listed as suffragans of Oviedo and it is claimed that after the Islamic conquest (711) God had translated all the rights and privileges of the church of Toledo to Oviedo, along with her relics, as a punishment for Spain's sins. Pelagius also wrote a history of the movement of the Arca Santa from Jerusalem to Oviedo, which is preserved in the Liber testamentorum and was also interpolated into the Chronica ad Sebastianum in the Liber chronicorum.

It is commonly known as the golden wood fungus. Description Australia: Gymnopilus allantopus is extremely common in the Perth region, most often seen on fallen Banksia logs and branches. It is a decomposer fungus occurring on a wide range of rotting logs, stumps and woody debris. The Golden Wood Fungus produces fruit bodies over most of the main local Australian fungus season ‚Äì May to July, and also produces masses of fan-like white thread in the wood that can be seen any time of the year. The best way to see the fans is to lift off a strip of bark to reveal the underlying threads amid the soft white- rotted wood. The fungus is easily identified in the field by its bright gills that develop rusty spots when old, white flap on the margin of young caps, and white fan-like mycelium. It has a bright ochre brown spore print. Most often the fruit bodies have a straight stem but if the specimens emerge from the side of a log the stem curves upwards.Bougher, N. L. (2009).

Taxonomy Previously in Western Australia Gymnopilus allantopus incorrectly was referred to as the northern hemisphere species Gymnopilus penetrans. It was also recently given the provisional name G. austrosapineus to distinguish small specimens from large ones sent in the 19th century from Australia to M. J. Berkeley in England. He named the large specimens as allantopus in 1845 and referred to it as the very noble species. Recent studies have revealed that Berkeley was sent only the largest specimens and he had wrongly assumed all specimens would be large- sized. Hence the name G. austrosapineus was determined to be superfluous because G. allantopus produces both small and large specimens.Bougher, N. L. (2009).

Koc, who had several noms de guerre (Witold, Szlachetny, Adam Krajewski, Adam Warmi≈Ñski and Witold Warmi≈Ñski), fought in Polish units in World War One and in the Polish-Soviet War. In his youth, he was a member of the Revolutionary Association of the Nation's Youth, the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Association. He then became a commandant of the Polish Military Organisation, first in the Warsaw district, and then its Commandant-in-Chief. Adam Koc was one of the officers of the Polish Legions and a member of so-called Convent of Organisation A. In the Second Polish Republic, Adam Koc joined the Polish Armed Forces, in December 1919, where he was given command of the 201 Infantry Regiment of Warsaw's Defense, which later became a Volunteer Division (31 July - 3 December 1920). Afterwards, he served in the Ministry of Military Affairs, in different positions. A participant in the May Coup, he was promoted in 1926 to be chief of the Command of VI District of Corps in Lw√≥w, a position he held until 1928. Considered a member of Pi≈Çsudski's colonels group, he was elected to the Sejm three times and once to the Senate. He was also multiple times in office, mostly in financial positions (he was Vice-Minister of Treasury and head of the Bank of Poland). He was one of the negotiators of loans to the Second Polish Republic from the UK and France. As a Sanational politician, he created the newspaper Gazeta Polska, published from 1929 to 1939. He was editor-in- chief of its Sanational predecessor G≈Ços Prawdy in 1929. After Pi≈Çsudski died in May 1935, Adam Koc joined the people close to Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. He became commandant-in-chief of the Association of Polish Legionists. In 1936‚Äì1937, Koc started co-creating a new political entity, the Camp of National Unity (OZN). He became its head a year later. He was supportive of the idea of OZN's approach towards the radical right National Radical Camp Falanga and right- wing National Democracy. As World War II started, Koc coordinated the evacuation of the Bank of Poland's gold reserves. He served as Minister of Finance, Trade and Industry for a short period in 1939, before he fled to the US in 1940. He became one of the active members of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America and died, still in exile, in 1969.  Early life  Adam Koc was born into an aristocratic family from Podlachia. It is possible that the family derived itself from the area near Bia≈Ça Podlaska. His grandfather, Leon, was a veteran of the January uprising and mayor of Filip√≥w and Sereje, both near Suwa≈Çki, Koc's hometown, while his grandmother, Waleria, was part of the Polish National Government. Adam's father, W≈Çodzimierz (1848-1925) was a teacher of ancient languages. His marriage with Helena (n√©e Pisanko) brought three children: Stefan (1889-1908), Adam Ignacy himself and Leon Wac≈Çaw, the youngest of them (1892-1954). After the death of Adam's mother in 1894, his aunt, El≈ºbieta Pisanko, took care of them. Five years later, the family moved to a rented flat in Suwa≈Çki. He started school in 1900 and he attended the Russian Boys' Gymnasium in Suwa≈Çki. It is there, most probably, that Koc became involved in the pro-independence activities, participating in self- taught additional lectures, in 1901. During the 1905 revolution he was part of the strike action gymnasium committee. As a result, he and future politician and MP Aleksander Putra were expelled from the school. At the time, he was a member of the National Workers' Union, an organisation with close ties with the National Democracy. He continued his education in January 1906 in the newly opened Polish Private Seven-class Trade School in Suwa≈Çki (now School Union nr. 4). Later on, his father sent Adam to Krak√≥w, where he attended the Philosophical College of the Jagiellonian University. In order to do so, he had to pass final exams in one of the Krak√≥w's gymnasiums. He did so on 20 June 1912, in then named IV classical gymnasium (now IV Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Lyceum), located in Podg√≥rze (then a separate city), on quite a low level (mostly, he received a \\"satisfactory\\" grade, with only Greek and Latin passed on a \\"good\\" one), which was enough, however, to start Polish studies there.  Pro-independence activity (1909-1914) = Before World War I = A group of Krak√≥w soldiers from the conspiracy Union of Active Struggle. Adam Koc alias Witold first from left Koc had been in Krak√≥w for three years when he wrote his Matura exam in 1912. At the time he committed to pro-independence conspiracy organisations, and was listed among the radical youth. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Studnicki was his mentor, while Aleksander Putra, Boles≈Çaw Kunc and Boles≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski were his closest cooperators. In the fall of 1909, Koc joined the newly created Revolutionary Association of Nation's Youth (ZRMN), which was introduced into the conspirative Union of Active Struggle (ZWC) by Studnicki, despite fears that the organisation bore a socialist character. There, Koc received his first pseudonym, Witold. His brother, Leon, joined the organisation in 1911, after Adam introduced him. Riflemen's Organisation meeting in Lw√≥w. Adam Koc third from left. Koc was engaged in the Riflemen's Association, a legal organisation related to ZWC. Initially he was responsible for the financial state of the Krak√≥w branch, but Koc was sent to Grodno in late May 1910 by Kazimierz Sosnkowski and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (where his retired father lived), so as to make a detailed description of the fortress. The task was done well, while the maps and sketches were sent via Aleksander Prystor. It is probable that it was the reason Koc could complete the officer's course, organized by the Union of Active Struggle in Str√≥≈ºa near Limanowa, in Austrian Galicia, in 1912, and therefore promoted to a higher rank in the ZWC a year later. In spring 1914, he passed an exam that gave him an officer's rank in the ZWC and an Officer's Star \\"Parasol\\" award. Simultaneously, Koc was an adjutant of the main headquarters of Riflemen's Organisation for the Russian partition affairs, starting from October 1913. = Polish Military Organisation (1914-1919) = On 10 August 1914, Koc came to Warsaw from Druskininkai on the order of Walery S≈Çawek, to take command of the local branch of the Union of Active Struggle in the Russian partition. Soon afterwards, the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Association in Congress Poland united under leadership of Karol Rybasiewicz, formerly commandant of the Polish Rifle Squads. Koc became his deputy, and in August 1914, the new body was named the Polish Military Organisation (POW), led by Pi≈Çsudski's emissary, Tadeusz ≈ªuli≈Ñski. The main target of the new organisation was to create sabotage actions behind the Russian army. Koc was one of the members of the Chief Commandment of POW. In addition, Koc commanded the Warsaw district of the organisation from the beginning of 1915. In February 1915 he was advanced to Podporuchik by ≈ªuli≈Ñski. Koc desperately wanted to fight Russians on the front, among Pi≈Çsudski's Legions, an occasion that could have been possible unless the front stabilized by spring 1915. Then, ≈ªuli≈Ñski sent him to Pi≈Çsudski (then actively in fight) with reports on POW's activity. Normally, such a person could cross the frontline to the 1st Brigade of Polish Legions, but it proved to be impossible. To fulfill the task, Koc had to use the northern route, via Finland and Sweden. Alias Adam Krajewski, Koc left Warsaw on 25 May 1915, giving up his POW's position. He arrived in Petrograd, and started to move towards Helsinki, illegally crossing the border between Russia and the Great Duchy of Finland. Then, Koc was transported to Stockholm, in agreement with Finnish pro-independence organisations. There, he met another messenger from POW, Aleksander Sulkiewicz. Problems with getting an Austro-Hungary visa, both had to wait for them in Kopenhagen. Having received the documents, Koc arrived in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski (then occupied by the Triple Alliance militia), where he met with Adam Skwarczy≈Ñski. He then finally reached Annopol, then Pi≈Çsudski's headquarters. The reports were given, and, on Koc's will, he was allowed to participate in the Legions.leftleft  Polish Legions (1915-1918)  Having completed the task given by ≈ªuli≈Ñski, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 1st Brigade of the Polish Legions. It almost coincided with the Central Powers countries' occupation of Lublin in summer 1915. He received a task coinciding with his earlier life experience: supporting the newly summoned Lublin's National Department - an organisation aiming at the propagation of Pi≈Çsudski's policies (to counteract the Commandment of Legions, controlled by Central Powers). By doing so, he raised suspicions among the Austro-Hungarian militia, so he was sent to the front line. Koc struggled with pneumonia and malaria, which was aggravated by his sight issues. Koc commented on his state: On 18 September 1916, Koc was severely wounded in the Battle of Sitowicze, in Volhynia. He was shot near his liver, while on a spy mission. Sulkiewicz was shot dead. Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski cared for him at the battlefield. The wounded Koc was transported to the Legions' clinic in Lublin, and then to Krak√≥w. He finished his treatment at the clinic on 31 January 1917. Koc returned to political life in the Legions, where he became one of the founders of the so-called Analphabet Association - a conspirative military organization in the 5th Infantry Regiment supporting Pi≈Çsudski's pro- independence policy. By that time he was one of the pi≈Çsudczyk (a supportwe of Pi≈Çsudski) who has already been a decent authority in the Legions. His actions did not remain unnoticed by the Austro-German generals, so Koc was sent to Ostr√≥w Mazowiecka for additional schooling, as a punishment. Additional trouble came to Koc after the oath crisis (9-11 July 1917), when, as one of the officers of the Legions, he was imprisoned at the camp in Beniamin√≥w, while his brother Leon was imprisoned at Szczypiorno (now part of Kalisz). At Beniamin√≥w, Koc worked to convince other prisoners to join Pi≈Çsudski and to continue resistance. Koc was released on 22 April 1918, with his health deteriorating.  Polish Military Organisation (1918)  Kingdom of Poland partition between Austria-Hungary and the German Empire. POW nr. 1 district was located in the cyan part of the map After he was freed from the prisoner-of-war camp, Koc rejoined the Polish Military Organisation. Jan Zdanowicz-Opieli≈Ñski, who was then the Main Commandant of POW district number 1 (the one that ruled over the German occupied territory from its headquarters in Warsaw), convinced the then head of POW, Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, to transfer his command to Koc. As POW's Main Commandant, Koc reorganized his Command, and created fast-moving squads for sabotage actions, on the order of Edward Rydz- ≈ömig≈Çy. He initiated protests against the German police and coordinated POW activity with the Armed Squads of the Polish Socialist Party. His successes increased his authority in the military organisations. While Main Commandant, he made close ties with Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski (who was responsible for correspondence with the political constituencies, mostly Polish political parties) and Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. The latter soon gave over his functions to Koc, in September 1918. At the same time, Koc substituted for Tadeusz Kasprzycki in the Convent of Organisation A, which was created in summer 1917, as a conspiratorial group of Pi≈Çsudski supporters. As the process of the so-called Lublin government advanced (early November 1918), German-led military councils were organized in Warsaw. Koc initiated the demilitarisation of some part of them. On 10 November 1918, together with Prince Zdzislaw Lubomirski, part of the Regency Council of the Kingdom of Poland, he welcomed J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and one of his fellow warriors, Kazimierz Sosnkowski, who returned by train to Warsaw from internment in Magdeburg. Then, Koc ordered his subordinates to disarm German soldiers in Warsaw. This done, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and the Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland could then peacefully enter Warsaw to start governing the newly created Polish Republic.

Left to right: Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski, Adam Koc i Marian Zyndram-Ko≈õcia≈Çkowski = Independence (1918-1920) = Even though Koc was busy as Main Commandant, he served as a referent for the I Department (Organisational) of the Polish Armed Forces on the affairs of POW incorporation, until mid-December 1918. The POW division was then merged with the VI Section (Informational) of the General Staff with Koc at its head. On 11 May 1919, its name changed to the Second Department of Polish General Staff. At first, he served in the Intelligence Bureau of the Second Department. He was afterwards directed to the Wojenna Szko≈Ça Sztabu Generalnego (Military School of the General Staff) for additional schooling, from 13 June to 1 December 1919. Polish Armed Forces officers after the capture of Grodno in September 1920. Adam Koc in the middle, with Virtuti Militari award Later, on 17 January 1920, by decree of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, Koc was officially accepted in the Polish Armed Forces as a captain (he had been informally advanced to the rank on 17 December 1918Centralne Archiwum Wojskowe (CAW), Akta personalne i odznaczeniowe p≈Çk. Adama Koca, columns 2-3). On the same date, another decree (dated 1 January 1920) was published he was awarded the Silver Cross of Virtuti Militari. By that time, he had been nominated as head of the VI Section (of Propaganda and Soldiers' Care).Centralne Archiwum Wojskowe (CAW), Oddzia≈Ç II Sztabu Generalnego, sign. I.303.4, vol. 11, n/p Nevertheless, he continued his duties as POW Main Commandant. It is unclear, however, which of his actions there were part of his official duties. As Koc received the most prestigious military award in Poland, he became secretary of the Temporary Council of the Virtuti Militari Award (as one of the 11 first recipients of the award since its restoration in August 1919, on 21 January 1920). He was as well part of the Statute Commission. He had to leave shortly, however, since he was to go to Ukraine in May until June 1920 to aid Symon Petlura in communication issues and, later on, the POW soldiers who remained alive.Letter of A. Koc to the Commandant-in-Chief, dated 10 June 1920. Archiwum Akt√≥w Nowych, The collection of the remains of the material of the II Department, vol. 144, columns 13-22. = War with Union of Soviet Socialists' Republic (1920) = On 11 June 1920, on the order of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Koc was promoted to lieutenant colonel, together with other Polish Legion officers. Soon he was given command of the 201st Infantry Regiment (18 July 1920), which consisted mainly of POW soldiers. The regiment was subordinated to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's, and then, as the regiment was incorporated into the 22nd Infantry Division, over it as well. All of the militia were created as part of the Volunteer Army, which itself was a result of mobilisation to the Polish Armed Forces. At first, in late July, Koc and his regiment were stationed in Sura≈º near Bia≈Çystok. The regiment began fighting against Soviet forces. As the regiment was incorporated into the Volunteer Division, Koc continued fighting on the Northern Front. The successes of his army started only after the turning point of the conflict. For example, on 15/16 August 1920, his soldiers took over Nasielsk, after Sikorski's counterattack a day earlier. Koc was unable to fully destroy the 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by Hayk Bzhishkyan, as the Soviet cavalry escaped encirclement. Soon after, Koc's Division was incorporated into the 3rd Army of Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, where Koc participated in the successful attack on Grodno. Part of the 22nd Division took part in ≈ªeligowski's mutiny, while the rest (Koc included) fought until 3 December 1920, when his division was dissolved. = Peace (1921-1925) = As the Polish-Soviet conflict waned, Koc came to Warsaw, where he took a course of informational lectures for higher rank officers, starting from 20 January 1921.  Service in the III Department  As the war officially finished, Pi≈Çsudski gave Koc command of the newly summoned III Department of the General Staff for the Preparation of Reserves affairs. His task was to support organizations that were to prepare the population for possible military conflict. The Department controlled military education of Polish youth and the reserves. Koc participated in the International Riflemen's Organisation councils on the behalf of Ministry of Military Affairs. He was an advocate for the democratisation of relationships inside the military and for stronger ties between the people and the army, which won him esteem among his subordinates. Simultaneously, he was regularly published in the Strzelec, RzƒÖd I Wojsko and Bellona military magazines. These facts resulted in a positive opinion of Koc's work by his boss in the III Department, Colonel Marian Kukiel, but in the highest military circles, namely, of Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki, then Minister of Military Affairs. On 3 May 1922, Koc was given an advantage in placement. He was placed in 135th place of senior infantry soldiers. While serving in the III Department, Koc was part of a conspiracy organisation called \\"Honor i Ojczyzna\\" (1921‚Äì23), which was to train new soldiers, maintain morale and depoliticise the army's structure. Together with Kazimierz M≈Çodzianowski, Koc, as the representative of the Polish Military Organisation and the Legions, was part of the chapter. (reprint by AKME) The organisation was created by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, himself a right-of-center politician, nevertheless, Koc received consent from J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and Kazimierz Sosnkowski, both on the left. At the time, Koc was writing poetry (alias Adam Warmi≈Ñski). His book of poetry and prose was published in 1921.  First attempt of Socialist takeover  Koc as colonel In mid-December 1922, as Gabriel Narutowicz was assassinated, Koc took part in the Pi≈Çsudski's officers meeting in the II Department's headquarters. The meeting aimed at calming the created situation by Pi≈Çsudski's military intervention (albeit Pi≈Çsudski had no formal power to do so) and, eventually, at taking over power in Poland. The officers present (including Koc, Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski, Ignacy Matuszewski, Ignacy Borner, Konrad Libicki, Kazimierz Stamirowski and Henryk Floyar-Rajchman) contacted the headquarters of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) in order to organise a general strike, a plan that did not come to life because Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski refused to cooperate.  Pre-May Coup activity  From 2 November 1923, Koc attended another schooling course in the Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Wojenna. Having completed his military studies, he was accepted as the I referent in the II Army Inspectorate in Warsaw (under ≈Åucjan ≈ªeligowski). Even though he worked at the Army Inspectorate, in addition, he was made head of 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment. On 1 December 1924, Koc was promoted to colonel, his highest military rank, with 17th place on the list of seniority among Polish infantry. Two months later, colonel Koc was nominated as a deputy of the commandant of the Center of Practical Army Schooling in Rembert√≥w (then a separate town). Koc became a freemason before 1921 demitted on 23 March 1928. In 1925‚Äì1926, while serving in Rembert√≥w, Koc was part of the National Grand Lodge of Poland, on Pi≈Çsudski's recommendation.  Koc-group  From mid-1924 until winter of 1925, meetings took place in Koc's apartment and in the Ma≈Ça Ziemia≈Ñska cafe on Mazowiecka street in Warsaw. The participators from the pi≈Çsudczycy circles (including J√≥zef Beck, Ignacy Matuszewski, Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski, Kazimierz Stamirowski, Kazimierz ≈öwitalski, Henryk Floyar-Rajchman and the Starzy≈Ñscy brothers Roman and Stefan) supported a coup d'√©tat, so the meetings were mostly about preparing for the event. Preparations were interrupted, however, by Pi≈Çsudski, in December 1925. Despite their suspension, they had some impact on the future May 1926 events. = May Coup and beyond (1926-1930) = May Coup  On 11 April 1926, Koc began serving as head of the Department for Non-Catholic Religions in the Ministry of Military Affairs. The position had taken him to Warsaw for the month preceding the coup, time Koc used to help Pi≈Çsudski organize it. His role was to inform some of the pi≈Çsudskiite officers about the upcoming power takeover just before the event. He fulfilled his mission on 11/12 May, he, Anatol Minkowski, Feliks Kwiatek (both lieutenant colonels) and Karol Lilienfeld-Krzewski (major), visited Kazimierz Sawicki, commandant of the 36th Infantry Regiment and contacted Tadeusz Piskor, commandant of the 28th Infantry Division, to signal Pi≈Çsudski's readiness for action. While the coup was in process, Koc was most probably negotiating the strike action announcement on the Polish rail service. He could not, however, know about Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski's location, a fact that upset Pi≈Çsudski.  First \\"sanation\\" years  After the May coup, he was nominated as Head of Staff of the Commandment of VI Military District in Lw√≥w, on 14 September 1926 (the office he held until 4 March 1928). The purpose of his nomination is subject to controversy. According to Marian Romeyko, he was to \\"supervise\\" his boss, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, a version rejected by Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski, who claimed Koc, along with other officers from the so-called Koc- group, were eliminated from Warsaw, even though Marsza≈Çek did not explain why and how that happened. It might be possible that Pi≈Çsudski was disappointed in Koc after his request to locate Wojciechowski during the coup. Another version was that Pi≈Çsudski was afraid of a financial scandal, caused by Jan Lecho≈Ñ's behaviour. The editor of Cyrulik Warszawski (Koc was an initiator and an organiser of the comical journal) was using Koc's generosity to support the magazine, which might cast a shadow over the new political system, on the grounds that budget money was used for political purposes. After serving in Lw√≥w for 1,5 years, he became Commandant of Infantry Officers Staff. By then, Koc decided to enter the political scene. In effect, Koc retired from military service while serving as an MP. He fully retired from military affairs on 30 April 1930.  Political career (1927-1938) = Initial activity = Koc's political career started in 1927 when he took part in the Cabinet of the Head of the Council of Ministers. There, decisions upon Sanation policies were made. He entered the Lw√≥w Regional Voivodership Committee, one of several structures that coordinated the electoral campaign of Pi≈Çsudskiite party. In the 2nd Sejm convocation, in December 1928, Koc was invited to the Main Awarding Commission of the Cross of Independence (commemorating the 10th anniversary of Polish independence), becoming one of its first recipients. = MP and journalist = In the March 1928 parliamentary elections, Koc was elected to the Sejm from the all-state list from the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (BBWR) constituency. Koc is claimed to be one of Pi≈Çsudski's colonels, which implies that he was one of the closest MPs to Pi≈Çsudski and that he was among the ruling class of the BBWR and Poland. Some authors question this statement: Andrzej Chojnowski writes that \\"Koc and Miedzi≈Ñski were somewhat removed (from the main positions) by Pi≈Çsudski\\", while historian Antoni Czubi≈Ñski claimed that Koc never belonged to that group. As an MP from the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the government, he was an informal head of a group of BBWR deputies (from both houses of parliament) from the so-called Eastern Ma≈Çopolska (i.e. territories of Lw√≥w, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and Tarnopol voivoderships) from 1928‚Äì1929, and again from 1930 on. At the same time, he was Director of Propaganda Section of BBWR, which, on 30 October 1929, helped him create a new pro-sanation newspaper - Gazeta Polska, where he briefly served as editor-in-chief. merging Epoka into G≈Ços Prawdy newspapers (Koc directed the latter from January 1929). The main reason Koc was nominated for the newspaper edition was to get rid of Wojciech Stpiczy≈Ñski's radical leftist views, which were not favourable for Walery S≈Çawek, part of Pi≈Çsudski's colonels and head of BBWR. BBWR was trying to find support in the conservative parties, partly to fight the opposition's Centrolew influences, and partly to make a future coalition with the right- wing parties (mainly National Democracy), which was necessary to retain majority in parliament and government. Even though he was an MP and formally ceased executing his military duties, he was still active in the military organizations where he had been participating for a long time. He was nominated as vice-director of the Riflemen's Association's Council. Koc became head of the Peowiak Association, uniting the veterans of POW, in March 1928. = Vice-minister of Treasury (1930-1935) = On 23 December 1930, Mo≈õcicki nominated the colonel for Vice-Minister of Treasury. At the time the first finance minister was Ignacy Matuszewski, later succeeded by Jan Pi≈Çsudski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zawadzki. Koc controlled the organisation of stock exchanges and banks (both the central Bank of Poland and private financial institutions), debt and foreign financial relations, during the Great Depression. According to Janusz Mierzwa, Koc's biographer, he had been summoned to such a position despite his lack of experience, thanks to his humble and honest character. Pi≈Çsudski could not have trusted other people, as rumours of bribery in the Bank of Poland came to him. Another factor that might have aided his nomination was Matuszewski's fear of the statist ambitions of Stefan Starzy≈Ñski. Additionally, Koc was passionate about economic issues. At first, Koc was seen to espouse moderately liberal views on the economy, but he evolved as an advocate of mainly interventionist or even statist actions. Map of railroads of Poland (as of 1952-1953). The coal trunk-line can be tracked there (starting from origin at Chorz√≥w) by the following route: Chorz√≥w- Tarnowskie G√≥ry-Herby Nowe-Karsznice-Inowroc≈Çaw-Nowa Wie≈õ Wielka-Bydgoszcz- Maksymilianowo-Ko≈õcierzyna-Gdynia At the beginning of 1932, Koc became State Commissioner for the Bank of Poland. He served for 4 years.  French and British railroad loans  Photograph of the Polish loan delegation to London. Adam Koc fourth from right. As Koc was responsible for international financial relations with his foreign counterparts, Koc actively engaged in discussions over a loan from France for finishing the so-called coal trunk- line - a strategically important communication railroad that was to connect Polish Silesia's coal mines with Gdynia, a fast-developing seaport. In mid- February 1931, Koc arrived to Paris to discuss the financial aspects of the loan, on behalf of the Ministry of Communication. According to the decision signed in France (which was to be valid until 31 December 1975), the French- Polish Rail Association was given rights to the parts of the line under construction (Herby Nowe - Inowroc≈Çaw and Nowa Wie≈õ Wielka-Gdynia), as well as to exploit the infrastructure on the Czƒôstochowa-Siemkowice section (close to the line). The treaty was the first case when a part of railway line was given for use to a foreign private enterprise, a step lauded by the government (by e.g. showing the importance of Polish loans for Polish-French relations), but equally criticised by the opposition. Koc served as vice-director of the rail association for more than three years. Koc vainly attempted to negotiate another loan from French officials - this time to electrify the Warsaw Rail Knot. He succeeded, however, while continuing talks with British partners. On 8 July 1933, a treaty between English Electric Ltd. and Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. Ltd., on one side, and the Ministry of Treasury, on another, was signed providing a ¬£1.98 million loan (then approx. 60 mln z≈Ç). The conditions of the loan were much more favorable than the French terms: the project had to be finished in 3‚Äì4 years, using materials made in Poland and building additional electrotechnical facilities as well as a power plant near Warsaw, using British capital. The agreement was signed on 2 August 1933, the fact Koc was very content: Another railroad modernisation loan was signed on 24 April 1934 - this time, with The Westinghouse Brake and Saxiby Co. Ltd., to install air brakes on Polish freight trains. The quote of the loan was the same ¬£1.98 million.  International economic conference in London (1933)  Koc worked to get Poland out of the Great Depression. In June and July 1933, Koc was head of the Polish delegation to the international economic conference in London. Koc presented his views on combating the Depression. He claimed that the main target was to stabilise the currencies via trade liberalisation and customs decrease or abolition. Koc favored the gold standard, signing a \\"gold countries\\" declaration with France, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, on July 3. The declaration stated, \\"the will of retaining the free gold standard according to the today's parity [of currencies towards gold] in their own countries, as [written] in the existent monetary laws\\".  1935  Adam Koc in mid-1930s 1935 was a turning point for Poland. On 12 May 1935, Pi≈Çsudski died. To commemorate his death, Koc entered the Main Committee of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Commemoration. The place of the General Inspector of the Armed Forces (GISZ) became vacant (no longer occupied by Pi≈Çsudski), several candidates were proposed. Koc preferred Kazimierz Sosnkowski, but Mo≈õcicki chose Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, a person who he thought was absent-minded, especially when compared to Sosnkowski. After the nomination Koc united with Walery S≈Çawek, expecting him to take up power in the havoc caused by Pi≈Çsudski's death. S≈Çawek, however, was unable to convince Mo≈õcicki to step down, despite evidence that Pi≈Çsudski had informally nominated him as his successor, and eventually S≈Çawek was ostracized from the Polish political scene. This deepened the decomposition of the pi≈Çsudskiite parties. Koc had to change his orientation, accepting the increasing importance of Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. With Bogus≈Çaw Miedzi≈Ñski and Wojciech Stpiczy≈Ñski, he co-created the so-called GISZ group, attempting to counterbalance the increasing influence of another informal group - grupa zamkowa (the castle group, named after the residence of Mo≈õcicki - the Royal Castle in Warsaw), headed by Mo≈õcicki and his prot√©g√© - Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. At the same time, he and Ignacy Matuszewski were considered as the rightmost politicians from the Pi≈Çsudski's colonels group. Koc (center) on the return from his visit to USA, aboard on MS Pi≈Çsudski Legislative elections were due in September 1935. This was a smaller problem, as Koc was reelected for the second time, with an overwhelming 67,408 votes. In mid-September 1935, he went to one of his last foreign trips as Vice-Minister in the US. His purpose was to gain a missionary loan (i.e. a loan from another country to introduce more money mass into the economy). Arriving in the US, Koc met with Polonia representatives and with Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Later, Koc visited the New York Stock Exchange and some representatives from economic circles. Despite that, the main goal of the visit was not achieved. When Koc returned to Poland, Walery S≈Çawek's government was dissolved by Mo≈õcicki on 12 October 1935. The next day, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski was nominated as Minister of Treasury and deputy PM. Kwiatkowski was known as an autarkist, while Koc belonged to the classical school, and the two could not coexist. Mo≈õcicki declined ≈ömig≈Çy's proposal to install Koc as Prime Minister. Koc resigned in December. with a warm farewell from Kwiatkowski. = Bank of Poland (1936) = On 7 February 1936, Mo≈õcicki nominated Koc as Head of the Bank of Poland. After his nomination, Koc traveled abroad, managing Poland's international loan issues. In France, he met his French counterpart, Jean Tannery, as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pierre-√âtienne Flandin and the Minister of Finances, Marcel R√©gnier. He also traveled to Great Britain to meet Montagu Norman, then Governor of the Bank of England. Koc advocated support for profitable enterprises and close cooperation between the Bank of Poland and private financial institutions. As in 1933, Koc protected the gold standard and tried to protect the immense Polish gold reserves. While Koc was in office, the Bank of Poland was not supportive of stock and currency manipulations. The policy, however, could not solve the problem of a sudden drop in foreign exchange reserves at the end of March 1936. Mo≈õcicki summoned a meeting of various officials (including Prime Minister Zyndram- Ko≈õcia≈Çkowski, Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, Tadeusz Kasprzycki, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz, Roman G√≥recki, Juliusz Ulrych and Juliusz Poniatowski). Koc proposed a presidential decree to devalue the national currency, but this was rejected by Mo≈õcicki. The Head of the Bank of Poland was definitely against such solution, leading Koc to resign on 8 May. Before leaving, Koc convinced Mo≈õcicki to transfer 20 mln z≈Ç ($3.77M) from the Bank of Poland for combating unemployment by hiring people to work on road construction. The nomination of Koc as head of the Bank of Poland, while Kwiatkowski, his boss, was in office, is subject to controversy. Mierzwa claimed that neither Kwiatkowski nor Mo≈õcicki had a better choice, which implies that the politicians from the \\"castle group\\" were searching for a better one, so Koc gave them some time. Koc joined Bank Handlowy in 1938, becoming its vice-director on 30 March 1939, while continuing his government service. Until 1939, Koc served only as a legislator. = Camp of National Unity (OZN) activity (1936-1938) = Prehistory  A cartoon featuring Koc (bottom left) and S≈Çawek (on a monument). A photograph from ZLP session in May 1937. Koc is standing on the left, while his mentor, Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, in the center With the death of Pi≈Çsudski, most right-wing politicians gathered around Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz. Walery S≈Çawek lost support. On 30 October 1935, Walery S≈Çawek dissolved the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government. ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz and his partners started working upon its replacement. ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz was trying to assure control over a Legionist organization - The Association of Polish Legionists (ZLP). On 24 May 1936, Koc took S≈Çawek's position. The same day, ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz made a speech highlighting the need to protect Poland and to develop its military forces. By that time, Koc was known as one of ≈ömig≈Çy- Rydz' closest cooperators, which was why the future Marshal chose him to supervise the creation of a new political entity. Miedzi≈Ñski took up that task in December 1936. A title page of Gazeta Polska newspaper, featuring Koc in front of a microphone and the text of his declaration Miedzi≈Ñski supported cooperation with right-wing parties. At the beginning of 1937, Miedzi≈Ñski wrote an article in Gazeta Polska, which was essentially a declaration by the ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz camp that it would create a new political entity. In the same article, Miedzi≈Ñski advocated cooperating with the right (mentioning National Democracy). Simultaneously, Miedzi≈Ñski and Koc were making pertractations with the young nationalist party - National Radical Camp Falanga (ONR \\"Falanga\\"). While talks were in progress, Miedzi≈Ñski drafted the party's declaration, which was accepted by neither ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz nor Koc. Miedzi≈Ñski mentioned little about agricultural reform, which was one of the reasons why talks with agricultural parties Maciej Rataj and Jan DƒÖbski failed, apart from lack of consensus on the subject of Wincenty Witos's return and on a new electoral system. ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz decided to create his own draft. The draft paralyzed the already uneasy talks with the agricultural parties because it did not consider agricultural reform. Miedzi≈Ñski warned that he was about to quit the Sanation camp if nothing changed. To achieve consensus, in January 1937, Koc, Miedzi≈Ñski and ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz met in Zakopane to provide corrections to the Marshal's project. After two days of discussions, Koc received a final draft, which contained some vague points on agricultural reform.  Creation  On 21 February 1937, Koc made a radio broadcast to declare a new political entity. The party affirmed the 1935 constitution's statement of the primary role of the state and civil solidarity. The declaration featured the need for military protection of the state (including militia heading the country) and maintaining distance from communism. An important part of this statement was the appeal to support ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz. The program included passages about the importance of the Roman Catholic church. The declaration advocated tolerance towards ethnic minorities, excepting Jews. The Camp of National Unity (OZN) was attacked as right-wing and antisemitic. Some National Democracy representatives argued that OZN had committed ideological plagiarism. Criticism came from opposition newspapers (e.g. right-wing Kurier Pozna≈Ñski) and some left-wing pro-pi≈Çsudskiite representatives. On the other hand, government newspapers such as Gazeta Polska praised the declaration and accented the enthusiasm of other political organisations.  Head of OZN  Koc (right) pays visit to Mo≈õcicki in the Royal Castle, 24 February 1937. The creation of a new political entity (colloquially called \\"OZON\\", Polish for ozone) interested the government itself, leading Koc to visit the president three days after his declaration. On 22 June 1937, a youth organization of OZN, Union of Young Poland (ZMP), was created. Formally, Adam Koc became director of it, but it was de facto controlled by Jerzy Rutkowski, his deputy. Eventually, on 28 October, Rutkowski took command. Rutkowski was from the radical-right political scene (ONR), but Koc denied any ties between him and ONR \\"Falanga\\". The step was a product of cooperation between Koc and ONR's leader, Boles≈Çaw Piasecki. It was widely condemned in Legionist and POW circles, for example, on the XIV General Congress of ZLP in Krak√≥w. As criticism grew, OZN ended cooperation with the Union of Young Poland on 22 April 1938. Koc had already stepped down from as leader in favour of Stanis≈Çaw Skwarczy≈Ñski. The impulse to do so was Rutkowski's declaration to create an independent organisation and his resignation from OZN.  Assassination attempt  On 18 July 1937 at 10.15 p.m., an assassin attempted to execute Koc while Koc was sitting in his small house in ≈öwidry Ma≈Çe (now in J√≥zef√≥w near Warsaw). The assassin was instead killed by his own bomb, as it exploded earlier than expected. The results of the subsequent investigation revealed that the culprit was Wojciech Bieganek from R√≥≈ºopole near Krotoszyn, together with his co-conspirator and brother, Jan, who was arrested the day following the failed attempt. Some pro-Sanation publications suggested that Bieganek was part of a conspiracy among politicians opposing him.  Plan for a coup d'√©tat  According to some reports, the assassination attempt, as well as OZN's decreasing popularity, were a signal for both OZN and ONR \\"Falanga\\" to attempt a second military coup, on 25/26 October 1937 (days when ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz was to be in Romania). The reports claim that Koc was planning some kind of \\"St. Bartholomew's massacre\\" or \\"Night of the Long Knives\\", allegedly, with ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz's support, which was supposed to physically eliminate the Sanational politicians opposing OZN. The plan was to assassinate 300-1500 people and to imprison an equal number, including: Mo≈õcicki; S≈Çawek; Kwiatkowski; Janina Prystorowa, wife of then Marshal of Senate, Aleksander Prystor; and Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska, widow of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, with Jerzy Paciorkowski and Zygmunt Wenda leading the massacre. Supporters of the idea claim that a prelude to the action was ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz's official proposal to change the government to install Witold Grabowski as PM (remembered for his hardline policies), an idea condemned by Stanis≈Çaw Car, an influential Marshal of Sejm. Moreover, rumours were circulating: right-of-centre Front Morges (Ignacy Jan Paderewski as leader), the delegalised Communist Party of Poland, leftist Sanation faction and the so-called \\"castle group\\". Historians opposed to the notion object that no concrete evidence documenting the plan exists. Moreover, Koc, one of the ostensible organizers, was nominated as Vice- Minister of Treasury by Mo≈õcicki, one of the proposed victims. In addition, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, a person alienated from Sanation, called Koc for cooperation as Minister of Treasury, Minister of Industry and Trade and, later on, Vice-Minister of Treasury. According to them, the rumours may be classified as \\"a successful political provocation\\", addressed to ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz. One of the main consequences of the coup was Koc's declaration that he had nothing in common with ONR \\"Falanga\\".  Resignation  Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy claimed that Koc was unfit for ruling OZN. Koc was not a public person, unlike, say, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. This fact made it difficult for Koc to lead. Furthermore, Koc was \\"tired of quarrels with Kwiatkowski, his health was failing\\", and \\"he took up the party's position [treating it] as an order from his boss\\". Also, Koc was neglecting or underestimating the importance of the opposition. To aggravate matters, OZN under Koc was widely seen as approaching fascism (mainly because of Piasecki's influence, despite claiming that \\"OZN and Falanga had nothing in common\\"), contrary to S≈Çawek's perfectionism and over-democratization. Finally, on 10 January 1938, Koc resigned from his position as head of OZN, formally because of poor health. Despite the official version, historians claim that Koc was forced to resign by ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, in favour of Stanis≈Çaw Skwarczy≈Ñski. On 25 June 1938, Koc's position as Commandant-in-Chief of the Association of Polish Legionists (ZLP) was terminated (although Koc had de facto quit ruling the organization by January 1938Archiwum Akt Nowych. Chapter: ZLP (ZwiƒÖzek Legionist√≥w Polskich). Volume 152). In this way, Koc became an ordinary MP. = Before World War II (1938-1939) = In Polish parliamentary elections in November 1938, Koc was elected to the Senate. He served on the Statute Commission of the Senate. Additionally, Koc was head of the chamber's Military Commission. Edward Raczy≈Ñski Koc was an employee of Bank Handlowy in 1938‚Äì1939, where he became vice-director on 30 March 1939. In March 1939 Koc went to London for the second time for negotiations to receive an export credit for his employer. Unofficially, he was working to maintain Poland's image in the United Kingdom, which was devastated by the annexation of Zaolzie the previous year. Koc met representatives from the government and economists to prepare for the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, J√≥zef Beck. Having returned, with ≈ömig≈Çy- Rydz's consent, Koc convinced the government to start talks about a material and a financial loan from the British. On 10 June 1939, Koc received informal instructions from Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski and was nominated as head of the official loan delegation to London. Initially, the delegation estimated the need at ¬£50-60 mln (approximately 1.24-1.49 bln z≈Ç), which was later reduced to ¬£24 million (ca. 600 mln z≈Ç). The talks were uneasy. The main problem within the Polish delegation was the question of sterling area accession, one of the conditions of the loan submission. Contrary to Kwiatkowski, Koc liked the idea of such a monetary union. At the end, the Polish delegation did not manage to receive the loan in June 1939 (although talks were to be continued in autumn). The only money received from Britain before the war broke out was an ¬£8 million materials loan on 2 August 1939.Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum (London). Collection 82, vol. 18, cards 68-70  World War II (1939-1945) = Polish gold evacuation and escape to France = At the dawn of the September campaign, Koc was an advocate of the transfer of gold from Poland's reserves to finance the purchase of the military equipment needed by the Polish army. Two days after the conflict started, Koc asked Aleksander Litwinowicz, Vice-Minister of Military Affairs and chief of Army Administration, to be employed in the financial department of the General Staff, which the general accepted. Koc was thereby reactivated in military service. Later, he coordinated preparations for the gold evacuation by bus from Warsaw. He departed with one of the convoys on 5 September to ≈Åuck, where he handed over the cargo to Ignacy Matuszewski and Henryk Floyar-Rajchman. On 10 September 1939, Koc was nominated by Mo≈õcicki as Vice-Minister of Treasury. The next day, Koc fled from Poland to Czerniowce. There, he, together with the ambassador of Poland in Bucharest, Roger Raczy≈Ñski, tried to obtain permission to transit the gold via Romania. At the same time, Koc was ordered to terminate the British loan talks, in order to use the money for the military. A few days later, Koc moved to Bucharest, where he convinced Henryk Gruber, an important businessman, to send a request to the Powszechna Kasa Oszczƒôdno≈õci (PKO) branch in New York (or Paris) to pay him a 2 mln z≈Ç loan, which, apparently, was needed for the Army. \\"Apparently\\" is used, because Koc did not inform the PKO about the purpose of this transaction, which was why it never happened. Having arrived to Paris (somewhere between 16 and 18 September), Koc started organising the structures of the Polish Ministry of Treasury. At the time, the Polish government was interned and Mo≈õcicki had resigned, leaving Koc as the highest-ranking representative of the Polish government in France. For some time, he was part of the council acting as the government, together with the ambassador to France, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz; Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jan Szembek and Stanis≈Çaw Burhardt-Bukacki. Knowing that a coalition government was necessary, he kept contact with the opposition (for example, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski). = Work for Sikorski's government (1939-1941) = Minister of Industry and Trade and Minister of Treasury  On 30 September 1939, Koc, one of two pi≈Çsudskiites in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's cabinet (with August Zaleski, Minister of Foreign Affairs), became Minister of Treasury, his first ministerial post, and added the Minister of Industry and Trade ten days later. While in Sikorski's cabinets, Koc was trying to preserve the nation's loans, gold, money and securities, all of which was a problem because of the Polish government's legal status. In addition, Koc was attempting to help Polish refugees in Romania, France and Hungary. Koc tried to cut expenditures to the minimum (by e.g. giving out unpaid leaves to most government workers via a declaration on 10 October 1939), in order to preserve as much gold as possible for post-war restoration. His policy could be summed up as: \\"I will fly over the possessions as if I were a vulture\\". At the same time, Koc was trying to minimise interest expenditures. To realise the policy, Koc convinced the British to give a ¬£5 million loan, before completely spending the earlier ¬£8 million loan.List from Adam Koc to Kazimierz Sosnkowski, from 23 July 1943 (New York City) While in office, Ignacy Matuszewski became ensnared in a scandal. The colonel, while making a report on the gold transport, was criticised for inappropriate financial expenditures on services and some other minor \\"unnecessary\\" purchases, e.g. of headache powder. Having heard the charges, Matuszewski attacked his friend Koc for his lack of reaction on them and then suggesting that Koc was the instigator of the criticism. Perhaps the worst attack, however, came from Stanis≈Çaw Kot, Vice-PM in the Sikorski government and an ardent enemy to everything connected with the Sanation. Kot accused him of attempting to speculate on Polish loans, monopolizing the Polish export for Koc's own profit and influencing others in order to give more power to pi≈Çsudskiites. In addition, Kot tried to prove that Koc was wasting government money, for example, while giving ¬£30 thousand in financial support to Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska; Kot was also unhappy with the slow pace of Koc's work. Koc thereupon resigned both of his offices, on 9 December 1939.  II Vice-Minister of Treasury  Koc then served as II Vice-Minister of Treasury, most probably at the insistence of Henryk Strasburger. The work with the new Minister of Treasury did not cause problems for either party. Koc was responsible for the organization of the military industry with the help of Polish immigrants in France (where the Polish government-in-exile was located). The action's purpose was to increase the resources of the government and to develop the Polish army, while helping the refugees to find jobs (in Turkey, if not in France). The disposition of Polish gold remained unresolved. The Bank of Poland wanted to transfer the gold from Beirut to either Great Britain or United States, a request which did not find support in the Treasury. Koc was later attacked by the Bank of Poland because he (presumably) was the only person in the ministry against gold evacuationInstitute and Museum of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. Akta Prezydium Rady Ministr√≥w, vol. 31, n/p from North Africa, where it was trapped in the pro-German Vichy France colonies. The dispute cost Koc his position. Pragier suggests that Koc resigned \\"a few weeks before April 1940\\", while Mierzwa proposes a later date when Sikorski's government was under reorganization. Accepting the later version, another reason for Koc to leave the ministry was that he evacuated from France too early (on 18 June 1940 from Bordeaux, aboard on HMS \\"Nylon\\"). Three days later, Koc welcomed W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz, President of Poland, on London Paddington, a fact recorded in his diary.  Polish gold vindication  Already in Great Britain, after Raczkiewicz convinced Sikorski that Koc was innocent in the gold reserves loss, Koc was given the mission of Polish gold vindication, which had relocated to Dakar. As Vichy France was a puppet state of the Axis, it was impossible to get permission to transport gold outside the French colonies from either Nazi Germany or Italy. At the same time, the Bank of France possessed gold reserves in New York worth a few hundred million dollars. Thus, Koc decided to convince the US to confiscate the French reserves while seeking an immediate loan (since the Polish gold could not be returned yet). He sent to assess the possible engagement of American financial institutions in his country's future reconstruction. In mid-September 1940, Koc sailed out of Liverpool to the USA, arriving in early October. There, he revealed that Belgian officials had also requested confiscation of the French gold. Koc was named head of the Gold Vindication Committee, a nomination protested by Henryk Strasburger, Minister of Treasury, and Bohdan Winiarski, a right-wing politician and then head of the Bank of Poland. In June 1941, Sikorski suspended the committee's activity.

He also served on the board of the Jozef Pilsudski Institute of America. Koc died on 3 February 1969 in New York.

The facility opened for business in March 1836, the same month as the fall of the Alamo in Texas. Prisoners were employed during the 1830s in making bricks; the initial prison population consisted of one guard, one warden, fifteen prisoners, and a foreman for the brick-making operation with an assistant. Eleven of the fifteen prisoners were from St. Louis, and all were incarcerated for larceny except for one, who was imprisoned for stabbing a man during a drunken brawl.Prison Problem in 1836, from the website on the penitentiary operated by the Jefferson City Convention and Visitors Bureau.

Riots In its daily \\"Times Past\\" column, the Irish Times ran the following column in 1990 and 2000: On the evening of September 22, 1954, there was a major riot at the Missouri State Penitentiary. It started when two inmates faked illness to attract two guards. Once the guards arrived, inmates ambushed them and took their keys. The inmates then ran down cell blocks and corridors, releasing other inmates in the process. During the incident The Missouri State Highway Patrol, the Missouri National Guard, and police departments from Jefferson City, St. Louis, and Kansas City were called in to help quell the riot. When it was all over, four inmates had been killed, 29 had been injured, and one attempted suicide. Four guards were seriously injured. Several buildings were burned, with damages estimated at 5 million dollars. No inmates were able to escape during the incident. Burned buildings and other damage from the riot would remain visible for the next ten years.The Missouri State Penitentiary: 1954 Riot In the summer of 1996, the Missouri State Penitentiary was experiencing a lot of tension between officers and convicts. The Superintendent and Major Eberle reinstated the Search and Response Team. The team managed to ease the tension and help slow the contraband coming into the penitentiary. Staff In 1974, Lillian Bonds became the first female correctional officer to work in a male correctional facility. This was also the year that the official job classification for custody staff was changed from \\"guard\\" to \\"correctional officer\\". =Wardens= MSP Warden Donald \\"D.W.\\" Wyrick Warden Donald \\"D.W.\\" Wyrick was the youngest, longest tenured, and last \\"official\\" warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary. He was the only warden to work his way up through the ranks. In less than fifteen years after beginning as a guard, he became warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary during the most turbulent time in its history. Warden Wyrick was credited on many occasions for keeping the old penitentiary under control when events brought the penitentiary to a boiling point. His extensive knowledge of prisons and extraordinary ability to communicate with convicts led to the capture of escaped convicts, contraband weapons being found, and prevented escapes. He was sought after by many states to oversee their penal systems. Two books have been published about Warden Wyrick: Man of the Big House, Missouri State Penitentiary, A Warden's Warden and If Only the Old Walls Could Talk, The Legend of Warden Wyrick. Escapes On October 22, 2003, a murder/escape attempt occurred at Missouri State Penitentiary. Inmate Toby Viles was murdered by two offenders that worked with him in the prison's ice plant. Inmate Shannon Phillips pled guilty of the murder. Inmate Christopher Sims was also present in the Ice Plant during the time of the murder, but has yet to stand trial. Inmate Phillips and Sims were found four days later in a room that the inmates had prepared for an extended stay. The room was concealed from corrections staff until a staff member accidentally hit a hole into the peg board that covered the wall where the small entrance to the room was. The offenders were planning to wait until the closure of M.S.P. to escape. Death row From 1938 to 1965, thirty-nine prisoners were executed in the penitentiary's gas chamber.Missouri State Penitentiary: Executions On January 6, 1989, inmate George \\"Tiny\\" Mercer was executed. It was the last execution to take place at the Missouri State Penitentiary and the first execution by means of lethal injection. The execution took place in the facility's disused gas chamber. Before April 1989, the State of Missouri's male death row was located at the Missouri State Penitentiary. Death row inmates were held in a below-ground unit and were isolated from other inmates. Death row inmates did not leave their special death row facility, and all services were brought into the unit. Each death row inmate was allowed one hour of exercise per day in a fenced area next to the death row facility. Missouri Department of Corrections said, \\"With restrictions on movement and limited access to programs, conditions of confinement for death row inmates mirrored those found in other states,\\" and, \\"As with other states using prison facilities constructed before the turn of the [20th] century, conditions at Missouri State Penitentiary were less than favorable for both death row inmates and staff.\\" After a legal challenge, the Missouri Department of Corrections began to use an internal death row classification system with privileges awarded by behavior, changed the medical services delivery procedures, and provided a \\"privacy room\\" where death row inmates could attend religious services.

Core math functions include BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, sparse solvers, fast Fourier transforms, and vector math. The library supports Intel processors and is available for Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems. History Intel launched the Math Kernel Library on May 9, 2003, and called it blas.lib. The project's development teams are located in Russia and the United States. MKL is bundled with Intel Parallel Studio XE, Intel Cluster Studio XE, Intel C++, Fortran Studio XE products as well as canopy. Standalone versions have not been sold for years to new customers but are now available for free. License The library is available free of charge under the terms of Intel Simplified Software License which allow redistribution. Commercial support is available when purchased as a standalone software or as part of Intel Parallel Studio XE or Intel System Studio.  Performance  Intel MKL and other programs generated by the Intel C++ Compiler improve performance with a technique called function multi-versioning: a function is compiled or written for many of the x86 instruction set extensions, and at run-time a \\"master function\\" uses the CPUID instruction to select a version most appropriate for the current CPU. However, as long as the master function detects a non-Intel CPU, it almost always chooses the most basic (and slowest) function to use, regardless of what instruction sets the CPU claims to support. This has netted the system a nickname of \\"cripple AMD\\" routine since 2009. , Intels MKL, which remains the numeric library installed by default along with many pre-compiled mathematical applications on Windows (such as NumPy, SymPy, and MATLAB), still significantly underperforms on AMD CPUs by ignoring their supported instruction sets. In older versions, setting the undocumented environment variable could be used to override the vendor string dependent codepath choice and activate supported instructions up to AVX2 on AMD processor based systems resulting in equal or even better performance when compared to Intel CPUs. Since at least Update 1 2020, the environment variable does not work anymore. At least two routes for hooking the MKL's internal routines to remove the discrimination have been discovered. The hook can be added at compile-time by linking or at run-time by injection. Agner Fog discovered that MKL and ICC binaries also have a non-discriminating dispatcher. A function was discovered in 2019. Fog's intel_dispatch_patch provides code that hooks both routes.https://www.agner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6 According to Dani√´l de Kok, just patching the latter function on MKL 2020 Update 1 improves performance for AMD Zen. Details=Functional categories= Intel MKL has the following functional categories: *Linear algebra: BLAS routines are vector-vector (Level 1), matrix-vector (Level 2) and matrix matrix (Level 3) operations for real and complex single and double precision data. LAPACK consists of tuned LU, Cholesky and QR factorizations, eigenvalue and least squares solvers. MKL also includes Sparse BLAS, ScaLAPACK, Sparse Solver, Extended Eigensolver, PBLAS and BLACS. *:Since MKL uses standard interfaces for BLAS and LAPACK, the application which uses other implementations can get better performance on Intel and compatible processors by re-linking with MKL libraries. *MKL includes a variety of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) from 1D to multidimensional, complex to complex, real to complex, and real to real transforms of arbitrary lengths. Applications written with the open source FFTW can be easily ported to MKL by linking with interface wrapper libraries provided as part of MKL for easy migration. *:Cluster versions of LAPACK and FFTs are also available as part of MKL to take advantage of MPI parallelism in addition to single node parallelism from multithreading. *Vector math functions include computationally intensive core mathematical operations for single and double precision real and complex data types.

They are primarily used in agriculture to control non-point source pollution, however, they may also be used to reduce sediment in storm water runoff from construction sites. There are several types of filter strips including vegetative filter strips, forested riparian buffers, and wind buffers. In agriculture, they are highly effective in reducing the concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in runoff into surface waterAbu-Zreig, Majed, et al. ‚ÄúPhosphorus Removal in Vegetated Filter Strips.‚Äù Journal of Environmental Quality, vol. 32, no. 2, 2003, pp. 613‚Äì19, doi:10.2134/jeq2003.6130. and are also effective in reducing sediment erosion and removing pesticides. This helps to prevent eutrophication and associated fishkills and loss of biodiversity. The use of filter strips is very common in developed countries and is required by law in some areas. The implementation and maintenance of filter strips is inexpensive and their use has been shown to be cost effective.Qiu, Z. (2003). \\"A VSA-based strategy for placing conservation buffers in agricultural watersheds\\". Environmental Management. 32: 299‚Äì311.  Functions  Filter strips are primarily used in agriculture to control nonpoint source pollution. They function by decreasing the velocity of water, allowing runoff and dissolved inorganic molecules to infiltrate the soil.\\"Filter Strip  RCD Of Monterey County\\". Resource Conservation District of Monterey County. Retrieved 2017-11-30. Vegetation then uptakes these inorganic molecules, notably nitrogen and phosphorus, reducing their concentrations in nearby surface water. Filter strips may also be used as sediment traps to reduce sediment in storm water runoff from construction sites. = Impact on the environment = Eutrophication in a lake caused by nonpoint pollution from agriculture Eutrophication in a lake caused by nonpoint pollution from agriculture Filter strips are commonly used to prevent eutrophication in surface waters. Eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, directly caused by the over-enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus; the source of which is overwhelmingly nonpoint pollution from agriculture. The excess of these nutrients leads to uncontrolled growth of plants and algae (and phytoplankton in saltwater environments). As they are decomposed by microorganisms, oxygen is depleted, resulting in hypoxia. This can lead to fishkills and the mass deaths of other fauna, creating a state of severely reduced biodiversity. = Impact on human health = By reducing the concentration of chemical fertilizers in surface water, filter strips have a positive effect on human health. Although elevated concentrations of phosphorus in water is not directly toxic to humans, nitrates poses a serious risk to human health. At high concentrations, the ingestion of nitrates can result in an acute condition known as methemoglobinemia in which the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin is impaired. Infants are especially susceptible, which is why the disease is colloquially referred to as \\"blue baby syndrome.\\" In areas where humans rely on fishing or aquafarming for nourishment, decreased populations of fish and shellfish can lead to undernourishment and associated diseases.  Types = Vegetative filter strip = Vegetative filter strips are small, edge-of-field tracts of vegetated land. This type of filter strip is planted with a perennial grass or legumes that have a high rate of nitrogen fixation. Several species are used. The most common grasses are switchgrass, orchardgrass, and tall fescue. Typical legumes are clovers and alfalfa. = Prairie filter strip = Prairie filter strips function in the same manner as vegetative filter strips, however they are populated with local prairie grasses. The use of prairie grass has some benefits, especially increased biodiversity, as opposed to vegetative filter strips, and their multilayered root systems and strong stems make them better suited for adverse weather. A forested riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa = Forested riparian buffer = Like prairie filter strips, forested riparian buffers are filter strips that are not planted, but rather, are populated by indigenous trees and other flora. They are better able to support local terrestrial fauna. As opposed to undisturbed land, riparian buffers support a significantly greater number of avian and arthropod species. However, they are not able to support as large of a number of species as undisturbed land.Marczak, Laurie B., et al. Are Forested Buffers an Effective Conservation Strategy for Riparian Fauna ? An Assessment Using Meta-Analysis Published by : Wiley Stable URL : https://www.jstor.org/stable/27797793 REFERENCES Linked References Are Available on JSTOR for This Article : Yo. Vol. 20, no. 1, 2016, pp. 126‚Äì34. = Wind buffer = Wind buffers (also referred to as windbreaks) are rows of planted trees or shrubs which are used to prevent soil erosion in fields. Additionally, they may be used to prevent the drifting of snow onto roadways and can reduce noise along highways.  Effectiveness  Filter strips are highly effective in reducing the concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in runoff into surface water. Zhou et al. (2014) found that prairie filter strips reduced the concentration of nitrate, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in runoff by 35%, 73%, and 82% respectively. Abu-Zreig, Majed, et al. (2003) found that vegetated filter strips were effective in reducing the concentration of phosphorus, with results ranging from 61% to 89% for 2m-wide filter strips and 15m-wide filter strips respectively. This indicates that filter strips are effective at even small widths. Filter strips have also been shown to be very effective in sediment trapping. A study of sediment removal found that prairie filter strips had a 96% sediment trapping efficiency over a 4-year period. As with nitrogen and phosphorus reduction, the sediment trapping efficiency of a filter strip varies by a number of factors, including subsurface conditions, surface conditions, and sediment characteristics.  Prevalence  The use of filter strips is very common throughout the developed world. Their use is stipulated by law in some areas. Minnesota, for example, requires farmers to install a filter strip along all public bodies of water and drainage ditches.  Cost  The main cost associated with filter strips is the decrease in yield due to a loss of cultivatable land.Helmers, Matthew J., et al. ‚ÄúBuffers and Vegetative Filter Strips.‚Äù Gulf Hypoxia and Local Water Quality Concerns Workshop September 26‚Äì28, 2005, Ames, IA, 2006, p. 17, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/2006_8_24_msbasin_symposia_ia_session4-2.pdf. Other costs are those associated with creating, planting, and maintaining a filter strip. The annual private cost of maintaining two filter strips on a Missouri watershed was found to be $62.40/ac.(4046.86m2), though cost varies by location due to different land values.

It was scheduled to begin airing in September 2009 on Turkey's channel T, with the launch intentionally delayed until after Ramadan ended. After the Presidency of Religious Affairs denied permission for an imam to appear, the programme appears to have been cancelled.Hurriyet Daily News, 5 July 2009, TV show sparks trouble between producer and Diyanet Overview Kanal T's Deputy Director Ahmet √ñzdemir has said that the goal of the show is \\"to turn disbelievers into [believers in] God,\\" but that which God they choose is up to them. He also believes that the show will be helpful for those interested in learning about other religions. Any converts will be offered a free pilgrimage to one of four holy sites ‚Äì Mecca, Vatican City, Jerusalem, or Tibet. The newly converted will be followed by a camera crew to ensure that the trip is a pilgrimage and not a vacation. 200 atheists had already applied as of July 5, 2009, and were being pre-vetted by an eight-person team of theologians to ensure that they truly were atheists, and not simply seeking to gain fame or fortune. Seyhan Soylu developed the show, which will be produced by Ay≈üe Hatun √ñnal and hosted by G√ºlg√ºn Feyman. Ali Bardakoƒülu, the head of the Diyanet ƒ∞≈üleri Ba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± (Presidency of Religious Affairs) in Turkey, has stated that no Turkish imam will be allowed to participate in the show. Soylu responded by stating that Bosniaks, Azerbaijanis or Tunisian imams would be used instead if need be, and also claimed that Bardakoƒülu was \\"committing a sin\\" by not providing the show with an imam. Advertisements for the show read: \\"You will find serenity in this competition,\\" \\"We give you the biggest prize ever; we represent the belief in God,\\" \\"Believe, repent, God will forgive you\\", and \\"We reconcile opposite poles.\\" As the BBC reports, \\"The programme has prompted a mixed reaction in mainly Muslim Turkey, with some saying it would be good for interfaith relations and others saying such discussions were 'inappropriate' for television.\\" Hakkƒ± Devrim, a television commentator and columnist for Radikal, said the idea insulted religion. \\"Religion is not a science, and it is not open to discussion,\\" Devrim said in an interview for H√ºrriyet, expressing concerns that atheists would receive a forum to express their views. He \\"advised Kanal T not to take the risk of airing such a show in Turkey\\". Professor Mustafa √áaƒürƒ±cƒ±, an Istanbul mufti, has also expressed concerns about religion being discussed on television, worrying that it would confuse people and \\"have negative consequences\\". According to the Jerusalem Post, \\"Jewish authorities...are vehemently opposed to the program, since according to Halacha, active proselytizing is forbidden.\\" Rabbi David Rosen, director of the American Jewish Committee's Department for Interreligious Affairs, said in an interview about the show, \\"[a]s a Jew, it is against our world outlook to seek to proselytize\\". More generally, he stated that he thought the show was \\"tasteless\\": \\"Matters of faith, profession and lifestyle commitment are not something that should be decided on a reality show.\\" However, sociologist Nil√ºfer Narlƒ± from Bah√ße≈üehir University has said that the show demonstrates a \\"rising curiosity toward religion\\" over the past 10 years in Turkey. The Guardian and CBC News have remarked some people may see the show as promoting a further intolerance towards atheists in Turkey, a secular country where a large majority of the population is deeply religious. The opposition of the ruling Justice and Development Party has accused the show of having a secret \\"Islamist agenda\\", which the series has denied.
